>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.780 align:middle line:84%
We've got a great
program for you today.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.400 align:middle line:10%
Tara Harris is with us,
a psychic medium living

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.400 align:middle line:10%
in the Pacific Northwest.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.280 align:middle line:10%
Since childhood,
she has experienced

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.480 align:middle line:10%
medium communications,
psychic knowing,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.520 align:middle line:10%
and telepathic
communication with animals.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.440 align:middle line:84%
She has a telepathic bond
with a Bigfoot named Ayolyn,

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.920 align:middle line:84%
who entrusted her to help
share their message of peace

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.820 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual connection.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.580 align:middle line:90%
Tara, welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.955 align:middle line:84%
>>TARA HARRIS:
Thank you, George.

00:00:48.955 --> 00:00:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What an
amazing story you have.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, it's
been an adventure.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You grew up in
the mountains of Oregon.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.920 align:middle line:90%
What was it like out there?

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Beautiful,
fun as a kid.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.360 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, we just played
outside all day,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.580 align:middle line:10%
and took care of the
animals, and it was fun.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.540 align:middle line:10%
And then we moved to
town when I got older,

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.100 align:middle line:10%
but I still go up
to the mountains.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.720 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did you
have a big family?

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: We do.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.600 align:middle line:84%
I have four siblings
and two parents.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.680 align:middle line:84%
So it was very
active in our house.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When you were a
little girl, nine years old,

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.900 align:middle line:90%
you saw a one-legged ghost.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.940 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.740 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: I was sleeping on
the sofa in the living room,

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.160 align:middle line:10%
and I heard--

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.040 align:middle line:10%
my family was asleep, and I
heard this clunking sound.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.180 align:middle line:90%
And it was so weird.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.968 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, what
where's that coming from?

00:01:36.968 --> 00:01:38.260 align:middle line:90%
And so I looked out the window.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.900 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't see anything.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:39.900 align:middle line:90%
But the dog was barking.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.600 align:middle line:84%
We had a dog outside,
and he was barking.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And I could hear this
really loud, clunking sound.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And I kept looking, and I
saw this old man coming up

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.060 align:middle line:90%
the driveway.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.060 align:middle line:84%
As he got closer and walked
in front of the window,

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.160 align:middle line:90%
I saw that he had a peg--

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.050 align:middle line:84%
a classic, like you
see on TV, peg leg.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Like an old
pirate or something.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, that's
what he looked like.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.433 align:middle line:84%
And he was clunking
up the driveway,

00:02:02.433 --> 00:02:03.850 align:middle line:84%
and I tried to
wake up my grandma,

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.910 align:middle line:90%
because she was sleeping there.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And I said, there's a man
with a wood leg walking up

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:09.630 align:middle line:90%
the driveway.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.270 align:middle line:90%
She goes, there is not.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.097 align:middle line:90%
Go back to sleep.

00:02:12.097 --> 00:02:13.430 align:middle line:90%
And she just went back to sleep.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.097 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, he's
literally-- and the dog's

00:02:15.097 --> 00:02:16.490 align:middle line:90%
right there barking at him.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
that he wasn't real,

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.090 align:middle line:90%
because he looked real to me.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And then as I got older, I
realized that the sound--

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.710 align:middle line:90%
I didn't actually hear it.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.210 align:middle line:84%
I heard it in my head, because
that's how I hear things now.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.170 align:middle line:84%
But that's the first one that I
saw with my eyes, really clear.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.250 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What do you
think this entity was?

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I think
he was just a ghost.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if he
knew that we could see him,

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.090 align:middle line:84%
but we were way out of town,
and I think he probably

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.650 align:middle line:90%
lived out there at one time.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.510 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know to ask
questions back then.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.937 align:middle line:84%
I thought he was just some old
guy coming up the driveway,

00:02:47.937 --> 00:02:49.270 align:middle line:90%
so I didn't really ask about it.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.750 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Limping his
way up to you, right?

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Uh-huh.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.177 align:middle line:90%
He disappeared.

00:02:52.177 --> 00:02:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Once he got up past the
window, he vanished.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.290 align:middle line:90%
And I--

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.690 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Just faded away?

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.725 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yep, just faded away.

00:02:57.725 --> 00:02:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought,
well, that was weird.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.647 align:middle line:84%
But as a kid, what do
you think about that?

00:03:01.647 --> 00:03:02.730 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Were you scared?

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I was scared.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.750 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to get
my grandma to wake up.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, there's a guy with a
wood leg coming into the house.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.418 align:middle line:90%
And she's like, there is not.

00:03:08.418 --> 00:03:09.710 align:middle line:90%
And I said, can't you hear him?

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:10.960 align:middle line:90%
And she's like, nope.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.760 align:middle line:90%
Go back to sleep.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He may have
lived there years ago.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.030 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, could be.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.530 align:middle line:90%
Really old property.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.590 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Then later on
in life, in your 20s,

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.530 align:middle line:84%
you would physically know and
predict things, wouldn't you?

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.570 align:middle line:84%
But I thought it was
really weird, and I said--

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.310 align:middle line:84%
I'd tell myself
it's just intuition.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.893 align:middle line:84%
I would know if
somebody was pregnant,

00:03:28.893 --> 00:03:31.290 align:middle line:84%
or I'd know, if they were
pregnant, what it was.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Or I would know, oh, I
shouldn't drive down that road.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.262 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm coming up
around a corner--

00:03:36.262 --> 00:03:37.970 align:middle line:84%
you better slow down
because there's deer

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.928 align:middle line:90%
on the corner, stuff like that.

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:41.470 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't really
think much of it.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.678 align:middle line:90%
I didn't really ask about it.

00:03:42.678 --> 00:03:44.210 align:middle line:90%
It just happened that way.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did your mother or
grandmother have this gift too?

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.192 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I don't think my
grandmother-- if she did,

00:03:50.192 --> 00:03:51.150 align:middle line:90%
she never told anybody.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.192 align:middle line:90%
She didn't talk about it.

00:03:52.192 --> 00:03:54.090 align:middle line:90%
They weren't the sort.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.040 align:middle line:84%
I think my mom does
have a little bit.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.660 align:middle line:84%
She gets big
premonition type stuff.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.060 align:middle line:84%
But it would be more
like earthquake type,

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.690 align:middle line:90%
nothing personal or smaller.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.260 align:middle line:90%


00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.420 align:middle line:84%
I think it comes from
her side of the family

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.860 align:middle line:90%
is what I'm saying.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.943 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's hereditary?

00:04:12.943 --> 00:04:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I think so.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.920 align:middle line:84%
I think so, because my
daughters both have it.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Then later on in life,
I think you were in your 30s,

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.937 align:middle line:84%
were you in some kind
of truck accident?

00:04:21.937 --> 00:04:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, it
wasn't an accident.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.645 align:middle line:90%
It could have been, though.

00:04:24.645 --> 00:04:30.460 align:middle line:84%
So I was on the freeway,
and there was really

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.460 align:middle line:90%
heavy construction going on.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And a semi truck had
gone off to the side,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.540 align:middle line:84%
and he was going to pull
back onto the freeway.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.688 align:middle line:84%
And so he was pulling
back out, and it

00:04:40.688 --> 00:04:42.480 align:middle line:84%
was hard to see him
because of the weather.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.900 align:middle line:90%
It's really foggy up there.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And he pulled out, and I knew
that I wasn't going to make it,

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.595 align:middle line:84%
because there was no space
between the concrete barrier--

00:04:51.595 --> 00:04:52.395 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, god.

00:04:52.395 --> 00:04:53.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: --and the truck.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And I looked right at him,
and he looked right at me.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.338 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, I'm dead.

00:04:57.338 --> 00:04:58.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to make it.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.940 align:middle line:84%
Because I was going
like 70 miles an hour.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And there was only
this much space.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And my final thought
was, I'm not going

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.240 align:middle line:90%
to make it through that space.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.802 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to hit him.

00:05:07.802 --> 00:05:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh, god,
I'm going to kill him--

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.963 align:middle line:90%
the guy.

00:05:10.963 --> 00:05:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I was on
the other side of the truck.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.182 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
how I got there.

00:05:15.182 --> 00:05:16.140 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember if I--

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.700 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Without any crash?

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Nope.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.420 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.317 align:middle line:84%
I was just heading
towards him, and then

00:05:21.317 --> 00:05:22.900 align:middle line:84%
I looked in my
rearview, and the truck

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.660 align:middle line:84%
was blocking the
whole road behind me.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:27.920 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It was miraculous.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, it was scary.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.820 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Who saved you?

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, at that time, I
started asking, what happened?

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.020 align:middle line:90%
That can't just happen.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.860 align:middle line:90%
And I got, in my head, angels.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.620 align:middle line:90%
Angels can do that.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.820 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I hear stories, Tara,
of accidents like that that are

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:50.300 align:middle line:84%
about to happen where a car is
going right towards another car,

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.020 align:middle line:84%
and it somehow fades into it
and comes out the other end

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.740 align:middle line:90%
of the car without any damage.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.520 align:middle line:84%
That's probably what
happened to you.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.320 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And I hadn't known anything
about that or angels.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.820 align:middle line:84%
I never really read about
it or looked into it

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.073 align:middle line:90%
until that happened.

00:06:06.073 --> 00:06:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And then I heard that had
happened to other people--

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.040 align:middle line:84%
similar things had happened
to other people like that.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.915 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, that's
got to be what happened,

00:06:11.915 --> 00:06:13.865 align:middle line:84%
because we both
should have been dead.

00:06:13.865 --> 00:06:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Absolutely.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.000 align:middle line:84%
What kind of an effect did
it have on you afterwards?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So after
that happened,

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.900 align:middle line:90%
I think that's the catalyst.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.260 align:middle line:84%
It started off my
looking into, are

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.330 align:middle line:84%
these things real, all
these different things

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.580 align:middle line:90%
that have happened in my life?

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And researching to see if
there's really something

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.700 align:middle line:90%
out there other than just us.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.775 align:middle line:90%
And that's where that started.

00:06:36.775 --> 00:06:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did you have
friends that had these kinds

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.580 align:middle line:90%
of abilities too?

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I didn't
then, but I do now.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.660 align:middle line:84%
One of my best friends
is a really good psychic,

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.000 align:middle line:84%
and her and I do
clearings together.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.750 align:middle line:90%
And we do psychic work together.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.250 align:middle line:84%
She's a really,
really good psychic.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:54.930 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now, where
did she get her gift?

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: She
doesn't know either,

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.010 align:middle line:84%
but she does think it
comes from her mom's side.

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: There's
something about moms.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:06:59.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I guess.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:00.590 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I tell you.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.230 align:middle line:90%
That's something.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.630 align:middle line:84%
You two began doing your
spiritual work together.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.390 align:middle line:90%
Tell me more about what you do.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So we started out just
kind of, well, what can you do?

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.850 align:middle line:90%
Do you get this?

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:16.410 align:middle line:90%
Do you get that?

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:17.535 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, I talk to ghosts.

00:07:17.535 --> 00:07:18.950 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, oh, OK.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.390 align:middle line:90%
And so we just kind of--

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:25.310 align:middle line:84%
we talked together, and then we
realized that it's easier for us

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.010 align:middle line:84%
to communicate when
we're together.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's because
our energy together--

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: --is so--
it's so much easier.

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And so then our
guides eventually

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.430 align:middle line:84%
said, you need to go to the
mountains, up where I grew up.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's a place up
there called a sacred space.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And there are sacred
spaces all over Earth.

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.050 align:middle line:84%
You got to find one
to do this work.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And so they told us
where we had to go.

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And so we started
going up there,

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and we started doing clearings,
which is helping ghost

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:55.830 align:middle line:90%
cross over to the other side.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.128 align:middle line:90%
We just call them that.

00:07:57.128 --> 00:07:59.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what the name
for it is technically,

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.710 align:middle line:90%
but that's what we call them.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And we open a door so
that ghosts can cross over

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:04.690 align:middle line:90%
to the other side.

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we started
our work together.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Truly remarkable.

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever have
a scary moment?

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: We've had
a few scary moments.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.190 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What happened.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: We started
seeing creatures.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.990 align:middle line:90%
Some people call them demons.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:19.310 align:middle line:84%
They're creatures
from other dimensions.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
side told us, well,

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:22.570 align:middle line:90%
you can also get rid of them.

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Just like you can
cross ghosts over,

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.310 align:middle line:90%
you can also get rid of them.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And so they started introducing
us to other helpers,

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:33.429 align:middle line:84%
because everybody has
a guide, at least one.

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And our guides help
us with the ghosts.

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And so they started giving us
other types of guides to help us

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:40.470 align:middle line:90%
with the really scary stuff.

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And so we started
clearing houses for people

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:46.270 align:middle line:84%
and getting rid of all
the nasty things that--

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Good.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do you put sage around
the house and stuff like that?

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: We don't use sage
because my guides have said

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.860 align:middle line:90%
that it doesn't really work.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it can help some people
with the right intentions.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.180 align:middle line:84%
But if you're just waving it
around, it doesn't really work.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.982 align:middle line:90%
It just makes them mad.

00:09:03.982 --> 00:09:06.440 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now, you come from
a region where there are a lot

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.660 align:middle line:84%
of Sasquatch and
Bigfoot sightings.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's huge
in the Northwest.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Have you had
those kind of encounters?

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: So I did.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.740 align:middle line:84%
We were up in our spot
up in the mountains,

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.040 align:middle line:84%
and we were doing
a regular clearing,

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.040 align:middle line:90%
meditating, doing a clearing.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And we just, all of a
sudden, felt something weird.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And I looked over, and
I'm like, oh, my gosh.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And she says, there's
a Bigfoot over there.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.543 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, they're not real.

00:09:33.543 --> 00:09:34.460 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to look.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:35.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, they're not even real.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And for sure, there was one
standing up on the hill right

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.160 align:middle line:90%
to the left of us.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.338 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh my gosh.

00:09:44.338 --> 00:09:46.880 align:middle line:84%
Because it was so scary, I'm
like, we got to get out of here.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.708 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't even
know they existed.

00:09:48.708 --> 00:09:51.000 align:middle line:84%
I didn't not believe, but I
didn't believe, because I'd

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.400 align:middle line:90%
never asked about them.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm like,
we have to leave.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:56.920 align:middle line:90%
We have to leave right now.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And so we got up to
leave, and he disappeared.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And then the other side told
us, you need to calm down.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.960 align:middle line:90%
He's not going to hurt you.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.620 align:middle line:90%
And so we left.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And then they said, you need to
go back up there and communicate

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.120 align:middle line:90%
with him.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Whoa!

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.560 align:middle line:90%
And did you?

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: We did.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.220 align:middle line:90%
We went back.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Did you find him?

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:16.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.320 align:middle line:90%
And we also found his--

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.270 align:middle line:90%
there was a female.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:22.048 align:middle line:90%


00:10:22.048 --> 00:10:24.640 align:middle line:90%
They had two children together.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a younger
boy, and then a middle aged--

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:28.938 align:middle line:90%
what we would call middle--

00:10:28.938 --> 00:10:29.980 align:middle line:90%
like a teenage type girl.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So there was
a family of Sasquatch.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: There were
four of them, yep.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How close
did you get to them?

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.215 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I'm not really
good width distance,

00:10:36.215 --> 00:10:38.860 align:middle line:84%
but I would probably say
within 50 feet maybe.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's pretty close.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.580 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't do anything.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:43.415 align:middle line:90%
They weren't scary.

00:10:43.415 --> 00:10:44.540 align:middle line:90%
They didn't make any noise.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.080 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They didn't
run away from you?

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:46.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Nope.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:47.240 align:middle line:90%
Nope.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.820 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did they
turn and look at you?

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They were
standing, staring at us, yes.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.520 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Probably wondering
what you were, right?

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yep.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
side told us, you

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.540 align:middle line:90%
have to communicate with him.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:58.820 align:middle line:84%
He wants to
communicate with you.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.487 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What did
they look like, Tara?

00:11:00.487 --> 00:11:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Very tall.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, the little one
was pretty small.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:09.118 align:middle line:84%
But really tall,
and really hairy.

00:11:09.118 --> 00:11:10.160 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Typical, right?

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.452 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: The typical, like,
what you would read about.

00:11:12.452 --> 00:11:15.160 align:middle line:84%
They were lighter
color brown, not--

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.660 align:middle line:84%
because I did see one
before that was real dark,

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:20.340 align:middle line:84%
like almost a black color,
but they were a lighter color,

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.520 align:middle line:90%
brown color, really big eyes.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:27.455 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But did they look
human or animal to you?

00:11:27.455 --> 00:11:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They looked
more animal to me

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.640 align:middle line:90%
than they did human.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they stood up
on two legs, like us,

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.080 align:middle line:84%
but they looked more
animal like to me.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.975 align:middle line:84%
Their faces look more
animal than human.

00:11:37.975 --> 00:11:39.100 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Interesting take.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, your daughter had an
experience with Bigfoot.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.130 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So we didn't
tell her anything about it,

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:49.910 align:middle line:84%
and we took her up there, and
she described the whole family.

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The same
family you saw?

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yep.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.330 align:middle line:90%
She said, oh, I can see--

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:55.508 align:middle line:90%
and she described them all.

00:11:55.508 --> 00:11:56.550 align:middle line:90%
She said, I can see them.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:57.350 align:middle line:90%
They're here.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:58.450 align:middle line:90%
They're in these woods.

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:00.315 align:middle line:84%
And she described
all four of them.

00:12:00.315 --> 00:12:02.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And obviously, you
believed her because you had

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:03.610 align:middle line:90%
just seen it, right?

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:04.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Exactly.

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:05.090 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:06.290 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Did it scare her?

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:06.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Nope.

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:07.650 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Because she was
seeing them like how

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:12.703 align:middle line:84%
I see them most of
the time in my head,

00:12:12.703 --> 00:12:13.870 align:middle line:90%
and that's how she saw them.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:14.670 align:middle line:90%
She said, oh, they're here.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:15.470 align:middle line:90%
I can see them.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:17.083 align:middle line:90%
And she was describing them.

00:12:17.083 --> 00:12:19.250 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did they ever
communicate with you at that

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:19.910 align:middle line:90%
point?

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I've never
really communicated

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:22.910 align:middle line:90%
with the other three.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:25.090 align:middle line:90%
It's mainly been the male.

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The one
we call Ayolyn?

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:27.456 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:12:27.456 --> 00:12:31.230 align:middle line:84%
He's the one that actually
wanted to communicate.

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.270 align:middle line:84%
So he's the one that I've
mostly communicated with.

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:36.590 align:middle line:84%
I haven't had any conversations
with the other three.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.090 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did they tell
you where they were from?

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They said that they're
from a place called Ayolyn,

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:42.450 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:45.930 align:middle line:84%
well, that's what he said
their dimension is called,

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:47.630 align:middle line:84%
and that's what they
like to be called.

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:50.990 align:middle line:84%
It's the same name,
is the same place.

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:52.707 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And where is Ayolyn?

00:12:52.707 --> 00:12:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So it's in another
dimension altogether.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:55.590 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So when he showed
me how they go in and out,

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:03.187 align:middle line:84%
it's like a really
loud popping sound.

00:13:03.187 --> 00:13:05.270 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When they shift
out of these dimensions?

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:07.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, so when
they go in and out.

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:10.850 align:middle line:84%
I also hear that sound
when they go from solid,

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:14.930 align:middle line:84%
like you can see
them, to invisible,

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:18.960 align:middle line:84%
because they can be right
there and you won't see them.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: This is amazing, Tara,
because people have wondered,

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:24.450 align:middle line:90%
where are these creatures?

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:27.950 align:middle line:84%
They see them, and then 10
seconds later, they're gone.

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, they can
just make themselves--

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:31.550 align:middle line:90%
it's like they pop in and out.

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:32.550 align:middle line:90%
So you hear this weird--

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:35.050 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know if I'm hearing
it in my head or if my ears,

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:37.470 align:middle line:84%
but I can hear this popping
sound when they go in and out.

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:39.762 align:middle line:84%
And they can be standing
there, and you hear the sound,

00:13:39.762 --> 00:13:41.430 align:middle line:90%
and then you don't see them.

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:42.623 align:middle line:90%
But they can still be there.

00:13:42.623 --> 00:13:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Were they surrounding
you at all when you were driving

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:46.630 align:middle line:90%
a truck or anything like that?

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:47.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Not that I saw.

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:49.790 align:middle line:84%
I did see the little
one, the little boy.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:51.730 align:middle line:90%
He was running beside the truck.

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:54.478 align:middle line:84%
And he was going super
fast, popping in and out.

00:13:54.478 --> 00:13:55.770 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: As fast as the truck?

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.568 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Uh-huh.

00:13:57.568 --> 00:13:59.110 align:middle line:84%
It didn't look like
a person running.

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:00.910 align:middle line:90%
It was almost like floating.

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:05.532 align:middle line:84%
But he was running, and
it was popping in and out.

00:14:05.532 --> 00:14:07.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if he was
going invisible or going

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:08.510 align:middle line:90%
to his dimension and back.

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:09.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm not quite sure.

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:11.850 align:middle line:84%
I didn't ask, but he
was going really fast,

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:13.078 align:middle line:90%
keeping up with the vehicle.

00:14:13.078 --> 00:14:14.870 align:middle line:84%
Probably going like 20
miles an hour maybe.

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:17.130 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The stories I've
heard about Bigfoot, Tara,

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:19.490 align:middle line:90%
are that they're mischievous.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:22.090 align:middle line:90%
They really don't hurt people.

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:25.070 align:middle line:84%
But do we know what
they're really like?

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:25.950 align:middle line:90%
Are they fun?

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:26.750 align:middle line:90%
Are they nice?

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:27.670 align:middle line:90%
Are they kind?

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:28.670 align:middle line:90%
Are they evil?

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:30.050 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So from what he's told
me, or communicated with me,

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:36.330 align:middle line:84%
is that there are good
and there are bad.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:37.780 align:middle line:90%
So you have to be careful.

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.140 align:middle line:84%
He said, there are
bad ones that will

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:43.380 align:middle line:84%
hurt if they have the
chance, or they'll chase you,

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.520 align:middle line:90%
or things like that.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.800 align:middle line:84%
But he said there are
good ones as well.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.702 align:middle line:84%
He did show me that
there was one up there

00:14:50.702 --> 00:14:52.160 align:middle line:84%
on that mountain
that was not good,

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.440 align:middle line:90%
and to stay away from the one.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.700 align:middle line:90%
And I actually saw that one.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:55.500 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Really?

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, they're all called
Ayolyn's, aren't they?

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, he told
me that in their dimension

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.542 align:middle line:84%
where they come from, that
they're all called that.

00:15:04.542 --> 00:15:06.000 align:middle line:84%
That's what they
like to be called.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:06.760 align:middle line:90%
That's where they come from.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:07.885 align:middle line:90%
That's what they're called.

00:15:07.885 --> 00:15:11.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not our language, so it's a
little bit weird to understand,

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.860 align:middle line:84%
because they don't speak
English like we do.

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.180 align:middle line:84%
But that is the name
that they gave me

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.220 align:middle line:84%
and spelled it for me
so that I would know--

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.760 align:middle line:84%
because I wasn't quite
sure what he meant,

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.500 align:middle line:90%
so they spelled it out for us.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.340 align:middle line:84%
He did make it known
that he didn't really

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:29.390 align:middle line:84%
care for being called
Bigfoot, so I tried to stop.

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:31.640 align:middle line:84%
When you call him that all
the time, it's hard not to.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.978 align:middle line:84%
But I try not to call him
that when I'm up there.

00:15:34.978 --> 00:15:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do they ever give you
a gift or anything like that,

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.640 align:middle line:90%
a flower or anything?

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: A flower
would be cool.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.020 align:middle line:90%
So he left me a stone.

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:45.048 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: A stone?

00:15:45.048 --> 00:15:46.340 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, like a crystal.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Really?

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: He said he was
going to give it to me.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And that if I used that, I could
communicate with him remotely.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Almost
like a telephone?

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Mhm, kind of.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.440 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's their idea
of a cell phone, right?

00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yep.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.620 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What did it look like?

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.518 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It actually
looks like a foot.

00:16:02.518 --> 00:16:03.560 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: A foot, really?

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Which is
hilarious, because they don't

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:05.783 align:middle line:90%
like to be called Bigfoot.

00:16:05.783 --> 00:16:07.240 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, it looks like a foot.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.940 align:middle line:84%
It looks like a foot
with little toes on it.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.380 align:middle line:90%
And like a crystal.

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:15.267 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did they ever
tell you why they're here?

00:16:15.267 --> 00:16:17.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So what he's
told me, specifically

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.683 align:middle line:84%
for him and his
family, they come here

00:16:18.683 --> 00:16:20.080 align:middle line:90%
because they like the area.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.080 align:middle line:84%
They've been coming here
for a really long time,

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.700 align:middle line:90%
and they like the food.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They like the food?

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: That's what he said.

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:27.540 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What do they eat?

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So they
eat lots of things.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And he did also tell me
at one point that they--

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.510 align:middle line:84%
not all Ayolyn like
the same things.

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:36.170 align:middle line:90%
They like different things.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:38.510 align:middle line:90%
So they like deer.

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.368 align:middle line:90%
He likes anchovies.

00:16:40.368 --> 00:16:41.910 align:middle line:84%
His son likes peanut
butter, but they

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:44.927 align:middle line:84%
don't like tuna fish, because
people leave them things.

00:16:44.927 --> 00:16:46.010 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Who blames them?

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:47.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, so.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: This crystal
that they gave you,

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:52.102 align:middle line:84%
you brought some
pictures of these things.

00:16:52.102 --> 00:16:53.810 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
what they look like,

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:56.710 align:middle line:84%
and you can explain to us,
Tara, what we're looking at.

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:58.410 align:middle line:90%
It does look like a little foot.

00:16:58.410 --> 00:16:59.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So it was just
sticking straight up

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:05.109 align:middle line:84%
out of the ground in the very
first place that I saw him.

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:06.869 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How big
would you say that is?

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:08.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It's a couple inches.

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:09.430 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: 3, 4 inches?

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:10.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:11.253 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Is it heavy?

00:17:11.253 --> 00:17:12.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: A bit, yeah.

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And I did wonder
about the stone,

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:18.490 align:middle line:84%
because he said he
brought it to give to me.

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And then he said if I put it on
my head and I stick it there,

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:25.790 align:middle line:90%
I can communicate with him.

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And so when I did
that, it brought

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:31.790 align:middle line:84%
me right into his dimension and
what his dimension looks like.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And that type of
stone, you can see

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:36.090 align:middle line:84%
pillars of that
where they come from,

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:38.052 align:middle line:84%
like big pillars coming
out of the ground,

00:17:38.052 --> 00:17:39.010 align:middle line:90%
kind of like our trees.

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:41.052 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do you feel
strange when you hold it up

00:17:41.052 --> 00:17:42.150 align:middle line:90%
to your head?

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:45.510 align:middle line:90%


00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:50.030 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's not dramatic,
but then sometimes it's

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:51.930 align:middle line:90%
very right in my face.

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are you still
in control of yourself?

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:55.235 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Most of the time.

00:17:55.235 --> 00:17:56.670 align:middle line:90%
But one time I was not.

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What happened?

00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:58.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: OK.

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:02.010 align:middle line:84%
So I was in the bathtub, and
I was like, OK, I need to--

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.570 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to
communicate with him.

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Because water is a
good communicator.

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:07.850 align:middle line:90%
Water has a lot of energy.

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:10.130 align:middle line:84%
So I'm thinking, well,
maybe this will help.

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And I stuck it on my head, and I
all of a sudden was in his body,

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:19.610 align:middle line:84%
running through the
mountains, up the mountain.

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:22.070 align:middle line:84%
I could feel the
grass on my legs,

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:24.930 align:middle line:84%
and I could feel his
feet hitting the ground,

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:29.750 align:middle line:84%
and I could feel fear or
anxiety running from something.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And I ran, and I was
running, and I was running.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And then on the
other side of it,

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.100 align:middle line:84%
myself, I'm scared because
I couldn't get out of it.

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I need
to get out of this.

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:40.110 align:middle line:90%
I need to get out of this.

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:41.290 align:middle line:90%
But I couldn't.

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And so I was running,
and I'm in his body.

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And he runs up onto
a logging road.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And he looks down
the logging road,

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:52.830 align:middle line:84%
and there's three cop
cars and an ambulance.

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And he looks at it and I'm
like, why are those there?

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:56.970 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was thinking.

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:57.770 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And then he looks
forward, runs, keeps running,

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:03.970 align:middle line:90%
and he's running.

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I pop
back into my body, and I get,

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:08.350 align:middle line:90%
it's not safe.

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:09.462 align:middle line:90%
It's not safe to go there.

00:19:09.462 --> 00:19:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He's
communicating that to you?

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:11.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
weirdest experience,

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:15.970 align:middle line:84%
because nothing like
that's ever happened.

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:17.110 align:middle line:90%
And it was scary.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:19.130 align:middle line:84%
But then I was like,
well, so it's not safe.

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:20.935 align:middle line:84%
Is it not safe
for me or for him?

00:19:20.935 --> 00:19:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And then later,
I found out, it's

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:23.848 align:middle line:90%
not safe for either one of us.

00:19:23.848 --> 00:19:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He's trying
to protect you?

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yep.

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:27.330 align:middle line:90%
So I stayed away for a year.

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:28.510 align:middle line:90%
I didn't go up there.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:29.590 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That long?

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:31.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, they ended up
having some bad things happen

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.400 align:middle line:90%
up there.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What compelled
you to come back?

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It was long enough
that I felt like for me, it

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.460 align:middle line:90%
was OK to go back up there.

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:42.120 align:middle line:90%
So I went up there.

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.020 align:middle line:90%
I tried to find him.

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:44.820 align:middle line:90%
He's not up there.

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.520 align:middle line:90%
He was nowhere to be found.

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And they've spent years
coming into that place,

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.400 align:middle line:84%
because their time's
different than ours.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.180 align:middle line:90%
And he was nowhere to be found.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.180 align:middle line:90%
I was like, where is he?

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.253 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't get a hold of him.

00:19:57.253 --> 00:19:58.420 align:middle line:90%
They've got to be somewhere.

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.980 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he's in his own dimension
and he's just not coming here.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:01.920 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: He went back and--

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.503 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah,
that's what I thought.

00:20:03.503 --> 00:20:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And so then later
on, I asked again,

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:10.320 align:middle line:84%
and he is in Oregon, but
just not on that mountain,

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.980 align:middle line:90%
because he said it isn't safe.

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.200 align:middle line:84%
It's not safe for his
family to be there.

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do they look physical
in their personal properties

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.118 align:middle line:84%
that when you look at
them, they look real?

00:20:20.118 --> 00:20:21.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: They look real.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.380 align:middle line:90%
You could touch them like us.

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:24.180 align:middle line:90%
They look real.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If you touched them,
you would feel something?

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:27.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes, yes.

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:30.280 align:middle line:84%
I believe that, because
I saw a physical real,

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.880 align:middle line:90%
like you could grab on--

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.260 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What kind of
abilities do they have?

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:38.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, can they tap into your
brain or anything like that?

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:39.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's how I communicate
with him, is telepathically.

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:46.320 align:middle line:84%
I think it's easier
that way for them,

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:50.200 align:middle line:84%
because it's not like we're
taught having a conversation

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.840 align:middle line:90%
and talking.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:57.080 align:middle line:84%
It's more symbolism
or pictures kind of.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And then the other side
helps with that too.

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:00.600 align:middle line:90%
They help with translation.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:05.680 align:middle line:84%
I think it can go both ways,
because they have very powerful

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.113 align:middle line:90%
telepathic abilities.

00:21:07.113 --> 00:21:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You can feel that?

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Mhm.

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Native American
lore has always talked about

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.600 align:middle line:84%
Sasquatch, creatures
that are out there.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.460 align:middle line:90%
Does he get into that at all?

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:20.260 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:26.610 align:middle line:84%
He did show me up where they
spend a lot of their time.

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:29.627 align:middle line:84%
A long time ago, they
were very friendly

00:21:29.627 --> 00:21:30.710 align:middle line:90%
with the Native Americans.

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:32.390 align:middle line:90%
They lived in harmony together.

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:34.090 align:middle line:84%
They weren't scared
of each other.

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:38.890 align:middle line:84%
They would show me that they
actually did healing together.

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And then that
stopped at some point

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:44.030 align:middle line:90%
once people started coming in.

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know much
about it other than what

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:49.770 align:middle line:84%
he showed me with,
they would actually

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:51.930 align:middle line:90%
get to touch each other.

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:54.170 align:middle line:84%
The Ayolyn and the
Native Americans

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:55.450 align:middle line:90%
would touch each other.

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What do
you mean they touch?

00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: For healing
or communication.

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:02.750 align:middle line:84%
They would touch,
physically touch each other.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:05.467 align:middle line:84%
So they would use
telepathic communication.

00:22:05.467 --> 00:22:06.800 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Like hands on healing?

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.090 align:middle line:90%
Remarkable.

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:10.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: He showed
me a brief image

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:12.490 align:middle line:90%
of that when I was up there.

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Explain
what that looked like.

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So I saw
the people around.

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:20.850 align:middle line:84%
There were multiple
Ayolyn, not just the one

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:23.090 align:middle line:84%
that I was communicating--
there was multiple.

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:24.690 align:middle line:84%
So I could see that
there were more

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:26.230 align:middle line:90%
than there are now up there.

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:30.090 align:middle line:10%
I think more used to
spend time up there.

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:32.950 align:middle line:84%
Because they lived so
close to each other,

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:35.810 align:middle line:84%
they learned how to
live in the same space.

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And they showed me an image of
their hands touching like this.

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And they could
communicate that way,

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:46.210 align:middle line:90%
and also do healing that way.

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He seemed to be
so forthright in telling you

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:49.070 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.610 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:50.670 align:middle line:90%

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:51.630 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: He felt comfortable.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:52.970 align:middle line:90%
He felt comfortable with you

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I know,
I don't know why.

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Like I do.

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:56.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I wish I knew why.

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:58.850 align:middle line:84%
So they told me
it's because there

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:03.850 align:middle line:84%
are certain people
that shine or glow,

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:05.635 align:middle line:90%
and they can see that energy.

00:23:05.635 --> 00:23:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And if they see
that energy, they

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:08.885 align:middle line:84%
know it's somebody they
can communicate with.

00:23:08.885 --> 00:23:11.890 align:middle line:84%
They can tell the bad from the
good, or the people that will

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:16.450 align:middle line:90%
not hurt them or expose them.

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:18.970 align:middle line:84%
people like me who I'm not
out there hunting them, not

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:21.990 align:middle line:84%
going out to do anything
bad or anything like that.

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:25.810 align:middle line:84%
But they said, you glow
or shine really brightly,

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:27.810 align:middle line:84%
and there are people
that do shine like

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:29.770 align:middle line:90%
that they are attracted to.

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Tara, do
they age like we do?

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:35.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So they
told me that they

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:38.290 align:middle line:90%
do not age like we do at all.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:41.650 align:middle line:84%
In their dimension, it's
almost like time doesn't exist.

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:44.290 align:middle line:84%
So if they're there and
then they come here,

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:45.710 align:middle line:90%
it's completely different.

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:48.770 align:middle line:84%
It's like they haven't aged from
when they went and came back.

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:50.930 align:middle line:84%
It's hard for me to
explain because it's weird

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:52.590 align:middle line:90%
how they showed it to me.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:57.170 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like, when they
leave, if they left in 2025

00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:01.450 align:middle line:84%
and they went there and, say,
they stayed in their dimension

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:05.210 align:middle line:84%
for a year, and then they
came back, it would be 2050.

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:06.710 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: 25 years will go by?

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Just like yesterday.

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:09.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It's very
weird how that happens.

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:12.825 align:middle line:84%
So they live longer than we do,
only because time doesn't really

00:24:12.825 --> 00:24:13.950 align:middle line:90%
exist where they come from.

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:16.570 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And when you say
live longer, do they die?

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:17.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: They do die.

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:18.570 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They do die.

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:18.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:19.710 align:middle line:90%
I had to ask that.

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:22.340 align:middle line:90%
I wondered about that.

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How old are when
they pass, do you think,

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.392 align:middle line:90%
in human years?

00:24:26.392 --> 00:24:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Oh, in human years?

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.960 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh, I'm not sure.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Just because the
time is so different,

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure, because
their time is so different.

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:35.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they told me
that they live longer,

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.140 align:middle line:90%
just because of the time.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Our time just goes
so much faster.

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did their relationship
with humans change over

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.100 align:middle line:90%
the years?

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Mhm.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.300 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What happened?

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: People became less
spiritual, less understanding.

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And then you get more
and more people move in,

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:01.020 align:middle line:84%
and they're mowing down the
trees, and they don't care.

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.525 align:middle line:84%
In general, people just don't
care as much as they used to.

00:25:04.525 --> 00:25:06.400 align:middle line:84%
Because especially with
the Native Americans,

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.460 align:middle line:90%
they care about the land.

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.420 align:middle line:90%
They care about the Earth.

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think since people just
don't care as much anymore,

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:18.620 align:middle line:84%
it's made it harder for them
to stay here and communicate

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.380 align:middle line:84%
with people and find people
that they can communicate with.

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do they want
to become closer with us.

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Some do.

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:29.980 align:middle line:84%
There are some that do because,
as he's communicated with me,

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:34.380 align:middle line:84%
it's important for them
to keep that relationship,

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:36.340 align:middle line:84%
just so they can
still be coming here.

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And they're not feeling like
they're hunted all the time.

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now, you
channel, don't you?

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Mhm.

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Who do you tap
into when you channel?

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:47.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: So I have my guides.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:51.060 align:middle line:84%
My two guides are the ones that
mainly give me information.

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:54.320 align:middle line:90%
And I have a lot help.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.360 align:middle line:90%
I have a lot help.

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.200 align:middle line:90%
I have angels.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.160 align:middle line:90%
I have guides.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.060 align:middle line:90%
I have other helpers that--

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.460 align:middle line:84%

separate from Ayolyns?

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:03.360 align:middle line:90%

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.160 align:middle line:90%

>>HARRIS: Probably.

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:10.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm a little nervous,
but I probably could.

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:12.080 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: There's nothing
to be nervous about.

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.152 align:middle line:84%
There's only 10 million
people watching you, right?

00:26:14.152 --> 00:26:14.540 align:middle line:90%

Sometimes I can

Sometimes it'll take
me a little bit.

I think just Ayolyn did for me.

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:48.190 align:middle line:84%

00:29:10.585 --> 00:29:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I think it could
take us back to the time

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:14.840 align:middle line:90%
that the natives had with them.

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:15.860 align:middle line:90%
More cohesive.

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:18.380 align:middle line:84%
We could live together
easily or easier.

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:22.820 align:middle line:84%
And also, you could
learn so much.

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:24.580 align:middle line:84%
There's so much to
learn from them.

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think if people actually
took the time and they cared,

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:29.400 align:middle line:84%
they could learn
a ton from them,

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.180 align:middle line:84%
because they have
a lot to share.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did we live with
them during the ancient times?

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.838 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: You mean like caveman
times, that sort of thing or--

00:29:38.838 --> 00:29:39.880 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Way back, yeah.

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Way back, yeah.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.427 align:middle line:90%
So they're saying, yes.

00:29:42.427 --> 00:29:44.260 align:middle line:84%
They could pop in and
out anytime they want.

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.160 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So we
coexisted with them?

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:46.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.900 align:middle line:84%
They only showed me the one
with the natives, I think,

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.108 align:middle line:90%
because I'm so close to that.

00:29:50.108 --> 00:29:52.320 align:middle line:84%
But yes, they're showing
me now that they've

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.460 align:middle line:90%
been around a lot longer.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:56.143 align:middle line:90%
So they've been here that long.

00:29:56.143 --> 00:29:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How long have
they been coming here?

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:03.840 align:middle line:90%


00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I'm not
getting a number,

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:08.760 align:middle line:84%
but I'm seeing
literal people living

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:11.360 align:middle line:90%
in huts and that sort of thing.

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:14.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm not seeing anything
further back than that though.

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did they have an
influence in shaping human

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.660 align:middle line:90%
development?

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:22.040 align:middle line:90%


00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:27.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I'm not seeing
that that's the case.

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:30.460 align:middle line:84%
I see them living together
as in the same space,

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:32.580 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not seeing
back that far.

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:34.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm not seeing them
doing things together.

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.380 align:middle line:84%
It may be that they're
just not showing me that,

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:38.200 align:middle line:90%
but I'm not seeing that.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If some humans saw
Bigfoot standing on the side

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:44.760 align:middle line:84%
of the road and pulled out
a rifle and shot at them,

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.020 align:middle line:90%
would they get hit?

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: They could.

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:48.742 align:middle line:84%
They're physical
when they're here.

00:30:48.742 --> 00:30:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They could be hurt?

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Mhm.

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:52.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.380 align:middle line:84%
If they don't pop into
their own dimension in time,

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:57.400 align:middle line:90%
I think they could get injured.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Because when they're
here, they're physical.

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do your guides
ever see a time where humans

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.490 align:middle line:84%
and Bigfoot will
coexist together again?

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:08.615 align:middle line:90%


00:31:08.615 --> 00:31:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Somebody just
told me not in my lifetime.

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:15.030 align:middle line:90%


00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:16.190 align:middle line:90%
It's not in the cards.

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:17.290 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm hearing.

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Who knows of
the existence of Bigfoot?

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:22.122 align:middle line:90%
Governments?

00:31:22.122 --> 00:31:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: The government
definitely knows about them.

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:26.650 align:middle line:84%
I had to ask about that,
because I was wondering

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:29.170 align:middle line:84%
what he was warning me
against that day, what

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:30.930 align:middle line:90%
was unsafe for him.

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And they did show me that
the government is involved.

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:35.630 align:middle line:84%
They know about them, and
they're also doing research.

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:37.403 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What kind of research?

00:31:37.403 --> 00:31:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They are doing
something with their blood.

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what, but
they said it's very important.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:45.450 align:middle line:84%
The blood is very
important, and they

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:48.537 align:middle line:90%
have them trapped somewhere.

00:31:48.537 --> 00:31:50.370 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They have
Bigfoot traps somewhere?

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:50.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They can't get out?

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No.

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:55.710 align:middle line:84%
So how they showed it to
me, it's somewhere with ice.

00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:57.190 align:middle line:90%
There's ice everywhere.

00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:58.690 align:middle line:90%
So it's somewhere cold.

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:00.550 align:middle line:84%
It's got to be
somewhere underground.

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:03.050 align:middle line:84%
It's nowhere anybody
could get to.

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And the one that they showed me
first, they showed me head on,

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:11.250 align:middle line:84%
there's a really
tall cage, and it's

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:14.930 align:middle line:84%
enough to hold a standing
male Bigfoot or Ayolyn,

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:16.850 align:middle line:90%
and he can't move.

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:20.852 align:middle line:84%
And they have some kind of--
they've got computers over here.

00:32:20.852 --> 00:32:22.310 align:middle line:84%
They have a guy on
a computer here.

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:23.650 align:middle line:90%
This is what they showed me.

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing
research over here.

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And then behind this
wall, there are more.

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:29.650 align:middle line:90%
They have more trapped.

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And then this one
they have cannot move.

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:34.930 align:middle line:84%
He also can't communicate
with the others

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:37.930 align:middle line:84%
that are there, because they
communicate telepathically.

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:40.060 align:middle line:84%
They're keeping him
with something--

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:41.310 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if it's a device.

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:42.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is.

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:43.750 align:middle line:90%
It might be alien technology.

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:44.550 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:46.370 align:middle line:84%
But they're keeping
him from communicating

00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:49.350 align:middle line:84%
with the others that are trapped
there, and he also can't move.

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:53.210 align:middle line:84%
He can't get out of that
dimension into his own.

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:56.107 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How long has
this been happening?

00:32:56.107 --> 00:32:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So when I
asked about that--

00:32:57.690 --> 00:32:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: With the government.

00:32:58.510 --> 00:32:59.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:00.490 align:middle line:90%
They said about 30 years.

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:05.930 align:middle line:84%
They've been able to get them
and do this for about 30 years.

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:08.348 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are they
getting great data?

00:33:08.348 --> 00:33:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They must be, because
they've figured something out

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:11.830 align:middle line:90%
with their blood.

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:13.288 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be
really important

00:33:13.288 --> 00:33:14.570 align:middle line:90%
at some point with the blood.

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:16.190 align:middle line:84%
They're doing something
with their blood.

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What do you think
they're doing with the blood,

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:18.753 align:middle line:90%
if you had to guess?

00:33:18.753 --> 00:33:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I've been
trying to figure that out.

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:20.940 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:22.150 align:middle line:90%
They're not telling me.

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:24.590 align:middle line:84%
But I would really like
to try to figure that out.

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: These are government
scientists playing around with

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:29.350 align:middle line:90%
Sasquatch blood?

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:33.810 align:middle line:90%
Yes, and I don't know why yet.

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:35.110 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Truly remarkable.

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:37.618 align:middle line:84%
There must be something
special about it.

00:33:37.618 --> 00:33:39.290 align:middle line:84%
I just don't know
what it is yet.

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: There have been rumors
that orbs that float around

00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:48.150 align:middle line:84%
might be carrying
Bigfoot within it.

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:49.158 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard that?

00:33:49.158 --> 00:33:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I haven't heard
that, but it's not impossible

00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:53.970 align:middle line:90%
because orbs are energy.

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:56.330 align:middle line:84%
So any kind of
energy, especially

00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:59.610 align:middle line:84%
if they can go
invisible, I don't

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:01.390 align:middle line:84%
see why there couldn't
be a ball of light,

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:03.210 align:middle line:90%
because it's just energy.

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:05.717 align:middle line:84%

be extraterrestrial

00:34:05.717 --> 00:34:07.300 align:middle line:84%

they don't come from space

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.440 align:middle line:84%
Their dimension is
completely different.

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:18.148 align:middle line:84%

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:29.517 align:middle line:84%
I've seen their
dimension on our level.

00:34:29.517 --> 00:34:30.600 align:middle line:90%
It's a little bit strange.

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.433 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like you
have to take a step up,

00:34:32.433 --> 00:34:36.120 align:middle line:84%
but it's on our level, and
it just like is within us.

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:38.040 align:middle line:84%
It's another
dimension within us.

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:40.659 align:middle line:84%
It's not far away
in another galaxy.

>>HARRIS: Yeah, I
just communicate.

00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:01.017 align:middle line:84%
They just pop in and tell me

00:35:01.017 --> 00:35:03.100 align:middle line:84%

00:35:04.267 --> 00:35:05.403 align:middle line:90%
I don't do that.

00:35:05.403 --> 00:35:06.820 align:middle line:84%
They're giving me

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:08.900 align:middle line:90%
and I'm just telling it to you.

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Where do they
get their information?

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:11.962 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: The other side?

00:35:11.962 --> 00:35:12.780 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:16.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So as far as I know,
the other side knows everything.

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:17.820 align:middle line:90%
They know everything.

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:19.600 align:middle line:90%
It's where we all come from.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:22.260 align:middle line:84%
It's where we're all going
to go back to once we're

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:24.620 align:middle line:90%
done with this life.

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:27.180 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How many different
types of Bigfoot are there?

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:28.578 align:middle line:90%
Just one breed or many?

00:35:28.578 --> 00:35:30.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: He said
that there's a few.

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:33.260 align:middle line:90%
There's different ones.

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:34.760 align:middle line:90%
He told me it's like humans.

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:35.920 align:middle line:90%
We have different--

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:36.180 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Races.

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS:
--nationalities and that.

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And races.

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:38.920 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Races.

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:40.740 align:middle line:90%
He said it's like that.

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:44.700 align:middle line:90%
So different races of Bigfoot.

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:46.820 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Do they all get along?

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No.

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They do not?

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:53.380 align:middle line:90%
He was very clear about that.

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I've heard sounds
from the woods of what could be

00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:58.920 align:middle line:84%
a Bigfoot shouting
and screaming.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.080 align:middle line:90%
What about their voices?

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.540 align:middle line:90%
What are they like?

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:04.442 align:middle line:84%
Do they talk, or is
it all telepathic?

00:36:04.442 --> 00:36:06.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I've only been able
to communicate telepathically

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:09.100 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:11.680 align:middle line:84%
No words, no English words
or anything like that.

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.220 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So you wouldn't be
able to describe their voice?

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No.

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:17.540 align:middle line:90%


00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:19.405 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do they
try to mimic humans?

00:36:19.405 --> 00:36:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: They don't.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.842 align:middle line:90%
There are things that do.

00:36:21.842 --> 00:36:24.238 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Such as?

00:36:24.238 --> 00:36:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I don't know
the names of these things,

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:30.260 align:middle line:84%
but there is a
creature that comes

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:33.120 align:middle line:84%
through that can
mimic human voices,

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:34.660 align:middle line:90%
and they try to trick people.

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And they come
through a dimension

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:37.760 align:middle line:90%
like Ayolyn's dimension.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:40.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not the same place,
but it's very similar.

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:44.043 align:middle line:84%
And because the
veil is thinning,

00:36:44.043 --> 00:36:45.460 align:middle line:84%
they're coming
through a lot more,

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:47.380 align:middle line:84%
and more people are
going to see them.

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Tara, what is
called tree knocking?

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.540 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So what I know of
it is that sometimes they'll

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:57.650 align:middle line:84%
use a branch or something
to knock on a tree.

00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:59.400 align:middle line:84%
I think they do that
to scare people away.

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.140 align:middle line:84%
But most of the
time, the knocking

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:04.970 align:middle line:84%
comes from something else
that follows Bigfoot around.

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:06.670 align:middle line:90%
They're from the same place.

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:08.730 align:middle line:90%
And they're little things.

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:10.430 align:middle line:90%
They're four feet tall.

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:14.950 align:middle line:84%
I've only seen them as really
dark, like, a very black shadow.

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And they will go around, and
they'll knock on the trees.

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:19.770 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of weird.

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:22.210 align:middle line:84%
They are in the same place as
Bigfoot a lot of the times.

00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:24.190 align:middle line:84%
But they'll go around
and knock on the trees,

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:25.610 align:middle line:90%
and they're really fast.

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:27.470 align:middle line:84%
You'll hear knocking behind
you, and then all of a sudden,

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:28.845 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
in front of you.

00:37:28.845 --> 00:37:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Are they like gnomes?

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No, not like gnomes.

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:35.630 align:middle line:84%
They're almost like--
what's that creature

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:38.510 align:middle line:84%
from that Lord of the Rings
movie, but they're taller?

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:40.210 align:middle line:90%
They look like skinny.

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:41.870 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they look like
those, but they're

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:43.170 align:middle line:90%
like a black shadow type thing.

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You remember the
movie Ghost with Patrick Swayze?

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:46.590 align:middle line:90%
God rest his soul.

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:47.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:50.670 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Those creatures that
came out of the ground whenever

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:52.990 align:middle line:84%
something happened,
were they like that?

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:54.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Kind of, yeah.

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:57.110 align:middle line:84%
But they do a lot of
the tree knocking.

00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:58.735 align:middle line:84%
They'll do a lot of
the tree knocking.

00:37:58.735 --> 00:38:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Ayolyn will do
tree knocking too.

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:01.193 align:middle line:90%
Some of them will do that.

00:38:01.193 --> 00:38:03.910 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of times,
it's this other thing.

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:07.230 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Have you been able
to travel with the Ayolyns

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:09.510 align:middle line:90%
to their dimension?

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: A couple times they've
taken me in telepathically,

00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:14.090 align:middle line:90%
I guess.

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:15.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
else to explain it.

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Like, I've been popped
into their dimension.

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And the first time they showed
it to me, it was pretty scary,

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:25.490 align:middle line:84%
because it's not like-- it's
like Earth, but it's not.

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:27.630 align:middle line:90%
The trees are a lot different.

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:32.270 align:middle line:84%
They have those crystals
coming up out of the ground.

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:33.390 align:middle line:90%
And they're massive.

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:34.203 align:middle line:90%
They're huge.

00:38:34.203 --> 00:38:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They seem to use these
crystals a lot, I guess, right?

00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:38.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They
use it for energy.

00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:41.630 align:middle line:84%
That's what I got from it, is
that it's very easy to use those

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:43.710 align:middle line:90%
because there's so much energy--

00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And
communication, obviously.

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:47.370 align:middle line:90%
What else, travel?

00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:48.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Because the times
that I've seen when

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:53.410 align:middle line:84%
I went in there, a couple
times I went in there,

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:54.210 align:middle line:90%
they're everywhere.

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:55.010 align:middle line:90%
They're all over.

00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:56.430 align:middle line:90%
They're right there.

00:38:56.430 --> 00:39:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think they use that also
maybe to open up their portals.

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:03.160 align:middle line:84%
That's how they go in and
out, is to use that energy.

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:06.840 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Tara, what are they
doing here in the first place?

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:09.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So they
basically just like--

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.020 align:middle line:90%
they like Earth.

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:11.980 align:middle line:90%
They like the land.

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:12.780 align:middle line:90%
They like the food.

00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:14.020 align:middle line:90%
They like to be here.

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:15.395 align:middle line:90%
They like it here.

00:39:15.395 --> 00:39:17.520 align:middle line:84%
He told me that they like
it here better than where

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:18.360 align:middle line:90%
they come from.

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:19.160 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Really?

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:19.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Mhm.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.377 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's a
beautiful planet.

00:39:21.377 --> 00:39:22.213 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Right?

00:39:22.213 --> 00:39:23.380 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Why not come here?

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:23.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And theirs isn't
all that beautiful,

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:26.140 align:middle line:90%
so I don't blame them.

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:28.480 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do they
come here to stay?

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:31.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They stay,
but they don't stay--

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.017 align:middle line:90%
they won't stay forever.

00:39:32.017 --> 00:39:33.100 align:middle line:90%
They do go back and forth.

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:34.960 align:middle line:84%
I've never asked
why they go back

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:37.740 align:middle line:84%
if they like it so much here,
but they do go back and forth.

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:39.440 align:middle line:84%
But they'll stay
here for a long time.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.565 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How do they live?

00:39:40.565 --> 00:39:42.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they don't have
houses or anything.

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:44.720 align:middle line:90%
Where do they sleep?

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Just on
the ground and--

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.320 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I can tell
you that I know

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.020 align:middle line:90%
that they'll sleep in caves.

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:53.680 align:middle line:84%
They'll do that too,
because I've seen that.

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I had a guy call me
on my radio show years ago.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:03.240 align:middle line:84%
He was fishing on the side of a

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:06.560 align:middle line:84%
put them in a little
bag, turned around

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:09.660 align:middle line:84%
and saw Bigfoot looking
at him from behind,

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:11.760 align:middle line:90%
about 10 feet behind.

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:14.040 align:middle line:90%
He pulled out the two trout.

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.200 align:middle line:90%
Bigfoot looked at the fish.

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:19.240 align:middle line:84%
The guy gave Bigfoot
the two fish.

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Bigfoot took the two
fish, looked at the guy,

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.400 align:middle line:90%

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.100 align:middle line:90%
They have a conscience.

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:42.880 align:middle line:90%
How many?

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So they did show me,
or tell me that some of them

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:50.760 align:middle line:84%
live in bigger groups,
like people would.

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:55.200 align:middle line:84%
Some are completely loners
and live by themselves.

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:58.620 align:middle line:84%
The ones that live in groups,
they tend to stay that way.

00:40:58.620 --> 00:40:59.680 align:middle line:90%
They travel that way.

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.240 align:middle line:90%
They'll stay together.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:05.060 align:middle line:84%
But not all of
them are like that.

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:08.800 align:middle line:90%
There's some that won't do that.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.800 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: We bury our dead.

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:13.400 align:middle line:90%
We cremate our dead.

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:15.400 align:middle line:90%
What do the Bigfoot do?

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:19.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So I asked about that,
and they showed me that they

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:24.720 align:middle line:84%
either take them back through
their dimension, or they--

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:29.280 align:middle line:84%
they showed me this scene
where they put the body over

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:33.960 align:middle line:84%
to the side and put things over
it, like leaves or branches

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.180 align:middle line:90%
and that, and just left it.

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:38.440 align:middle line:84%
But it was close to
where they were at.

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And then they would take it
back to their dimension or--

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.720 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Do they bury them?

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They said
they don't bury them.

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.920 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do they
believe in God?

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.325 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No.

00:41:50.325 --> 00:41:51.200 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They don't?

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No.

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do they ever
talk about their existence,

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:56.330 align:middle line:90%
how they got here?

00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:58.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Nope.

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:00.910 align:middle line:84%
They're very much like,
this is what we do.

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:01.990 align:middle line:90%
This is where we live.

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:03.190 align:middle line:90%
This is what we eat.

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:06.158 align:middle line:90%
This is how it goes.

00:42:06.158 --> 00:42:12.350 align:middle line:84%
They don't have the thought of,
there's a God, there's a heaven,

00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:13.230 align:middle line:90%
that sort of thing.

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:14.650 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Do you like them?

00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I like the
one that I've met.

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:17.170 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:18.337 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Is he kind to you?

00:42:18.337 --> 00:42:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: He has been.

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:20.790 align:middle line:90%
I like his son.

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:22.650 align:middle line:90%
His son's really cute.

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How big is his son?

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:26.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Oh, he's
probably four feet tall.

00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:30.082 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do they communicate
telepathically with all of them?

00:42:30.082 --> 00:42:32.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Like within the
different groups or the races,

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:33.270 align:middle line:90%
as you say?

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:34.570 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:37.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I've
never asked to that.

00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:40.095 align:middle line:84%
But somebody is
telling me they can.

00:42:40.095 --> 00:42:41.470 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Who's
telling you that?

00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: One of my
guides is saying they can.

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:44.275 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They can do that?

00:42:44.275 --> 00:42:45.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Mhm.

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If you want to
communicate with Bigfoot,

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:49.410 align:middle line:90%
what's the easiest way?

00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: For me or
for other people?

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:51.770 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Both.

00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:52.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: OK.

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:55.770 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's easier for me
just to talk to him in my head.

00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's easier when I go to the
mountain, or wherever he's at.

00:42:58.790 --> 00:43:01.330 align:middle line:10%
That's the easiest to
be in the same space.

00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:03.590 align:middle line:10%
For other people, if
they want to communicate,

00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:09.490 align:middle line:10%
they need to have good
intentions, and just be--

00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:11.390 align:middle line:10%
anywhere you're at, if
you're in their space,

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:14.050 align:middle line:10%
just don't do anything wrong.

00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:18.770 align:middle line:10%
Don't cut a tree down, or-- they
don't like that sort of thing.

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:21.570 align:middle line:84%
But have good intentions, and
maybe leave them something.

00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Because I have heard
that they like that.

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:25.480 align:middle line:90%
Some of them really like that.

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:29.010 align:middle line:90%


00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:30.410 align:middle line:90%
Keep trying.

00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:31.230 align:middle line:90%
Just keep trying.

00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Because I know a lot of
people, they try once

00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:33.687 align:middle line:90%
and then they give up.

00:43:33.687 --> 00:43:35.053 align:middle line:90%
You got to keep trying.

00:43:35.053 --> 00:43:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do you think
they picked you to pass

00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:38.970 align:middle line:90%
on the messages about them?

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:40.392 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I think so.

00:43:40.392 --> 00:43:41.850 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's
important to them

00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:47.490 align:middle line:84%
to pass the message along about
co-existing in the same space

00:43:47.490 --> 00:43:50.410 align:middle line:84%
and Earth, because the land
is very important to them,

00:43:50.410 --> 00:43:51.960 align:middle line:90%
just because it's their home.

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Why you?

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:55.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I have no idea.

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:56.120 align:middle line:90%
Because I was there.

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:56.920 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:58.960 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I don't think
they sought me out.

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:01.220 align:middle line:84%
I was there in
their space, and he

00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:04.740 align:middle line:84%
saw me and knew that he
could probably talk to me.

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So when people go to
your website, what do they get?

00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They can
email me for readings.

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:12.560 align:middle line:90%
I do animal communication.

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:17.000 align:middle line:84%
So if they need a reading for a
pet or an animal, I can do that.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.280 align:middle line:90%
Or medical readings.

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.762 align:middle line:84%
I do a lot of medical readings
for people, and for animals.

00:44:20.762 --> 00:44:21.720 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Good for you.

00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:23.820 align:middle line:84%
Tara, thanks for being
on Beyond Belief.

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:25.487 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Thank you,
I appreciate it.

00:44:25.487 --> 00:44:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I've interviewed a
lot of people about Bigfoot

00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:30.020 align:middle line:90%
and Sasquatch over the years.

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:33.260 align:middle line:84%
But Tara Harris brings
us something very unique

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:36.380 align:middle line:90%
to this subject, very personal--

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:41.060 align:middle line:84%
a relationship with
Ayolyn, a Sasquatch,

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:42.940 align:middle line:90%
that you can't replace.

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:45.160 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
Beyond Belief.
