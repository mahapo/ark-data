00:00:24.532 --> 00:00:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Were the Great Pyramids
just simple tools?

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.350 align:middle line:84%
Or could they be a
holistic energy device

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.870 align:middle line:84%
that pairs with the Earth
and its inhabitants?

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.720 align:middle line:10%
Chris Dunn, who has
worked at every level

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.780 align:middle line:10%
of high-tech manufacturing
for 52 years,

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.270 align:middle line:10%
has researched this topic
since the publication

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.150 align:middle line:10%
of his first book back in 1998.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.287 align:middle line:84%
And he will talk with
us about his theory

00:00:48.287 --> 00:00:49.870 align:middle line:84%
and the new discoveries
that have been

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.490 align:middle line:90%
made about the Great Pyramid.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.058 align:middle line:84%
Chris, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:53.058 --> 00:00:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRIS DUNN: It's good
to be here, George.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:55.663 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:55.663 --> 00:00:57.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in all this?

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.180 align:middle line:90%
How did this start for you?

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.290 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNN: Well, it started
out with an interest

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.959 align:middle line:10%
in general things Egyptian.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:08.080 align:middle line:10%
And like everybody else on the
planet going through school,

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.310 align:middle line:10%
I learned that the pyramids
were tombs for pharaohs.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.940 align:middle line:84%
But then I picked up a
book by Peter Tompkins--

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.680 align:middle line:90%
"Secrets of the Great Pyramid."

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that there
were quite a few people

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.920 align:middle line:84%
in the world who
question that theory

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.980 align:middle line:84%
and that actually tried
to offer their own.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when you
came out with that theory

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.190 align:middle line:84%
that it could have
been a power plant,

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.390 align:middle line:84%
it was pretty
controversial, wasn't it?

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.277 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: It was.

00:01:32.277 --> 00:01:33.360 align:middle line:90%
It's still controversial--

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.440 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNN: --in some circles.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.680 align:middle line:10%
It's been accepted a
little more after being

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.510 align:middle line:10%
published for 20 years.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.330 align:middle line:84%
But the surprising
thing to me is

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.670 align:middle line:84%
that there is a huge interest
in ancient technologies

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.890 align:middle line:84%
or advanced ancient technologies
in Egypt by the Egyptians.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And they are now looking
at this with some pride

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.740 align:middle line:84%
in their culture,
that their ancestors

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.000 align:middle line:84%
were more advanced than what
they were previously taught.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.700 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What was that
fundamental area that

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.520 align:middle line:10%
got you to believe that the
pyramids could very well be

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.810 align:middle line:10%
power plants?

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, it was actually
the engineering description

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.110 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramid, the
structure itself

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.070 align:middle line:84%
and how it was
crafted, the precision,

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.760 align:middle line:84%
and when you consider that you
have the largest building that

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.060 align:middle line:84%
has ever been built on the
planet that covered 13 acres.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And the 13 acres was leveled
within 7/8 of an inch.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
blocks of casing stones

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.390 align:middle line:84%
that are within
10/1000 of an inch.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.420 align:middle line:84%
That's like half the
thickness of a thumbnail.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.130 align:middle line:90%
And that's how precise they are.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.720 align:middle line:90%
And then the shafts--

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.133 align:middle line:84%
everything about the Great
Pyramid inside and out.

00:02:59.133 --> 00:03:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Not just the Great Pyramid,
but other pyramids, too.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.890 align:middle line:84%
They show a real high order
of manufacturing precision.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Truly
remarkable that we almost

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.830 align:middle line:90%
can't duplicate today.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.470 align:middle line:90%


00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: It would be
difficult. I mean, as far

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.530 align:middle line:84%
as the manufacturing of it, the
cutting of precise artifacts,

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.920 align:middle line:90%
we do have those capabilities.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.120 align:middle line:84%
The construction of it, I
think, will be a real challenge.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.672 align:middle line:84%
Some people say that it would be
almost impossible to do today--

00:03:31.672 --> 00:03:32.472 align:middle line:90%
other people.

00:03:32.472 --> 00:03:34.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, so we
have two areas here.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.120 align:middle line:84%
One is, of course,
is it a power plant?

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.898 align:middle line:90%
And what was it used for?

00:03:38.898 --> 00:03:39.940 align:middle line:90%
I mean, who needed power?

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.140 align:middle line:90%
For what?

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And then also, how in the
heck they built these things.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so there are two
complex questions there.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Well, yes.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's when
you start looking

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.290 align:middle line:84%
at the schematics
of the Great Pyramid

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.290 align:middle line:90%
and the unusual interior design.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.420 align:middle line:84%
It has no-- it doesn't
represent any kind of structure

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.930 align:middle line:84%
or building where people would
spend any time in at all.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's almost
inaccessible to human traffic.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the original
tomb theory-- there

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.740 align:middle line:84%
were no mummies found
in the Great Pyramid,

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.260 align:middle line:84%
no original mummies found in
any pyramid for that matter.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.160 align:middle line:84%
But for me, it was more of
the engineering precision

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.800 align:middle line:84%
that spoke of a
civilization that

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.390 align:middle line:84%
had a state of the art that was
much higher than what we have

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.480 align:middle line:84%
give them credit for
and even challenges

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.240 align:middle line:84%
our own state of the art
in terms of manufacturing

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.050 align:middle line:90%
precision.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chris, as
we get into this--

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.380 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to get into
it in a big way on the program

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.740 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Jonny Enoch, who appeared on
one of our "Beyond Belief"

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.260 align:middle line:84%
programs, talked about your
theory of the power plant.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Oh.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.892 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:51.892 --> 00:04:55.700 align:middle line:10%
- If I could tell you a story,
when we were in Egypt not too

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.630 align:middle line:10%
long ago, I stayed with my
friend, the great hieroglyphics

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.720 align:middle line:10%
expert and Egyptologist
Mohamed Ibrahim.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.960 align:middle line:10%
And we were at this
temple called Edfu.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.040 align:middle line:10%
Now, the original temple where
the Atlantis story came from

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.010 align:middle line:10%
was known as Nefru.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.180 align:middle line:10%
It was on the Nile delta.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.330 align:middle line:10%
And we're told it was
washed away and destroyed.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.740 align:middle line:10%
The great story was
upon the wall there.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.640 align:middle line:10%
But when we go to Edfu and
you look upon the temple,

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.920 align:middle line:10%
we see a great seafaring people.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.710 align:middle line:10%
But what we see above
them is rather alarming.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.230 align:middle line:10%
We see a great serpent come
down from the heavens that

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.598 align:middle line:10%
is destroying them.

00:05:28.598 --> 00:05:30.390 align:middle line:10%
- Where it looks like
a comet or something?

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.400 align:middle line:10%
- Yes.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.380 align:middle line:10%
But in the mysteries,
the serpent

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.800 align:middle line:10%
always represented energy
or electromagnetic energy.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.580 align:middle line:10%
So therefore, I believe,
from what I've seen,

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.130 align:middle line:10%
and I know you've seen
this evidence before, too,

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.230 align:middle line:10%
that when we look at
the Great Pyramid,

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.720 align:middle line:10%
especially using Chris
Dunn's Giza power plant

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.350 align:middle line:10%
hypotheses on how we see it
built like a Faraday cage,

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.900 align:middle line:10%
we see the granite,
sandstone, limestone.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:55.730 align:middle line:10%
It's a technology.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.170 align:middle line:10%
It's a power plant.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.300 align:middle line:10%
We see these obelisks acting
like transmitters for energy,

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.980 align:middle line:10%
that I believe they
were experimenting

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.680 align:middle line:10%
with electromagnetic
energy and gravity

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.760 align:middle line:10%
much how we're playing
around with HAARP now.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.560 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chris, what do you
think of Jonny's thoughts?

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, I agree with
him and very well spoken.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:22.520 align:middle line:90%
The electromagnetic energy as--

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.450 align:middle line:84%
I would modify a little
bit and say that they

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.130 align:middle line:90%
weren't just experimenting.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:33.380 align:middle line:84%
They had mastered tapping
into electromagnetic energy

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.550 align:middle line:84%
and using
electromagnetic energy.

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what were
they using all this for?

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Just like
us-- civilization.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:50.870 align:middle line:84%
I would say that if you have a
source of energy and you have--

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.690 align:middle line:84%
the output of that
is electricity,

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:54.970 align:middle line:90%
electromagnetic energy.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:01.633 align:middle line:84%
Then you can use it for whatever
you have the genius to invent.

00:07:01.633 --> 00:07:03.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well.
what kind of things

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.050 align:middle line:84%
do you think they had then,
which would have required

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.130 align:middle line:90%
that kind of power?

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.850 align:middle line:90%


00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: When you look
at a worldwide system

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:19.520 align:middle line:84%
and the fundamental function
of the Great Pyramid,

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.970 align:middle line:84%
it's not just about
electromagnetic energy.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is the goal
to actually generate that.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:26.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: But it's also relieving
stresses in the Earth.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.360 align:middle line:90%
So it's multi-functional.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And it allows you to relieve
stresses in the Earth

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:43.220 align:middle line:84%
so that it would eliminate
the destruction of earthquakes

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.125 align:middle line:84%
if you could take that
energy and just release it

00:07:46.125 --> 00:07:47.000 align:middle line:90%
over periods of time.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Almost like
a pressure cooker.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.010 align:middle line:90%
Let the steam out.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:49.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Right.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:54.500 align:middle line:84%
But then as far as
the kind of products

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.990 align:middle line:84%
or the kind of
inventions or devices

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:02.030 align:middle line:84%
that they needed to power,
it's clear throughout Egypt

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:06.890 align:middle line:84%
that they were using very, very
large machines, mega machines.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:07.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where'd they go?

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Where did they go?

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:08.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where are they?

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: That is a good question.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:13.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is a
perennial question.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.560 align:middle line:90%
And it's a thorny question.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.215 align:middle line:84%
And answering it-- all
you can do is speculate.

00:08:19.215 --> 00:08:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, is
it conceivable that

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.560 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials were part
of this equation in that

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.590 align:middle line:84%
the machinery and whatever
apparatus they knew that needed

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.750 align:middle line:90%
the power source for--

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.559 align:middle line:84%
they took back with them
and left the planet?

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, I know that even
today when a project started

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.080 align:middle line:90%
out, an engineering project--

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.970 align:middle line:84%
you'll bring specialists
in from the outside.

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:46.220 align:middle line:84%
They'll bring their
specialized tools.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.080 align:middle line:90%
They'll complete the project.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.080 align:middle line:84%
Then they'll pack their
tools up and leave.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:55.280 align:middle line:84%
I know that the idea
that extraterrestrials

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.870 align:middle line:90%
had some effort.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Those were able to assist and
help is a very popular idea.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Another idea is I think a
little bit more down to Earth.

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And that is if we push that
civilization further back

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:18.920 align:middle line:90%
in time which are--

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:22.760 align:middle line:84%
from my conversations in Egypt,
they're now looking at that.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Because they are accepting that
their ancestors were much more

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.350 align:middle line:90%
advanced.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.380 align:middle line:84%
But they see that
between the old kingdom

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.490 align:middle line:84%
or the Egyptian
pharaohs and what

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:41.270 align:middle line:84%
they were capable of
doing with their tools--

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.610 align:middle line:84%
that they wouldn't be
able to create what

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:45.650 align:middle line:90%
we see in Egypt on the ground.

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And so they're looking at a gap
or some cataclysm that happened

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:56.070 align:middle line:90%
maybe 10, 12, 15,000 years ago.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the
case, then what

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:01.790 align:middle line:84%
products would survive
that we have made,

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:06.290 align:middle line:84%
all that we use over 10,000
years if suddenly everything

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.756 align:middle line:90%
stopped for us?

00:10:08.756 --> 00:10:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And that is a scenario
that has been discussed.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Television programs
have been created on it.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.417 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could they
have been powering UFOs?

00:10:18.417 --> 00:10:21.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: I think that they could
power whatever they wanted to.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And so if they had aerial
craft, which I don't put limits

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.110 align:middle line:84%
on the ancient Egyptians on
what they were able to do,

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:36.070 align:middle line:84%
all the pyramid builds and
what they were able to do.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.470 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
the Great Pyramid,

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:42.170 align:middle line:84%
it's a total out of place
artifact in history,

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:46.610 align:middle line:84%
in time, where it is so
advanced even by our standards.

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:50.060 align:middle line:84%
It's so advanced that
even by our standards,

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.400 align:middle line:84%
we look at what we
have surrounding

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.760 align:middle line:84%
our very large structures--
power plants, things like that.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And we have a whole
infrastructure.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Right now in Egypt,
we're just looking

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:06.230 align:middle line:84%
at the skeleton of a
advanced ancient civilization

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:08.890 align:middle line:84%
and actually filling
in the blanks

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:10.547 align:middle line:90%
while putting flesh and--

00:11:10.547 --> 00:11:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Trying to
fill in the blanks.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:16.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Trying to fill in the
blanks to put the rest of it

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.550 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.230 align:middle line:84%
We're not left with
that much, really,

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:25.880 align:middle line:84%
except what they crafted with
their hands and their machines

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.170 align:middle line:84%
and what they imprinted
on their temples.

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chris, those who are
skeptical of your power plant

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:33.590 align:middle line:90%
theory--

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:35.110 align:middle line:90%
what do they say?

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:36.360 align:middle line:90%
What's their biggest argument?

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, I think there
is a resistance to considering

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:48.430 align:middle line:84%
the idea that the
civilization is--

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:50.720 align:middle line:90%
our civilization is mortal.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And past civilizations
have reached great heights

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.660 align:middle line:90%
only to be destroyed.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And more classical
trained scholars

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:08.840 align:middle line:84%
would reject the idea of
a cyclical history, where

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.940 align:middle line:84%
you go back in time
and you find that there

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.350 align:middle line:90%
was a high civilization.

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:14.600 align:middle line:90%
They reject that.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
that they have based

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.190 align:middle line:84%
their history on
is what they find

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:21.290 align:middle line:90%
in their archaeological record.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, acoustics seem
to be very important here, too.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:25.580 align:middle line:90%
Tell me why.

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, acoustics-- I
mean, acoustics is energy.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:33.370 align:middle line:90%
You can-- vibration.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:39.620 align:middle line:84%
The use of acoustics in the
Great Pyramid and the phenomena

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:43.820 align:middle line:84%
surrounding how sound moves
within the Great Pyramid

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.050 align:middle line:90%
has been recorded.

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Or you have anecdotal
information going back

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.850 align:middle line:90%
to the time of Napoleon.

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of people, a
lot of travelers, explorers,

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.230 align:middle line:84%
researchers who have
visited the Great Pyramid

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:07.880 align:middle line:84%
have noticed that there is a
very unusual acoustic effect

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:08.990 align:middle line:90%
inside the Great Pyramid.

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it sound
resonance, too?

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:11.760 align:middle line:90%
Is that one and the same?

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Well, yes.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the sound and
acoustics is the same thing.

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:18.050 align:middle line:90%
But the sound is--

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:21.840 align:middle line:90%


00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.270 align:middle line:84%
in the Giza power
plant theory, it

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:28.320 align:middle line:84%
explains the reason
for the giant granite

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.230 align:middle line:90%
beams above the king's chamber.

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's theorized that
those beams were actually

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:38.010 align:middle line:84%
tuned to respond
to sound generated

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:39.882 align:middle line:90%
within the Great Pyramid.

00:13:39.882 --> 00:13:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our friend,
Steve Halpern,

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:45.690 align:middle line:84%
who is a great musician, has
put together acoustical sounds

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:46.980 align:middle line:90%
from the Great Pyramids.

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.022 align:middle line:90%
We got to listen to this.

00:13:49.022 --> 00:13:52.392 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:52.392 --> 00:15:14.290 align:middle line:90%


00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:16.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, Steve did a great job,
Chris, with the sound acoustics

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:17.640 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.500 align:middle line:90%
But what does that mean?

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, to me it just
represents the phenomena

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:26.577 align:middle line:84%
that you find inside
the Great Pyramid.

00:15:26.577 --> 00:15:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, did you hear
that in the Great Pyramid?

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:29.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yes.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:36.990 align:middle line:84%
In 1995, I paid to be left
alone in the king's chamber

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:38.615 align:middle line:90%
and have the lights turned off.

00:15:38.615 --> 00:15:40.532 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How much do you
have to pay for that?

00:15:40.532 --> 00:15:42.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: It was about
$50 at the time.

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:43.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it?

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: It would be a
little more than that now.

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'd pay 100 to be left
alone in the Great Pyramid.

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:47.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yeah.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.370 align:middle line:84%
So I had a couple of hours
there after all the tourists

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:51.523 align:middle line:90%
had left.

00:15:51.523 --> 00:15:52.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So all right.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.020 align:middle line:90%
So you were in there alone.

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: And I had
a tape recorder.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.710 align:middle line:90%
And I had an RF meter.

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:00.810 align:middle line:84%
So I was actually
seeing if there

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:05.620 align:middle line:84%
was a response from the granite
and the radio frequency ranges.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you picked
up similar kinds of tones?

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:08.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Oh, yes.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the
reverberation in that.

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:11.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: But the
amazing thing is they

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.290 align:middle line:90%
hadn't turned the lights off.

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:17.760 align:middle line:90%
And I was getting impatient.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:22.560 align:middle line:84%
So I walked through the
entrance-- but you don't walk.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.537 align:middle line:84%
You crawl through
the passageway--

00:16:24.537 --> 00:16:25.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's that narrow?

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: --leading to the
Grand Gallery, right?

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And I stood on top
of the step there.

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And I yelled down, hey,
turn off the lights, please!

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And then I scurried back up
through the passage, back

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:42.780 align:middle line:84%
into the king's
chamber and walked up

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:44.520 align:middle line:90%
to where my equipment was.

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
the lights were off.

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you imagine the
engineering behind this to--

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:50.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yes, I can imagine it.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --put
all this together?

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:52.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yeah, I can imagine it.

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.280 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.840 align:middle line:90%
It's very complex.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
out of place.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.480 align:middle line:90%
Nothing was done accidentally.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was all
perfectly engineered.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:07.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
mistakes in manufacturing.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.740 align:middle line:84%
You see where there
are machine mistakes.

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:10.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: But as far as a system
itself, It's pretty perfect.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:18.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
any research going

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.319 align:middle line:90%
on right now investigating this?

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:22.119 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yes.

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And the amazing thing is that
of late, some of that research

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:32.380 align:middle line:84%
is directly related to the
theory in the Giza power plant.

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:38.020 align:middle line:84%
One of the areas of research
is the Scan Pyramid project.

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:43.900 align:middle line:84%
That's where they are actually
using or detecting muons--

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:47.500 align:middle line:84%
particles from space-- as they
come through the Great Pyramid

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:51.700 align:middle line:84%
to see if there are any open
spaces or any chambers that

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.490 align:middle line:84%
have been previously
undiscovered.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And they found a space right
above the Grand Gallery.

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:02.315 align:middle line:84%
It's about 100 feet
long, I would guess.

00:18:02.315 --> 00:18:03.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:05.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: It's huge.

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:08.500 align:middle line:84%
But it's right near
where the northern shaft.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And so a very good friend of
mine when he was a aerospace

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.710 align:middle line:90%
engineer--

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:20.200 align:middle line:84%
when he saw that, he
said, well, finally, they

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.060 align:middle line:84%
have discovered
the preamp that you

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:25.780 align:middle line:84%
need in order for your
power plant theory to work.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:28.150 align:middle line:90%
And so he had--

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.720 align:middle line:84%
I had doubts about how the
power plant theory would

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.555 align:middle line:90%
work without a preamp.

00:18:33.555 --> 00:18:34.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not anymore.

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: The location
of this space.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:42.070 align:middle line:84%
All they would need
for a preamp is

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:47.710 align:middle line:84%
to have quartz crystals
filled with quartz crystal

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:50.680 align:middle line:84%
sand and then some
kind of a connector

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:55.750 align:middle line:84%
to connect with the energy
coming, going through.

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:57.260 align:middle line:90%
The signal comes from space.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:01.250 align:middle line:84%
So that would actually
amplify the signal

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:06.870 align:middle line:84%
and amplify the effects
in the king's chamber.

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chris, are the Pyramids
of Giza all connected somehow?

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yes, I believe so.

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:13.670 align:middle line:90%
I believe they are.

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:18.070 align:middle line:84%
I believe they're
connected acoustically.

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And they have
particular frequencies.

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.360 align:middle line:90%


00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.407 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's no
underground wires or anything

00:19:27.407 --> 00:19:28.240 align:middle line:90%
like that connected?

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, I mean, there have
been reports of wires found.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:40.125 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: I think
when Napoleon was--

00:19:40.125 --> 00:19:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Shooting
them up, right?

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:46.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: His events--
wrote about some wires

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:50.830 align:middle line:84%
in the Great Pyramid, but
trying to find the source

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:53.882 align:middle line:84%
material where that was actually
discussed is very difficult.

00:19:53.882 --> 00:19:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That would be
amazing if we could find that.

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Yeah, I
haven't found that.

00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:01.542 align:middle line:84%
But a friend of mine who
is a sound engineer--

00:20:01.542 --> 00:20:04.990 align:middle line:90%


00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:07.360 align:middle line:84%
he's done studies
in other pyramids

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.300 align:middle line:90%
in terms of the frequencies.

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And their frequencies are
generally harmonically coupled.

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:21.760 align:middle line:84%
The whole series of pyramids
is definitely linked together.

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does all
this do to us today

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:28.000 align:middle line:84%
if your theory is
proven to be correct?

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And it very well may be, but
that it was a power plant.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.070 align:middle line:90%
It is a power plant.

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And that perhaps it was used by
a very advanced civilization,

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:41.740 align:middle line:84%
whether they came from outer
space or not, not the point.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:45.250 align:middle line:84%
But what happens to us
as a society when we

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:47.350 align:middle line:90%
realize that you were correct?

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:50.060 align:middle line:90%


00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: I think the
only way that it

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:56.110 align:middle line:84%
would be globally recognized
that the theory is

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:58.870 align:middle line:84%
correct is if we were
able to replicate it.

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:01.750 align:middle line:90%


00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:06.670 align:middle line:84%
So there's always going to be
some people who are closed off

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:10.590 align:middle line:90%
to the idea, and that's normal.

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:12.580 align:middle line:84%
But I think actually
replicating it--

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:16.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's even more
information coming through.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:20.080 align:middle line:84%
It's not just the Scan
Pyramid project, which

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.320 align:middle line:90%
is a very interesting project.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
amazing, though, as far

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:30.610 align:middle line:84%
as the stakeholders who
are backing that funding.

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:33.160 align:middle line:84%
They're all scientific
institutes--

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.172 align:middle line:90%
high energy physics in Japan.

00:21:36.172 --> 00:21:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
they want to know?

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.790 align:middle line:90%
What do they want to know?

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:44.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: If you talk to a
really wonderful director

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.380 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid,
Ahmed El Guindi,

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.730 align:middle line:84%
people say they are
looking for Khufu's tomb.

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:53.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, right.

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Big discovery that
would be, right?

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:55.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Right.

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:58.450 align:middle line:84%
So everybody is looking
for Khufu's tomb,

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:02.650 align:middle line:84%
but they're throwing
a lot of money at it.

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:05.410 align:middle line:10%
But there's another
area of research

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:08.470 align:middle line:10%
which I find very exciting.

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:12.940 align:middle line:10%
And that is the research
of a physicist at NASA.

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:16.030 align:middle line:84%
His name is Dr.
Friedemann Freund.

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And he has been
conducting research

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:21.710 align:middle line:84%
into earthquake
lights since 1997.

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:25.620 align:middle line:84%
They do give off plasma
lights, they say.

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:28.375 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: And he's actually
studied the underlying physics

00:22:28.375 --> 00:22:32.170 align:middle line:90%
on what actually creates this.

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:39.400 align:middle line:90%
And it comes to be that rock--

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:46.620 align:middle line:84%
granite will-- electrons
will flow if it's stressed.

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't really
take that much movement

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:55.150 align:middle line:84%
in the rock for electrons to
flow and just like a foot stump

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:56.350 align:middle line:90%
would do it.

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:59.410 align:middle line:84%
So it only has to
move an extra little,

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:01.550 align:middle line:84%
and then you've got
electromagnetic flow.

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:07.000 align:middle line:84%
So when he's looking at
the earthquake prediction

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.610 align:middle line:84%
where you can actually-- by
looking at earthquake light,

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:16.090 align:middle line:84%
so the activity of
electromagnetic energy

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:16.965 align:middle line:90%
on these high points.

00:23:16.965 --> 00:23:19.215 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are these plasma
balls we hear so much about?

00:23:19.215 --> 00:23:20.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, that's
a part of it, too.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And I actually addressed
that in my book.

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:26.530 align:middle line:90%
Because when you talk about--

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:30.940 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people look
at them as being UFOs.

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:34.330 align:middle line:84%
I think that
scientists dismiss that

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:40.720 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, it's just
electromagnetic energy,

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:45.400 align:middle line:84%
ionizing gases seeping
through the rock.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.020 align:middle line:90%
And they may be right.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:51.550 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line
is that that electron

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:55.570 align:middle line:84%
flow, that electromagnetic
energy does exist.

00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:57.940 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Since the
publication of your book,

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.670 align:middle line:10%
has there been
any other evidence

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:05.020 align:middle line:10%
to talk about your theories,
the shaft theory that

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:06.440 align:middle line:10%
would help back some of this?

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yes.

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:11.690 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I think the last
one of the times we talked,

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:15.620 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about what
lay behind Gantenbrink's door.

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:16.420 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think that first
exploration was 2002.

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:23.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the
long shaft, right?

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:24.467 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Right.

00:24:24.467 --> 00:24:25.300 align:middle line:90%
It's the long shaft.

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:28.060 align:middle line:84%
It goes from the
queen's chamber.

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Originally, the shaft was
closed off from the chamber.

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.770 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't completed.

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:38.290 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't until 1872.

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:44.140 align:middle line:84%
Wayman Dixon actually discovered
the void behind the wall

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:49.150 align:middle line:84%
and chiseled out the limestone
to open up the shaft.

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And then it wasn't until
1993 when Rudolf Gantenbrink,

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.230 align:middle line:90%
a German robotics engineer--

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:00.910 align:middle line:90%
he built a robot.

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:03.280 align:middle line:90%
They called it Upuaut 2.

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And he sent the robot up
there at the southern shaft.

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And for the first
time in history,

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:12.640 align:middle line:84%
we were able to see
what was at the end

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.673 align:middle line:90%
of this particular shaft.

00:25:14.673 --> 00:25:17.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I guess that's what
they drilled a hole for, too,

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:17.300 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:18.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yes, that came later.

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:22.670 align:middle line:84%
But Gantenbrink first
discovered what they

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:25.460 align:middle line:90%
called the Gantenbrink's door.

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, the shaft is
8 inches square.

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.890 align:middle line:90%
So I mean, a door for what?

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:32.000 align:middle line:90%
A rat or a mouse?

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.590 align:middle line:90%
But it's not a door.

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:35.663 align:middle line:90%
It's just a block.

00:25:35.663 --> 00:25:36.830 align:middle line:90%
In fact, Gantenbrink comes--

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:38.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How long was it?

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:38.510 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Hm?

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:39.802 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How long is the shaft?

00:25:39.802 --> 00:25:40.970 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: About 200 feet.

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:42.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 200 feet?

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yeah.

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:45.308 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there's got
to be a purpose for it.

00:25:45.308 --> 00:25:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, I proposed
in the "Giza Power Plant"

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:52.190 align:middle line:84%
that it delivered chemicals
to the queen's chamber.

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Both the north and south
shaft delivered chemicals

00:25:55.310 --> 00:26:00.470 align:middle line:84%
to the queen's chamber that
mixed in boiled off hydrogen.

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And hydrogen was
used in the process

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:06.235 align:middle line:90%
of generating electricity.

00:26:06.235 --> 00:26:07.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:07.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yeah.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:13.970 align:middle line:84%
There has been two
expeditions of the shafts

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:15.740 align:middle line:90%
in the queen's chamber.

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And in 2002, they
drilled a hole into it.

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:22.050 align:middle line:10%
And what they found--

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:23.210 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They stuck a little
camera through it, right?

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:25.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Yeah, they just--
they sent an endoscope camera.

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:28.640 align:middle line:90%


00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.840 align:middle line:90%
The camera had some limitations.

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:36.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, basically, it
just had a straight shot.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.570 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't look up,
or down, or around,

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:41.180 align:middle line:84%
so it just looked
straight ahead.

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And they showed
another blockage.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:49.490 align:middle line:90%
Now, in 2010, another team--

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:53.370 align:middle line:84%
they built a robot
they called the Djedi.

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:56.340 align:middle line:84%
The one in 2002-- they
called it the Pyramid Rover,

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.520 align:middle line:90%
but the Djedi--

00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:59.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Got better, right?

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Yeah, they had a
little more sophistication.

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And it was able to
articulate a camera

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:11.720 align:middle line:84%
on the backside of this
blockage and look behind.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And so what they
found when they--

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Came back.

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: The camera picked up.

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:23.780 align:middle line:84%
What happened-- the backside
of the block and the metal

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:27.620 align:middle line:84%
fittings that I proposed
were electrodes.

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:30.560 align:middle line:90%
And it's a very unique design.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And so I actually built a model
of the Gantenbrink's door.

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Matched it up?

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.920 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNN: Matched it
up and demonstrated

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.650 align:middle line:10%
how I thought it would work.

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:42.500 align:middle line:90%
And it worked.

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.348 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I did that for
the show "Ancient Aliens."

00:27:45.348 --> 00:27:46.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I saw that part.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Yeah, but
that was interesting.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our colleague,
Graham Hancock,

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:54.170 align:middle line:84%
talks a little bit
about these shafts.

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:55.397 align:middle line:90%
Listen to this.

00:27:55.397 --> 00:27:56.650 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:59.530 align:middle line:84%
- Along a horizontal passage
that leads you to the so-called

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:00.330 align:middle line:90%
queen's chamber.

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:02.372 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what the
builders of these pyramids

00:28:02.372 --> 00:28:03.310 align:middle line:90%
called these chambers.

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:05.920 align:middle line:10%
All these names are
modern attributions.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:08.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's just take a quick look
inside the queen's chamber.

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:12.000 align:middle line:90%


00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.760 align:middle line:10%
There's these
curious little shafts

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.320 align:middle line:10%
in the walls of the
queen's chamber.

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Up until the 1870s, this
shaft was not visible.

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.490 align:middle line:10%
It was covered by
a block of stone.

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:27.150 align:middle line:10%
When they completed the
chamber, they closed it.

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:30.780 align:middle line:10%
But a British freemason
called Wayman Dixon, who'd

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:33.600 align:middle line:10%
noticed that there were shafts
in the chamber above the king's

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.470 align:middle line:10%
chamber, wondered
if there might be

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:36.720 align:middle line:10%
shafts in the queen's chamber.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:39.510 align:middle line:10%
And he went around
tapping the walls.

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:43.020 align:middle line:10%
And he found these hollow
points, cut out the stone.

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:44.850 align:middle line:10%
And sure enough,
there's these shafts.

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:47.310 align:middle line:10%
And my friend, Robert
Bauval, has established

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:50.830 align:middle line:10%
the astronomical connections
with these shafts,

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:55.060 align:middle line:10%
that the queen's chamber shafts
point to the southern shaft.

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:57.640 align:middle line:90%
This one points to Sirius.

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:01.870 align:middle line:10%
And the northern shaft
points to Beta Ursa Minor--

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:06.340 align:middle line:10%
very curious thing,
especially since these shafts

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:09.700 align:middle line:10%
actually do not exit on
the outside of the pyramid.

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:13.396 align:middle line:84%
The ones from the king's chamber
do, but these ones don't.

00:29:13.396 --> 00:29:15.170 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:16.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So these shafts--

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.860 align:middle line:84%
some believe that
they may have been

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:21.870 align:middle line:84%
used to point to star
systems and things like that.

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:24.620 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:29.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: I really
don't agree with that.

00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:32.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's possible
that the designer when

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:35.370 align:middle line:84%
they're designing a building
may put something symbolic

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:36.170 align:middle line:90%
in there.

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:37.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.400 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be
another purpose.

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: But as far as them being
built just for that purpose--

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:47.475 align:middle line:90%
I really don't agree with that.

00:29:47.475 --> 00:29:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what about
the northern shaft?

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:50.800 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
that was used for?

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:51.370 align:middle line:90%
Same thing?

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:52.170 align:middle line:90%
The transfer?

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: In the queen's chambers,
specifically the same thing.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's the other
interesting thing

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:02.290 align:middle line:84%
about the difference
between the metal fittings

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:05.290 align:middle line:84%
that you find in the
northern shaft and those

00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:07.320 align:middle line:84%
that you find in
the southern shaft.

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:10.910 align:middle line:84%
In the southern shaft,
you find that the fittings

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:16.570 align:middle line:84%
are heavily eroded, almost down
to a very, very thin point,

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:21.100 align:middle line:84%
which signifies the use of
some kind of corrosive, which

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:23.070 align:middle line:84%
I actually proposed
that they were

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:26.870 align:middle line:90%
using dilute hydrochloric acid.

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:29.160 align:middle line:84%
In the northern
shaft, you have--

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
they do this stuff?

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: One of the metal
fittings that was--

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:40.290 align:middle line:84%
it looks like it has a
wide white coat on it,

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:42.720 align:middle line:84%
like it was-- been
electroplated.

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And so that makes a lot
of sense when it comes

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:49.600 align:middle line:90%
to the proposed use of them.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.140 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think that's
like smoking gun evidence

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.210 align:middle line:90%
to prove it.

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
thing when you

00:30:56.310 --> 00:31:00.150 align:middle line:84%
look at behind the
Gantenbrink's so-called door

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:04.140 align:middle line:84%
and you look at the electrodes
or the metal fittings

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:09.960 align:middle line:84%
as they come through
the back of the block,

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:15.060 align:middle line:84%
you see corrosion on one of
them and not on the other.

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And so that's like the
poles on a battery.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:19.680 align:middle line:90%
You would have--

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One is used
for certain things.

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Right.

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:26.070 align:middle line:84%
So the actual flow of
electricity from one

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:28.680 align:middle line:90%
to the other creates that.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The
engineering behind this

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:32.110 align:middle line:90%
must have been unbelievable.

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yes.

00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:35.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's very
well thought out,

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:38.220 align:middle line:84%
even down to those
copper fittings, which

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:42.300 align:middle line:84%
it became clear to me
when I saw the evidence

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:45.180 align:middle line:90%
that the Djedi revealed.

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:47.670 align:middle line:84%
It became clear to
me that they had

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:50.670 align:middle line:84%
to have some means of
servicing that area

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:53.550 align:middle line:90%
and replacing those electrodes.

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:58.380 align:middle line:84%
So I'm still waiting
for more discoveries

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:03.540 align:middle line:84%
inside the Great Pyramid, such
as interior passageways where

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:05.940 align:middle line:84%
maintenance workers
could go up there.

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And then also, behind
that so-called door,

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:15.210 align:middle line:84%
you have these marks that
are painted on the floor.

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which represent
what, in your opinion?

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yeah.

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:23.340 align:middle line:84%
To me, they are
electrical symbols.

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:27.300 align:middle line:84%
You have a very
clear image of what

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:32.620 align:middle line:84%
we call a twisted pair where
you have a cable and two

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:34.380 align:middle line:90%
wires coming out of it.

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:35.587 align:middle line:90%
And then you have--

00:32:35.587 --> 00:32:36.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hooked up to something?

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yeah, exactly.

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And then even
identifying the polarity

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:47.610 align:middle line:84%
of the wiring for
that particular door.

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does the old
Egyptian antiquities director

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Zahi Hawass, who is
not part of it anymore,

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:56.580 align:middle line:90%
know about all this stuff, too?

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:58.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: I mean, the
information is available.

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:02.780 align:middle line:84%
I haven't had any really
in-depth conversations

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:07.070 align:middle line:90%
with Zahi about the technology.

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:12.178 align:middle line:84%
He's always presented
a negative--

00:33:12.178 --> 00:33:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: About anything--

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:14.262 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: --opinion about--

00:33:14.262 --> 00:33:15.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --beyond

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.930 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:19.770 align:middle line:90%
Egyptians' tombs.

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: And he is far from
not being involved now.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.528 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he is definitely.

00:33:25.528 --> 00:33:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Has he gotten back in?

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:31.175 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Yeah, he still
has a lot of authority.

00:33:31.175 --> 00:33:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
there was a moment

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:36.270 align:middle line:84%
after Mubarak got tossed out
that Zahi's career was over.

00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:38.490 align:middle line:84%
So he's made his way
back in again, huh?

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:40.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Yeah.

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:43.050 align:middle line:84%
I think the Egyptians
and a lot of people

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:47.470 align:middle line:84%
see his value in
attracting tourism.

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:49.273 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
fluid switch, Chris?

00:33:49.273 --> 00:33:50.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: That's what
we're talking about.

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:51.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is what it is?

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:51.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Down to the green door.

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:52.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:54.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, the fluid switch.

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:58.740 align:middle line:84%
Because the way it
functions is in order

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:05.856 align:middle line:84%
to be able to determine or
be assured that you have

00:34:05.856 --> 00:34:09.489 align:middle line:84%
a particular rate of
flow into the chamber,

00:34:09.489 --> 00:34:11.905 align:middle line:84%
then you need to know what
the head pressure is, so--

00:34:11.905 --> 00:34:12.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:14.130 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: If the level of the
fluid gets down too far,

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:22.600 align:middle line:84%
then your flow is going to
be diminished a little bit.

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And your
power goes down.

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Right.

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:28.800 align:middle line:84%
So when the fluid
drops and then it

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.620 align:middle line:84%
breaks continuity between
the two electrodes,

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:37.389 align:middle line:84%
then that signal for the pumping
of more fluid into the shaft.

00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:40.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where would the
fluid come from originally?

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:42.060 align:middle line:90%
Would they bring it in?

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Yeah, I mean, they'd
pump it up from a chamber

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:48.389 align:middle line:90%
underneath, probably.

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:51.443 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A tank
full of it, maybe?

00:34:51.443 --> 00:34:55.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: If you go on the east
side of the Great Pyramid,

00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:58.470 align:middle line:84%
there are some very
deep shafts going down.

00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:03.150 align:middle line:84%
There's one close to the
pyramid that is very curious.

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:06.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's been
fully investigated yet.

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:11.630 align:middle line:84%
But it's a shaft that
has two sides to it.

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:13.290 align:middle line:90%
And that's out on the east side.

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And then on the south side, you
have some vertical shafts, too.

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:18.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's possible
that they may have

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:22.380 align:middle line:84%
been able to just feed the
chemical from the outside

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:25.080 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Pyramid.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And it would be directed through
conduits from the outside.

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:33.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the Scan
Pyramid mission, Chris?

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:39.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: That's a consortium
of scientists or scientific

00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:44.052 align:middle line:84%
institutions that are using
muons to detect voyage--

00:35:44.052 --> 00:35:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's what
you were mentioning?

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.457 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Yeah, within
the Great Pyramid.

00:35:47.457 --> 00:35:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they ongoing
with this mission?

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: They're ongoing.

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:50.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:51.230 align:middle line:90%
I was there.

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:57.870 align:middle line:84%
An interesting story--
in 2019, I led a tour.

00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:02.250 align:middle line:90%
And I had an aerospace engineer.

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And he's with some other folks,
about three or four of them.

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:09.270 align:middle line:90%
We were at Aswan.

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:11.190 align:middle line:10%
And they decided
that they wanted

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:14.430 align:middle line:10%
to cut their visit
to Aswan short,

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:16.620 align:middle line:10%
because the Red Hot
Chili Peppers were

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:18.457 align:middle line:10%
playing at the Giza Plateau.

00:36:18.457 --> 00:36:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They wanted
to see that, huh?

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: So they wanted to go
see the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately for them, el-Sisi,
the president, was in Aswan,

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.200 align:middle line:90%
and security was really tight.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And so their flight
arrived late.

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:37.170 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't
get to the plateau

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:41.900 align:middle line:90%
until the end of the concert.

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:44.660 align:middle line:84%
But the director of
the Great Pyramid,

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:49.100 align:middle line:84%
who is just a wonderful,
wonderful man--

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:50.540 align:middle line:90%
he felt sorry for Eric.

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And he said, hey,
the Scan Pyramid

00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:54.830 align:middle line:84%
team are going to
be here tomorrow

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:56.790 align:middle line:90%
if you want to join them.

00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:59.298 align:middle line:90%
And I'll introduce you to them.

00:36:59.298 --> 00:37:00.590 align:middle line:90%
Eric says, yeah, I'll be there.

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:02.930 align:middle line:90%
So he's up there at 7 o'clock.

00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And then I actually
assisted them

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:08.990 align:middle line:84%
in repairing some
of the equipment.

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:11.060 align:middle line:84%
They had some wiring
issues, I guess.

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:12.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got
some video I want

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:15.530 align:middle line:84%
you to look at about the Ancient
Architects channel explaining

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:17.420 align:middle line:84%
more about what scientists
have been doing.

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:18.380 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:21.410 align:middle line:10%
- Scientists have discovered
that the Great Pyramid of Egypt

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:23.690 align:middle line:10%
concentrates
electromagnetic energy

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:26.570 align:middle line:10%
into its internal chambers
and below its base.

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:28.460 align:middle line:10%
And now, scientists
are wondering

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:31.580 align:middle line:10%
if this incredible
discovery can be recreated

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:35.360 align:middle line:10%
on a nanoscale size, which could
lead to more efficient sensors

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.780 align:middle line:10%
and solar cells.

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:40.930 align:middle line:10%
Its ability to concentrate
electric and magnetic energy

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:44.380 align:middle line:10%
was discovered by a team of
researchers led by scientists

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:49.370 align:middle line:10%
from ITMO University in the
Russian city of St. Petersburg.

00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:51.100 align:middle line:84%
They created a
model of the pyramid

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:53.920 align:middle line:84%
to measure its
electromagnetic response.

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:57.370 align:middle line:84%
It was used to see how wave
energy is scattered or absorbed

00:37:57.370 --> 00:37:58.390 align:middle line:90%
by the pyramid.

00:37:58.390 --> 00:38:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And the group
tested interactions

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:03.160 align:middle line:84%
with waves of resonant length
ranging from 200 meters

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:07.300 align:middle line:84%
to 600 meters Dr.
Andrey Evlyukhin,

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:10.270 align:middle line:84%
scientific supervisor and
coordinator of the research,

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:12.310 align:middle line:84%
said Egyptian
pyramids have always

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:14.050 align:middle line:90%
attracted great attention.

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:17.300 align:middle line:84%
We as scientists were
interested in them as well.

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.260 align:middle line:84%
So we decided to look at the
Great Pyramid as a particle,

00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:23.110 align:middle line:84%
dissipating radio
waves resonantly.

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:25.550 align:middle line:10%
Given the lack of reliable
information about the pyramid's

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:27.400 align:middle line:10%
properties, the
team says they had

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:29.590 align:middle line:10%
to fill in the blanks
for some factors.

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:31.720 align:middle line:10%
Andrey continued, we
assumed that there

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:35.200 align:middle line:10%
was no unknown cavities inside,
and that the building material

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:37.450 align:middle line:10%
has the properties of
an ordinary limestone

00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:40.960 align:middle line:10%
and is evenly distributed
in and out of the pyramid.

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:44.290 align:middle line:10%
With these assumptions made,
we obtained interesting results

00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:48.070 align:middle line:10%
that can find important
practical applications.

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:51.790 align:middle line:10%
The scientists used multiple
analysis, a method widely used

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:53.500 align:middle line:10%
in physics to study
the interaction

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:56.860 align:middle line:10%
between a complex object
and an electromagnetic field

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:58.900 align:middle line:10%
to reveal how the
pyramid concentrates

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:02.440 align:middle line:10%
electromagnetic energy into
its underground chambers.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.420 align:middle line:10%
But still, the
mainstream media are

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:06.250 align:middle line:10%
reporting that these
new findings are

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:09.130 align:middle line:10%
a quirk of the design,
an accidental byproduct

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:12.820 align:middle line:10%
of the so-called ancient tomb,
which I must disagree with.

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:13.680 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:15.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A quirk of the design?

00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:16.810 align:middle line:90%
How can that be?

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:20.880 align:middle line:90%


00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:21.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: I don't know.

00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:24.245 align:middle line:84%
The things that come out
of some people's mouth is--

00:39:24.245 --> 00:39:26.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't think you
agree with that, do you?

00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:27.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: No.

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:28.050 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:33.795 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think the study is
valid, and it's significant.

00:39:33.795 --> 00:39:38.730 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly very
significant to my work.

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And after that study
came out, I was

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:44.530 align:middle line:90%
receiving many, many emails.

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:47.520 align:middle line:84%
So, well, it looks like
you've been vindicated.

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I say,
well, not necessarily.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.290 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:55.090 align:middle line:90%
Not fully.

00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:58.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is a part
of it that excites people

00:39:58.970 --> 00:40:00.730 align:middle line:84%
and if it brings
people's attention.

00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:02.840 align:middle line:84%
But the real nuts
and bolts of it

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:11.655 align:middle line:84%
are in the design of the
structure, the acoustics,

00:40:11.655 --> 00:40:15.280 align:middle line:84%
the movement of sound,
the creation of gases,

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:21.100 align:middle line:84%
and that whole system
working together,

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:27.160 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic signature
of pyramids in general.

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:28.570 align:middle line:90%
That's not surprising at all.

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:31.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why
anybody would deny that.

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How much, in
terms of a percent,

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:36.370 align:middle line:84%
do you think the
pyramids that are there

00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:39.010 align:middle line:84%
to prevent earthquakes
in that region

00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:41.020 align:middle line:84%
and that's their primary
mission and source?

00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:46.730 align:middle line:90%


00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: I think if we
were to go down that path,

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:53.550 align:middle line:84%
it would be a
primary focus for us.

00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:55.880 align:middle line:84%
When you look at all
the pyramids in Egypt,

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:58.430 align:middle line:84%
you have many different
interior designs.

00:40:58.430 --> 00:41:00.830 align:middle line:84%
But fundamentally,
what they have is

00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:02.040 align:middle line:90%
they're a pyramid shape.

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And they have a downward
shaft to a bedrock chain,

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:10.410 align:middle line:84%
but that's typical
for all of them.

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And so I think the
fundamental purpose

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:20.720 align:middle line:84%
for harmonizing the
plates of the planet

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:23.660 align:middle line:84%
is the most
significant part of it.

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And also, because
it's using harmonics.

00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually working
with Earth energies.

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:37.280 align:middle line:84%
Then the people in
the area are going

00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:39.380 align:middle line:90%
to be affected by it, too.

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Because we're all--
how we resonate,

00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:46.180 align:middle line:84%
we resonate with
frequencies, too.

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have seismologists
talked to you about this,

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:53.300 align:middle line:84%
about this possibility that the
power source of the pyramids

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:55.377 align:middle line:84%
is preventing earthquakes
in that region?

00:41:55.377 --> 00:41:56.210 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember a--

00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:56.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: No.

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.985 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --big
earthquake in that area.

00:41:57.985 --> 00:42:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Well, I
mean, the pyramids

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:03.020 align:middle line:84%
are not functioning as
they used to right now.

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, so it's
like dead right now.

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Yeah, they're
shut down right now,

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:10.760 align:middle line:90%
but there has been some studies.

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:14.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Russians
did some studies

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:20.480 align:middle line:84%
on trying to obviate
earthquakes by actually drilling

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:26.220 align:middle line:84%
a hole into a subduction--
near a subduction zone

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:31.730 align:middle line:84%
and letting off many, many
explosions or charges down.

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And they found that they
were able to move the plates

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:39.388 align:middle line:90%
smoothly over the subduction.

00:42:39.388 --> 00:42:40.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tectonic plates.

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:40.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: Right.

00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:41.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:47.510 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, rather than stay combined
and then suddenly break loose.

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:50.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we know enough about
the Great Pyramids to power

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:51.870 align:middle line:90%
it up again?

00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:52.700 align:middle line:90%
Can we do that?

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:55.710 align:middle line:90%


00:42:55.710 --> 00:43:00.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: I don't think the
Great Pyramid in Egypt--

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:02.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we
could get that built.

00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We couldn't
get it running again.

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: No, I think
we would have to--

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:09.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like a
car engine that's gone.

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: --use that as a model,
and work out the science,

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:14.660 align:middle line:90%
and build our own.

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:15.910 align:middle line:90%
That's what I would recommend.

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:18.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you look at
all the many pyramids around

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:21.540 align:middle line:84%
the planet, do they all
have, in your opinion,

00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:23.030 align:middle line:90%
the same purpose--

00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:25.862 align:middle line:84%
they're power sources
to prevent earthquakes?

00:43:25.862 --> 00:43:28.550 align:middle line:90%


00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:30.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: I think that's
a little overly broad.

00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:35.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can't really say
with complete confidence

00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:38.230 align:middle line:90%
that that's the case.

00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:44.500 align:middle line:84%
They do seem to have this conic
connection with each other.

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:48.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look at the
way they are positioned

00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:52.540 align:middle line:84%
and their alignment with other
structures, other pyramids,

00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:55.810 align:middle line:84%
and even standing
stones, it does

00:43:55.810 --> 00:43:59.350 align:middle line:84%
seem like this
ancient culture were

00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:01.690 align:middle line:84%
very knowledgeable
of Earth energies

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:03.310 align:middle line:90%
and working with Earth energies.

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:04.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All around the planet.

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:05.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: All around the planet.

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:05.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Somebody taught this.

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: And they also had a high
level of manufacturing prowess,

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:12.130 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:17.680 align:middle line:84%
So for acquiring and cutting
stone very precisely,

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.060 align:middle line:90%
they were masters at that.

00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If ETs came
down and said, look,

00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:24.310 align:middle line:84%
this is a ley line here, put
them here, here, here, here,

00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:27.760 align:middle line:84%
here, they'd know
how to do that right?

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:30.220 align:middle line:90%
The extraterrestrials?

00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:31.450 align:middle line:90%
Simple.

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: We may assume
that, but I don't know.

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:40.060 align:middle line:84%
I think if they
had the instruments

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:45.130 align:middle line:84%
where they could actually
determine or detect

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:49.940 align:middle line:84%
where the power places
are, then they can say,

00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:53.920 align:middle line:84%
yes, you'd maximize the
output of this system

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:59.500 align:middle line:84%
if you placed it in
this spot like at Giza.

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:03.760 align:middle line:10%
One of the things about Earth
energy is earthquake lights.

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:08.890 align:middle line:10%
There has been a study
done on the placement

00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:12.693 align:middle line:10%
of old monasteries and old
cathedrals, that they seem--

00:45:12.693 --> 00:45:14.360 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And they run
on acoustics, too.

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:20.800 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNN: Yeah, they seem to be
located in areas where there is

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:22.490 align:middle line:10%
an abundance of this--

00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:23.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:25.730 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNN: --terrestrial
energy being gathered.

00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're on to
something, Mr. Dunn.

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:30.310 align:middle line:90%
You have been for years.

00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Yeah, I haven't
let that tiger go yet,

00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:34.490 align:middle line:90%
but it's been quite a ride.

00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:36.912 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are you
working on now these days?

00:45:36.912 --> 00:45:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: I'm actually working
on an old theater in Danville,

00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:40.190 align:middle line:90%
Illinois.

00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:41.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, are you?

00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:44.275 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNN: Yeah, we restored
a classic opera house.

00:45:44.275 --> 00:45:45.400 align:middle line:90%
It was built in 1884.

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How many seats?

00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:48.333 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: 900 seats.

00:45:48.333 --> 00:45:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chris, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:51.490 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNN: My pleasure.

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:52.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Chris Dunn.

00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:55.330 align:middle line:10%
We can always count on Chris to
bring us the latest information

00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:57.370 align:middle line:10%
on the mysterious
pyramids, which

00:45:57.370 --> 00:45:59.440 align:middle line:10%
continue to reveal
their secrets to those

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:01.210 align:middle line:10%
who know where to look.

00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:02.710 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
