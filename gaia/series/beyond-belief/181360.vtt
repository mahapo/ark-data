00:00:24.389 --> 00:00:26.180 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.030 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory with
our special guests

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.110 align:middle line:10%
tonight, Bill Foss.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Bill is an expert on
the Akashic Records.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.970 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
his book is "How

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.770 align:middle line:90%
to Read the Akashic Records."

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.580 align:middle line:84%
He's an international
speaker, author, and healer.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And, Bill, welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BILL FOSS: Thank you, George.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for having
me back on the show.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
always good to have.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.050 align:middle line:10%
I had great response the
last time you were on with me

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.220 align:middle line:10%
a couple of years ago.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.700 align:middle line:10%
>>FOSS: Excellent, excellent.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.860 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How did you
get involved in studying

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.985 align:middle line:10%
the Akashic records?

00:00:52.985 --> 00:00:54.610 align:middle line:10%
>>FOSS: That's an
interesting question.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.140 align:middle line:10%
As I started what I call my wake
program or my re-remembrance

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.780 align:middle line:10%
of who I was as a soul,
when I found the records

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.670 align:middle line:10%
in the studies of yoga,
Taichi, energy work, healing,

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.880 align:middle line:10%
all of this and intuitive
work, also studying

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.560 align:middle line:10%
the ascended
masters, ascension--

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.150 align:middle line:10%
and I wanted to know
as much as possible.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And when I found the Akashic
records, it was a natural.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.480 align:middle line:84%
I started waking up into
things that I already knew.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.405 align:middle line:10%
It's as if I was studying all
of this and I already knew it.

00:01:28.405 --> 00:01:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, there are
some people out there

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.280 align:middle line:84%
that are saying, what the
heck are the Akashic records.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.750 align:middle line:90%
So explain that.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.490 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: The Akashic records
is an aetheric language--

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.930 align:middle line:84%
it's an actual place as well
as a modern day modality--

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.570 align:middle line:90%
of healing and intuitive work.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.170 align:middle line:10%
It has the imprint,
the energetic imprint

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.450 align:middle line:10%
of all of your past lifetimes.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.150 align:middle line:10%
And you have a
personal book of life

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.610 align:middle line:10%
that's stored in the
aetheric field of the planet,

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.560 align:middle line:10%
in the Akashic records.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And you can access this
during your lifetime.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And it will give you a
deeper knowing of who you are

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.370 align:middle line:90%
and why you're here.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When I was a kid
going through Catholic school

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.900 align:middle line:84%
and Catechism classes,
they would always

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.730 align:middle line:90%
talk about "the book."

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.530 align:middle line:84%
That when you died, there'd
be that review in "the book."

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.895 align:middle line:90%
Is this "the book?"

00:02:18.895 --> 00:02:20.350 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: That's "the book."

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.762 align:middle line:84%
It's also referred to in
the "Book of Revelations."

00:02:23.762 --> 00:02:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who catalogs
the things in the book?

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.840 align:middle line:90%
Who puts your record in there?

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: You do with the help
of your spirit guides and life

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.160 align:middle line:90%
events.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.710 align:middle line:84%
So you're given options
during your life about--

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.630 align:middle line:84%
and your response,
sometimes, your reaction,

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.710 align:middle line:84%
which is more emotional, or
your response on a soul level

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:45.910 align:middle line:90%
guides your life.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.195 align:middle line:84%
And your soul is guiding
through your body

00:02:49.195 --> 00:02:50.570 align:middle line:84%
through the journey
of your life.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And there are certain things
in the records that are set up.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.460 align:middle line:90%
Much of your life is free will.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And other things in
the records, there

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.810 align:middle line:84%
are some things that are set up
as lessons or lifetime events

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:11.080 align:middle line:84%
for you to experience, such
as marriage or learning

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.540 align:middle line:84%
on some deep level
or great level.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there any inaccuracy
about the book at all?

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.490 align:middle line:84%
Or is it everything
you've done in your life?

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: There's literally
no inaccuracy with the book

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.190 align:middle line:90%
because it's--

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.140 align:middle line:90%
the book is not going to have--

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.090 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to be telling
a fictional story for you.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.950 align:middle line:84%
The book is literally going
to be your truest self.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.470 align:middle line:84%
So if you connect
into your records,

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.720 align:middle line:84%
if you connect into your book
of life, you're going to get--

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.250 align:middle line:90%
it's like looking in the mirror.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.680 align:middle line:90%
The mirror doesn't lie.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing about this mirror

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.280 align:middle line:90%
is it's a mirror for the soul.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And when you look into it,
you're actually able to write,

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.690 align:middle line:84%
you're actually able to create,
to heal, to clear yourself,

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.245 align:middle line:90%
to create a great life.

00:04:02.245 --> 00:04:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you rewrite
it or is it what it is?

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: It is but,
again, it is what it is.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.940 align:middle line:90%
You are who you are.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.750 align:middle line:10%
But that being said, some
of the older or simpler ways

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.769 align:middle line:10%
of looking at life
and enlightenment--

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.310 align:middle line:10%
some teachers would
say, well, you're

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.476 align:middle line:10%
going to become enlightened.

00:04:23.476 --> 00:04:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's that
and there you are.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.080 align:middle line:90%
And that's the way it is.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.920 align:middle line:84%
But with the
Akashic records, you

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.050 align:middle line:84%
can literally
transform yourself.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.970 align:middle line:84%
You can keep going as
far as you want to go.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you only access the
Akashic records when you die?

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: That's a great
question, George.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.020 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
main reasons why

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm sharing information
about the records

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.740 align:middle line:90%
worldwide at this time.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And the records are very
important for each of us

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.630 align:middle line:90%
to access.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.290 align:middle line:84%
We're all going to access it,
and go directly to our records

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.450 align:middle line:84%
to the Akashic
records when we die,

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.380 align:middle line:84%
when we have our
appointment with eternity.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.560 align:middle line:84%
If you access during the
middle of your life or any time

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.900 align:middle line:84%
while you're in
physical human form,

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.330 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
ahead of the curve.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.100 align:middle line:84%
There is something very special
about being in human form.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.890 align:middle line:10%
We're here in this world
and we're on the other side.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.920 align:middle line:84%
After you pass, you're
just on the other side.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.700 align:middle line:84%
So you're more just
of a yin energy.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.720 align:middle line:84%
When you're here and
there, it's like a balance.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.800 align:middle line:90%
There's a certain power.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And there's a certain
magic or specialty

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.537 align:middle line:90%
to being in human form.

00:05:38.537 --> 00:05:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bill, as you know,
I'm on the History Channel's

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.910 align:middle line:90%
"Ancient Aliens" quite often.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And they had a segment
on the Akashic records.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.240 align:middle line:10%
>>ROBERT CLOTWORTHY: This idea
of an otherworldly repository

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.620 align:middle line:10%
of cosmic information is most
commonly referred to today

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.890 align:middle line:10%
as the Akashic record.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.330 align:middle line:10%
The term was coined in
1883 by author Alfred Percy

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.190 align:middle line:10%
Sinnett in his book
"Esoteric Buddhism."

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.500 align:middle line:84%
In it, he describes
how according

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.010 align:middle line:84%
to eastern philosophy,
universal records physically

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.650 align:middle line:84%
exist in the ever
pervasive realm known

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.110 align:middle line:84%
as the Akasha, which
can be accessed

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.940 align:middle line:90%
by enlightened individuals.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.960 align:middle line:90%


00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Akashic is a Sanskrit word.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.110 align:middle line:90%
It means "the sky."

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:32.250 align:middle line:84%
So Akashic records can be
considered as cosmic knowledge.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.420 align:middle line:84%
So it is belonging
to the cosmos.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.995 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
written in the sky.

00:06:36.995 --> 00:06:40.430 align:middle line:84%
It's not belonging
to human beings.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.820 align:middle line:84%
You simply cannot go and bring
it in a sense a tangible form.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.830 align:middle line:84%
It's something that can be
accessed through your mind,

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.450 align:middle line:84%
through your brain
power, through

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.695 align:middle line:90%
your spiritual wavelength.

00:06:52.695 --> 00:06:55.670 align:middle line:90%


00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>> The Akashic field, it's the
immeasurable potential of all

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.840 align:middle line:90%
that was, is, and will ever be.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it appears
that these records,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:11.420 align:middle line:84%
the Akashic records have an
influence on what you've done

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.430 align:middle line:90%
but also what you might do.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:19.710 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Yes, yes, it's literally
the past, present, and future.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.310 align:middle line:84%
So on the other side,
there's no linear time

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.670 align:middle line:84%
as we know from the higher
studies in quantum physics.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.460 align:middle line:84%
Everything is more
on a quantum level.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.350 align:middle line:84%
They're literally-- when
you go into the records,

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.510 align:middle line:84%
we have done things
in past lives.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And we will have future events
that we will be involved with.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:42.590 align:middle line:10%
And we can write--

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:45.200 align:middle line:10%
we're writing in
that book again as we

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.060 align:middle line:10%
have these future responses,
these possibilities

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.440 align:middle line:10%
for future response.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.130 align:middle line:10%
When you get into
a place where you

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.110 align:middle line:10%
know who you are and
the energy is streaming

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.330 align:middle line:10%
through you like it's
streaming to the records,

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:04.070 align:middle line:10%
you will literally have the
dynamic to stream energy

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:08.550 align:middle line:10%
out along the timelines
past and future.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:13.280 align:middle line:84%
So while it might
not change the event,

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.200 align:middle line:84%
it will bring a new
energy to the event.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.000 align:middle line:90%
And it will heal.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If someone
is a bad person,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.330 align:middle line:84%
a serial killer, what
will their records look

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:28.160 align:middle line:84%
like compared to somebody
who's lived a pretty good life?

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.100 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: They could be quite--

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.760 align:middle line:90%
they could be quite similar.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.110 align:middle line:84%
Those two people,
those two individuals

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:39.679 align:middle line:84%
could be working on
the same lessons.

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:46.490 align:middle line:84%
They could be-- such as love or
the specialness of human life,

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:53.460 align:middle line:84%
learning what are all of the
parameters around life itself.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there different
levels of the Akashic records?

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: There sure are George?

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:03.930 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the questions that
I run across from time to time.

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:07.320 align:middle line:84%
There is a-- not many
people know this,

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.200 align:middle line:84%
but there is a fifth
dimensional level.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain that.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: The actual Akashic
records is located,

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:20.260 align:middle line:84%
to my knowing, in
between dimensions,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.760 align:middle line:84%
in between the 10th
and the 11th dimension

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:27.230 align:middle line:84%
and the 11th and
the 12th dimension.

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:31.950 align:middle line:84%
The astral plane is the Grand
Central Station, if you will,

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:35.540 align:middle line:84%
of all spirits that are
connecting with us and also

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.090 align:middle line:90%
our psychic activity.

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:40.940 align:middle line:84%
There has been--
there is a version

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:46.850 align:middle line:84%
of the Akashic records set up
for people who want to just

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:48.930 align:middle line:90%
be more of a novice with it.

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.950 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody is
dabbling with mysticism--

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.994 align:middle line:84%
maybe there are people
that are practicing magic,

00:09:53.994 --> 00:09:55.910 align:middle line:84%
and they don't really
know what they're doing.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.430 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:02.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everything has its
purpose in us waking up,

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.910 align:middle line:84%
but there are some
people that aren't

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.960 align:middle line:84%
quite ready to go into
those higher levels

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.110 align:middle line:84%
where the Akashic
records are protected.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.030 align:middle line:10%
And if they're just
playing around,

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:16.100 align:middle line:10%
they're going to be guided to
more of an elementary template

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.120 align:middle line:10%
of the records.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does every
living being, person,

>>NOORY: And since

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:29.900 align:middle line:90%

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Yes, every
single moment.

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:36.440 align:middle line:10%
And every sin-- you and
I and every other person

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.840 align:middle line:10%
on the planet, we
have a thin cord

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.270 align:middle line:10%
as we know that's
connected up to heaven.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:43.809 align:middle line:84%
This goes directly
into our books of life.

00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this your astral
cord you're talking about?

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes, yes.

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:48.595 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
severed when you die?

00:10:48.595 --> 00:10:51.830 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Yes, yes, so you
follow that back up--

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.930 align:middle line:84%
actually you follow
that cord back up,

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.790 align:middle line:90%
and you go into the records.

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:57.650 align:middle line:90%
So when we're going--

00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:02.090 align:middle line:84%
and we mentioned astral earlier,
when you go into the records

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:05.120 align:middle line:84%
or you travel up, we
travel past or we travel

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.550 align:middle line:90%
through the astral realm.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As a
living human being,

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:13.980 align:middle line:84%
what benefit is that
to us living if we

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.960 align:middle line:90%
know about the Akashic records?

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.890 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: When you know
about the dynamic of it

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:25.780 align:middle line:84%
understand that reincarnation
is second nature.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:29.860 align:middle line:84%
You understand that
you are a divine soul,

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:37.720 align:middle line:84%
that you have the possibility
to learn, to heal,

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.600 align:middle line:84%
you know yourself at the
greatest level possible

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.930 align:middle line:84%
as you continue to open
and expand into this.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:47.560 align:middle line:10%
There are many dynamics of
the Akashic records that

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:52.540 align:middle line:10%
are hidden that have great
opportunities for humanity

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:56.920 align:middle line:10%
and individuals to
open their intuition,

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.860 align:middle line:10%
to create the best life
possible for their selves,

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.649 align:middle line:10%
and to heal others, to be
of service to the world.

00:12:03.649 --> 00:12:05.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you
talk about healing,

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.360 align:middle line:84%
and, Bill, you're
a healer, do you

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.870 align:middle line:84%
need to access the Akashic
records for individuals if you

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:12.790 align:middle line:90%
attempt to heal them?

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: I find that many
healers are, including myself,

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:23.110 align:middle line:84%
we're accessing the Akasha
continually whether we know it

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.950 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:28.850 align:middle line:84%
So we might-- even
in everyday life,

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:30.940 align:middle line:84%
if we have an intuitive
thought or a vision

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:35.170 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes dreams, we're
connected there as well.

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:39.110 align:middle line:10%
With healers, they're actually--

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:42.910 align:middle line:10%
anyone from a massage
therapist to an energy worker,

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:44.950 align:middle line:10%
we're all getting
intuitive messages

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.320 align:middle line:10%
about the person we're
interacting with.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:52.990 align:middle line:10%
And if we go in and connect
with that person's records--

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:56.830 align:middle line:10%
and that is where were
granted permission

00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:00.430 align:middle line:10%
because that person has
come to us for healing then

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:05.230 align:middle line:10%
we get a deep insight
about which creative level

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:08.920 align:middle line:10%
or which direction to go in when
we're working with that person.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you die, Bill,
is there some spirit that is

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:13.710 align:middle line:84%
looking at the records
with you that goes--

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:17.230 align:middle line:90%
"Oh, George, back in 1972--

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.490 align:middle line:90%
no, no, no."

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:20.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is all in
there like that?

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Well, I wasn't going
to say anything George, but--

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've access
my records, haven't you?

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.270 align:middle line:90%
It was '73 actually.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:27.520 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: We'll talk about that.

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:32.050 align:middle line:90%


00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:33.800 align:middle line:90%
You have guides.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:34.600 align:middle line:90%
I have guides.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.550 align:middle line:90%
We all have guides--

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:42.470 align:middle line:84%
angelics, family
members, loved ones.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.312 align:middle line:84%
People that we may have even
forgotten about in our life,

00:13:45.312 --> 00:13:46.520 align:middle line:90%
and we get to the other side.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.400 align:middle line:84%
It can even be a family
member or a loved

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.172 align:middle line:90%
one from a past life.

00:13:50.172 --> 00:13:51.880 align:middle line:84%
When you go to the
other side and you go,

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.610 align:middle line:90%
"Oh, my gosh, there you are."

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And that person,
or those guides,

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.830 align:middle line:90%
will help you to transition.

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:03.820 align:middle line:84%
It's been often said
that a childbirth can

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:05.710 align:middle line:90%
be a traumatic experience.

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes passing back
into the other side

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.350 align:middle line:84%
can be traumatic for
some people because they

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:15.700 align:middle line:84%
take their mind field and their
emotional field with them.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:20.080 align:middle line:84%
So your astral body goes
with you to the other side.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.870 align:middle line:84%
It's George or
Bill or anyone else

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:26.380 align:middle line:84%
out there going to the
other side as their self

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:30.400 align:middle line:84%
before that astral body
is finally absorbed back

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.870 align:middle line:90%
into the soul field.

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And you become that
celestial being again.

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And then you're off
to your next journey.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
come across a situation

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:45.970 align:middle line:84%
with the Akashic records where
the records were inaccurate,

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.170 align:middle line:90%
the wrong person?

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:48.625 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: No.

00:14:48.625 --> 00:14:49.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's always right.

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:51.640 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: No, it's always right.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:55.720 align:middle line:10%
The closest thing that
there could be to that

00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:02.200 align:middle line:10%
is a walk in or a soul that
comes in and takes over

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.100 align:middle line:10%
for an individual.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that an
individual is connected

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:10.550 align:middle line:84%
with multiple people in a
family or a soul grouping,

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.370 align:middle line:84%
and there is
something that person

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.620 align:middle line:84%
has to accomplish
that's going to affect

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:18.580 align:middle line:84%
multiple people or even one
person's life for a very

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.100 align:middle line:90%
important task or mission.

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Then if that person is
going to expire in some way

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:28.210 align:middle line:90%
or be moved out of the way--

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:34.720 align:middle line:84%
sometimes when a person goes
to try to commit suicide,

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:39.040 align:middle line:84%
and there can be a walk in or a
celestial being, sometimes even

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.590 align:middle line:84%
an alien soul,
will come in that's

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:43.960 align:middle line:84%
divinely guided by divine
intelligence to come in

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.910 align:middle line:84%
and says, we are
taking this over.

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:48.790 align:middle line:90%
We are taking over this body.

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:50.470 align:middle line:90%
And then there will still be--

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:53.950 align:middle line:84%
that person still has their
memories and the body-spirit

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:58.510 align:middle line:84%
of being that person, but
there's a new lease on life.

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:01.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Edgar Cayce, the late
American prophet, of course,

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:04.090 align:middle line:84%
would tap into the
Akashic records often.

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And he believed
that some of them

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.650 align:middle line:84%
had to do with Atlantis,
the lost continent.

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:09.730 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes.

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:13.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Probably the most astounding
historical readings Cayce gave

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.770 align:middle line:10%
had to do with the
lost land of Atlantis.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Atlantis from Edgar Cayce's
perspective was the first great

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.130 align:middle line:90%
Eden on the earth.

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:26.920 align:middle line:84%
It predates the
Eden that we know

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.320 align:middle line:84%
of between the
Tigris and Euphrates,

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:31.840 align:middle line:90%
the Eden of Adam and Eve.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Cayce saw Atlantis
as a massive continent

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.370 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
the Atlantic Ocean.

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:41.560 align:middle line:84%
At the time, the individuals
that populated the area

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:46.000 align:middle line:84%
had a deep understanding of
the forces of the universe

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.180 align:middle line:84%
and could actually harness
some of these powers

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:53.830 align:middle line:84%
to use devices, such as
flying machines and crystals

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:54.946 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:16:54.946 --> 00:16:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>> But according
to the readings,

00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:00.150 align:middle line:84%
the Atlanteans abused
their power over nature.

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And Atlantis disappeared
in a cataclysmic disaster

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:06.530 align:middle line:90%
some 10,000 years ago.

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:08.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That is amazing
how the records would

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.450 align:middle line:90%
illustrate something like that.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:11.800 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: It truly is.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: His ability to
tap into it was uncanny.

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:16.940 align:middle line:90%
Do you have that same ability?

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:18.349 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: I do.

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that comes up for
me continually in my visions,

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:27.790 align:middle line:84%
readings with others,
and my personal dreams

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:31.480 align:middle line:84%
are remembrances of
being in Atlantis.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And so the structures, the
energy, the happenings--

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:38.720 align:middle line:90%
there were some amazing things.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.880 align:middle line:84%
It was an amazing
time for humanity.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.140 align:middle line:84%
We were all connected
telepathically.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:46.870 align:middle line:84%
The frequencies of
the Earth were so high

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:51.730 align:middle line:84%
at that time, the aethers, that
if we wanted to heal somebody

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:54.640 align:middle line:84%
or to create something, you
and I would come together.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.650 align:middle line:90%
And it would just be created.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:58.090 align:middle line:90%
We would create through sound.

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:01.450 align:middle line:84%
We would create
through intention.

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And they had technologies
that were what they referred

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:10.600 align:middle line:90%
to as selfic technologies.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- it
was a combination

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:17.230 align:middle line:84%
of plants and crystals, but
they also used the elements.

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:20.319 align:middle line:84%
They used water,
fire, aether, air.

00:18:20.319 --> 00:18:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I saw a movie when
I was a kid about Atlantis.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:24.220 align:middle line:90%
It was a movie now.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And they had a
massive size crystal

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:31.450 align:middle line:84%
that they used as a
weapon or something.

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And they contend
that that contributed

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.780 align:middle line:84%
to the sinking of the
land, something happened.

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And that it's still down
on the floor of the ocean.

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:41.260 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: They had they had
multiple crystals that

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.170 align:middle line:90%
were very large in size.

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:49.540 align:middle line:84%
We know from looking at
some of the minds that

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:52.570 align:middle line:84%
exist today that are
deep down in the Earth,

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:54.010 align:middle line:90%
these are amazing.

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:59.830 align:middle line:84%
When we do the journey to
the Atlantis Akashic records

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:03.820 align:middle line:84%
journey in the
workshops, and it's also

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:09.060 align:middle line:84%
available on the site, there is
a master crystal for healing.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And so we go to the main
healing temple that's

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:14.640 align:middle line:84%
at the center of
Atlantis, and we

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.520 align:middle line:90%
tap into this master crystal.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:18.810 align:middle line:90%
And we project into it.

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:23.535 align:middle line:84%
And it's streaming energy back
out for the purpose of healing.

00:19:23.535 --> 00:19:26.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you can tap
into the Akashic records,

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:30.600 align:middle line:84%
can you determine what
happened to Atlantis?

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.040 align:middle line:90%
Is it outlined that way?

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:36.960 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Yes, yes, there
are things about Atlantis

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.320 align:middle line:84%
that I have found
from the records

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:44.070 align:middle line:84%
with all of that, George,
that haven't come up

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:48.900 align:middle line:84%
in the studies or the
writings of other researchers.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And I don't consider
myself to be a researcher.

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:55.470 align:middle line:84%
But I am an intuitive
cosmonaut, if you will.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:20:01.800 align:middle line:90%
And as I see Atlantis they--

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:06.240 align:middle line:84%
and this ties into some of the
origins of the Akashic records.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.800 align:middle line:84%
As we were talking
about, the energy

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:12.840 align:middle line:84%
was so high on the planet
that the destruction literally

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:16.710 align:middle line:84%
separated the aethers from
the Earth in a way that

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:23.560 align:middle line:84%
caused the unification to go
into a time of separation.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a cosmic cycle that
happens every 26,000 and 13,000

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:30.080 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:34.410 align:middle line:84%
26,000 being the grand rotation
around the great central sun,

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:38.850 align:middle line:84%
and the 13,000 year
period is from unity

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:42.630 align:middle line:84%
back to separation back to
unity back to separation,

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:43.870 align:middle line:90%
so forth and so on.

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And this will continue
up until about 6,034

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.330 align:middle line:90%
when the earth becomes a star.

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:53.163 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting,
now, what do you think

00:20:53.163 --> 00:20:55.290 align:middle line:90%
happened to Atlantis, Bill?

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: They had-- as
they were using energy

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:02.144 align:middle line:84%
and they were at the height
in the end of the unity.

00:21:02.144 --> 00:21:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, they
were way advanced.

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Oh, yeah, oh,
yeah-- much more than what

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:09.000 align:middle line:90%
we see in most of the studies.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.970 align:middle line:10%
There was a platform
that they had.

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:15.600 align:middle line:90%
And it was like a large mesa.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:21.320 align:middle line:84%
Thoth the Atlantean had talked
about the Halls of a Amenti.

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:25.950 align:middle line:84%
and the Seven Lords of Time,
the Seven Lords of Space,

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:31.380 align:middle line:84%
the cycles of time and space and
energy and many other realms.

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:35.040 align:middle line:84%
They had created
what you would think

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.740 align:middle line:90%
of as a holographic vortex.

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:40.670 align:middle line:84%
When we see the Aurora
Borealis, something like that

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:46.470 align:middle line:84%
but vortexed into like a
platform that was a large mesa.

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:48.300 align:middle line:90%
This energy was streaming.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:51.850 align:middle line:84%
This was literally
creation of energy.

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:55.750 align:middle line:84%
This was literally the
god source light energy.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:59.350 align:middle line:84%
So you might say that
they were playing god,

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:03.580 align:middle line:84%
but they were creating on the
grandest level that they could.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.380 align:middle line:90%
They were all-knowing beings.

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something backfired,
Bill, something happened.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Yes, as this
created a great energy,

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:17.800 align:middle line:84%
it also had portals into
other times and places.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.740 align:middle line:84%
So portals into other
times and places

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:23.860 align:middle line:90%
started to begin opening.

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And it started to cause
the timelines to collapse.

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't
necessarily meant to be.

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.590 align:middle line:10%
It was their greatest creation.

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:37.840 align:middle line:10%
And they could
literally go into this--

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.560 align:middle line:10%
the high priests could literally
go into this energy and access

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:48.385 align:middle line:10%
and just call things up on more
of a cosmic universal level.

00:22:48.385 --> 00:22:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did that contribute
to the destruction?

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:51.520 align:middle line:90%
Something happened.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:56.290 align:middle line:10%
>>FOSS: Yes, as the poles were
shifting naturally anyway,

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:59.210 align:middle line:10%
this creation tipped
the balance for them.

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And when it tipped the
balance, the only thing

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:07.090 align:middle line:84%
that they could do
at that point was

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:12.550 align:middle line:84%
to fire more energy into this
vortex that they had created.

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:17.860 align:middle line:84%
It was a streaming vortex with
what you might think of as gold

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:23.300 align:middle line:84%
pearlescent colors that
literally embodied past,

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:26.350 align:middle line:84%
present, and future--
everything that ever will be--

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:28.120 align:middle line:90%
into a central location.

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:31.570 align:middle line:84%
They fired more energy into
it, and it didn't work.

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:35.616 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did Egypt have
anything to do with Atlantis?

00:23:35.616 --> 00:23:37.240 align:middle line:84%
Was there any kind
of connection there?

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.675 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes, absolutely.

00:23:38.675 --> 00:23:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How so?

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:44.660 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Egypt was the survivors.

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:45.760 align:middle line:90%
Those who were the--

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.710 align:middle line:90%
it was a surviving colony.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:48.852 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From Atlantis?

00:23:48.852 --> 00:23:49.810 align:middle line:90%
That's where they fled?

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:51.910 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes, that's the main--

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:55.480 align:middle line:84%
this is the main
place they fled to.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:59.770 align:middle line:84%
There are remembrances
of Atlantis that are--

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:05.200 align:middle line:84%
as far over as South
America, we find things.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Egypt was-- when Egypt happened,
when this first happened,

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:18.120 align:middle line:84%
they had trouble
talking and thinking.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.430 align:middle line:84%
As the poles shifted
on the planet,

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:25.745 align:middle line:84%
the mind fields of the
surviving humans were wiped out.

00:24:25.745 --> 00:24:27.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what
do you mean by that?

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:28.740 align:middle line:90%
Wiped out?

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:32.005 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: If your fields
became out of whack--

00:24:32.005 --> 00:24:32.805 align:middle line:90%
like

00:24:32.805 --> 00:24:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like a
computer breaking down?

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:36.240 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Yes, yes,
so if your fields

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.340 align:middle line:84%
were altered
electromagnetically,

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:40.140 align:middle line:84%
we're all connected
to the Earth.

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:42.420 align:middle line:90%
And we have our chakra system.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:46.320 align:middle line:84%
So if your chakra system
was electromagnetically out

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:51.540 align:middle line:84%
of whack or altered,
you would have

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:53.020 align:middle line:90%
trouble with your orientation.

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:55.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they were
walking around like zombies?

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:57.900 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Well, you
might say that.

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And they were
struggling to survive.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:06.090 align:middle line:84%
So it took humanity back into
more of a primitive stage.

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:10.620 align:middle line:84%
The high priests were
connecting with aliens.

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:13.650 align:middle line:84%
Sirians, Pleiadians,
and other groups--

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:19.140 align:middle line:84%
some say the Annunaki as
well-- had a big hand in this.

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:23.610 align:middle line:84%
They stepped in and they
said, we're going to help you.

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:31.980 align:middle line:10%
So they helped to
build technologies

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:34.330 align:middle line:10%
that moved them forward.

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:39.630 align:middle line:84%
There was some power sources
that were installed deep

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:44.050 align:middle line:84%
in the Earth to help correct
the electromagnetic field

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:44.850 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And the great pyramids
are part of that

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.204 align:middle line:84%
and other pyramids
around the world.

00:25:51.204 --> 00:25:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Christopher Dunn
believes that the pyramids

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:55.350 align:middle line:90%
are power plants.

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:58.590 align:middle line:84%
Other people believe that
the pyramids were there

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:01.320 align:middle line:90%
to offset earthquakes.

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm reading
you correctly,

00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:06.660 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids are
there as something

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:10.290 align:middle line:84%
to tie into the spirituality
of these Akashic records.

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:14.870 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Absolutely, yes, the
pyramids with their design,

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:18.630 align:middle line:84%
they're actually
downloading what

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:22.410 align:middle line:84%
we consider to be fourth
dimensional energy, which

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:23.620 align:middle line:90%
is that of the mind.

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:26.910 align:middle line:84%
So we have third dimension,
which is the here

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:28.170 align:middle line:90%
and now, time-space reality.

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:30.690 align:middle line:90%


00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And we have 4D in between third
dimension and fifth dimension,

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:39.150 align:middle line:84%
which is a
consideration of mind.

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:41.910 align:middle line:10%
So as you were saying
and Christopher

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:48.900 align:middle line:10%
was referring to, in helping
to thwart earthquakes, yes.

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:54.930 align:middle line:10%
So if it was helping to balance
the polarity of the planet

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:56.520 align:middle line:10%
through the north
and the south pole

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.770 align:middle line:10%
and restore that
electromagnetic field,

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:01.324 align:middle line:10%
then it would offset earthquakes
and other happenings.

00:27:01.324 --> 00:27:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you say
the Akashic records are

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.920 align:middle line:90%
more spiritual than religious?

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.130 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Absolutely, yes.

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:15.540 align:middle line:84%
There are people from all
religions around the world,

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:20.690 align:middle line:84%
whether they're deeply led
through that religion who

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:23.660 align:middle line:84%
just get a sense, who
just get a sense of it.

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:26.300 align:middle line:84%
So there might be
somebody that's religious

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:28.340 align:middle line:84%
and you might walk
up to them and start

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:31.160 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
Akashic records,

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:34.460 align:middle line:84%
and that person may
have or may never

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:38.670 align:middle line:84%
have heard of the records, much
like when I found the records.

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And they just have a deep
knowing on a soul level.

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there anything for
people to be afraid of here?

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:46.972 align:middle line:90%
Could something go wrong?

00:27:46.972 --> 00:27:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: The only thing the
only thing that people are

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:56.350 align:middle line:90%
really afraid of is the ego.

00:27:56.350 --> 00:28:02.340 align:middle line:84%
The ego is the small self or
the survival part mechanism

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:08.520 align:middle line:84%
deep within us, that was
the original survival that

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.340 align:middle line:84%
helped us when we were
battling man against nature,

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.500 align:middle line:84%
man against man,
things like that--

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:19.320 align:middle line:84%
survival through fear and battle
of the fittest, et cetera.

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:25.020 align:middle line:84%
The only fear there really
is what I call conflict.

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And that conflict is that
your ego can be afraid

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.000 align:middle line:84%
of what you may have
done in another life

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000 align:middle line:90%
or what you're going to see.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.750 align:middle line:90%
It's like stepping out into--

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:42.390 align:middle line:84%
it's like having those
dreams where you step out,

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:45.310 align:middle line:84%
if you ever have, where
you're naked in a dream.

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:46.597 align:middle line:90%
And you step out into society.

00:28:46.597 --> 00:28:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've never had one
of those kind of dreams, darn.

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:51.810 align:middle line:90%
I've had flying dreams.

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:54.130 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes, a lot of us do.

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always
been told that if you're

00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:02.460 align:middle line:84%
going to advance spiritually
that you need to shed your ego

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:04.410 align:middle line:90%
and get rid of it basically.

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:08.830 align:middle line:84%
That the ego-- most
of us think the ego

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:12.160 align:middle line:84%
has to do with personality
and boisterism and things

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.040 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:15.880 align:middle line:90%
That's not the case.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: That's only one fraction
of what the ego wants to do.

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:23.230 align:middle line:84%
The ego wants to be
that corporate entity,

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:26.440 align:middle line:84%
if you will, that
manages our whole life,

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.270 align:middle line:90%
manages our whole existence--

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:31.750 align:middle line:90%
not only the body functions.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:35.830 align:middle line:84%
It wants to manage
your spiritual journey.

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:40.630 align:middle line:84%
So it might say-- the ego, while
you're learning and practicing

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:43.300 align:middle line:84%
spirituality, the
ego may be running

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.790 align:middle line:84%
in the background
saying, well, I

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:47.657 align:middle line:84%
think I need to do
that one more workshop.

00:29:47.657 --> 00:29:48.740 align:middle line:90%
And now I need to do this.

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:50.110 align:middle line:90%
And now I need to read this.

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:51.220 align:middle line:90%
And now I need to--

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:55.280 align:middle line:84%
so in a way, there's a
certain constructively to it.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And yet, you don't
really need anything

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.800 align:middle line:84%
to step into that
moment of enlightenment.

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:04.300 align:middle line:90%
So it's a very soft--

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:07.950 align:middle line:84%
it's a very soft
veil that you step

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:12.390 align:middle line:84%
through when you move into a
higher state of enlightenment

00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:16.080 align:middle line:84%
or spirituality or knowing
yourself at a clearer level.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.630 align:middle line:10%
But the ego likes to keep
you right on this side

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:22.920 align:middle line:10%
and keep you as if
there's more to do,

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.860 align:middle line:10%
there's more that
you need to do.

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bill, they talk about
quantum physics and its tie

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.030 align:middle line:90%
into the Akashic record.

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:32.110 align:middle line:10%
So let's take a look.

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:34.300 align:middle line:10%
>> According to
theoretical physicists,

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:38.800 align:middle line:10%
zero-point energy is an all
pervasive sea of quantum energy

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:43.060 align:middle line:10%
waves that are invisible but
exist throughout the universe.

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:47.590 align:middle line:84%
The fabric of space itself is
made of energy and information.

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And the way this information
propagates through the universe

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:52.420 align:middle line:90%
is through waves.

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:55.150 align:middle line:90%
We call these quantum waves.

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And so the Akashic field is
made of quantum waves that are

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:02.210 align:middle line:90%
common to all intelligent life.

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:04.440 align:middle line:84%
This means that
all human brains,

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:09.160 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial brains, and
any sort of other worldly beings

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.100 align:middle line:84%
also have the ability to
tap into these quantum

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.310 align:middle line:90%
waves receiving information.

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:18.770 align:middle line:84%
This idea of an intelligent
informational field

00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:21.140 align:middle line:84%
that we can access
with our consciousness

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.030 align:middle line:90%
is not pseudoscience.

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:24.860 align:middle line:90%
It's not superstition.

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:27.320 align:middle line:84%
It is a basic fact
that our scientists

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.815 align:middle line:90%
confirm is actually true.

00:31:29.815 --> 00:31:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if this is true,
what does that do for us?

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.550 align:middle line:90%
How can we use that?

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:39.950 align:middle line:10%
>>FOSS: The quantum
time-space reality

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:44.730 align:middle line:10%
refers to what we also call
the Eternal Now moment.

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:48.260 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
Eternal Now moment.

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
Eternal Now moment--

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:52.760 align:middle line:90%
and now, and so on and so forth.

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:56.840 align:middle line:84%
It's ever streaming, ever
present, everywhere present.

00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And when you go into
the Akashic records--

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:02.720 align:middle line:84%
and here's one of the
deeper hidden levels

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.120 align:middle line:84%
that I found with
the Akashic records.

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.970 align:middle line:84%
When you're streaming
up into the records,

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:12.920 align:middle line:84%
the records are activating
your soul energy.

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.200 align:middle line:90%
Your soul energy is part of God.

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:18.260 align:middle line:84%
You are living, breathing--
your celestial being, that

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:21.990 align:middle line:84%
celestial you that's
streaming through your senses

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:23.990 align:middle line:84%
right now, that's streaming
through these senses

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:27.020 align:middle line:90%
into this body is part of God.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And that part of you that
part of all of us is eternal.

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:37.070 align:middle line:84%
It's the Eternal Now self
in the Eternal Now moment.

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:39.690 align:middle line:90%
This is quantum.

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:42.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where does evil
fit into any of this, Bill?

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems to me
that you've got good,

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.700 align:middle line:84%
you've got bad, but
where does that fit

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.340 align:middle line:84%
into the Akashic
records, if at all?

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Yes, that's an
interesting question.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.200 align:middle line:84%
There is light and
dark in the universe.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:02.130 align:middle line:90%


00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:04.390 align:middle line:84%
There is light
coming from source.

00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And there is void energy
between the stars of space.

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Light and dark can often be
confused with good and evil.

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:14.400 align:middle line:84%
There is good and evil
here on the planet.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's good
and evil in space.

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:21.210 align:middle line:84%
There is good and evil
in the higher dimensions.

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And some would say, well,
both are part of creation--

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:27.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Always have been here.

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Yes, and there
are some that would say go

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:34.650 align:middle line:84%
tend yourself towards
the light instead

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:38.530 align:middle line:84%
of trying to draw power from
both the light and the dark.

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:43.110 align:middle line:84%
So it takes a person
or as a being--

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:45.960 align:middle line:84%
it takes a person in
a different direction.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:50.760 align:middle line:84%
When you're drawing power
from both light and dark,

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:54.300 align:middle line:84%
it will have a
different orientation--

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.280 align:middle line:84%
that power coming
through that person--

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:58.110 align:middle line:90%
then if you stay in the light.

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:01.290 align:middle line:84%
If you tend towards service,
if you connect with God source

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:02.970 align:middle line:90%
light, first moment.

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:05.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When people
meditate, are they

00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:08.370 align:middle line:84%
tapping into their
Akashic records that way?

00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:11.010 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: You can, you can.

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:13.710 align:middle line:84%
So knowing that we're all
connected to the records

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:15.260 align:middle line:90%
all of the time.

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:18.659 align:middle line:84%
We are naturally
inputting continually.

00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:21.100 align:middle line:84%
It's when you
consciously engage--

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:23.550 align:middle line:84%
so, oftentimes,
people are trying

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:28.212 align:middle line:84%
to not think when they meditate,
unless they're manifesting,

00:34:28.212 --> 00:34:30.420 align:middle line:84%
let's say, or visualizing
or trying to create a great

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:32.100 align:middle line:90%
or healing.

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:34.230 align:middle line:90%
Something along those lines--

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:38.124 align:middle line:84%
sending energy to others
for healing and blessings.

00:34:38.124 --> 00:34:39.540 align:middle line:84%
But most of the
time, we're trying

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:42.330 align:middle line:84%
to calm the mind down
because we have anywhere

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:46.389 align:middle line:84%
from 10,000 to 60,000
thoughts per day.

00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:48.130 align:middle line:90%
So most people are--

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:51.120 align:middle line:84%
but it's when you
consciously start to say,

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:54.870 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm in a
peaceful state now, I

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:57.840 align:middle line:90%
would like to access my records.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And as you can go in
there and hold space,

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:05.540 align:middle line:84%
even if it's just for a few
moments, it's important to ask.

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:09.200 align:middle line:84%
Because we all have
the inalienable right

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.806 align:middle line:90%
to look into our own records.

00:35:11.806 --> 00:35:12.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At any time?

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: At any time.

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What determines
what goes into those records?

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.730 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: You do.

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:24.210 align:middle line:84%
You do without a doubt and
your guides and your life path

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:28.200 align:middle line:84%
that you set up
before you came here.

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.620 align:middle line:84%
So let's say, George, was up in
the records in between life--

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:33.420 align:middle line:84%
the divine being
that is now George

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:35.890 align:middle line:90%
Noory was up in the records.

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:38.270 align:middle line:90%
And the angels said--

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:42.380 align:middle line:84%
the keepers of the records says,
as we look at the symbols here,

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:46.130 align:middle line:84%
the cosmic symbols,
and your journey

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:50.810 align:middle line:84%
is meant to be a great
purveyor of the divine,

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:57.650 align:middle line:84%
to be a great light, and a
way-shower for many people.

00:35:57.650 --> 00:36:01.200 align:middle line:90%
And you said, yes, I want that.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.000 align:middle line:90%
I can do that.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.166 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who are the keepers
of the Akashic records?

00:36:04.166 --> 00:36:06.770 align:middle line:84%
You just mentioned
angels, are they?

00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:09.140 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Angels, the
archangels-- they're

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:13.970 align:middle line:84%
arcangelic like
creation all angels

00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:16.550 align:middle line:84%
that would be more
associated with the Elohim.

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:19.670 align:middle line:84%
The Elohim are
high level angels.

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:25.640 align:middle line:10%
These are creations
all energies that--

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:28.820 align:middle line:10%
they're good, but
their orientation

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:32.300 align:middle line:10%
is such that if you saw
one on the other side,

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:34.430 align:middle line:10%
you would know what it is.

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And most people we don't
think about creators

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:42.110 align:middle line:84%
of the universe that created
from the mind of God, that

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:44.840 align:middle line:84%
are directly linked to the
heart and the mind of God.

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:49.910 align:middle line:84%
These parts of God that
operates through these beings.

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Literally, also ancient
angelic presence

00:36:56.570 --> 00:36:59.240 align:middle line:84%
that may even be
considered-- that may show up

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:04.760 align:middle line:84%
for a person as human looking,
humanoid in appearance,

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.920 align:middle line:90%
or alien.

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:11.780 align:middle line:84%
I see the keeper of the Akashic
records as a very tall being

00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:17.270 align:middle line:84%
that is streaming this
whitish-gold energy that--

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:19.670 align:middle line:84%
it looks somewhere
between alien inhuman.

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And it is just very, very
interesting, very easy

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:27.050 align:middle line:84%
to get along with,
a wisdom keeper.

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:29.690 align:middle line:84%
Someone you definitely
want to get to know.

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Based on
some of that, assuming

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.220 align:middle line:84%
that extraterrestrial
life exists

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:38.070 align:middle line:84%
in the universe on
other planetary systems.

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:40.850 align:middle line:90%
And it's a very physical thing.

00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:43.620 align:middle line:84%
Are they to tapped into
the Akashic records,

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:45.060 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrials?

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:48.480 align:middle line:90%
Do they have their own records?

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Every single planet,
all of the ancient alien

00:37:52.890 --> 00:38:00.481 align:middle line:84%
civilizations and their planets
of their historical place--

00:38:00.481 --> 00:38:01.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
all tied into this.

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:05.610 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: They all have their
own set of Akashic records.

00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:08.760 align:middle line:84%
So, for instance,
I remember being

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.730 align:middle line:90%
Pleiadian in other life times.

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:11.535 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do?

00:38:11.535 --> 00:38:12.930 align:middle line:10%
>>FOSS: Yes, and--

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:16.590 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, that's
another show all by itself.

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:23.940 align:middle line:10%
>>FOSS: Yes, there were
deep levels of wisdom.

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:28.200 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiadians are
hands down what

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:32.940 align:middle line:84%
I would consider
to be benevolent

00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:35.040 align:middle line:90%
and helpers of humanity.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.405 align:middle line:90%
This is the one--

00:38:36.405 --> 00:38:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's why you
do what you do, maybe.

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: That could be probably.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:48.150 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiadians are--
they want to help.

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:49.920 align:middle line:90%
They can be trusted.

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:53.040 align:middle line:90%
Some of the other races--

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.350 align:middle line:84%
all alien races have
their different factions.

00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:56.960 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
have their military.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.418 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
have their healers

00:38:58.418 --> 00:39:01.500 align:middle line:84%
and medical just
like our society.

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And everyone thinks that
they're doing the right thing.

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:08.940 align:middle line:84%
So they have their
own agendas, sometimes

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:12.360 align:middle line:84%
in alignment with our
growth and sometimes not.

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.850 align:middle line:90%
The Pleiadians are one society--

00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:21.420 align:middle line:84%
as souls come from other
races among the stars

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:24.420 align:middle line:84%
to incarnate here and
have an experience,

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:27.240 align:middle line:84%
the Pleiadians are
doing that just

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:30.360 align:middle line:84%
for the purpose of elevating
human consciousness

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:34.590 align:middle line:84%
and seeing us move
closer towards ascension.

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:36.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are these
records ever--

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:40.170 align:middle line:84%
if we can coin a phrase that
we use these days-- hacked?

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Can they be hacked by other
groups or individuals?

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Can I hack into
your Akashic record

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:48.405 align:middle line:90%
and see what you've done?

00:39:48.405 --> 00:39:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: You could.

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:50.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: You could,
however, there are

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:57.940 align:middle line:84%
going to be fail safes
setup within the records.

00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:05.290 align:middle line:84%
They're going to-- they may
show you skewed information.

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:08.880 align:middle line:84%
So let's say if you were
going to do that, you must

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:14.300 align:middle line:84%
be in a certain frame of
mind or have a certain agenda

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:17.580 align:middle line:90%
to want to get into my records.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:19.160 align:middle line:90%
You have to have an intention--

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Absolutely,
it's not accidental.

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:23.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing it for a reason.

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:26.610 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Sure, so if we wanted--

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:32.840 align:middle line:84%
if we are doing so
for the highest level,

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:36.020 align:middle line:84%
if you're acknowledging
me as your brother,

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:38.550 align:middle line:84%
and we're all good
with each other.

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And we have no conflict between
us then what's the point?

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:45.030 align:middle line:90%
Why would you?

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If two people, Bill,
are in love with each other,

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:53.300 align:middle line:84%
do their records
somehow mesh together?

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:54.410 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes, yes--

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:55.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like
soulmates basically?

00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:59.580 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: So two soulmates
come together--

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:04.930 align:middle line:84%
when a man and a woman or
two partners come together,

00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:10.600 align:middle line:84%
and their soul
energy starts to--

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:13.090 align:middle line:90%
soul energy, it morphs.

00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:16.000 align:middle line:84%
This is the creation
energy of God.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.090 align:middle line:10%
This is sometimes
star energy or direct

00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:23.830 align:middle line:10%
from creator God for
a first moment source.

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:27.747 align:middle line:10%
This soul energy will
start to morph together.

00:41:27.747 --> 00:41:29.080 align:middle line:10%
It will start to morph together.

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:30.080 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I can see that.

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:32.710 align:middle line:10%
>>FOSS: Have you ever
noticed two people

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:35.660 align:middle line:10%
that get together and
over the course of time,

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:38.210 align:middle line:10%
they start to look
similar to each other?

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:39.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sometimes.

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:41.095 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Yes,
sometimes, sometimes.

00:41:41.095 --> 00:41:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are animals
tied into any of this?

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:45.670 align:middle line:90%
Do they have Akashic records?

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:47.950 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: That's a good question.

00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:50.740 align:middle line:90%
Animals are part of the Earth.

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:53.530 align:middle line:90%
So the Earth is--

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:58.720 align:middle line:84%
the Akashic records are part of
the aetheric body of the Earth.

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And the Earth is like
a living library.

00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:03.370 align:middle line:90%
And the earth is living itself.

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:04.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's the Gaia theory.

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:13.040 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Yes, and as the Earth
is living, everything upon her

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.540 align:middle line:90%
is also living.

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:16.940 align:middle line:84%
All of the animals
are part of the group.

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:20.180 align:middle line:84%
They all have their
group consciousness.

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:27.350 align:middle line:10%
And this soul energy
from God, which

00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:29.810 align:middle line:10%
soon comes into
human form, sometimes

00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:34.250 align:middle line:10%
it will come through
a being that's

00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:36.050 align:middle line:10%
part of the animal kingdom.

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And it starts to develop
a special personality

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:42.200 align:middle line:90%
that we notice.

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever noticed
a person's pet

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:46.310 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, maybe
our own at times,

00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:50.030 align:middle line:84%
that there's something
about that pet that's

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:54.395 align:middle line:84%
different than any other
dog or cat or fish?

00:42:54.395 --> 00:42:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My granddaughter has
that with her a little pet dog.

00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:03.860 align:middle line:84%
She's got like a little Yorkie,
and they're inseparable.

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
that when she takes

00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:10.220 align:middle line:84%
pictures of this little thing,
there's something there.

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:11.930 align:middle line:90%
There's a connection there.

00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:15.140 align:middle line:84%
Because this dog is
looking in the camera

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:16.520 align:middle line:90%
like a little human being.

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:18.320 align:middle line:90%
It's uncanny.

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.430 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: That's wonderful.

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:23.210 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes a soul-- let's
say if two souls need

00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:28.190 align:middle line:84%
to be close to each other, and
there's no rhyme or reason--

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:33.350 align:middle line:84%
there's like a divinely
guided chaotic synchronicity

00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:38.600 align:middle line:84%
to soulmates and a soul
group participants coming

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:42.180 align:middle line:84%
in and out of incarnations
with each other.

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:45.770 align:middle line:84%
So if a soul needs to be
close to another soul,

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:50.270 align:middle line:84%
sometimes it will
come into a pet.

00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:55.490 align:middle line:84%
They can incarnate as that
pet to be with that person.

00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Because maybe there's some
lesson that will be learned.

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's some
energy that will

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:05.090 align:middle line:84%
be balanced if the person
gets sick, so on and so forth.

00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bill, what does
ascension means to you?

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Ascension is literally
what we are destined for.

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:21.200 align:middle line:84%
It is literally the highest
version that humanity,

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:25.640 align:middle line:84%
as we know humanity,
as we know humans

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:29.040 align:middle line:90%
to be in the here and now--

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.620 align:middle line:90%
this is where we're going.

00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:32.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that what Jesus did?

00:44:32.090 --> 00:44:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes, yes as he was--

00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:39.980 align:middle line:84%
now, he was studying ancient
energy techniques such

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:44.990 align:middle line:84%
as there was Asian Hindu
and many other cultures

00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:47.990 align:middle line:84%
that he studied in the
last years that brought him

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:53.390 align:middle line:84%
into alignment at
such a high level

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:55.580 align:middle line:90%
that he was able to let go.

00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:59.240 align:middle line:90%
And when he just said--

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:02.150 align:middle line:84%
God was intending
this also through him.

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, the other way to
do it is without pain,

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:13.840 align:middle line:84%
without having to go through
being put on a cross basically.

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:16.330 align:middle line:84%
When the ascended
masters, as we call them--

00:45:16.330 --> 00:45:19.200 align:middle line:84%
the ascended
masters of the light

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:25.030 align:middle line:84%
draw the soul down into
the body so powerfully

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:33.790 align:middle line:84%
that the astral body and the
personality of that person

00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:37.900 align:middle line:90%
goes into a suspended animation.

00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:43.870 align:middle line:84%
So it literally transforms
the DNA that's in the fields

00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:48.490 align:middle line:84%
and in the body
bringing light and light

00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:53.610 align:middle line:84%
codes into the fields
in the body, which

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:56.144 align:middle line:84%
will hold that person
whether that person passes

00:45:56.144 --> 00:45:57.810 align:middle line:84%
to the other side at
the end of the life

00:45:57.810 --> 00:46:00.840 align:middle line:84%
or whether they do it during
their lifetime in the here

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:04.140 align:middle line:84%
and now in the waking
state, that they can

00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:06.600 align:middle line:90%
transform into a body of light.

00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And it will be
that person as them

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:15.660 align:middle line:84%
from then on at a higher
level of frequency.

00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When we were created
as human beings, Bill,

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:22.500 align:middle line:84%
this grand scheme of what
we are and who we are,

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:26.160 align:middle line:84%
the Akashic records seem
to be always part of that.

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.470 align:middle line:84%
How would the maker
know about this?

00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And why would they
create these records?

00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:33.000 align:middle line:90%
Why do we need him?

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: We need the records
primarily so that when--

00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:43.870 align:middle line:90%
this is a very special planet.

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:48.570 align:middle line:84%
We always think about
different alien civilizations

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:52.410 align:middle line:84%
and alien planets as being so
much more advanced than we are.

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's true we are
young race, and we've

00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.370 align:middle line:90%
got a long ways to go.

00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:59.850 align:middle line:84%
But the Earth is a very
beautiful living library.

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:02.960 align:middle line:84%
That's why they all want to come
here and check it out and check

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:03.760 align:middle line:90%
us out.

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:04.759 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are we unusual?

00:47:04.759 --> 00:47:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: We're unusual because
we were created literally

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:10.950 align:middle line:90%
in the image of God.

00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:14.130 align:middle line:84%
This is one thing, one
translation of the Bible

00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:16.740 align:middle line:84%
that they actually left in
that they did get right.

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:20.700 align:middle line:84%
We are created in
the image of God.

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And with this divine template
of the human form with the seven

00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:29.550 align:middle line:84%
chakras, the seven primary
chakras and the extended chakra

00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:35.710 align:middle line:84%
system under the feet, over
the head and the acupuncture,

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:39.330 align:middle line:84%
acupressure, the meridians
that run through the body--

00:47:39.330 --> 00:47:42.990 align:middle line:84%
144,000 meridians running
through five zones

00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:45.180 align:middle line:90%
in the physical body.

00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:47.340 align:middle line:90%
The DNA that's in the fields.

00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:50.820 align:middle line:90%
The DNA in the body.

00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:54.750 align:middle line:84%
Everything that has to

00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:58.950 align:middle line:84%
dynamic human form is
a very intricate form.

00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And other races, other
souls, and even technologies,

00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:13.240 align:middle line:84%
dare I say, want to
merge with our form.

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you use the
Akashic records for yourself?

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: I use it in
my everyday life.

00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:28.160 align:middle line:84%
The main thing that I use it
for is my service to others.

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:31.670 align:middle line:84%
That is more important
to me than anything.

00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And in doing that,
I learn a lot.

00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:41.270 align:middle line:84%
I learn a lot from the
keepers of the records.

00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:42.975 align:middle line:90%
As they're showing me--

00:48:42.975 --> 00:48:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
communicate with them?

00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:45.800 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes.

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:50.870 align:middle line:84%
As they're showing
me a person's life,

00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:55.580 align:middle line:84%
they often show me ancient
lifetimes, alien lifetimes--

00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:56.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Other lives.

00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:58.550 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes, other lives here.

00:48:58.550 --> 00:49:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And as they're showing
me this, I then

00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:05.420 align:middle line:84%
get to learn things about that
culture, about those times,

00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:07.290 align:middle line:90%
about how things occurred.

00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:12.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's literally like an
ongoing history lesson or one

00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:15.830 align:middle line:84%
of the greatest
artistic projects

00:49:15.830 --> 00:49:18.590 align:middle line:90%
that I've ever undertaken.

00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: By knowing how to
deal with the Akashic records,

00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:26.200 align:middle line:84%
as an individual is your

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:31.570 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Absolutely, yes-- in
the grandest sense of the word

00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:34.120 align:middle line:90%
and an overview, yes.

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:39.010 align:middle line:84%
There can also be
underlying currents

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:44.260 align:middle line:84%
that are generated by the
ego that will as you expand.

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And you go into
this the soul field,

00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:53.650 align:middle line:84%
you're going more into your
soul energy, expanding--

00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:56.620 align:middle line:84%
you're going to feel more
comfortable, more divinely

00:49:56.620 --> 00:49:59.440 align:middle line:90%
guided by divine intelligence.

00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:02.800 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, the ego
says, are you sure?

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:04.480 align:middle line:90%
I have no control over this.

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:06.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's bring it
back down and let's

00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:07.760 align:middle line:90%
tune it back down a notch.

00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And so the ego starts
through the empathic field

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:11.590 align:middle line:90%
to pull back in.

00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:14.860 align:middle line:84%
So you're literally
expanding and contracting.

00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:17.350 align:middle line:90%
The difference is, normal peop--

00:50:17.350 --> 00:50:20.530 align:middle line:84%
for all of us in a
normal everyday life

00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:23.200 align:middle line:84%
through the series of
events, it can be sporadic--

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:25.180 align:middle line:90%
this expansion and contraction.

00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:27.910 align:middle line:84%
When it starts to
become more rhythmic,

00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:29.950 align:middle line:90%
we know when we're expanded.

00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And we know how it feels
when we're contracted.

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:37.120 align:middle line:84%
When we're in this
state of contraction,

00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:41.320 align:middle line:84%
eventually, your higher
self knows what feels best.

00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And you will either
move up to higher levels

00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:48.300 align:middle line:84%
or you will land somewhere
in the middle of these

00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:49.960 align:middle line:84%
where you're able
to balance more.

00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:51.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The person

00:52:38.410 --> 00:52:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've got that on a
coffee table in St. Louis,

00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:40.970 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:42.190 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Oh, great, thank you.

00:52:42.190 --> 00:52:44.565 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People thumbed through
that and everything else.

00:52:44.565 --> 00:52:46.660 align:middle line:84%
This other one is
much smaller, but it's

00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:47.920 align:middle line:90%
more practical I think.

00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Yes, it's one
of a three book series--

00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:53.390 align:middle line:84%
beginner level,
intermediate, and advanced.

00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:57.670 align:middle line:84%
So there are going to be three
volumes where I literally take

00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:59.650 align:middle line:90%
someone through step-by-step.

00:52:59.650 --> 00:53:02.620 align:middle line:84%
So this new book,
the volume one,

00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:05.410 align:middle line:84%
is literally here's
what you need to --

00:53:05.410 --> 00:53:09.110 align:middle line:84%
sit down, get quiet, let's
take some breaths together.

00:53:09.110 --> 00:53:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Here's what's going to be
more beneficial for you

00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:13.310 align:middle line:90%
to put in your body.

00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:15.610 align:middle line:84%
Here are the things
to stay away from--

00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:17.980 align:middle line:84%
really spelling it
out for a person

00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:22.210 align:middle line:84%
and starting to talk to a person
through the book about what

00:53:22.210 --> 00:53:24.310 align:middle line:90%
they can expect.

00:53:24.310 --> 00:53:26.740 align:middle line:84%
How are those visions
going to feel?

00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:30.250 align:middle line:84%
How is the energy going to feel
when your soul is connecting up

00:53:30.250 --> 00:53:35.020 align:middle line:84%
through your senses and through
the central part of your body,

00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:37.120 align:middle line:90%
projecting up into the records?

00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:38.890 align:middle line:90%
How is that going to--

00:53:38.890 --> 00:53:40.810 align:middle line:90%
what's it going to be like?

00:53:40.810 --> 00:53:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it difficult,
Bill, for people

00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:45.940 align:middle line:84%
to comprehend the fact that
there is a book of records

00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:47.230 align:middle line:90%
of their life?

00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:50.920 align:middle line:84%
How many people
understand that or get it?

00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: A lot more
than you would think.

00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:56.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot more than
a person would think.

00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:59.590 align:middle line:84%
Most people, when
you bring it up to--

00:53:59.590 --> 00:54:02.230 align:middle line:84%
if they haven't
heard of it, I find

00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:03.820 align:middle line:84%
that most people
that haven't heard

00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:07.810 align:middle line:84%
of it are more
inquisitive as to they

00:54:07.810 --> 00:54:09.190 align:middle line:90%
always have another question.

00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, tell me, how
does that work?

00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:13.490 align:middle line:84%
Instead of thinking, I
don't believe in that.

00:54:13.490 --> 00:54:17.140 align:middle line:84%
I honestly I don't hear
that many comments ever

00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:20.064 align:middle line:84%
about somebody saying, well,
no, I don't believe in that.

00:54:20.064 --> 00:54:21.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't get that?

00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: I don't maybe every
one in several thousand people

00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:29.020 align:middle line:84%
will say, no, I
don't believe it.

00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:30.550 align:middle line:90%
You've got one life.

00:54:30.550 --> 00:54:31.510 align:middle line:90%
The devil's down there.

00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:32.530 align:middle line:90%
God's up here.

00:54:32.530 --> 00:54:33.650 align:middle line:90%
And that's all you got.

00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
we originally know

00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:38.920 align:middle line:84%
that we had Akashic
records in the first place?

00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:41.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we saw the
video how it was coined,

00:54:41.110 --> 00:54:43.240 align:middle line:84%
the phrase was
coined, but how did

00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:47.590 align:middle line:84%
we actually know that there's
a book of records of our life?

00:54:47.590 --> 00:54:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: We all knew as
souls prior to incarnating.

00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:58.760 align:middle line:84%
So and you might say that in
the mind of God or in quantum

00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:01.730 align:middle line:84%
time-space reality,
this is already--

00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:04.250 align:middle line:84%
we've heard this has
already happened.

00:55:04.250 --> 00:55:06.950 align:middle line:90%
It's continuing to happen.

00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:07.920 align:middle line:90%
It will happen.

00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:11.350 align:middle line:84%
It has happened, and
it's happening now

00:55:11.350 --> 00:55:12.600 align:middle line:90%
in the Eternal Now moment.

00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:15.680 align:middle line:84%
So from that
perspective, we already

00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:20.300 align:middle line:84%
knew before we came here because
that's what we were part of--

00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:26.390 align:middle line:84%
reading those records before
we came down, before each life.

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:30.400 align:middle line:84%
As a person coming into
human form, there are--

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:33.020 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure you've run
across at some point in all

00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:34.440 align:middle line:90%
of your work.

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:38.210 align:middle line:84%
There are really amazing
stories about people,

00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:40.610 align:middle line:84%
whether they're children
around the world

00:55:40.610 --> 00:55:43.610 align:middle line:84%
or whether they're grown
ups that say, yes, I

00:55:43.610 --> 00:55:46.130 align:middle line:84%
remember every single
thing about my past lives.

00:55:46.130 --> 00:55:48.290 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Can you
expunge your record

00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:50.960 align:middle line:10%
and as if something
never happened?

00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:53.674 align:middle line:10%
>>FOSS: You mean like using
the universal White-Out?

00:55:53.674 --> 00:55:54.590 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yes, exactly.

00:55:54.590 --> 00:55:58.130 align:middle line:90%


00:55:58.130 --> 00:55:58.930 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: You can.

00:55:58.930 --> 00:56:00.940 align:middle line:90%
It's not that yet--

00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:03.400 align:middle line:84%
let me make an
illustration with that.

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:08.330 align:middle line:84%
So in reference
to healing, let's

00:56:08.330 --> 00:56:10.880 align:middle line:84%
say that an individual
had something

00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:14.000 align:middle line:90%
happen in said lifetime--

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.400 align:middle line:84%
on all of their
lifetimes, which are

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:19.100 align:middle line:84%
like a great wheel
of incarnations,

00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:22.910 align:middle line:84%
the soul being in the center,
and this is the reference

00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:23.870 align:middle line:90%
in the here and now.

00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:26.480 align:middle line:84%
You are here and now, and
your main reference point

00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:27.670 align:middle line:90%
is in the here and now.

00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's say this person has done
something in another life where

00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:33.290 align:middle line:84%
they're being
tortured or there's

00:56:33.290 --> 00:56:35.330 align:middle line:84%
a great sickness or
a disease or there's

00:56:35.330 --> 00:56:39.350 align:middle line:84%
something painful or
some emotional struggle,

00:56:39.350 --> 00:56:42.560 align:middle line:84%
the soul field could
have a doorway open

00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:44.480 align:middle line:90%
to that other life.

00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And that could be streaming
through you in the here and now

00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:50.000 align:middle line:84%
and causing difficulties in
your everyday life here now.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.250 align:middle line:84%
This is an invisible
thing where people

00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:53.660 align:middle line:90%
are doing the healing work.

00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:55.940 align:middle line:90%
They're trying to get ahead.

00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Everything that they're
trying and nothing has worked.

00:56:58.190 --> 00:57:01.580 align:middle line:84%
When you've tried all
of these things in life

00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:05.030 align:middle line:84%
and nothing else seems to
work, then go to the records.

00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can something evil
put something in your records?

00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:10.920 align:middle line:84%
Where you would say,
"I didn't do that.

00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:11.930 align:middle line:90%
That's not me."

00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:12.890 align:middle line:90%
But it's there.

00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:19.490 align:middle line:10%
>>FOSS: They try to put
obstacles in your way that are

00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:22.800 align:middle line:10%
along the way in
other dimensions--

00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:25.160 align:middle line:10%
so in the astral
dimension-- that

00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:28.160 align:middle line:10%
can translate into
physical reality.

00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:31.730 align:middle line:84%
They try to manipulate
people and situations

00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:36.915 align:middle line:84%
to cause maybe a separation
or breakdown within a person.

00:57:36.915 --> 00:57:40.200 align:middle line:90%


00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:41.730 align:middle line:90%
We can supersede that.

00:57:41.730 --> 00:57:44.280 align:middle line:90%
We can always transcend that.

00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:46.770 align:middle line:84%
They can't put it
into our records.

00:57:46.770 --> 00:57:48.570 align:middle line:90%
That's not allowed.

00:57:48.570 --> 00:57:50.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bill, thanks for
being on "Beyond belief."

00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:51.600 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Thank you, George.

00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:53.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a pleasure to be
here with you again.

00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:54.094 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bill's work.

00:57:54.094 --> 00:57:57.180 align:middle line:84%
It's called "How to Read
the Akashic Records,"

00:57:57.180 --> 00:58:01.290 align:middle line:84%
Which is literally
your life in a book.

00:58:01.290 --> 00:58:05.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:10.560 align:middle line:90%
