00:00:10.635 --> 00:00:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL LICHENS:
Best way to describe

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.440 align:middle line:84%
the angelic realm is
they are ones that exist

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.690 align:middle line:90%
outside of time and space.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Are they
testing us for some reason?

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: They are.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.960 align:middle line:84%
Especially, Saint Paul has
this reminder to everyone

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.180 align:middle line:84%
to entertain strangers
because sometimes people

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.025 align:middle line:90%
entertain angels unaware.

00:00:28.025 --> 00:00:29.900 align:middle line:84%
One of the great things
about guardian angels

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.350 align:middle line:90%
is it shows we're not alone.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.520 align:middle line:84%
We're not just left
here to exist and die.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's an archangel?

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: They oversee
specifically God's realm

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.520 align:middle line:90%
and protect it.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.650 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people, when
they encounter angels,

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.170 align:middle line:84%
especially when the angels
appear in their full glory,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.690 align:middle line:90%
are immediately afraid.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they have
messages for us, Michael?

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.543 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: They do.

00:00:50.543 --> 00:00:51.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What might they be?

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.918 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: Of course, repent.

00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:56.780 align:middle line:84%
Flee from your sins,
but also return to God.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.402 align:middle line:90%
They're asking you to come back.

00:00:59.402 --> 00:01:03.333 align:middle line:90%
>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC]

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.860 align:middle line:10%
Michael J. Lichens with us, a
mysticism researcher with an MA

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.370 align:middle line:10%
degree from the University
of Chicago Divinity School.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.420 align:middle line:84%
Michael's work focuses on
the very overlooked aspects

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.710 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual life.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Michael, welcome
back to the program.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: Thank you so much
for having me again, George.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You did a great job
on Coast to Coast for us,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.050 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.925 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: Thank you.

00:01:24.925 --> 00:01:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm still getting
emails from people.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: Being on that show
was like a dream come true.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.390 align:middle line:10%
I was one of those nerdy kids
who loved Art Bell, growing up.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.120 align:middle line:10%
And when you took over-- so
it's been a dream come true.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad it went well.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
you get involved

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.010 align:middle line:90%
in the aspect of mysticism?

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: I got involved--

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.430 align:middle line:84%
pretty much from
an early age, I was

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.380 align:middle line:84%
raised in an
evangelical household

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.060 align:middle line:90%
with a very Irish Catholic--

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.605 align:middle line:90%
American Irish Catholic grandma.

00:01:47.605 --> 00:01:48.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Strict?

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: Yes.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.770 align:middle line:84%
So she would take me
to mass all the time.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And I loved-- I adored
her, so I, of course,

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.690 align:middle line:84%
wanted to learn about
her spirituality.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And that whole side of the
family, one of her daughters,

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.300 align:middle line:84%
my aunt, has psychic powers
and things of that nature.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.600 align:middle line:10%
So almost immediately,
from the time

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.010 align:middle line:10%
I could talk and
ask questions, I

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.120 align:middle line:10%
wanted to know more about that.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.260 align:middle line:10%
And then my career in
academia and editing

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.950 align:middle line:10%
just kept going
in that direction.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now one of the great
aspects of mysticism is angels.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: Yes.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the angelic
realm is fascinating.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.208 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:02:25.208 --> 00:02:27.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: Best way to
describe the angelic realm

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.080 align:middle line:84%
is they're still creatures much
like us, created by a creator,

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.260 align:middle line:84%
but they are ones that exist
outside of time and space.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.660 align:middle line:84%
So they're not bound like we are
by the laws of physics or time

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.320 align:middle line:90%
or things of that nature.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.250 align:middle line:84%
But they exist in this
eternal communion with God.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.690 align:middle line:84%
Unless they're
the fallen angels,

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.960 align:middle line:84%
that they exist in eternal
communion outside of God.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And that is where they
exist for all of eternity,

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.300 align:middle line:84%
having no place in
physics or time.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did they
fall, some of them?

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: Some of them fell,
according to scriptures,

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.748 align:middle line:84%
because Lucifer became
jealous of us humans.

00:03:02.748 --> 00:03:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was an angel.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.623 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: He was one
of the highest angels.

00:03:05.623 --> 00:03:07.900 align:middle line:90%
And his very name means light.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And he was thought to be one
of the more beautiful ones.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.020 align:middle line:84%
He after-- according
to scripture,

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.610 align:middle line:84%
after humans were
created and we were

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.580 align:middle line:84%
endowed with a physical soul
and creating God's image,

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.530 align:middle line:90%
jealousy overtook him.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And he and one-third
of the angels

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.930 align:middle line:84%
rebelled against God before
being cast into hell.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now,
because it was God,

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.660 align:middle line:84%
I have this feeling that
he allowed this to happen.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: He allowed
them to happen

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.850 align:middle line:84%
because one of the
great constants of God

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.010 align:middle line:84%
in most Western religions
is that he allows

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.080 align:middle line:90%
our free will to go about.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.910 align:middle line:90%
And even angels have free will.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.650 align:middle line:84%
It's different from
us because once they

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.710 align:middle line:84%
make a decision, due to
their eternal nature,

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.750 align:middle line:90%
it's an eternal decision.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.700 align:middle line:90%
But he allowed it to happen.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And this also
allowed, say, Michael,

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.810 align:middle line:84%
who we'll be
talking about today,

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.020 align:middle line:84%
to show his warrior spirit
and cast Lucifer down

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.190 align:middle line:90%
into the Earth.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.393 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we see
angels, Michael?

00:04:02.393 --> 00:04:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: If they want us to
see them, we absolutely can.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And they do often
show themselves to us.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So they walk among us?

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: They
can walk among us.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Scripture and
mystics have reported

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.160 align:middle line:84%
that they will sometimes
appear as just regular humans--

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.720 align:middle line:84%
the beggar, the
guy who's knocking

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.950 align:middle line:90%
on your door asking for food.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.140 align:middle line:90%
So they can appear human.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.840 align:middle line:84%
They can also sometimes
appear in their actual form,

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.860 align:middle line:90%
which is terrifying.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they testing
us for some reason?

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: They are.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Especially Saint Paul has
this reminder to everyone

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.290 align:middle line:84%
to entertain strangers
because sometimes people

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.120 align:middle line:90%
entertain angels unaware.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's a calling to
the ancient Christian idea

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.850 align:middle line:84%
of hospitality that we give
to people as much as we can.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And so we do that knowing
that they're strangers,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.100 align:middle line:84%
but they very well
might be angels.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They say we're all
assigned a guardian angel.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: Yes.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that true?

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.798 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: We are all,
each and every one

00:04:50.798 --> 00:04:52.963 align:middle line:84%
of us, assigned a guardian
angel, absolutely.

00:04:52.963 --> 00:04:54.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, does the
guardian angel have any

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:55.870 align:middle line:90%
say so with the matter?

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: [LAUGHS] I
don't know specifically

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.623 align:middle line:84%
if it's like the job
posting, but they still

00:05:01.623 --> 00:05:03.790 align:middle line:84%
have their free will to do
the will of God, so yeah,

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.880 align:middle line:90%
they do have the say in us.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.380 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know if they have
a say in each specific person.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.938 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we each
have one guardian angel?

00:05:10.938 --> 00:05:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: We each have
one guardian angel,

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.120 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes other angels
can take an interest in us.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.490 align:middle line:84%
In the Old Testament,
there was this story

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.670 align:middle line:84%
of Tobit, who Raphael,
the archangel,

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.487 align:middle line:84%
had befriended him while
disguised as a human.

00:05:25.487 --> 00:05:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
some stories that you

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.740 align:middle line:84%
may have heard about people
dealing with their guardian

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:31.540 align:middle line:90%
angels.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: Absolutely.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.000 align:middle line:84%
So one of my absolute
favorites is Padre Pio, who--

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.242 align:middle line:84%
Christian mystic extraordinaire
of the 20th century.

00:05:39.242 --> 00:05:40.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He had the stigmata.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:41.742 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: He had the stigmata.

00:05:41.742 --> 00:05:44.200 align:middle line:84%
He would also get the other
wounds of Christ on him.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, exactly.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: He would
frequently talk not just

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.030 align:middle line:84%
to his own guardian
angel, he could

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.480 align:middle line:84%
commune with other guardian
angels for other people.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And whenever anyone asked
him for prayer requests,

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.670 align:middle line:84%
he would often say just
tell your guardian angel

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:57.610 align:middle line:90%
to tell mine.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:58.750 align:middle line:90%
And they will tell me.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they'll
take care of it.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:00.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: Yeah.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And this was proven to him
when a pilgrim was coming

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.873 align:middle line:90%
to see him, and their bus had--

00:06:06.873 --> 00:06:08.290 align:middle line:84%
their breaks went
out on their bus

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:09.195 align:middle line:90%
and they were in an accident.

00:06:09.195 --> 00:06:09.995 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, jeez.

00:06:09.995 --> 00:06:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: So this woman just
prayed to her guardian angel,

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.820 align:middle line:84%
protect me and let Padre
Pio know that I'm coming,

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.050 align:middle line:90%
but I need help.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And the moment she arrived,
a few minutes later,

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Padre Pio immediately
comes over to her

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.050 align:middle line:84%
and says your guardian
angel came to me

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.550 align:middle line:84%
and told me you
were needing prayer.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.180 align:middle line:90%
Were you in an accident?

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And this happened constantly
in the confessional,

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.730 align:middle line:84%
where before people
could talk, he'd

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.210 align:middle line:84%
say your angel already spoke
to me or something like that.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a call on Coast
to Coast several years ago

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.800 align:middle line:90%
during my open line section.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And the lady was telling me
about her guardian angel.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And she was in a
car with her husband

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.950 align:middle line:84%
and they were weaving
in and out of traffic,

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.690 align:middle line:90%
and it was nighttime.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And they pulled to the
left to pass a truck.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And as they did, guess what,
a car was coming right at them

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.305 align:middle line:90%
from the other side--

00:06:59.305 --> 00:06:59.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: Oh, my gosh.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --right at them.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And she's praying, oh,
God, please, help me.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.320 align:middle line:90%
Oh, God please help me.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And I guess when you pray
to God, he sends the angels.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.240 align:middle line:84%
She said at that moment,
when she started praying,

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:19.630 align:middle line:84%
the two cars merged and went
through each other, almost like

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:20.440 align:middle line:90%
ghosts.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: Oh, my.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And one car
went the other way

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:29.050 align:middle line:84%
and they went their way,
and nobody got hurt.

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:30.635 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:07:30.635 --> 00:07:32.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: Couldn't
tell you the exact,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.510 align:middle line:84%
but it's the miracles
they can work.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Again, they're not bound
by physics like we are.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.550 align:middle line:84%
They don't-- they can change
their appearance if they need

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:40.350 align:middle line:90%
to.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:43.390 align:middle line:84%
They can move things
and move through time.

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:46.510 align:middle line:84%
I've never heard of something
quite that extraordinary.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.053 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: Oh, the heart attack.

00:07:49.053 --> 00:07:50.560 align:middle line:90%
I am sure that when he--

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.977 align:middle line:84%
I bet that person never asks
when does God answer prayers.

00:07:52.977 --> 00:07:54.935 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Favorite movie,
"It's a Wonderful Life

00:07:54.935 --> 00:07:55.760 align:middle line:90%
with Jimmy Stewart"

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: Yes.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he was there,
ready to commit suicide.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:01.450 align:middle line:90%
He was so despondent.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they
sent the angel, Clarence,

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.870 align:middle line:90%
down to save him.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:05.800 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: He did.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they get involved
in our life, don't they.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:09.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: They did.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And what I loved about that
depiction of guardian angels,

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:15.370 align:middle line:84%
he was responding not to just
Jimmy Stewart's character

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:16.300 align:middle line:90%
but everyone.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.980 align:middle line:84%
The whole town was
praying for him

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.120 align:middle line:84%
because they knew
he was in crisis.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.210 align:middle line:84%
So, in a way,
Clarence was an answer

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.280 align:middle line:84%
to a prayer hundreds
of people were

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.987 align:middle line:84%
praying, and had no idea how
their prayer would be answered.

00:08:26.987 --> 00:08:27.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, angels communicate with
people in different ways.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:32.679 align:middle line:84%
On Gaia's "Open
Minds," Belinda Womack

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:35.890 align:middle line:84%
describes a way to
contact the angelic realm.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:36.880 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:37.680 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.929 align:middle line:10%
>> So they say it begins
by saying I need help.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:43.510 align:middle line:10%
And that's the first thing.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:46.090 align:middle line:90%
I need help and I surrender.

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:49.360 align:middle line:84%
Those two words,
I surrender, make

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.940 align:middle line:84%
it so helpful for angels
to step into our movies

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:58.690 align:middle line:84%
and to help us to change
our reality because we

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:00.950 align:middle line:90%
are creating our lives.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And so if we say, I
surrender and help me,

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:11.140 align:middle line:84%
that allows these awesome,
wonderful executive producers

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.900 align:middle line:84%
to step in and to
help us to change

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:17.350 align:middle line:84%
the movie we are dreaming,
the movie we are writing.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And I am constantly
amazed throughout my life

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:26.830 align:middle line:84%
when I say, hey, I need
some help with this one.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:28.900 align:middle line:84%
Or even if I don't ask,
they know me well enough

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.190 align:middle line:90%
to know where I do.

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And the degree of creativity
to which they solve problems

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.050 align:middle line:84%
is mind-boggling
to me all the time.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:40.910 align:middle line:84%
It's like I could
have never come up

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:42.200 align:middle line:90%
with that as a solution.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.640 align:middle line:90%
That is brilliant.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:49.170 align:middle line:84%
It's far beyond anything that
we would calculate on our own.

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>> But at the same time, we're
not giving our power away.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.100 align:middle line:10%
And they really make
this is important,

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:59.870 align:middle line:10%
that they work through us,
through the concept of oneness,

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.540 align:middle line:10%
which again is
challenging for the ego

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:06.050 align:middle line:10%
to understand because the
ego thinks, hey, I'm it.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:07.714 align:middle line:90%
I'm me and you're you.

00:10:07.714 --> 00:10:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And you're over there
and I'm over here.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.830 align:middle line:90%
But really, we are all one.

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:15.590 align:middle line:90%
We are so connected.

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And so when we just ask for
help and we ask for help

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:24.720 align:middle line:90%
whatever the problem is--

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.860 align:middle line:84%
and as you know,
the more we ask,

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:32.360 align:middle line:84%
the easier it becomes
because our egos are starting

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.580 align:middle line:90%
to realize there's help for me.

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:38.360 align:middle line:84%
There's help, and the more I
ask, then that help shows up,

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.980 align:middle line:84%
and then the ego begins to
be just like a scientist.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.200 align:middle line:84%
We start to see the
proof that we are helped.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.000 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's that old saying,
Michael, knock and the door

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:50.230 align:middle line:90%
will open?

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:51.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: Yes.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:54.270 align:middle line:84%
From the New Testament,
Jesus says knock and the door

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.070 align:middle line:90%
will open.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:56.757 align:middle line:84%
Ask and it will
be given unto you.

00:10:56.757 --> 00:10:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Much like
what she just said.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:59.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: Exactly.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And I love how she
incorporates the angels

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:04.400 align:middle line:84%
because to paraphrase
John Paul II,

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.740 align:middle line:84%
guardian angels are our
personal patron saint.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.540 align:middle line:84%
They're not just
there to protect us

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:09.620 align:middle line:90%
from spiritual danger.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:13.460 align:middle line:84%
They can help us in physical
danger, but as a lot of saints,

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:14.960 align:middle line:84%
Bernard of Clairvaux,
in particular,

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.670 align:middle line:84%
noted, that he often
asked his angel

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:19.790 align:middle line:84%
to help him with studying,
to help him with virtue,

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:23.510 align:middle line:84%
to resist temptation because
they're there to protect us,

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:26.480 align:middle line:84%
but their ultimate goal
is to see us through life

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.340 align:middle line:90%
and the life beyond death.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That little
voice, Michael, we

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:34.385 align:middle line:84%
all hear in our head, could
that be our guardian angels?

00:11:34.385 --> 00:11:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: It is often
said that our guardian

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.420 align:middle line:90%
angels help us and prompt us.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:41.090 align:middle line:84%
Most of theologians
and exorcists

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:43.460 align:middle line:84%
don't believe angels are
able to read our minds.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.560 align:middle line:84%
But because these
are ancient beings,

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:49.250 align:middle line:84%
they understand human
intuition and human nature

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.448 align:middle line:84%
a lot better than we
do, so it can look

00:11:51.448 --> 00:11:52.740 align:middle line:90%
like they're reading our minds.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.310 align:middle line:84%
They're not sitting there with
a transcript of what we're

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:57.540 align:middle line:84%
thinking, but they can
influence our thinking,

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.640 align:middle line:90%
our decision-making.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.090 align:middle line:84%
Most powerfully, I think
Odile Haumonté, who

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:05.690 align:middle line:84%
is this wonderful French writer,
wrote "Encounters with Angels."

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.660 align:middle line:84%
She talks about times when
she would be going down

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.940 align:middle line:84%
a dark alley and would
just feel someone tug

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.610 align:middle line:84%
at her shoulder or something,
say, hey let's go this way.

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Be careful.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:14.720 align:middle line:90%
Don't go there.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: Exactly.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm here
today because I

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.080 align:middle line:84%
think I might have been
saved by a guardian angel.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:24.920 align:middle line:84%
I am approaching a
four-lane intersection

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:29.330 align:middle line:84%
and my light is
green, so you go.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.740 align:middle line:90%
I hear a voice in my head--

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.080 align:middle line:90%
maybe it's the angel--

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:37.100 align:middle line:84%
and the voice says don't go
through the intersection.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.140 align:middle line:84%
Don't go through
the intersection.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was so compelling,
I had my green light,

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:48.660 align:middle line:84%
cars are behind me, and
I stopped right there

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.220 align:middle line:90%
and didn't go through.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.670 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, Michael,
had I gone through--

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:56.220 align:middle line:84%
somebody went through
their red light

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.170 align:middle line:84%
and they would
have broadsided me.

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.910 align:middle line:84%
God knows what would
have happened to me.

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:04.110 align:middle line:84%
But what was that voice that
told me not to go through?

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:04.960 align:middle line:90%
Was it me?

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.902 align:middle line:84%
Am I the intuitive one or is
it an angel tipping me off?

00:13:08.902 --> 00:13:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: I think it could
be a combination of both.

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:13.470 align:middle line:84%
I think you've been
around a while.

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:15.970 align:middle line:84%
You definitely learned how to
listen to your inner voice,

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.390 align:middle line:84%
listen to your instincts,
those things that

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:20.910 align:middle line:84%
have kept the human race alive
for hundreds of thousands

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:21.840 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.505 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, there are
supernatural occurrences.

00:13:25.505 --> 00:13:27.380 align:middle line:84%
One of the great things
about guardian angels

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:28.830 align:middle line:90%
is it shows we're not alone.

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:32.325 align:middle line:84%
We're not just left
here to exist and die.

00:13:32.325 --> 00:13:33.950 align:middle line:84%
There's something
that watches over us.

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And you, George, have
a reason to live,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.655 align:middle line:84%
which is why we couldn't lose
you in that intersection.

00:13:38.655 --> 00:13:39.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:41.000 align:middle line:90%
What's an archangel?

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: An archangel is
one of the higher angels.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:48.650 align:middle line:84%
They oversee specifically
God's realm and protect it.

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:51.050 align:middle line:84%
They are oftentimes-- like
we get guardian angels,

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:54.840 align:middle line:84%
guardian angels can be
assigned to countries as well.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:59.060 align:middle line:84%
For example, at Fatima, one of
the archangels who many believe

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.210 align:middle line:84%
was also Gabriel,
identified himself

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:04.610 align:middle line:90%
as the angel of Portugal.

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:07.848 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that he was overseeing
the entire nation of Portugal.

00:14:07.848 --> 00:14:09.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was his assignment.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.182 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: It was his
assignment to look over it.

00:14:11.182 --> 00:14:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And so archangels are
almost the commanders,

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:18.260 align:middle line:84%
if you think of it, over
God's armies on Earth.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.860 align:middle line:84%
They can also-- they often play
major roles in human affairs,

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.950 align:middle line:84%
most famously, Gregory
the Great Pope of Rome

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:26.960 align:middle line:90%
in the sixth century.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:30.380 align:middle line:84%
A massive plague had moved
through the Mediterranean

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.460 align:middle line:84%
and it was hitting
Rome really hard.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And so he prayed
and did a procession

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.450 align:middle line:90%
to make the plague go away.

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And one day, he and a bunch
of onlookers looked up

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:42.002 align:middle line:84%
in what's now called
Castel Sant'Angelo--

00:14:42.002 --> 00:14:43.460 align:middle line:84%
and it was called
that because what

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.770 align:middle line:84%
did they see on top
of this ancient castle

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:48.500 align:middle line:84%
was the Archangel
Michael showing a sword

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.020 align:middle line:84%
and then taking a sword and
putting it back in its sheath,

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:54.672 align:middle line:84%
signifying to everyone that the
plague was going to be lifted.

00:14:54.672 --> 00:14:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'll talk about
Michael's sword in a moment

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.470 align:middle line:90%
because that's fascinating.

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:02.390 align:middle line:84%
So the archangels, in the
pecking order of things,

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.018 align:middle line:90%
are a little higher than angels?

00:15:04.018 --> 00:15:05.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: Yes, they are.

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.460 align:middle line:84%
They're all made with the
same dignity and grace,

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.200 align:middle line:84%
but they have
different assignments.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.810 align:middle line:84%
As you go further
up, they're closer

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.480 align:middle line:84%
to God's throne, where
you get into the thrones,

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.510 align:middle line:84%
the Dominions, the
Seraphim, and the Cherubim,

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.880 align:middle line:84%
whose entire work
is surrounding God.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they have
more angelic powers

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.930 align:middle line:90%
than regular angels?

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: They seem
to have equal powers

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:28.530 align:middle line:84%
and are made in equal
dignity, but they

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:31.110 align:middle line:84%
have greater
assignments and also can

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:32.940 align:middle line:84%
take on a more
terrifying appearance.

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:37.650 align:middle line:84%
That's where the Old Testament
describes like the Cherubim are

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:41.100 align:middle line:84%
six-winged, many-eyed,
and terrifying

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.360 align:middle line:90%
looking from description.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.908 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can an archangel
be a guardian angel?

00:15:44.908 --> 00:15:46.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: They've shown
up in the Old Testament.

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:49.590 align:middle line:90%
I mentioned Tobit and Raphael.

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Raphael was taking-- he
appeared as a human to Tobit

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.880 align:middle line:84%
and his son, Tobias, and
was just helping them

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:00.240 align:middle line:84%
through this period where
Tobias was looking for a wife.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And then only
towards the end, he

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.070 align:middle line:84%
reveals that I'm Rafael,
one of the archangels

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:06.990 align:middle line:90%
who surrounds God's throne.

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And he was assigned,
in many ways,

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:11.370 align:middle line:84%
it sounded like a love
story, but he was also

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:14.580 align:middle line:84%
assigned specifically
to look after Tobit.

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:16.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
an archangel story.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.440 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what is their role?

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: Their role-- probably
the most famous when we get

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:24.390 align:middle line:84%
around to Christmas, we'll hear
the words of the archangel to--

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:28.140 align:middle line:84%
it was Gabriel to Mary to tell
her that she would give birth

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:29.550 align:middle line:90%
to the son.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:34.457 align:middle line:84%
And that-- and he appears many
times in different connections.

00:16:34.457 --> 00:16:36.540 align:middle line:84%
He appeared, of course,
to the children of Fatima,

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:38.760 align:middle line:84%
along with the
Archangel Michael.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And then many, many Irish
Saints, particularly off

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.120 align:middle line:84%
of the coast of Ireland
at Skellig Michael,

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.300 align:middle line:84%
many monks had
encountered the archangel

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.525 align:middle line:84%
at that very space,
which is interesting

00:16:50.525 --> 00:16:52.650 align:middle line:84%
because there weren't a
lot of people in that area.

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a
religious song called "Ave"

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.220 align:middle line:90%
and it includes cherubim.

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:01.810 align:middle line:90%
What is a cherubim?

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:06.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: The cherubim are the
ones who surround God's throne.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And their job is
basically to sing

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.900 align:middle line:90%
the praise and glory of God.

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.150 align:middle line:84%
When they encounter
us, they're usually--

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they the little
things we see hovering around?

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: No, they are.

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.940 align:middle line:84%
That's how a lot of artists
depict them because--

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:20.232 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Little tiny
wings and all that.

00:17:20.232 --> 00:17:21.032 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: Yeah.

00:17:21.032 --> 00:17:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Little tiny winged
babies flying around.

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:24.880 align:middle line:84%
In the Old Testament,
they sound almost

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.349 align:middle line:84%
like ancient
terrors, which is why

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:30.960 align:middle line:84%
one of my favorite things
about biblical angels

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.480 align:middle line:84%
is they always start
with, be not afraid.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.510 align:middle line:90%
Do not fear us.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:38.212 align:middle line:84%
Which I remember
reading like, why

00:17:38.212 --> 00:17:40.170 align:middle line:84%
were people so terrified
that when you find out

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:43.020 align:middle line:84%
the descriptions of angels
and also all that power

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.240 align:middle line:84%
and light that's
suddenly in front of you,

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:48.750 align:middle line:84%
it's easy for humans to
fall into terror of them?

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:51.870 align:middle line:84%
But that they're-- at least
the ones sent by God are there

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:52.740 align:middle line:90%
to help us.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do some people
fear angels, Michael?

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: Yes.

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.542 align:middle line:84%
And I think a little
fear is healthy.

00:17:58.542 --> 00:18:00.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a-- I don't
think I'm going

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.575 align:middle line:84%
to get attacked by
a bear every day,

00:18:01.575 --> 00:18:03.450 align:middle line:84%
but when I see a bear
in the wild, of course,

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:05.770 align:middle line:84%
I get that internal sense
that's saying, OK, careful.

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:06.570 align:middle line:90%
That's--

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:07.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fight or flight.

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:07.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: Yeah.

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that has
the power to swipe my head off.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.240 align:middle line:90%
Angels are far more powerful.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.180 align:middle line:84%
They have patience,
they have everything

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.690 align:middle line:90%
they need to take us down.

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:20.050 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people, when
they encounter angels,

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:22.570 align:middle line:84%
especially when the angels
appear in their full glory,

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:24.730 align:middle line:90%
are immediately afraid.

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:28.090 align:middle line:84%
I recall one patient
who encountered an angel

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:30.370 align:middle line:84%
while his father
was on his deathbed.

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And when he saw the angelic
being, his father was at peace.

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:36.070 align:middle line:84%
He himself was
filled with terror

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:40.220 align:middle line:84%
and he wanted to run from the
room, but also what's going on?

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now you said
that Lucifer was an angel.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:43.630 align:middle line:90%
Was he an archangel?

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:44.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: He was an archangel.

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:47.410 align:middle line:84%
So he was one of
the higher angels.

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:50.860 align:middle line:84%
The other angels were of
various different powers.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Some think that Beelzebub
might have been a seraph.

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:57.190 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to tell,
but he was indeed

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:58.300 align:middle line:90%
one of the highest angels.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.520 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, his very
name means light.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.710 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes he's even
called the light bringer

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:04.540 align:middle line:90%
in the old stories.

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
pray to an angel?

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: You can
absolutely pray to an angel.

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Their goal is not so
much to act as gods

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:14.980 align:middle line:84%
but to act as intermediaries
between God and man,

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:16.270 align:middle line:90%
or to act as messengers.

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:18.580 align:middle line:84%
But your guardian
angel is a great person

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:21.110 align:middle line:90%
to pray to, to say--

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:23.080 align:middle line:84%
probably for me, what
I've learned from reading

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.455 align:middle line:84%
is that the best thing you
can say to your guardian angel

00:19:25.455 --> 00:19:27.137 align:middle line:90%
is simple gratitude-- thank you.

00:19:27.137 --> 00:19:27.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Now on Gaia's Ascension Keepers,
our friend William Henry

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:35.830 align:middle line:84%
discusses archangels, the
Seraphim, and Cherubim,

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:37.300 align:middle line:90%
as you've been talking about.

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.100 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:42.040 align:middle line:10%
>> According to this system, the
Watchers are the highest angels

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:46.150 align:middle line:10%
possible and were ruled
over by four of their own.

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:51.610 align:middle line:84%
The great angels known as
Michael, Gabriel, Raphael,

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:53.890 align:middle line:90%
and Ariel.

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:57.130 align:middle line:84%
These are among the good
watchers we will discuss,

00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:04.250 align:middle line:84%
as is Metatron, who is actually
the transformed human Enoch.

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:08.990 align:middle line:84%
The watchers are the mighty
Seraphim, the winged and fiery

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:11.600 align:middle line:84%
serpents, as they were
known, the burning ones,

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:15.650 align:middle line:84%
who formerly guarded
the gate to Eden.

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:18.560 align:middle line:10%
They came from God's
throne, where they

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.680 align:middle line:10%
served on God's divine council.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.470 align:middle line:90%
But they decided to leave.

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:27.110 align:middle line:84%
They crossed a
forbidden boundary

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:31.030 align:middle line:90%
and took on earthly bodies.

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:34.360 align:middle line:84%
In Christian art, the Seraphim
are portrayed as sixed-winged

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:38.590 align:middle line:84%
and covered with
feathers and eyes--

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:40.990 align:middle line:84%
an appropriate
attribute of those who

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:45.250 align:middle line:90%
watch or guard God's throne.

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:48.910 align:middle line:84%
Their swirling
bodies are toroidal.

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:53.410 align:middle line:84%
They are composed of
pure love and pure light.

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:57.460 align:middle line:84%
In his famous vision, Isaiah
saw the Seraphim enthroned

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.920 align:middle line:84%
above the Ark of the
Covenant in the Holy

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.100 align:middle line:90%
of Holies of Solomon's temple.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:08.910 align:middle line:84%
They stood above Yahweh as
he sat on his Ark throne.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:11.600 align:middle line:84%
They are believed to be the
same as the Cherubim of 1

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.210 align:middle line:84%
Chronicles, whose
wings were stretched

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:15.785 align:middle line:90%
above the Ark of the Covenant.

00:21:15.785 --> 00:21:18.360 align:middle line:90%


00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.360 align:middle line:10%
The root of Seraphim comes
either from the Hebrew verb

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:25.020 align:middle line:10%
seraph, to burn, or the
Hebrew noun, seraph,

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:28.770 align:middle line:10%
meaning a fiery flying serpent.

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:29.970 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For so many
different cultures

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:40.790 align:middle line:84%
have illustrated these angels
and cherubims and seraphins.

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:43.083 align:middle line:84%
It's got to tell you
something was happening.

00:21:43.083 --> 00:21:44.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: Absolutely.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Especially when you look into
all the Abrahamic faiths that

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:51.430 align:middle line:84%
came from the desert, they not
only had angels, of course,

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:54.220 align:middle line:84%
but they also would talk about
demons and other creatures

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:55.990 align:middle line:90%
of the night.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:57.940 align:middle line:84%
In some ways, it
takes the terror

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.790 align:middle line:84%
that we just naturally
feel as humans

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:05.050 align:middle line:84%
in this big chaotic universe,
and they bring order to it.

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:10.602 align:middle line:84%
They help us to see beyond just
the eat and live parts of life,

00:22:10.602 --> 00:22:12.310 align:middle line:84%
but to see that there's
something greater

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:13.990 align:middle line:90%
and bigger than us.

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the angels
still under the realm of God?

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: The angels
that stayed with God

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.150 align:middle line:84%
after the rebellion are
still under the realm of God.

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:24.550 align:middle line:84%
They still operate
under God's will.

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And they still seek
to enact his will.

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they the
messengers of deception

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:36.248 align:middle line:84%
or are they the messengers
of grand things to do?

00:22:36.248 --> 00:22:38.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: They're the
messengers of grand things

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:41.510 align:middle line:84%
even if they don't seem so
grand in our view of things.

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:44.230 align:middle line:84%
They are the messengers that
help the human race get back

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.760 align:middle line:84%
on the right path, but
there are, of course,

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:49.300 align:middle line:84%
the fallen angels
who can deceive us.

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:51.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is the Metatron?

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: Metatron is the
voice of God incarnate.

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:58.990 align:middle line:84%
So when God needed to speak
to, say, Adam and Eve,

00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:02.230 align:middle line:84%
it's thought in some mysticism
that he would send Metatron,

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:05.710 align:middle line:84%
who would act as the voice of
God, whose very voice could

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:07.760 align:middle line:90%
shatter a person's mind.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And so there was another
messenger between God and man.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:14.690 align:middle line:90%
It is fascinating.

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:15.590 align:middle line:90%
Is it not?

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:17.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: It's
very fascinating.

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:20.480 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting because
we know that God--

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.430 align:middle line:84%
in at least my
spiritual tradition,

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:25.310 align:middle line:84%
we know God uses humans
often to fulfill his will.

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:27.110 align:middle line:84%
It's so fascinating
to think about.

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:28.730 align:middle line:84%
There's a realm
beyond and something

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:31.650 align:middle line:84%
that we can't even comprehend
that's doing exactly what we're

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:32.450 align:middle line:90%
doing.

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Michael, you talked
about the sword of St. Michael.

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:37.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: Yes.

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: First of all,
explain St. Michael.

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: So Saint Michael
is probably the most famous

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:44.180 align:middle line:90%
of archangels.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.820 align:middle line:84%
You can tell by my first
name, I really like the guy.

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:51.500 align:middle line:10%
He is the one that
had casted Lucifer out

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.660 align:middle line:10%
during the rebellion
and actually slew him

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:57.320 align:middle line:10%
with a sword before casting
them down into the Earth.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:01.100 align:middle line:84%
From there, he has been known
to be a protector, a fighter.

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.250 align:middle line:84%
He's the Patron Saint of
soldiers and warriors.

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And he has appeared
throughout human history

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:08.180 align:middle line:90%
in the strangest of places.

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.850 align:middle line:84%
We mention Rome, to
talk about the plague.

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:15.735 align:middle line:84%
He's also appeared to
different mystics and people

00:24:15.735 --> 00:24:16.740 align:middle line:90%
who had seen Mary.

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:19.770 align:middle line:84%
He will often be the
forerunner before people

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:21.870 align:middle line:84%
will have Marian
visions, basically

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:26.050 align:middle line:84%
to let people prepare, be
ready for this to happen.

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And so while he's the Warrior
Saint and the archetype

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:36.060 align:middle line:84%
of a Christian Warrior, he's
also the messenger still.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:39.050 align:middle line:84%
So he still fulfills
that angelic function.

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There is a piece
that I run during Christmas

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:46.890 align:middle line:84%
on the radio show, that was
done by a great broadcaster

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:49.770 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Lee
Allen, and it is

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:52.800 align:middle line:90%
called "A Letter to Michael."

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And it depicts a soldier
writing back to his mother

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:04.770 align:middle line:84%
about the Korean War and how he
was about ready to get killed,

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:08.160 align:middle line:84%
when all of a sudden,
out of nowhere,

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Michael appears with his
sword and protects him

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:14.350 align:middle line:90%
from the enemy.

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:17.500 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazing
depiction on many things

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:18.790 align:middle line:90%
you've just illustrated.

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:19.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: Yeah.

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:20.950 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting.

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:24.040 align:middle line:84%
A couple of soldiers have
had visions of St. Michael.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:27.520 align:middle line:84%
One of the most famous, there's
called the Angel of Belgium

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.710 align:middle line:84%
that many soldiers
thought was Michael,

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:32.080 align:middle line:84%
but it was during
World War I when

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:36.010 align:middle line:84%
British had to flee Belgium
while the Germans advanced.

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And at this time,
there was a lot

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:40.660 align:middle line:84%
of crimes against humanity
happening in Belgium.

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:44.930 align:middle line:84%
We're talking crucifixions,
deep crimes against humanity.

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Horrible.

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:47.688 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: And while the
soldiers were fleeing,

00:25:47.688 --> 00:25:49.930 align:middle line:84%
they weren't sure they
were going to flee in time.

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Thousands-- I'm not
talking about just a couple

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:53.740 align:middle line:84%
of dozen-- thousands
of soldiers saw

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:57.390 align:middle line:84%
an angel appear at the German
lines holding back the Germans.

00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was Michael.

00:25:58.390 --> 00:25:59.473 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: It was Michael.

00:25:59.473 --> 00:26:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Sword unsheathed, helping
people flee and evacuate.

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:04.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is Michael
the only angel

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:06.572 align:middle line:90%
that deals with protection?

00:26:06.572 --> 00:26:08.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: All the angels
deal with protection.

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:11.050 align:middle line:84%
He seems to have a
particular love of soldiers,

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:14.260 align:middle line:84%
though, especially the
boots on the ground

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.100 align:middle line:90%
that are in the field.

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.070 align:middle line:84%
A couple other
encounters happened

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:19.840 align:middle line:84%
in World War I, where
soldiers wrote back

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.080 align:middle line:84%
that they saw Saint Michael
warning them to flee

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.600 align:middle line:84%
or telling them to
get down minutes

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.730 align:middle line:84%
before the bombs
started falling.

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:31.960 align:middle line:84%
So he takes an interest in the
low-level soldiers, it seems.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are various areas
around the country that Michael

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:35.770 align:middle line:90%
has been seen.

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:39.100 align:middle line:84%
We've got a little
depiction on the spots.

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:40.232 align:middle line:90%
He's all over the place.

00:26:40.232 --> 00:26:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: He's
all over the place.

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:44.260 align:middle line:84%
So this is what's called
the Sword of Saint Michael,

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:46.150 align:middle line:84%
and it runs in
this straight line.

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:48.760 align:middle line:84%
This has only been discovered
in the last 100 years

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.820 align:middle line:84%
that people noticed all
these monasteries associated

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.400 align:middle line:84%
with Saint Michael ran
in a straight line.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And what's even
more fascinating,

00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:01.630 align:middle line:84%
this follows the summer
equinox, so it's actually

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:03.100 align:middle line:90%
aligning with the stars.

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:04.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Michael is seasonal.

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:05.830 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:08.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: He at least keeps
an eye on the sky for us.

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that
right across the two Saint

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:14.440 align:middle line:84%
Michael's monastery-- one in
Cornwall and one in Normandy--

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:17.860 align:middle line:84%
those were two-plate
mountain, tidal mountains

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:20.890 align:middle line:84%
that you can't access them
when the tide is high.

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And Saint Michael
appeared on each spot,

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:26.020 align:middle line:84%
so of course, they built a
massive monastery to him.

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And as you get further down,
down there in Southern Italy

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.630 align:middle line:84%
is also where Saint
Michael appeared

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:34.000 align:middle line:90%
to a group of soldiers.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Right before the
Saracens invaded,

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:39.670 align:middle line:84%
he basically showed
to the small village,

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:41.500 align:middle line:84%
warned them they were
about to be invaded

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:46.970 align:middle line:84%
and to fortify their place,
and they survived the invasion.

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Michael, what does
Saint Michael look like?

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: That's
a tough question.

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:56.060 align:middle line:84%
Angels, they don't have
physical bodies like us,

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.480 align:middle line:84%
so they can often appear as
humans however they like.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.480 align:middle line:84%
But in almost all
accounts of him,

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:07.010 align:middle line:84%
he is shown to be a warrior with
a sword, depending on what--

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:10.063 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is he the only
archangel that is doing that?

00:28:10.063 --> 00:28:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: He's
the only archangel

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:14.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm aware of that appears
to humans with a sword

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:18.500 align:middle line:84%
like as if to make sure
we understand what he is.

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:22.970 align:middle line:84%
The sword itself, what's
its reasoning behind that?

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:25.100 align:middle line:84%
The sword is sacred
in a lot of ways

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:27.890 align:middle line:84%
because it was the weapon
that defeated Satan.

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:30.140 align:middle line:84%
So, in a lot of
spirituality, we like

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:33.200 align:middle line:84%
to say that we want to
be cloaked, protected

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:37.850 align:middle line:84%
by the sword of Saint Michael,
the one that slew demons.

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And by that weapon
itself, it's taken

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:44.550 align:middle line:84%
on a lot of meaning throughout
Christian mysticism, which

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:47.340 align:middle line:84%
is why when he announced to
Saint Gregory the plague was

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:50.040 align:middle line:84%
leaving, he was sheathing the
sword as if God's wrath was

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.860 align:middle line:90%
suddenly going to go away.

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Anytime he's depicted as holding
the sword in his hands, that

00:28:56.670 --> 00:29:00.960 align:middle line:84%
means battle is about to happen,
either spiritual or physical.

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do other events
occur when Saint Michael

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:08.820 align:middle line:84%
has been witnessed, like
natural tragedies or anything

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:09.620 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: Yeah.

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:11.200 align:middle line:90%
I had mentioned a--

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.780 align:middle line:84%
particularly invasions,
but he has often

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:16.690 align:middle line:84%
appeared to mystics whenever
there's been a plague.

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:19.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if he ever appeared
before COVID or anything

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:22.390 align:middle line:84%
like that, but in ancient
times, many people

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:25.270 align:middle line:84%
would see him
warning of a plague,

00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:26.962 align:middle line:84%
warning that this
was going to happen.

00:29:26.962 --> 00:29:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
in the medieval,

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:32.075 align:middle line:84%
understanding plagues was part
of God's wrath to correct us.

00:29:32.075 --> 00:29:32.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:34.750 align:middle line:90%
How about the other archangels?

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:middle line:84%
Do they have similar traits
as Michael, or is he the one?

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: He's the most
popular, the most famous.

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:47.200 align:middle line:84%
You can find authors of St.
Michael just about anywhere.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.800 align:middle line:84%
He got especially famous
in the 19th century

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.950 align:middle line:84%
when Pope Leo the 13th had
a vision of St. Michael

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:56.150 align:middle line:90%
and the devil at an argument.

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's why he
promoted the Saint Michael

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:01.437 align:middle line:84%
prayer, which many Catholics
remember praying after mass.

00:30:01.437 --> 00:30:03.520 align:middle line:84%
Saint Michael the Archangel,
protect us in battle,

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.520 align:middle line:84%
be our defense against
the wickedness and snares

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.260 align:middle line:84%
of the devil, and
that was prayed

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:12.170 align:middle line:84%
by thousands of Catholics
every Sunday for years.

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we've heard
depictions of Michael.

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:15.800 align:middle line:90%
I mentioned the one in Korea.

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:16.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: Yes.

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.090 align:middle line:90%


00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there any
boundaries to this archangel?

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:24.735 align:middle line:90%
Are there places it will not go?

00:30:24.735 --> 00:30:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: As far as I'm aware,
they'll go just about anywhere,

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.260 align:middle line:90%
talk to anyone.

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.690 align:middle line:84%
They are bound
only by God's will.

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:33.060 align:middle line:90%
So so long as it's not a--

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:36.180 align:middle line:84%
I can't imagine that any of us
would have the power to keep

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.070 align:middle line:84%
an angel out even
if we wanted to,

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:41.460 align:middle line:84%
but they, of course,
do not appear in hell.

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.970 align:middle line:84%
The only time a being
appeared in hell

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:46.840 align:middle line:84%
was Christ after
his crucifixion.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.620 align:middle line:84%
But otherwise, they don't
go-- that's not their realm.

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:51.960 align:middle line:84%
That is another realm
they do not go into.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does
Michael the archangel

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:59.350 align:middle line:84%
appear when you ask for him
or does it appear on its own?

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: He will appear
completely on his own.

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:07.550 align:middle line:84%
They are able to
act in their wills--

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:10.370 align:middle line:84%
fulfilling God's will,
but they will often

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:13.710 align:middle line:84%
appear when we do ask for them,
whether we can see them or not.

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:16.010 align:middle line:84%
So I do believe that
each time every one of us

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:20.712 align:middle line:84%
prays, say the archangel Michael
prayer, we are calling on him

00:31:20.712 --> 00:31:21.920 align:middle line:90%
and he is looking out for us.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:23.853 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about
sacred sites, Michael.

00:31:23.853 --> 00:31:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: Absolutely.

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:26.478 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
interesting sacred sites,

00:31:26.478 --> 00:31:28.190 align:middle line:84%
especially associated
with, say, Michael,

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:30.320 align:middle line:84%
is, for me, Skellig
Michael, which

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.530 align:middle line:84%
was set up by monks on
the west side of Ireland.

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:36.560 align:middle line:84%
If anyone remembers the
latest "Star Wars" movies,

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.080 align:middle line:84%
that's where Luke
Skywalker was hanging out,

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:40.190 align:middle line:90%
at Skellig Michael.

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:41.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: For the
medieval person,

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.390 align:middle line:90%
that was the edge of the world.

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:47.070 align:middle line:84%
You could not go further
west if you wanted to.

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:49.880 align:middle line:84%
So it was at the very
edge of civilization.

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And it was a perfect
place for Irish monks

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:54.710 align:middle line:84%
to set up to do
their translations,

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:56.787 align:middle line:84%
but they had a
particular devotion

00:31:56.787 --> 00:31:58.370 align:middle line:84%
to the Archangel
Michael, who was said

00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:00.320 align:middle line:90%
to appear to the first monks.

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And that is at the very tip
of the sword of Saint Michael,

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.480 align:middle line:90%
running down to Jerusalem.

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our colleague,
Freddy Silva,

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:10.820 align:middle line:84%
appeared on Gaia's "Open
Minds" about these sacred sites

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:15.550 align:middle line:84%
that apparently are awakening
humans all over the place.

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:16.350 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>> This is really
about human awakening.

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:22.610 align:middle line:84%
All of these sites are about
awakening our own consciousness

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:23.900 align:middle line:90%
and coming to know ourselves.

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:24.700 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:25.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.800 align:middle line:10%
If you go to any of the
temples around the world

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.960 align:middle line:10%
and particularly
the ones in Egypt,

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.902 align:middle line:10%
the ones in Southern India,
who are still very much intact,

00:32:32.902 --> 00:32:35.360 align:middle line:10%
they still have a lot of their
texts written on the walls--

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:38.330 align:middle line:10%
and once we sat down to decipher
what the text is saying,

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:40.940 align:middle line:10%
it's quite clear that all
of them are in agreement.

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:42.990 align:middle line:84%
There's one in Temple
of Edfu, for example,

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:45.620 align:middle line:84%
that talks about how the
temple is built to transform

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:49.070 align:middle line:84%
the person into a god, into
a bright star, which is not

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:52.130 align:middle line:84%
a bad reason to go there
in the first place.

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And other temples talk about how
these are transmutation points

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:58.520 align:middle line:84%
of the soul where heaven
connects with Earth, where

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:00.710 align:middle line:84%
the temple is a kind
of living intermediary

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:03.540 align:middle line:84%
between the physical human
and everything else that's

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:04.340 align:middle line:90%
in the cosmos.

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:07.580 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, it almost
reminds you that whenever

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:08.480 align:middle line:90%
you lose the plot--

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.630 align:middle line:84%
and we do this regularly
all the time these days--

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:14.120 align:middle line:84%
the ancestors who
built these temples

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.680 align:middle line:84%
left us the
instructions of where

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:18.440 align:middle line:84%
to go, certain hot spots
on the face of the Earth,

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.880 align:middle line:84%
where we can go
and basically tune

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:21.630 align:middle line:84%
into the rest of the
universe and find out

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:22.790 align:middle line:90%
how things really are.

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:26.480 align:middle line:84%
Get to know ourselves, get to
know the purpose of our soul.

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:30.567 align:middle line:84%
And by doing that in this kind
of quasi-shamanic environment,

00:33:30.567 --> 00:33:32.150 align:middle line:84%
then you are able
to more or less live

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:34.880 align:middle line:84%
your life with a certain
degree of self-empowerment.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And when you have that degree
of self-awareness in your life,

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.312 align:middle line:84%
no one or anything can
tell you what to do,

00:33:40.312 --> 00:33:42.020 align:middle line:84%
which is not a bad
way to live your life.

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:43.190 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it's not.

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And that has been dampened,
some can say, by intent.

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.950 align:middle line:84%
It's not an accident
that these edifices

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:55.580 align:middle line:84%
have been destroyed over
the last few thousand years,

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:56.630 align:middle line:90%
in particular.

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And there has been
a great detriment,

00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:02.330 align:middle line:84%
but the reality is, as
we're going to get into,

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:04.490 align:middle line:84%
these places are
built on sacred spots

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:07.340 align:middle line:84%
that even if the dwelling
should fall down,

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.949 align:middle line:84%
if you knew where to go, they
have the same effect on us,

00:34:09.949 --> 00:34:10.749 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:34:10.749 --> 00:34:11.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:14.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're all
harnessed with natural laws.

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:17.659 align:middle line:84%
And today, we have the
mechanism to understand what

00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:19.400 align:middle line:84%
the natural laws
they were harnessing.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.200 align:middle line:90%

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:26.889 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: The
Abrahamic faiths do.

00:34:26.889 --> 00:34:28.330 align:middle line:84%
When you get into
other religions,

00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:31.780 align:middle line:84%
you'll have intermediaries,
messengers that look--

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:34.330 align:middle line:84%
from my very layman
understanding,

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:36.429 align:middle line:90%
sound like angels to me.

00:34:36.429 --> 00:34:38.320 align:middle line:90%
Hermes is a good example.

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:41.679 align:middle line:84%
He's the God that talks to the
other gods on behalf of us.

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:44.590 align:middle line:84%
It starts to sound very angelic
when you get down to it.

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And of many places
where Saint Michael

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:50.530 align:middle line:84%
had sacred sites
built to him, were

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:53.230 align:middle line:90%
previously temples to Apollo.

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:55.840 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost as if he
came through and revealed,

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:59.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm the actual Apollo, but we're
still building on his temple.

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:01.630 align:middle line:84%
It was a sacred site
before Christianity.

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Long after Christianity,
would probably

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:05.020 align:middle line:90%
continue to be a sacred site.

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are these sites
dedicated to anything specific?

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: Usually,
an appearance

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:15.910 align:middle line:84%
or an event that
happened, many pilgrims go

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:17.858 align:middle line:84%
to Fatima or Lourdes
because that's

00:35:17.858 --> 00:35:20.025 align:middle line:84%
where the Virgin Mary and
other characters appeared.

00:35:20.025 --> 00:35:21.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Appeared, yeah.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And Lourdes is a fascinating
place all by itself, isn't it?

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:27.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: People still--

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:29.330 align:middle line:90%
I have a friend of mine--

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:31.100 align:middle line:84%
I get goosebumps
when I think of him.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:33.350 align:middle line:84%
He was the father of
my friend, Danny--

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:36.080 align:middle line:84%
went to Lourdes
after dealing with--

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.925 align:middle line:84%
trying to remember-- I
believe it was colon cancer.

00:35:38.925 --> 00:35:39.725 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, God.

00:35:39.725 --> 00:35:41.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: But healed.

00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:42.132 align:middle line:90%
He's still alive with us.

00:35:42.132 --> 00:35:42.932 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Healed?

00:35:42.932 --> 00:35:44.300 align:middle line:90%
Did he jump in the water?

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:46.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: He did
bathe in the water

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:48.920 align:middle line:84%
and he also attended mass
and did some fasting.

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.425 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't sure anything would
happen, but weeks later,

00:35:51.425 --> 00:35:53.300 align:middle line:84%
the doctor is like
everything's in remission.

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:55.230 align:middle line:90%
You're fine.

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you feel about
people who do not believe?

00:35:58.340 --> 00:35:59.870 align:middle line:90%
They don't believe in angels.

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:03.342 align:middle line:84%
They don't believe
in a higher power.

00:36:03.342 --> 00:36:04.300 align:middle line:90%
It's their prerogative.

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:04.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: Yeah.

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:05.170 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But what do you think?

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:07.930 align:middle line:84%
What are they missing
in their life?

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:10.180 align:middle line:10%
>>LICHENS: Oh, I think
some skepticism is always

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:14.010 align:middle line:10%
a little healthy, but I
think with a lot of people,

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:17.100 align:middle line:10%
it's because it's hard to
get outside of the hustle

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:18.480 align:middle line:10%
and bustle of every day.

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:21.370 align:middle line:84%
We have-- our lives
are determined

00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:23.710 align:middle line:84%
by the clock and the people
who are running the clock,

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:26.500 align:middle line:84%
so it's easy to get
caught up in the imminent

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:28.360 align:middle line:84%
without thinking
about the mystical

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.640 align:middle line:90%
because we live and die by it.

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And what I often want
to stress to people

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:37.420 align:middle line:84%
is I don't believe in
angels or the greater powers

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:39.380 align:middle line:90%
because I want a child's story.

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:40.780 align:middle line:10%
It's because I want to know--

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:43.590 align:middle line:10%
I know in my deepest heart
that there is something bigger

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:44.390 align:middle line:10%
than us.

00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:45.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
something there.

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.403 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt about it.

00:36:46.403 --> 00:36:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Do you find the
angels appear more

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:52.140 align:middle line:84%
during years and
moments of strife?

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: Based off the history
and especially the mysticism,

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.030 align:middle line:84%
like the hundreds
of encounters people

00:36:57.030 --> 00:37:00.270 align:middle line:84%
had with angels and
also Saints and ghosts

00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:02.760 align:middle line:90%
during World War I is insane.

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.710 align:middle line:10%
The Guardian ran a
piece about how many

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:06.750 align:middle line:10%
people encountered
ghosts or angels

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:10.080 align:middle line:10%
during the Western Front.

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And you think yeah,
that's probably

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:15.420 align:middle line:84%
the time we need them the
most, when we can't rely just

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:16.650 align:middle line:90%
on our own understanding.

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:18.060 align:middle line:90%
We really need them.

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's when
they deliver greatly.

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does prayer
mean to you, Michael?

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:26.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: Prayer to me is
communication but more than

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:29.700 align:middle line:84%
that, it's opening yourself
up to God in his will,

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:33.087 align:middle line:84%
to say to him whatever it is
you need of me, whatever it is

00:37:33.087 --> 00:37:35.670 align:middle line:84%
you want of me, I want to do it
even if I can't see the bigger

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:38.380 align:middle line:84%
picture because you can
see the bigger picture.

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
want to be part of.

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And so when we pray to
God or even ask his angels

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:46.590 align:middle line:84%
for assistance, we're
opening ourselves

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:48.690 align:middle line:90%
up to a lot more possibility.

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
had an angelic experience?

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:52.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: I have not.

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.210 align:middle line:90%
My grandmother did.

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:56.370 align:middle line:84%
My grandmother
swears up and down

00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:58.980 align:middle line:84%
that she was saved from
walking into oncoming traffic

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:00.507 align:middle line:84%
by an angel because
she thought--

00:38:00.507 --> 00:38:01.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pushed her aside.

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:03.673 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: Grabbed her
shoulders, pulled her back,

00:38:03.673 --> 00:38:05.565 align:middle line:90%
and there was no one around her.

00:38:05.565 --> 00:38:06.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But she felt that.

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:07.830 align:middle line:90%
She felt that.

00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:09.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: She
looked behind herself

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:11.590 align:middle line:84%
to say thank you, I
really appreciate it,

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:13.620 align:middle line:84%
and there was no
one there to thank.

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:15.540 align:middle line:84%
So she had to
instead say thank you

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:17.940 align:middle line:84%
in prayer, which was one
of the things she taught

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:20.460 align:middle line:84%
me, was always be thankful
for your guardian angel

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.920 align:middle line:84%
because you don't know how
many times they saved you.

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:26.585 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the angels
working on their own?

00:38:26.585 --> 00:38:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: They can--

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:28.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or is it
all through God?

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:29.963 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: It's all through God.

00:38:29.963 --> 00:38:31.540 align:middle line:84%
They do have some
free will, but they

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:36.430 align:middle line:84%
are working through God's
will and will generally not go

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:37.360 align:middle line:90%
against his will.

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I keep thinking
of that Nicolas Cage

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:40.842 align:middle line:90%
movie, "City of Angels."

00:38:40.842 --> 00:38:42.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: I love that movie.

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And that depicts him as a
human being but an angel.

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:49.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they really
out there like that?

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:52.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: That's an
interesting depiction of angels.

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:55.450 align:middle line:84%
What I liked about it was
that the angels had no more

00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:57.010 align:middle line:84%
understanding of
God than we did,

00:38:57.010 --> 00:39:00.430 align:middle line:84%
but they were still
fulfilling God's will.

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:02.080 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any--

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.970 align:middle line:84%
it's a great artistic
device, but I

00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:05.980 align:middle line:84%
don't know of any
mystic who has ever

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:09.040 align:middle line:84%
said that angels are just
wandering the library,

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.600 align:middle line:90%
asking the same questions.

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We heard stories
about Saint Michael

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:16.870 align:middle line:90%
getting involved in events.

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:20.320 align:middle line:90%
How often is that happening?

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: It's hard to
tell because many times, I--

00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:26.880 align:middle line:84%
many times, angels can
appear to us completely

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:29.100 align:middle line:90%
and we're completely unaware.

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:30.875 align:middle line:84%
Saints, going back
to the Old Testament,

00:39:30.875 --> 00:39:33.000 align:middle line:84%
have talked about they had
no idea they encountered

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.800 align:middle line:90%
an angel until much later.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.930 align:middle line:90%
So who knows how often?

00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:38.388 align:middle line:84%
There's a good
chance that somebody

00:39:38.388 --> 00:39:41.370 align:middle line:84%
who gave you helpful advice
or lifted your spirits one day

00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:43.620 align:middle line:90%
was just an angel in disguise.

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:45.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they have
messages for us, Michael?

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:46.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: They do.

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What might they be?

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: The
messages are often--

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.690 align:middle line:84%
depending on the
person and place,

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:55.500 align:middle line:84%
they are often a similar
message which is, of course,

00:39:55.500 --> 00:40:00.120 align:middle line:84%
repent, flee from your sins,
but also return to God.

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:03.300 align:middle line:84%
They're asking you to come
back because many of us

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:06.870 align:middle line:84%
need that wake-up call
often in our lives.

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Their messages are also of
hope that this life, whatever

00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:15.960 align:middle line:84%
travails we're having, whatever
world wars, diseases, famines,

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:17.730 align:middle line:90%
there is still hope for us.

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And again, their very existence
shows we're not left alone.

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:22.660 align:middle line:90%
We're not an accident.

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:24.000 align:middle line:90%
We are here for a purpose.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
channel an angel?

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: I don't know.

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.160 align:middle line:90%
Many people have tried.

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't know of any
successful ones.

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:32.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be
too close-minded,

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.680 align:middle line:84%
but angels will often
talk through people,

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.120 align:middle line:90%
deliver messages for others.

00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:38.910 align:middle line:84%
Padre Pio would often tell
people what their guardian

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:41.100 align:middle line:84%
angel was trying to
tell them, but they just

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:43.200 align:middle line:84%
couldn't hear, for
whatever reason.

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And he received those
messages frequently.

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:49.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who is Theo?

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:53.302 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: Theo is the
name of God in Latin.

00:40:53.302 --> 00:40:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there's also a
collectiveness of archangels

00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:00.000 align:middle line:90%
under that umbrella.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: And they are--

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.020 align:middle line:84%
that is the higher angels,
what we were talking

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:05.430 align:middle line:90%
about in a previous video.

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Those are the Thrones, the
Watchers, you might call them,

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:10.410 align:middle line:90%
who are overseeing--

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:12.390 align:middle line:90%
they are closest to God.

00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:15.240 align:middle line:84%
They literally surround
him at all times,

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:17.760 align:middle line:84%
so they know God
better than any of us.

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sheila
Gillette channels Theo.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So are you ready to say
goodbye to us and let Theo come

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:25.320 align:middle line:90%
through?

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:27.370 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, I'll see you later.

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:28.170 align:middle line:90%
OK, here we go.

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:45.690 align:middle line:90%


00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:46.710 align:middle line:90%
>> It is that beginning.

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:47.760 align:middle line:90%
Is it now?

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:49.410 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Theo.

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:52.680 align:middle line:84%
>> We are appreciative of the
opportunity to be of service

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:53.760 align:middle line:90%
unto you.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:55.570 align:middle line:90%
You may ask.

00:41:55.570 --> 00:42:00.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Theo, we would like
to open it up for you to choose

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:02.252 align:middle line:84%
who you wish to
speak to unless--

00:42:02.252 --> 00:42:03.960 align:middle line:84%
well, you know what,
first, why don't you

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:06.600 align:middle line:84%
give us your perspective
on soul integration?

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:09.300 align:middle line:84%
We just heard a little bit
from Marcus and Sheila on that.

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And just introduce the
subject a bit to our viewers

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:13.410 align:middle line:90%
before we go to the questions.

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Soul integration is
coming into the wholeness

00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:20.610 align:middle line:84%
of your being, the recognition
of the divine essence that you

00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:22.920 align:middle line:90%
are, the master that you are.

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:27.360 align:middle line:84%
This fifth dimensionary energy
is fully about the planet now.

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:30.390 align:middle line:84%
Never before have
human beings been

00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:33.990 align:middle line:84%
available to recognize
their masterhood.

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:38.670 align:middle line:84%
The fifth dimensionary energy
is a place of refined vibration

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:41.970 align:middle line:84%
that allows each
individual to recognize

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:46.320 align:middle line:84%
the divine essence,
the master, and express

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:48.070 align:middle line:90%
that in their daily life.

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:51.180 align:middle line:84%
The third dimension
being physical reality.

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:53.580 align:middle line:84%
The fourth was the
spiritual awakening.

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And now as science
speaks about as well

00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:02.680 align:middle line:84%
is the fifth-dimensional
waves if you would,

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:06.430 align:middle line:84%
on a higher frequency
level of recognition.

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:10.620 align:middle line:84%
So it is a release of
beliefs of old paradigms that

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:16.500 align:middle line:84%
no longer work any longer, that
allows for this transmutation,

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:21.090 align:middle line:84%
if you would, this homecoming
into the alignment of wholeness

00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:24.690 align:middle line:84%
or holiness, divinity
expressed fully,

00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:26.750 align:middle line:90%
unencumbered from the past.

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:27.550 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think of Sheila Gillette?

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:33.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: That's fascinating.

00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:36.543 align:middle line:84%
I knew of several Renaissance
and medieval people

00:43:36.543 --> 00:43:37.710 align:middle line:90%
who tried to channel angels.

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:39.840 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know it was still
happening in modern times.

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:40.680 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:42.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You sound like
you might have the ability

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:43.280 align:middle line:90%
to do it yourself.

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:45.893 align:middle line:90%


00:43:45.893 --> 00:43:47.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: I don't think so.

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:50.060 align:middle line:84%
My family has many
weird abilities when

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:51.920 align:middle line:90%
observing and seeing ghosts.

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.580 align:middle line:84%
I have not seen an angel,
though, or encountered one.

00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:55.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you want to?

00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:57.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: I do, but--

00:43:57.110 --> 00:43:58.190 align:middle line:90%
I do and I don't.

00:43:58.190 --> 00:43:59.810 align:middle line:84%
I do, on the one
hand, because I would

00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:04.340 align:middle line:84%
love to have that
affirmation and just

00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:06.190 align:middle line:90%
that proof for my own eyes.

00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:08.690 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, I don't want
to see an angel because they

00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:10.640 align:middle line:90%
often have to give you work.

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.392 align:middle line:84%
They often are
assigning you something.

00:44:12.392 --> 00:44:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And all I could think is if
an angel is coming to me,

00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:17.040 align:middle line:90%
they're really desperate.

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:19.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'll tell you
an interesting story.

00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:23.040 align:middle line:84%
My mother was raised
in the Boston area.

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And her parents owned a
series of apartment complexes

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:31.830 align:middle line:84%
over a furniture
store that they owned.

00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And they had four apartments all
adjoining that they lived in.

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:39.750 align:middle line:90%
And we'd go there every summer.

00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:45.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, one night, we got woken
up by a fireman with a mask

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:51.170 align:middle line:84%
on at like 3:00 in the morning,
smoke engulfing the apartment.

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And he woke everybody
up and got us all out.

00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:57.290 align:middle line:84%
There was a picture of me in
the "Fitchburg Massachusetts

00:44:57.290 --> 00:45:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Gazette" running across the
street in my little pajamas.

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:03.830 align:middle line:84%
I must have been seven
or eight years old.

00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:07.550 align:middle line:84%
But this angel, whatever it
might have been, saved us.

00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, my father went up
to the fire department

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:16.500 align:middle line:84%
after the fact because smoke
was billowing outside, and said,

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:19.820 align:middle line:84%
we want to thank that
fireman who was in there.

00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And they said we haven't
gotten in there yet.

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:25.700 align:middle line:90%
Who was he?

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: That's intense.

00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:31.250 align:middle line:10%
I can't believe I'm returning
to his name for this story,

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:33.930 align:middle line:10%
but Saint Michael is the
patron of firefighters.

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:34.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:35.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: He is.

00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:38.180 align:middle line:84%
A lot of firefighters,
especially in the Boston area,

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:40.100 align:middle line:84%
will wear a Saint Michael's
medallion on them.

00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:42.362 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: So he's--

00:45:42.362 --> 00:45:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm convinced it
was an angel that saved us.

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LICHENS: I am
too if I'm honest.

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.967 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because they said
they never went up there.

00:45:47.967 --> 00:45:50.550 align:middle line:84%
They hadn't been up
there at that point.

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:52.670 align:middle line:10%
>>LICHENS: So an
angel was looking out

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:54.950 align:middle line:10%
for you and your
family, and they did it

00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:57.650 align:middle line:10%
as they often do, in disguise,
because they don't necessarily

00:45:57.650 --> 00:46:01.030 align:middle line:10%
need our gratitude,
but that's insane.

00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:02.813 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Michael,
give out your website.

00:46:02.813 --> 00:46:04.480 align:middle line:10%
>>LICHENS: You can
find me at mlichens--

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:06.781 align:middle line:10%
looks like mlichens-- .com.

00:46:06.781 --> 00:46:09.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Michael, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:10.248 align:middle line:90%
>>LICHENS: Thank you, George.

00:46:10.248 --> 00:46:12.090 align:middle line:90%
This was a joy to share.

00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:16.780 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The man upstairs sends
angels down to protect us.

00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:19.920 align:middle line:10%
Thank God he
continues to do that.

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:27.000 align:middle line:90%
