welcome to "Beyond Belief."

Debbie Solaris is
an ET contactee,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.470 align:middle line:84%
interdimensional traveler,
galactic historian,

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.350 align:middle line:84%
and after a very faithful
extraterrestrial contact

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.350 align:middle line:84%
experience just a
few years ago, Debbie

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.050 align:middle line:84%
awakened to her true star
lineage and higher calling.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.810 align:middle line:84%
Now through her
ancestral connection

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.260 align:middle line:84%
with the Akashic records,
she's been receiving downloads

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.660 align:middle line:84%
of galactic
historical information

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.990 align:middle line:84%
and universal spiritual
knowledge ever since.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.830 align:middle line:90%
Debbie, welcome to the program.

>>DEBBIE SOLARIS: Thank
you for having me.

I'm very excited to be here.

>>NOORY: This is fascinating.

00:01:05.318 --> 00:01:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about a
galactic historian.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.578 align:middle line:90%
What is that, first of all?

00:01:09.578 --> 00:01:11.120 align:middle line:10%
>>SOLARIS: Actually,
that wasn't even

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.950 align:middle line:10%
a term I coined for myself.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.397 align:middle line:10%
It was just what people
started calling me after--

00:01:15.397 --> 00:01:16.730 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They coined the phrase.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.440 align:middle line:10%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, they
coined the phrase

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.230 align:middle line:10%
because of the
type of information

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.770 align:middle line:10%
that I was downloading
from the Akashic records.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.840 align:middle line:10%
After I had my ET contact
experience in 2012,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.420 align:middle line:10%
I found that just
kind of randomly, all

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.680 align:middle line:10%
my extrasensory perception
had increased quite a bit,

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.000 align:middle line:10%
I would say probably by 100%.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Because
before, I was just

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.250 align:middle line:90%
like a regular, ordinary human.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.580 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.510 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have any abilities.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.843 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's a regular human?

00:01:48.843 --> 00:01:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: I don't know.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:51.950 align:middle line:90%
It's just kind of weird.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.740 align:middle line:84%
But I found that I was starting
to download information

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.860 align:middle line:84%
about galactic wars and
different star systems.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm not an astronomy person.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.040 align:middle line:90%
I've never studied astronomy.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.410 align:middle line:84%
But all of a sudden, I
knew all the star systems.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.650 align:middle line:84%
I knew where they were
located, the details

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.792 align:middle line:90%
of these star systems.

00:02:13.792 --> 00:02:15.500 align:middle line:84%
I knew the history of
these star systems.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just overnight, right?

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Overnight.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:17.703 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:17.703 --> 00:02:18.620 align:middle line:90%
It was really strange.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about
this contactee experience.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.220 align:middle line:90%
What happened to you?

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Well, in 2012--

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.600 align:middle line:84%
this was probably
around probably May,

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.790 align:middle line:90%
June time period--

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.160 align:middle line:84%
I was very concerned about,
you know, things that

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.300 align:middle line:90%
were going on in the world.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.070 align:middle line:10%
And so one night I sent out a
prayer to the entire universe

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.850 align:middle line:10%
that we here on Earth
needed assistance.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.420 align:middle line:90%
We needed divine protection--

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In a big way.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: --in a very big way.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.910 align:middle line:90%
And so I sent this prayer out.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.990 align:middle line:84%
I sent it out to the
angelic realm, the--

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.300 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, I mean, anybody
I can think of.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And I was a non-believer
at the time.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.330 align:middle line:84%
I was not somebody that
believed in extraterrestrials.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.550 align:middle line:84%
My husband was more the person
that was into the paranormal.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.050 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't so much.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.640 align:middle line:90%
But I just sent this prayer out.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.603 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't-- nothing
happened for two weeks.

00:03:16.603 --> 00:03:18.020 align:middle line:84%
I was just kind
of like, oh, well.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.068 align:middle line:84%
You know, prayed,
nothing happened.

00:03:20.068 --> 00:03:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you expect
anything to happen?

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:22.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Not really.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:23.370 align:middle line:90%
I was just--

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You just
put it out there.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I just
put it out there.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.810 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't really expecting
any kind of response.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:34.070 align:middle line:84%
But in June, the first
week of June 2012,

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.830 align:middle line:84%
I had just had
minor back surgery.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.530 align:middle line:90%
I went to sleep as normal.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And when I came
to consciousness,

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.300 align:middle line:84%
I found that I was in
a different reality.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.980 align:middle line:90%
And it was not a dream.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:52.190 align:middle line:84%
It was actually much more,
I would say, intense,

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.440 align:middle line:84%
more intense than
even a lucid dream.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you say you
were physically somewhere else?

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Absolutely.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Aboard
a craft, perhaps?

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yes.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.800 align:middle line:84%
I found myself on an
extraterrestrial starship.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.355 align:middle line:90%
It was--

00:04:08.355 --> 00:04:11.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it hovering
above the planet?

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: My
understanding from what

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.140 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrials
on board that ship

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.920 align:middle line:84%
told me is that they
were in the solar system

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.150 align:middle line:84%
in an area between the
asteroid belt and Jupiter.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this contactee
experience that occurred, I

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.100 align:middle line:84%
want to get into what
the ship looked like

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.300 align:middle line:90%
and what the ETs looked like.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.467 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:30.467 --> 00:04:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But why you?

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:32.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: I don't know.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:33.970 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were there other
humans aboard the ship?

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Not any
Earth humans, no.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.100 align:middle line:90%
Not that I saw.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.180 align:middle line:90%
So you're aboard this craft.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Kind of describe first
of all the ETs, Deb.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I got
led by the ship.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.730 align:middle line:84%
The ship was kind of
like a living entity.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.620 align:middle line:90%
It was not like a metallic ship.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.400 align:middle line:84%
It was made of light and
some sort of weird materials

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.605 align:middle line:90%
that I'd never seen before.

00:04:56.605 --> 00:04:57.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But physical.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: But physical, yeah.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.570 align:middle line:84%
I was led to a room, and I
encountered about four or five

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.010 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial beings.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they looked like
the standard grays or humans?

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.230 align:middle line:90%
What did they look like?

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: They didn't
look like gray aliens,

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.940 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't
look human either.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.970 align:middle line:84%
They had larger
heads, large eyes.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.345 align:middle line:84%
I could see that
much about them.

00:05:21.345 --> 00:05:23.428 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Clearly, if they
walked down our streets,

00:05:23.428 --> 00:05:25.640 align:middle line:84%
people would say, uh,
that's not a human.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.220 align:middle line:90%
They were definitely not human.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.847 align:middle line:84%
They had more refined
features than a gray alien.

00:05:30.847 --> 00:05:32.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you were to
first glance at them,

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.763 align:middle line:84%
you would think, oh, yeah,
they're possibly grays,

00:05:34.763 --> 00:05:36.490 align:middle line:90%
but they weren't.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.030 align:middle line:90%
They had very colorful auras.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.468 align:middle line:84%
They emanated all this
love and acceptance.

00:05:42.468 --> 00:05:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did they
communicate with you?

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.060 align:middle line:90%
Telepathy?

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Telepathy, yes.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.933 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you feel at
all threatened or scared?

00:05:48.933 --> 00:05:49.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Not at all.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:50.390 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And that was kind of surprising
to me, because I mean,

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.060 align:middle line:84%
obviously, I'd never
encountered anything like this.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.480 align:middle line:90%
So you're there on this craft.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Describe what the craft
looked like inside.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: It looked
very organic, actually.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.820 align:middle line:90%
It kind of shifted and moved.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, were the
ETs sitting at control panels

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.210 align:middle line:84%
like you would expect a
pilot to sit at a plane?

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.730 align:middle line:10%
>>SOLARIS: No, it
was-- they had me

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.820 align:middle line:10%
inside what they call the
orientation room, which

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.650 align:middle line:10%
looked like kind of a futuristic
room with some chairs.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And there was a big
hologram in the room.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And they had me in the
middle of this hologram,

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.530 align:middle line:84%
and they were communicating
with me via telepathy.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And I remember asking
them, why am I here?

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:41.870 align:middle line:90%
You know, what is this?

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:42.670 align:middle line:90%
Where am I at?

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:43.800 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.710 align:middle line:90%
And why am I here?

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:45.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you get answers?

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Absolutely, yes.

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You did?

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:48.520 align:middle line:90%
Why were you there?

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: They said
they heard my prayer.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Number one, they
heard my prayer,

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:56.920 align:middle line:84%
and they were moved
by the prayer.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.590 align:middle line:84%
Number two is I was
part of their family.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:06.580 align:middle line:84%
So I was a human incarnation
of a soul that originated

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.440 align:middle line:90%
from their star system.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you there to
learn something from them,

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.270 align:middle line:84%
or were you there for
them to learn something

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.730 align:middle line:90%
about you and us?

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I think
it was probably both,

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.608 align:middle line:84%
but I would say I was there to
remember why I came to Earth.

00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Richard Dolan appeared
on one of our programs called

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.400 align:middle line:84%
"Phenomena" that
we have with Gaia,

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.590 align:middle line:84%
and he was talking
about the late Dr. John

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.680 align:middle line:84%
Mack, psychiatrist, about these
encounters similar to what

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.480 align:middle line:90%
happened to you.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Mm-hmm.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.370 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
There is little

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.950 align:middle line:10%
that can be more terrifying
for a human being than to be

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.333 align:middle line:10%
overtaken by another species.

00:07:41.333 --> 00:07:42.750 align:middle line:10%
This is what occurs
during what is

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.570 align:middle line:10%
called the phenomena
of alien abduction.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.610 align:middle line:10%
Though a highly
controversial subject,

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:49.500 align:middle line:10%
it's been studied
in depth, including

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.690 align:middle line:10%
by a leading psychologist at
Harvard University, Dr. John

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:53.490 align:middle line:10%
Mack.

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:54.720 align:middle line:10%
His findings?

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.760 align:middle line:10%
Something real is happening.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.585 align:middle line:10%
I spoke with Richard Dolan
about Dr. Mack's conclusions.

00:08:00.585 --> 00:08:01.960 align:middle line:10%
>>RICHARD DOLAN:
They'll say, oh,

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.330 align:middle line:10%
John Mack thought that
the ETs were good,

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.330 align:middle line:10%
whereas people like Bud
Hopkins and David Jacobs

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.240 align:middle line:10%
say the ETs are bad.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.150 align:middle line:10%
And it's really not
that simplistic.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:10.300 align:middle line:10%
But John Mack said, look.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:14.620 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people had very, very
frightening experiences here.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.920 align:middle line:10%
But what he pointed
out is if you

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:23.510 align:middle line:10%
are going to go through any kind
of true growth in your life,

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.930 align:middle line:10%
it's going to involve stripping
away closely held illusions.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.300 align:middle line:10%
We all grow up with illusions.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.710 align:middle line:10%
You have, I have.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.890 align:middle line:10%
Everyone listening has
grown up with false beliefs.

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.900 align:middle line:10%
And if you are going
to go beyond that

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.940 align:middle line:10%
and truly develop into
something beyond what--

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.390 align:middle line:10%
you know, this little box of
reality that you're placed in,

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:48.230 align:middle line:10%
then you have to go through a
painful process of facing down

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.862 align:middle line:10%
lies and illusions,
and it's not fun.

00:08:50.862 --> 00:08:52.070 align:middle line:10%
No one ever wants to do that.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:54.400 align:middle line:10%
And I think what
John Mack was saying

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.590 align:middle line:10%
is that this was a
component of what we call

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:01.147 align:middle line:10%
the alien abduction experience.

00:09:01.147 --> 00:09:03.230 align:middle line:10%
He didn't really like to
use the phrase abduction,

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:06.800 align:middle line:10%
but essentially, that's an
important component of it.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.740 align:middle line:10%
Now does that mean that their
intentions were all good?

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.350 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if he would even
go so far as to say that.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:16.190 align:middle line:10%
But that the repercussions
of the contact

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:20.648 align:middle line:10%
that we have with them could
result in true human growth.

00:09:20.648 --> 00:09:22.190 align:middle line:10%
And you know, when
you look at people

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:25.800 align:middle line:10%
who've had these experiences,
many of them have developed--

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.050 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: Psychic abilities.

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:29.240 align:middle line:10%
>>DOLAN: --psychic
abilities, and also interests

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.785 align:middle line:10%
that have to do with kind
of a global consciousness.

00:09:31.785 --> 00:09:32.660 align:middle line:10%
This is very typical.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:36.770 align:middle line:10%
So there's something going
on there that is not--

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:39.445 align:middle line:10%
you know, you can use
a traumatic experience

00:09:39.445 --> 00:09:40.820 align:middle line:10%
to get personal
growth out of it,

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.500 align:middle line:10%
and I think that was his point.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds like some of
the things that happened to you.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:45.457 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Absolutely.

00:09:45.457 --> 00:09:48.560 align:middle line:84%
It's dead on what
happened to me.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.890 align:middle line:84%
It's funny that he used a
word illusion, because that's

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.050 align:middle line:90%
what the Arcturians--

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:56.810 align:middle line:84%
that's what they told me they
were, the extraterrestrials I

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.610 align:middle line:90%
had encounters with--

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:00.680 align:middle line:84%
they said that a lot of
the things-- because I

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.055 align:middle line:84%
had a lot of questions about
what was happening on Earth.

00:10:03.055 --> 00:10:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the things
that they told me,

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.900 align:middle line:84%
they mentioned
the word illusion.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.550 align:middle line:84%
They mentioned it,
like, five times.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:13.580 align:middle line:90%


00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:17.300 align:middle line:84%
That the third dimensional
reality that we're in currently

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.920 align:middle line:90%
is an illusion.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:23.570 align:middle line:84%
When I was onboard the
ship, the ship struck me--

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:27.620 align:middle line:84%
just the environment there,
the colors were more brilliant.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:31.790 align:middle line:90%
The details were very sharp.

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:34.160 align:middle line:84%
It seemed more like
a hyper reality.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.140 align:middle line:90%
I had never seen that before.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:39.420 align:middle line:84%
It felt more real than you
and me sitting here right now.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:40.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Absolutely.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
were brought back,

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.283 align:middle line:84%
were you put back
in your bedroom?

00:10:44.283 --> 00:10:45.450 align:middle line:90%
Where were you brought back?

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, I
woke up in my bed.

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:48.530 align:middle line:90%
It was morning.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thinking
you had a dream?

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, yeah--
well, initially-- no,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.480 align:middle line:84%
I knew it wasn't a
dream, because it just

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.570 align:middle line:90%
seemed so strange.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:01.040 align:middle line:84%
But I was definitely, I guess,
perplexed about what happened.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.080 align:middle line:90%
I remember calling my husband.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.340 align:middle line:90%
He was away at the time.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:05.970 align:middle line:90%
And I told him--

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:07.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you emotional?

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: No.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:08.220 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.262 align:middle line:90%
I was just kind of like--

00:11:09.262 --> 00:11:13.490 align:middle line:84%
I said, I had a
strange experience.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:14.630 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't believe me.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.010 align:middle line:90%
He thought it was just a dream.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no,
this wasn't a dream.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:20.515 align:middle line:84%
This was a real--
very real experience.

00:11:20.515 --> 00:11:21.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does he
believe you now?

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:22.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: He does.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:22.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:23.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
convinced him finally?

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I think the fact
that there was so much detail

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:35.180 align:middle line:84%
to my story, because
I remember details--

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:38.990 align:middle line:84%
I remember details even today
like it happened yesterday.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:46.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I still remember
the rooms, the atrium,

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.050 align:middle line:90%
being led through the ship.

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:51.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, seeing different
spaces in the ship.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:54.350 align:middle line:84%
I still remember encountering
other extraterrestrial beings,

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:58.460 align:middle line:84%
not Arcturians, but
other species of beings.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:59.962 align:middle line:84%
I remember it all
like yesterday.

00:11:59.962 --> 00:12:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they ever
tell you what star

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:03.692 align:middle line:90%
cluster they were from?

00:12:03.692 --> 00:12:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yes,
they said they were

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:06.720 align:middle line:90%
from the Bootes constellation.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.320 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.620 align:middle line:90%
Many light years away.

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:10.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:12.350 align:middle line:90%
About 37 light years away.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Akashic records.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.010 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little bit
about what they are

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:19.180 align:middle line:84%
and what your involvement
was with them.

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Actually,
I didn't intend

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.892 align:middle line:84%
to become an Akashic
records guide or person.

00:12:24.892 --> 00:12:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just happened.

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:27.017 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: It just happened.

00:12:27.017 --> 00:12:30.760 align:middle line:90%
I just noticed that I was just--

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.890 align:middle line:84%
when they were saying
on the video clip

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.170 align:middle line:90%
that people have psychic--

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:38.650 align:middle line:84%
you know, they gained
psychic experiences, that's

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.140 align:middle line:90%
definitely what happened to me.

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:45.850 align:middle line:84%
I found my extrasensory
perception increased 100-fold

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:48.340 align:middle line:90%
after I had this experience.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.670 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing auras,
I was seeing energy,

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:56.050 align:middle line:84%
I was having
interdimensional experiences.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:57.910 align:middle line:90%
I was getting downloads.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.820 align:middle line:84%
I would meet a person and know
immediately, oh, yeah, they're

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.320 align:middle line:90%
from the Pleiades originally.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was
just kind of crazy.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know where this
information was coming from.

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:10.875 align:middle line:84%
I spent several years
I think after 2012

00:13:10.875 --> 00:13:13.000 align:middle line:84%
just trying to figure out
what was happening to me.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:13.420 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.950 align:middle line:90%
Who wouldn't?

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:18.790 align:middle line:84%
On Gaia's program
"Initiation," Matias De Stefano

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:20.990 align:middle line:84%
talked about the
Akashic records.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.790 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:24.246 align:middle line:10%
>>MATIAS DE STEFANO: My
name is Matias De Stefano,

00:13:24.246 --> 00:13:26.747 align:middle line:10%
and my purpose is to remember.

00:13:26.747 --> 00:13:28.118 align:middle line:10%
[WHOOSH]

00:13:28.118 --> 00:13:29.950 align:middle line:10%


00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:33.310 align:middle line:10%
Since I was three, I began
to remember a past life

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:35.620 align:middle line:10%
before I was born.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:39.250 align:middle line:10%
I thought this was normal, until
many years later I realized

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:42.580 align:middle line:10%
people cannot see
what I could see.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:45.220 align:middle line:10%
Usually at this age,
the brain begins

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.580 align:middle line:10%
to disengage with
other dimensions,

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:52.480 align:middle line:10%
but mine stayed active,
and still is today.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.570 align:middle line:10%
This part of my brain
that is still active

00:13:55.570 --> 00:14:00.330 align:middle line:10%
allows me to remember
in full detail the past

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:05.460 align:middle line:10%
and connect me with the cosmic
memory that unites us all.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:09.090 align:middle line:10%
Through these visions,
I see people and places

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:11.070 align:middle line:10%
and important things.

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:13.290 align:middle line:10%
These visions help
me piece together

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:15.940 align:middle line:10%
the existence of
not only humans,

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:18.018 align:middle line:10%
but the universe itself.

00:14:18.018 --> 00:14:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Similar to what
happened to you, Debbie?

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I would say it's
exactly what happened to me.

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:23.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.120 align:middle line:90%
What are the Akashic records?

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: The Akashic records
is a higher dimensional

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:36.720 align:middle line:84%
storehouse of
cosmic information--

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: About us?

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.353 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: About us.

00:14:38.353 --> 00:14:41.450 align:middle line:84%
About everything that
happens in the universe.

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And I always say this,
and I stand by it.

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:48.920 align:middle line:84%
All of us have access
to the Akashic records.

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:52.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why it's so
easy for me to access them.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.740 align:middle line:84%
Maybe because of what
happened similar to Matias.

00:14:54.740 --> 00:15:02.000 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just able to download
the information much easier.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And like he mentioned, it's
kind of like I see a movie.

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:08.000 align:middle line:84%
I see a movie in
my head, you know?

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.060 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm doing a
reading for a client,

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:13.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm accessing their
particular records.

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.090 align:middle line:84%
I use their full
name and birth date.

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:16.340 align:middle line:84%
That's all I need,
and I will be able--

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:17.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And off you go.

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:17.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: And off I go.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:18.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:19.462 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:15:19.462 --> 00:15:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: They call
it the book of life.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:22.700 align:middle line:84%
That's what the Bible
used to call it.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.325 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what
they were referring

00:15:24.325 --> 00:15:25.760 align:middle line:90%
to as the Akashic records.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:31.880 align:middle line:84%
But it's kind of like an
intergalactic, cosmic computer

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.990 align:middle line:84%
system that contains every
single information that's ever

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:41.480 align:middle line:84%
happened in the past, future,
present, alternate dimensions,

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:46.310 align:middle line:84%
alternate parallel
lives, different star

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:48.870 align:middle line:90%
systems, everything.

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you erase the
Akashic records and rewrite it?

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.830 align:middle line:90%
Or is it what it is?

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I think
it's mostly what it is.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:59.540 align:middle line:84%
You can certainly
set new intentions.

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:00.980 align:middle line:90%
I do that a lot for clients.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:04.788 align:middle line:84%
You can set new intentions
for clients and their records.

00:16:04.788 --> 00:16:06.830 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if there's
anything that actually

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:11.930 align:middle line:84%
can be erased, but I do
think that we can certainly

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.330 align:middle line:84%
set new intentions for
clients to have a much more

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:17.420 align:middle line:90%
productive and fulfilling life.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Since we're born,
from the moment we're born,

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:23.870 align:middle line:84%
Debbie, does our life go
into this Akashic record?

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:25.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Absolutely.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.310 align:middle line:90%
Even before we're born.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who's recording it?

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.440 align:middle line:90%
Or does just life do it?

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: My understanding,
there is Akashic guides.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.100 align:middle line:10%
The extraterrestrials
that I met onboard

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:40.310 align:middle line:10%
the ship told me that
I have an ancestral

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:42.350 align:middle line:10%
connection to the
Akashic records, which

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:45.320 align:middle line:10%
is why I'm able to access them.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:51.890 align:middle line:84%
But I do think there are higher
dimensional etheric beings that

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:54.500 align:middle line:90%
maybe tend to the records.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.560 align:middle line:84%
But it's basically, I
think, a part of source.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
difference between

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:03.600 align:middle line:84%
galactic Akashic records
and other Akashic records,

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.532 align:middle line:90%
or is it all one in the same?

00:17:05.532 --> 00:17:07.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I would say
they're one in the same.

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:12.430 align:middle line:10%
I think it depends on
your ability to access--

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:14.099 align:middle line:10%
it's like various levels.

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:15.145 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:17:15.145 --> 00:17:16.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: So you
have, you know,

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.310 align:middle line:84%
kind of the Earth-level
Akashic records,

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:26.720 align:middle line:84%
which I think most Akashic
readers operate from the Earth

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.820 align:middle line:90%
level, which is fine, you know?

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:31.010 align:middle line:90%
That's where they're at.

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:34.280 align:middle line:84%
I tend to operate in the
higher levels, you know?

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.880 align:middle line:84%
So I go way deeper
into the records.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
glad this experience

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:41.390 align:middle line:90%
happened to you, Deb?

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:42.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yes, I am.

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No downsides
at all here?

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:49.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: There's
been some downsides.

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:54.190 align:middle line:84%
I can't say my life was perfect
after I had this experience.

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:56.630 align:middle line:84%
It went through a
lot of ups and downs.

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because
of the experience?

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Not because
of the experience itself,

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:05.270 align:middle line:84%
but maybe because of my
reaction to the experience.

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:10.490 align:middle line:84%
I felt a lot of depression after
I had my ET contact experience,

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:14.630 align:middle line:84%
because I went from being
in the higher dimensions

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.910 align:middle line:84%
back to third
dimension, and I didn't

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:19.050 align:middle line:84%
understand why I was back
in the third dimension.

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:22.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's very similar
to an NDE-type--

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.010 align:middle line:84%
you know, somebody
has an NDE go through.

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:25.970 align:middle line:90%
It made my--

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:30.320 align:middle line:84%
I guess my 3D life a
little more difficult,

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.967 align:middle line:84%
because I was having
these experiences

00:18:31.967 --> 00:18:33.050 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't explain it.

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:34.717 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now you do
readings for people.

00:18:34.717 --> 00:18:35.517 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Right.

00:18:35.517 --> 00:18:36.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain what they are.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:37.943 align:middle line:90%
And what do you call them?

00:18:37.943 --> 00:18:39.320 align:middle line:90%
Starseed readings?

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I do galactic
Akashic readings,

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:48.710 align:middle line:84%
and I have quite a few
clients across the world that

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:51.020 align:middle line:90%
contact me for readings.

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.580 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these
clients are people

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:57.410 align:middle line:84%
that, like Matias
was mentioning,

00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:01.040 align:middle line:84%
that they're starting to
get memories, you know?

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.450 align:middle line:90%
They're starting to have--

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Similar
experiences to you, right?

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:07.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Somewhat, yeah.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Or they're just starting
to have random visions

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:13.700 align:middle line:84%
and they're starting to
see extraterrestrials,

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:15.030 align:middle line:90%
and they're wondering why.

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And so they'll contact
me for a reading,

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:21.220 align:middle line:84%
and I'll help them
guide through why they

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:22.960 align:middle line:90%
are having these experiences.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, what's
happening with them?

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now you're going
to do a reading on me.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: I am, yes.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.045 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you need
what kind of information?

00:19:29.045 --> 00:19:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I actually
have it already.

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do?

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: I do.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:32.777 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who gave it to you?

00:19:32.777 --> 00:19:33.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: I looked it up.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:34.310 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, all right.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Used
Google [INAUDIBLE]..

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:36.630 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:38.480 align:middle line:90%
So how do we begin?

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: OK.

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:42.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do a little
bit of a space clearing

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:44.780 align:middle line:84%
before we get started,
just to make sure

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.780 align:middle line:84%
that we have only the
highest vibrations around us.

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.820 align:middle line:84%
Usually when I start off, I
do a divine heart triangle,

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:54.410 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to be connecting
my heart chakra to yours, just

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:55.760 align:middle line:90%
to connect with your energy.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.850 align:middle line:84%
We do the space clearing,
I'll do the pathway prayer,

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:00.350 align:middle line:84%
and I have your
name and birth date.

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:01.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: So you want
to go ahead get started?

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:02.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:03.330 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:04.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: OK.

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:07.300 align:middle line:90%


00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.460 align:middle line:84%
Only the highest vibrations
of love and light

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.770 align:middle line:84%
can be in this space
and all objects

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:16.930 align:middle line:84%
in this space for the highest
good of George Ralph Noory.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:22.420 align:middle line:84%
For this reading today, all
other energies must leave now.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.940 align:middle line:84%
I call in the highest
level of the divine that

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.210 align:middle line:84%
knows that love is the power and
the truth from which we read,

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:31.090 align:middle line:84%
the highest level guides
and angels of George Ralph

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:35.940 align:middle line:84%
Noory and myself to help
us with this reading.

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Archangel Michael, hold this
space for us, and so it is.

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And so we do acknowledge
the forces of light,

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.260 align:middle line:84%
asking for guidance,
direction, and courage

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:48.480 align:middle line:84%
to know the truth as it is
revealed for our highest

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:52.230 align:middle line:84%
good and the highest good
of everyone connected to us.

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:59.820 align:middle line:84%
Oh Holy Spirit of God, help
me to know George Ralph

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.430 align:middle line:84%
Noory in the light of
the Akashic records

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:05.520 align:middle line:84%
to see George Ralph
Noory in the eyes

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:06.960 align:middle line:90%
of the lords of the records.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And enable me to share
the wisdom and compassion

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.210 align:middle line:84%
that the masters,
teachers, and loved ones

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:16.410 align:middle line:90%
have for George Ralph Noory.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:18.140 align:middle line:90%
OK, the records are now open.

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:23.340 align:middle line:90%


00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.580 align:middle line:84%
OK, George, I don't know if
anybody's ever told you this,

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.430 align:middle line:84%
but you're not
originally from Earth.

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:31.230 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason
why I think you're

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:34.470 align:middle line:84%
very interested in the
paranormal and the things

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:37.740 align:middle line:84%
beyond, because you didn't
originate from this star

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:38.850 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Part of what Dolores
Cannon, who wrote "The Three

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Waves of Volunteers
and the New Earth,"

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:46.620 align:middle line:84%
she talks about
three generations

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.870 align:middle line:84%
of volunteers that came here
to Earth to help with the Earth

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:50.670 align:middle line:90%
ascension.

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And I knew Dolores.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:53.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:57.110 align:middle line:84%
She was a wonderful lady from
the same star system as me.

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:58.380 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There you go.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:06.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: But she talks
about the first wavers, OK?

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:08.380 align:middle line:84%
So since you were
born in 1950, you're

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.660 align:middle line:90%
a very early first waver, OK?

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.360 align:middle line:84%
You came in kind of
more the beginning

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:16.450 align:middle line:90%
of these waves of volunteers.

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:18.535 align:middle line:84%
So what this tells
me about you is

00:22:18.535 --> 00:22:22.840 align:middle line:84%
you are a soul that has had
probably a few incarnations

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.360 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth.

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.100 align:middle line:90%
You're very experienced.

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:30.640 align:middle line:84%
You came from different
star systems originally.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.760 align:middle line:84%
You've had experiences
in those star systems.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:39.230 align:middle line:84%
But the George that's here now
is here on a bigger mission,

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:41.800 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:46.060 align:middle line:84%
What I picked up as far as your
origins is you came from a star

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:47.510 align:middle line:90%
system called Lyra.

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:48.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Lyra.

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.580 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Lyra.

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:50.650 align:middle line:90%
Originally, OK?

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:52.570 align:middle line:84%
You've been to several
star systems, OK?

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:58.420 align:middle line:84%
So Lyra is very important,
because it is where everything

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.650 align:middle line:90%
began in this galaxy.

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:03.670 align:middle line:84%
So when we started this
deep experimentation

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:06.670 align:middle line:84%
into physicality-- so we went
from the higher dimensional,

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:07.960 align:middle line:90%
etheric realms.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:11.140 align:middle line:84%
We're all part of source,
so we separated from source.

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:12.850 align:middle line:84%
You were part of
a soul group that

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:16.360 align:middle line:84%
was assigned to the
galactic center, which

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.290 align:middle line:84%
is located between
Scorpio and Sagittarius.

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: OK?

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:27.070 align:middle line:84%
So there was a group of beings
known as the co-creators who

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:30.460 align:middle line:90%
created the Lyra system.

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:36.780 align:middle line:84%
They created planets and
locations for physical life

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.340 align:middle line:90%
to begin.

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:42.900 align:middle line:84%
When this occurred, you as
part of this oversoul group,

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:46.710 align:middle line:84%
you incarnated into
the Lyra system, OK?

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:48.830 align:middle line:90%
I do see--

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:52.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to see which
planet you were on.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.687 align:middle line:90%
I think it was Avion.

00:23:55.687 --> 00:23:57.770 align:middle line:84%
That's the name of the
planet that you originated.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:58.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The planet Avion?

00:23:58.890 --> 00:23:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Avion.

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:04.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: You, I think--

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:09.980 align:middle line:84%
you didn't have the typical
Lyran experience, OK?

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why I say that
is because most Lyran people,

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:15.640 align:middle line:90%
when they were first created--

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.780 align:middle line:84%
these were higher dimensional
humans, by the way.

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:21.880 align:middle line:84%
They weren't third
dimensional humans.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:25.960 align:middle line:84%
They were a very
simple race of people.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Most of them were
agricultural, OK?

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:32.140 align:middle line:84%
You did not have that
agricultural experience.

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On that planet?

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: On that planet.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:41.470 align:middle line:84%
The planet evolved, I think, and
they started having technology.

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing that
you were connected

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:46.360 align:middle line:84%
to the technology
of that planet,

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:50.680 align:middle line:84%
that because you had
certain skill sets maybe

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:58.930 align:middle line:84%
in communication or in certain
technological propensities,

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:05.490 align:middle line:84%
you were pulled away from your
family to work in the new Lyran

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:07.150 align:middle line:90%
starfleet, OK?

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:11.530 align:middle line:84%
They did have enough technology
where they had starships.

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:13.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing you on
board a starship.

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:15.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So I was a
space-faring individual, huh?

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, you were, yeah.

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:21.640 align:middle line:84%
You traveled-- you
traveled a bit.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:24.503 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe my interest
in UFOs got started that way.

00:25:24.503 --> 00:25:25.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Absolutely.

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:26.350 align:middle line:90%
I would think so.

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:29.620 align:middle line:90%


00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:31.690 align:middle line:84%
I talk about this a
lot in my readings,

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:35.830 align:middle line:84%
but Lyra was this beautiful
paradise planet or paradise

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:41.950 align:middle line:84%
star system that got brutally
attacked by a neighboring star

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:43.810 align:middle line:90%
system called Draco, OK?

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:47.590 align:middle line:84%
This is where we get our concept
of draconians and reptilians.

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:48.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.255 align:middle line:90%
Were they obliterated?

00:25:50.255 --> 00:25:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: They
obliterated the system.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My people, basically.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:57.470 align:middle line:84%
They say 50 million Lyrans lost
their lives during the war.

00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:58.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 50 million?

00:25:58.700 --> 00:25:59.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: 50 million.

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:05.320 align:middle line:84%
They completely annihilated, I
think, at least three planets.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:10.180 align:middle line:84%
You, I think, survived the
wars, but somehow your ship

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:11.260 align:middle line:90%
got circumvented.

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:13.450 align:middle line:90%
You were headed to Sirius.

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:17.620 align:middle line:84%
That was where-- I think your
ship evacuated some people.

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:21.100 align:middle line:84%
You were being chased
by a draconian fleet.

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing that you were
supposed to go to Sirius,

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.830 align:middle line:84%
but you got circumvented
and you ended up

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:29.290 align:middle line:90%
in the Orion belt stars.

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:32.980 align:middle line:84%
In Orion, I'm seeing that
you were in the middle belt

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:36.490 align:middle line:90%
star, which I think is Alnilam.

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:41.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing that you got involved
with the Orion liberation

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.420 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Orion was a very
large star system.

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:49.270 align:middle line:84%
It's still a very
large star system.

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:53.080 align:middle line:84%
It has a lot of stars,
and it's kind of

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.910 align:middle line:84%
like the melting
pot of the galaxy,

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:56.860 align:middle line:84%
because there's many
different races of beings

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:59.740 align:middle line:84%
that live there, some of them
benevolent and some of them

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:00.820 align:middle line:90%
not.

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And so there was definitely a
more of a duality consciousness

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:10.230 align:middle line:84%
in Orion, and there was a lot
of conflicts, a lot of wars

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:11.223 align:middle line:90%
for millions of years.

00:27:11.223 --> 00:27:13.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I'm right in
the middle of all of that.

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:14.432 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: You are, yeah.

00:27:14.432 --> 00:27:15.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:16.080 align:middle line:90%
That's me.

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:20.210 align:middle line:84%
You have-- and I think
even your zodiac sign,

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:21.620 align:middle line:90%
you're a Gemini, right?

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:23.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, I am.

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: So you have the
duality within yourself

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:30.390 align:middle line:84%
that you're constantly
trying to resolve.

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:34.050 align:middle line:84%
But what's really great
about being a Gemini

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:36.660 align:middle line:84%
is that you're a
well-integrated soul.

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:41.140 align:middle line:84%
You understand your feminine
side, your masculine side.

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:43.320 align:middle line:84%
You understand the light
aspects of yourself,

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.310 align:middle line:90%
the dark aspects of yourself.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:47.460 align:middle line:90%
You are a great communicator.

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing that you
worked in intelligence

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:55.720 align:middle line:84%
with the Black League resistance
fighters in the Orion system.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.930 align:middle line:84%
I always call the belt
stars the good zone,

00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:01.470 align:middle line:84%
because these were people that
wanted to achieve their freedom

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:04.920 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted to achieve unity
consciousness within the Orion

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.150 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:10.320 align:middle line:84%
But they were constantly
fighting against the outlier

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.880 align:middle line:90%
stars in the Orion system--

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:18.270 align:middle line:84%
Rigel, Bellatrix,
Betelgeuse-- that all

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:21.510 align:middle line:84%
wanted to control the
entire system, OK?

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:22.800 align:middle line:90%
Including the belt stars.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you tell how
my life came to an end

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.813 align:middle line:90%
during that period?

00:28:28.813 --> 00:28:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: They're
saying that you

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:34.150 align:middle line:84%
went on a reconnaissance mission
and your ship got shot down.

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:34.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, boy.

00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:36.140 align:middle line:90%
That's how I went, huh?

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:37.205 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:28:37.205 --> 00:28:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, at least
I went out as a hero.

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: You did.

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:42.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did I have family?

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yes, you did.

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now where may they be?

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: They were in
the Alnilam, which is--

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And according, Debbie,
to our time, when might this

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:55.340 align:middle line:90%
have occurred?

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:58.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: This was likely at
least a million years ago when

00:28:58.570 --> 00:28:59.370 align:middle line:90%
this happened.

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:00.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:01.040 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: You've been
here on Earth for a while.

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:04.322 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, we
don't have the time

00:29:04.322 --> 00:29:06.440 align:middle line:84%
to get into a full
Akashic reading.

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:09.620 align:middle line:84%
But you've been
here for a while.

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:13.370 align:middle line:84%
You've been here on
Earth for a long time.

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:17.900 align:middle line:84%
What I'm seeing is eventually
in consequent reincarnations

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:22.550 align:middle line:84%
in Orion, Orion did manage to
achieve unity consciousness.

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:27.560 align:middle line:84%
So you, as this, I guess,
compassionate soul, you know,

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.720 align:middle line:84%
wanting to be of
service, you wanted

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.460 align:middle line:84%
to do the same thing
for planet Earth,

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:32.687 align:middle line:90%
and that was your mission.

00:29:32.687 --> 00:29:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's still
my mission, I think.

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: It is.

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:35.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to look at
a clip from Raymond Tarpey

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:40.640 align:middle line:84%
who talked with Regina
Meredith on "Open

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:44.900 align:middle line:84%
Minds" about the universe
and how it's inhabited.

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:46.537 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Absolutely.

00:29:46.537 --> 00:29:47.870 align:middle line:90%
>>RAYMOND TARPEY: It is endless.

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:50.480 align:middle line:10%
It is a universe of worlds.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:55.190 align:middle line:10%
What Casey talks about is a
habitation of all the realms

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:57.440 align:middle line:10%
now invisible to us.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.930 align:middle line:10%
We think they are uninhabited.

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:04.160 align:middle line:10%
He talked about the solar
system specifically,

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:07.640 align:middle line:10%
and he comes through with
a new version of astrology

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:12.890 align:middle line:10%
where Mars is inhabited right
now by billions of souls.

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:14.210 align:middle line:10%
So are Venus.

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:15.410 align:middle line:10%
All the planets.

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:17.270 align:middle line:10%
All of them are inhabited.

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:20.810 align:middle line:10%
But they are in the realm
of dark matter and dark

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:24.350 align:middle line:10%
energy, which our quantum
physicists are finally

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:27.170 align:middle line:10%
learning about and
realizing that they're

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:31.130 align:middle line:10%
starting to sound like a bunch
of spiritual philosophers now,

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:34.850 align:middle line:10%
talking, trying to explain
the standard model,

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:38.330 align:middle line:10%
their standard model which
grew from their attempt

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:41.960 align:middle line:10%
to understand everything
that's going on here.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:45.170 align:middle line:10%
And now it's going into realms
that they'd never predicted

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:46.173 align:middle line:10%
would happen.

00:30:46.173 --> 00:30:48.590 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: Let me ask you a
question at that point, then.

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:52.280 align:middle line:10%
If these beings, these
thousands and thousands of souls

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:55.090 align:middle line:10%
are living on Mars
and Venus, is there

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:59.517 align:middle line:10%
a migration back and forth
between Earth for them and--

00:30:59.517 --> 00:31:00.350 align:middle line:10%
>>TARPEY: Lifetimes.

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:01.680 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: Lifetimes
of inhabiting Earth--

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.260 align:middle line:10%
>>TARPEY: So he
said your astrology

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:09.560 align:middle line:10%
is from a recent sojourn in Mars
or a recent sojourn in Venus.

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.350 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what the
nature of that life is,

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:17.510 align:middle line:10%
but it seems to be a vibration
and a whole other realm

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:21.620 align:middle line:10%
of being that we don't know
about, because as the quantum

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:29.720 align:middle line:10%
physicists now say, most of
the matter and the energy

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:34.910 align:middle line:10%
of the universe is unseen by us,
our senses, or the instruments

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:36.530 align:middle line:10%
that we've created to sense.

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:37.988 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: So that
means they have

00:31:37.988 --> 00:31:40.190 align:middle line:10%
to be existing within,
for lack of a better term,

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:41.270 align:middle line:10%
other dimensional fields.

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:42.470 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Correct.

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:44.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think of that?

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:45.890 align:middle line:90%
Is he spot on or not?

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I think he's pretty
close to the truth, yes.

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:51.680 align:middle line:84%
Because when I look
in the records,

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:55.670 align:middle line:84%
I see multitudes
of star people that

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:57.500 align:middle line:90%
live in alternate dimensions.

00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:59.230 align:middle line:84%
The reason why I
think our scientists,

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:03.060 align:middle line:84%
they look out in the space
and they can't find anything

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:05.150 align:middle line:84%
is because they're looking
in the third dimension.

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:07.297 align:middle line:84%
Most of these beings
live in higher demand.

00:32:07.297 --> 00:32:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Other dimensions,
so we can't tell.

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:10.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happened
to you, your experience?

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:16.160 align:middle line:84%
How would you tell
a human how they

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.320 align:middle line:84%
can live their life without
that kind of experience

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:20.120 align:middle line:90%
you went through?

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:23.240 align:middle line:90%


00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:25.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I think my story
is every person's story.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:28.360 align:middle line:84%
I think maybe I'm a
prototype for what

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:31.030 align:middle line:90%
humanity is going towards.

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:33.190 align:middle line:90%
We all have these abilities.

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:36.585 align:middle line:90%
I'm not unique, you know?

00:32:36.585 --> 00:32:41.710 align:middle line:84%
I struggle with same human
issues everybody else does.

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:45.850 align:middle line:84%
But I think I just had an
extraordinary experience.

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:50.410 align:middle line:84%
What I usually tell
my clients is in order

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:55.180 align:middle line:84%
to access the higher realms, you
need to raise your vibration.

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:58.750 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, there's many ways
you can raise your vibration.

00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:01.690 align:middle line:90%
Some of us like to meditate.

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:03.040 align:middle line:90%
That's what I do.

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:07.030 align:middle line:84%
Some of us like
to eat good foods

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:10.150 align:middle line:90%
or take care of our bodies.

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Maybe listen to higher
vibrational music.

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:18.980 align:middle line:90%
And by doing this--

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:20.920 align:middle line:84%
and maybe being out
in nature as well.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.740 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of my clients
enjoy nature, you know?

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:26.650 align:middle line:90%
They say they feel better.

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:29.230 align:middle line:84%
If we can raise our vibration
and just start really

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:32.020 align:middle line:84%
listening to the little
voice within us, you know,

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:34.990 align:middle line:84%
this little teeny
voice that maybe we've

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:37.180 align:middle line:84%
drowned out through
the monkey mind

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:42.310 align:middle line:84%
or through years of programming
that we're not supposed

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:43.780 align:middle line:90%
to trust ourselves, you know?

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:45.970 align:middle line:84%
That we're supposed to
put our trust in something

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:47.590 align:middle line:90%
outside of ourselves.

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:52.060 align:middle line:84%
In doing that, I think
they too can have access

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:55.600 align:middle line:84%
to those higher realms,
to their higher guidance.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you hopeful
for humanity, Deb?

00:33:57.970 --> 00:33:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: I am, actually, yes.

00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:02.186 align:middle line:90%


00:34:02.186 --> 00:34:04.240 align:middle line:10%
I think that--

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:05.950 align:middle line:10%
I see it across the--

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:09.670 align:middle line:10%
I have a lot of clients
across the globe right now.

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:11.290 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people are awakening.

00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:14.650 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are realizing
that the status quo no longer

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:16.239 align:middle line:90%
works.

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:18.159 align:middle line:84%
They want to create
a better reality.

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:20.570 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them are anxious
to get on their own mission,

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:22.900 align:middle line:84%
so that's why they
come to me in order

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.190 align:middle line:90%
to figure out what that is.

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:25.565 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
keep helping them.

00:34:25.565 --> 00:34:26.920 align:middle line:90%
How do people get a hold of you?

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:29.350 align:middle line:10%
>>SOLARIS: They can reach
me through my website.

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:32.949 align:middle line:10%
I'm at www.debbiesolaris.com.

00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:34.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: S-O-L-A-R-I-S?

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:35.409 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Mm-hmm.

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:36.209 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:34:36.209 --> 00:34:37.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: And I'm
also on YouTube,

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:40.570 align:middle line:84%
so they can contact
me from there as well.

being on "Beyond Belief."

you for having me.

00:34:48.982 --> 00:34:53.270 align:middle line:10%
She was abducted back in
2012, and it changed her life,

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:56.110 align:middle line:10%
but maybe it's
also changed ours.

00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:59.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
