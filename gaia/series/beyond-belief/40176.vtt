>> [Background Music]

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think many people
today don't know what

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.841 align:middle line:90%
to believe anymore.

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>> People are basically
going to keep

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.379 align:middle line:84%
on help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.781 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:16.716 align:middle line:84%
>> We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:18.885 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told the
entire story.

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:27.961 align:middle line:84%
>>George Noory: And
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:29.796 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:32.432 align:middle line:84%
You know practically every
computer we have has an

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:36.269 align:middle line:84%
antivirus system on
it called McAfee.

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:40.006 align:middle line:84%
Well, the McAfee is sitting
right next to me John McAfee.

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:41.341 align:middle line:90%
John, welcome to the program.

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:42.342 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:43.276 align:middle line:84%
>> George McAfee:
Thank you George.

00:00:43.276 --> 00:00:44.044 align:middle line:84%
I'm great to have
to be here sir.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:44.744 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Good to see you.

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:45.779 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you indeed.

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:47.747 align:middle line:84%
What an incredible
career you have had.

00:00:47.747 --> 00:00:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Well, I have some ups
and downs and certainly a lot

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.120 align:middle line:84%
of tangents and it's been a wild
ride for me and I've enjoyed it.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.389 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: When you
started off were you

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:57.724 align:middle line:90%
into computers as a kid?

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.793 align:middle line:90%
Did they have computers--

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:01.861 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: When I was a kid,
they didn't have computers.

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Actually, one of the
first computers ever,

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.333 align:middle line:90%
ever made was a computer made

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.135 align:middle line:84%
by General Electric
called the GPAC.

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:12.038 align:middle line:84%
And it was used for
process automation.

00:01:12.038 --> 00:01:15.275 align:middle line:84%
I was fortunate enough to get
a job with General Electric,

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:17.143 align:middle line:84%
the first year that
they came out.

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:18.945 align:middle line:84%
There was no software
engineering at that time.

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:20.747 align:middle line:84%
There were no programs
in school--

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:22.148 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Amazing.

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:23.683 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: And General Electric
did their own education programs

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:27.087 align:middle line:84%
so I went through a very
intensive software engineering

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:30.357 align:middle line:84%
school at G.E. This is at--
while I was in grad school--

00:01:30.357 --> 00:01:31.491 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Learning as you went--

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:32.492 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Learning as I
went along and I've been

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:33.860 align:middle line:90%
in computers ever since.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.628 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Now, at what point

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:39.099 align:middle line:84%
in your career did you started
dabbling in the software

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:41.668 align:middle line:90%
with the antivirus because--

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:43.603 align:middle line:84%
I mean who would even
know there was a virus

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:45.071 align:middle line:90%
to defend at that time?

00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:47.741 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Well, I didn't
to be quite frankly.

00:01:47.741 --> 00:01:51.644 align:middle line:84%
A virus was discovered in 1986
called the Pakistani Brain.

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:53.747 align:middle line:84%
It was the world's
first computer virus.

00:01:53.747 --> 00:01:55.148 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Developed?

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:57.817 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Developed by a two
brothers in Lahore, Pakistan.

00:01:57.817 --> 00:02:00.653 align:middle line:84%
For an odd place for such
technology to come from

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:04.257 align:middle line:84%
but no one had conceived
to the concept of a program

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:06.426 align:middle line:84%
that could replicate
itself and moved

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:08.561 align:middle line:84%
and that's what a
electronic computer viruses.

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:12.699 align:middle line:84%
It's a piece of software that
acts like a bacteria or a virus.

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.634 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What do they
want to do with the virus?

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:17.971 align:middle line:84%
I mean what-- each
virus has a plan, right?

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:20.306 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: None of
them are good.

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:25.512 align:middle line:84%
The Lahore brothers wrote into
the programs of a procedure

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:27.514 align:middle line:84%
to wipe out everything
on the hard disk.

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:28.314 align:middle line:90%
They thought it was fun.

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:29.816 align:middle line:90%
And funny it was--

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:31.284 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: A little game.

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:32.619 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: It was a game.

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:33.920 align:middle line:84%
It was not funny to the people
who encountered the virus.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.589 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, when I first heard
of it which was about a day

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:40.527 align:middle line:84%
after it was first discovered,
I called a friend, got a copy,

00:02:40.527 --> 00:02:43.496 align:middle line:84%
took a look at it and suddenly,
I saw how did they did it.

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And I go wow, what an
incredibly beautiful technique

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.967 align:middle line:90%
because it was.

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:49.903 align:middle line:84%
In terms of software
engineering,

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:51.905 align:middle line:90%
it was beautifully engineered.

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:54.641 align:middle line:84%
No one had ever conceived
to the concept before.

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:57.444 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
I saw how it was done.

00:02:57.444 --> 00:02:58.578 align:middle line:90%
I saw huh!

00:02:58.578 --> 00:03:00.814 align:middle line:84%
Well this is how you can
stop this or cure this.

00:03:00.814 --> 00:03:03.249 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote a little
program, put it out on--

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:04.484 align:middle line:84%
we didn't have the
internet then,

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:06.486 align:middle line:90%
we have bulletin board systems.

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:07.587 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: OK.

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:08.721 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: And, you
know, within a month,

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:10.356 align:middle line:84%
everyone in the world
had a computer program

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:11.424 align:middle line:90%
and the rest is history.

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:13.059 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And it was
fighting that virus.

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:14.394 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: They got
rid of that virus, yes.

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:15.361 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That is amazing.

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:16.896 align:middle line:84%
And at what point,
did you decide

00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:18.898 align:middle line:90%
to form the company McAfee?

00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:20.733 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Well, it was when
the next virus came out.

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:23.069 align:middle line:84%
It was virus called
the Jerusalem.

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:24.404 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: They keep coming.

00:03:24.404 --> 00:03:25.472 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: They keep
coming and also

00:03:25.472 --> 00:03:27.073 align:middle line:90%
from the same part of the world.

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:28.775 align:middle line:84%
But the second one was
the Jerusalem virus

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:30.176 align:middle line:84%
and it was a very
odd little thing.

00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:32.078 align:middle line:90%
This is before we had Windows

00:03:32.078 --> 00:03:35.181 align:middle line:84%
and everything was
texted on the monitor.

00:03:35.181 --> 00:03:37.584 align:middle line:84%
It made all the letters
fall into a jumble

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:39.319 align:middle line:90%
at the bottom of your screen.

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.388 align:middle line:84%
Another very interesting
virus, so at that time,

00:03:42.388 --> 00:03:46.292 align:middle line:84%
everyone had downloaded
my program for the Brain.

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:49.629 align:middle line:84%
It took about two days and
I wrote another program

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.563 align:middle line:84%
for the Jerusalem
and at that point,

00:03:51.563 --> 00:03:53.666 align:middle line:84%
I knew that the world
needed this

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:54.934 align:middle line:84%
because this is not
going to stop.

00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:56.302 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: You know
this is amazing.

00:03:56.302 --> 00:03:57.637 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Not going to stop
and it doesn't and it hasn't.

00:03:57.637 --> 00:04:00.406 align:middle line:84%
There are thousands and
thousands of viruses

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:01.975 align:middle line:84%
that have been written
in the interim.

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:05.979 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: John, is it--
today is that a virus person

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:09.182 align:middle line:84%
versus an antivirus
person every other day

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:12.552 align:middle line:84%
because I noticed I'm getting
updates almost every other day

00:04:12.552 --> 00:04:13.153 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:04:13.153 --> 00:04:13.720 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Yes.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.854 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes, it is.

00:04:14.854 --> 00:04:17.390 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's almost
an unofficial war going

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.491 align:middle line:84%
on between-- if you want
to call them the good guys

00:04:19.491 --> 00:04:20.493 align:middle line:90%
and the bad guys depending

00:04:20.493 --> 00:04:21.861 align:middle line:84%
on which sides you
happen to be on--

00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:22.862 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That's right, right.

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:23.963 align:middle line:84%
McAfee: Right, but
keep in mind many

00:04:23.963 --> 00:04:25.932 align:middle line:84%
of the virus writers
have political agendas.

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:27.133 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Uh-hmm.

00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:28.701 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: They-- They
feel that there are some--

00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:32.772 align:middle line:84%
some slight or some wrong
in some world government

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:35.041 align:middle line:84%
that they're trying to
readdress, you know,

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:38.211 align:middle line:84%
by bringing down the central
computer systems, what have you.

00:04:38.211 --> 00:04:41.014 align:middle line:84%
On the other side, we
look at them as vandals

00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:43.082 align:middle line:84%
because they are
destroying our work.

00:04:43.082 --> 00:04:46.052 align:middle line:90%
So there is a war going on.

00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:47.387 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: To create a virus

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:51.391 align:middle line:84%
to let's say shutdown the
power grid, that's being worked

00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:53.593 align:middle line:84%
on now I think by
rogue nations isn't it?

00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:54.127 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Of course.

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:55.228 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:04:55.228 --> 00:04:56.629 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And we're
probably doing it too.

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:58.864 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Well, if we aren't, I
would be very surprised George.

00:04:58.864 --> 00:05:02.468 align:middle line:84%
Of course and what happen
is the anti has been up.

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:05.405 align:middle line:84%
If you think a couple of Lahore
hackers in Pakistan or Russia

00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:07.340 align:middle line:84%
or where have you,
they're going to do

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.576 align:middle line:84%
so much damage even though
the damage they can do is

00:05:09.576 --> 00:05:10.977 align:middle line:90%
still great.

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:14.514 align:middle line:84%
If you take a government with
all of its resources and money

00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:17.050 align:middle line:84%
and technical capabilities,
what would come

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.185 align:middle line:84%
out will be horrible
beyond belief.

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:20.553 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Do you
ever see the day

00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:24.757 align:middle line:84%
where another country would
shutdown, the satellite systems,

00:05:24.757 --> 00:05:29.362 align:middle line:84%
the computers and everything of
a country they're going after?

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:30.763 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Yes, absolutely.

00:05:30.763 --> 00:05:35.201 align:middle line:84%
And I think-- I think it would
be done by countries like China

00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:39.606 align:middle line:84%
or possibly Russia that that go
way beyond the technical aspect

00:05:39.606 --> 00:05:42.575 align:middle line:90%
of viruses and computer crime.

00:05:42.575 --> 00:05:45.712 align:middle line:84%
And they have merited with the
science of human engineering.

00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:48.948 align:middle line:84%
OK. And human engineering
is merely the science

00:05:48.948 --> 00:05:50.717 align:middle line:90%
of taking people and going--

00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:54.087 align:middle line:84%
this is how they're going to
behave in a certain condition.

00:05:54.087 --> 00:05:55.855 align:middle line:90%
You know, they'll watch you.

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:57.323 align:middle line:90%
Let's say we want to put a virus

00:05:57.323 --> 00:05:59.759 align:middle line:84%
in George Noory's
computer, how do we do it?

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.561 align:middle line:84%
Well, I would watch
you for a while--

00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:02.695 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Learn.

00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:04.330 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: I would see
what's your habits are,

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:05.832 align:middle line:90%
what sort of foods you ate.

00:06:05.832 --> 00:06:07.033 align:middle line:90%
Are you a curious man?

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:08.034 align:middle line:90%
Are you not a curios man?

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:09.402 align:middle line:84%
If you're a curious
for example--

00:06:09.402 --> 00:06:10.103 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Do I go to the
ATM a lot?

00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:11.437 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Right.

00:06:11.437 --> 00:06:13.473 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you're a curious man,
I would take a thumb drive

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:16.109 align:middle line:84%
and drop it in front of your
car with a little label on it.

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:18.144 align:middle line:84%
And let's say your favorite
thing is flying saucers

00:06:18.144 --> 00:06:21.247 align:middle line:84%
and I would say flying saucer
research, little label.

00:06:21.247 --> 00:06:22.982 align:middle line:84%
I guarantee you're going to
put that in your computer.

00:06:22.982 --> 00:06:24.183 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That's right.

00:06:24.183 --> 00:06:25.685 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: As soon as you
do, I own your computer.

00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:26.386 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It's got me.

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:27.353 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: It's got you.

00:06:27.353 --> 00:06:29.822 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a very
simple example.

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:31.891 align:middle line:90%
You can imagine how more complex

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:36.062 align:middle line:84%
and subtle examples would
be impossible to circumvent.

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:37.730 align:middle line:84%
So this is how they're
getting in.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:42.535 align:middle line:84%
It's not by trying to solve
or unravel our encryptions,

00:06:42.535 --> 00:06:44.037 align:middle line:90%
or to bypass some firewall.

00:06:44.037 --> 00:06:46.739 align:middle line:84%
No. This is defined as
[inaudible] with access

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:50.143 align:middle line:84%
to the system and
compromising her own computer.

00:06:50.143 --> 00:06:51.411 align:middle line:90%
This is how it happens.

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:54.013 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I've got a personal
e-mail and I use Yahoo.

00:06:54.013 --> 00:06:55.415 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Yes.

00:06:55.415 --> 00:07:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I noticed a couple of
days ago, I had an email from me

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.455 align:middle line:90%
with some trashy stuff on it.

00:07:02.455 --> 00:07:03.589 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:05.591 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I didn't send it.

00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:06.926 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: No of course--

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:08.661 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: -- but it clearly
had my email address on it.

00:07:08.661 --> 00:07:09.896 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Absolutely.

00:07:09.896 --> 00:07:10.463 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: What happened?

00:07:10.463 --> 00:07:11.264 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: OK.

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.231 align:middle line:90%
This is a very common thing.

00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:13.733 align:middle line:90%
OK. Sometimes it's malicious,

00:07:13.733 --> 00:07:17.070 align:middle line:84%
sometimes there's a
business reason behind it.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:21.207 align:middle line:84%
What happened is you got unto a
website and downloaded a cookie

00:07:21.207 --> 00:07:24.077 align:middle line:84%
which transferred your
entire contact list

00:07:24.077 --> 00:07:26.045 align:middle line:90%
to someone or a hacker.

00:07:26.045 --> 00:07:26.979 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: OK.

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:28.247 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: That contact
list now,

00:07:28.247 --> 00:07:32.485 align:middle line:84%
now he knows your email
address and all of your contacts

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:35.655 align:middle line:84%
and you are also in the
contact list as yourself,

00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:37.724 align:middle line:84%
then everybody is
going to get an email.

00:07:37.724 --> 00:07:39.959 align:middle line:84%
Now, maybe a little bit be an
email saying something like

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:42.628 align:middle line:84%
"Gosh, I tried this new"
whatever, "this new diet

00:07:42.628 --> 00:07:43.663 align:middle line:90%
and I loss 30 pounds."

00:07:43.663 --> 00:07:44.497 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And they
think it's from me?

00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:45.665 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Anything is from you.

00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:47.266 align:middle line:84%
And we trust you
so they go "Gosh,

00:07:47.266 --> 00:07:48.401 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go out
and buy it now."

00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:50.002 align:middle line:84%
And there's a link at
the bottom of the page

00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:52.472 align:middle line:90%
to order it for 99.95.

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:55.441 align:middle line:84%
That's one example or maybe
there's this malicious people

00:07:55.441 --> 00:07:57.377 align:middle line:84%
and they enjoy making
your day, you know--

00:07:57.377 --> 00:07:58.211 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Miserable.

00:07:58.211 --> 00:07:59.612 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: -- a miserable day.

00:07:59.612 --> 00:08:02.014 align:middle line:84%
And so they send dirty pictures
through all of your friends--

00:08:02.014 --> 00:08:03.049 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Oh, God.

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:03.883 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: -- with
your name attached.

00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:05.017 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: So my network people--

00:08:05.017 --> 00:08:06.119 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: To your
network people and so on.

00:08:06.119 --> 00:08:08.287 align:middle line:84%
And so it's happened
to a lot of my friends.

00:08:08.287 --> 00:08:09.522 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: How did they get that?

00:08:09.522 --> 00:08:12.091 align:middle line:84%
How did they get the ability
to use my email address?

00:08:12.091 --> 00:08:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Because-- Because
here is the issue George,

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:18.431 align:middle line:84%
you run applications and you
access websites that store--

00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:19.499 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: -- on your
computer programs.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.268 align:middle line:84%
This is-- This is the way
the world is working now

00:08:22.268 --> 00:08:23.569 align:middle line:90%
and it's really dangerous.

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:26.939 align:middle line:84%
These programs have the
ability to contact the owner

00:08:26.939 --> 00:08:28.641 align:middle line:84%
or the person who
wrote the program.

00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:29.976 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: OK.

00:08:29.976 --> 00:08:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: So it goes into
your drive because it's running

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.745 align:middle line:84%
on your computer, he can
access whatever he wants,

00:08:33.745 --> 00:08:36.749 align:middle line:84%
get your contact list
and send it home.

00:08:36.749 --> 00:08:41.387 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Now, outside of
dumping my Yahoo address,

00:08:41.387 --> 00:08:42.955 align:middle line:90%
how do I fight that personally?

00:08:42.955 --> 00:08:44.724 align:middle line:90%
Do I change my password?

00:08:44.724 --> 00:08:46.359 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Well, that happens.

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:48.194 align:middle line:84%
What you have to do
is be more cautious.

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:49.429 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you an example.

00:08:49.429 --> 00:08:50.897 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I need John
McAfee over on my computers?

00:08:50.897 --> 00:08:51.597 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Right.

00:08:51.597 --> 00:08:52.832 align:middle line:90%
You, the other thing--

00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:56.002 align:middle line:84%
on my software or you maybe
need some little advice.

00:08:56.002 --> 00:08:57.737 align:middle line:84%
For example, do you
have a smart phone?

00:08:57.737 --> 00:08:58.805 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yes.

00:08:58.805 --> 00:08:59.772 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: And an
iPhone or an Android?

00:08:59.772 --> 00:09:00.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah, Android.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.841 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: An Android.

00:09:01.841 --> 00:09:04.410 align:middle line:84%
OK. Now, I recommend that
you go and download the Bank

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.712 align:middle line:90%
of America banking application.

00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:08.448 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not you have an
account doesn't really matter.

00:09:08.448 --> 00:09:09.282 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: OK.

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:10.383 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: And you install it,

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:11.551 align:middle line:84%
it's an app that runs
on your smart phone.

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:12.952 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right, right.

00:09:12.952 --> 00:09:16.322 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: And instead of just
saying I agree to all the terms

00:09:16.322 --> 00:09:18.825 align:middle line:84%
and conditions which
we all do, read them,

00:09:18.825 --> 00:09:20.560 align:middle line:84%
specifically the
one referencing--

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.994 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I've never
read any of them.

00:09:21.994 --> 00:09:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Let me tell you
why you need to George.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.333 align:middle line:84%
Then look at the one
that says camera.

00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:27.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.202 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: OK.

00:09:29.202 --> 00:09:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: And it will say
"By agreeing to these terms,

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.940 align:middle line:84%
you give the Bank of
America application the right

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:38.010 align:middle line:84%
to access your camera
and microphone at anytime

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.614 align:middle line:84%
without us having to notify
you that we're doing it now."

00:09:41.614 --> 00:09:43.049 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: While that
phone is on.

00:09:43.049 --> 00:09:45.384 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: While that phone is
on at any point, they can turn

00:09:45.384 --> 00:09:46.619 align:middle line:90%
on the camera and look at you

00:09:46.619 --> 00:09:48.354 align:middle line:84%
or whatever your
camera is pointing at.

00:09:48.354 --> 00:09:49.689 align:middle line:90%
If you have a front and back,

00:09:49.689 --> 00:09:51.090 align:middle line:84%
they can choose which
one to go to.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:51.924 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Unbelievable.

00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:53.025 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Why do they do that?

00:09:53.025 --> 00:09:54.460 align:middle line:90%
It's very obvious.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.294 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:09:55.294 --> 00:09:56.963 align:middle line:90%
I have a Bank of America account

00:09:56.963 --> 00:10:00.633 align:middle line:84%
and I do banking
applications on my smartphone.

00:10:00.633 --> 00:10:02.034 align:middle line:90%
I'm having rough times.

00:10:02.034 --> 00:10:05.171 align:middle line:84%
I empty my account and then call
the banks that I didn't do it.

00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:06.305 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:10:06.305 --> 00:10:07.907 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: The bank goes
it sure looks like you,

00:10:07.907 --> 00:10:09.041 align:middle line:90%
we have a picture

00:10:09.041 --> 00:10:10.476 align:middle line:84%
of you actually doing
it and we've got the--

00:10:10.476 --> 00:10:11.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: We got you.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:12.645 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Yeah,
and we've got you.

00:10:12.645 --> 00:10:16.115 align:middle line:84%
So you can see why, however,
it spooks me out George

00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:19.685 align:middle line:84%
because if the Bank of
America can do it, anybody can.

00:10:19.685 --> 00:10:22.989 align:middle line:84%
And look at you will find that
over half of the applications

00:10:22.989 --> 00:10:25.958 align:middle line:84%
that you are running, you have
given the right to either turn

00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:30.029 align:middle line:84%
on the microphone whenever they
want or the camera or both.

00:10:30.029 --> 00:10:31.764 align:middle line:90%
Why? Think about why.

00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:32.465 align:middle line:90%
I mean if I--

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:33.165 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Unbelievable.

00:10:33.165 --> 00:10:34.267 align:middle line:90%
There's too many apps.

00:10:34.267 --> 00:10:35.334 align:middle line:84%
Look at the NSA, look
what they're doing.

00:10:35.334 --> 00:10:36.369 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: If I am
Russian spy-- pardon?

00:10:36.369 --> 00:10:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Look what
the NASA is doing.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:38.437 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Absolutely,

00:10:38.437 --> 00:10:40.206 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't even
need to be the NASA.

00:10:40.206 --> 00:10:43.242 align:middle line:84%
We're giving the role
the right to spy on us

00:10:43.242 --> 00:10:46.345 align:middle line:84%
by our blind acceptance
of terms and conditions

00:10:46.345 --> 00:10:47.380 align:middle line:90%
which we don't bother to read.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:48.314 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Nobody reads it.

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:49.649 align:middle line:90%
Nobody reads it.

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: You need to start
and the world needs to start

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.653 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise, we're going
to have some serious problems.

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Unbelievable.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.388 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: So try it out.

00:10:55.388 --> 00:10:56.722 align:middle line:84%
This would be proof
in the pudding.

00:10:56.722 --> 00:11:00.092 align:middle line:84%
Get the application on the
Android, click on terms--

00:11:00.092 --> 00:11:01.894 align:middle line:84%
because you can read
them if you want.

00:11:01.894 --> 00:11:04.463 align:middle line:84%
And it will tell you why by--
yes, you're giving us the right

00:11:04.463 --> 00:11:05.965 align:middle line:84%
and we don't have to tell
you when we're doing it.

00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:07.833 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Are we too
technologically advanced

00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:09.235 align:middle line:90%
these days?

00:11:09.235 --> 00:11:13.406 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Yes, because we were
more technologically advanced

00:11:13.406 --> 00:11:17.510 align:middle line:84%
than our custom and
conditioning allows.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:20.646 align:middle line:84%
If the world is going
to change radically

00:11:20.646 --> 00:11:21.480 align:middle line:90%
over the next few years--

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.515 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Unbelievable.

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:23.916 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: -- and
not to our benefit,

00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:26.586 align:middle line:84%
somebody who is very smart, very
powerful is going to take all

00:11:26.586 --> 00:11:29.288 align:middle line:84%
of these capabilities
and suddenly,

00:11:29.288 --> 00:11:31.390 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be
puppets on the string.

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:33.292 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Let's talk a
little bit about your company

00:11:33.292 --> 00:11:34.627 align:middle line:90%
about some of the bizarre things

00:11:34.627 --> 00:11:36.629 align:middle line:84%
that have happened
to you in your life.

00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:37.863 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Yes.

00:11:37.863 --> 00:11:40.066 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So you have
McAfee software antivirus--

00:11:40.066 --> 00:11:41.167 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Yes.

00:11:41.167 --> 00:11:43.502 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: The companies
grows, what happens?

00:11:43.502 --> 00:11:47.139 align:middle line:84%
You sell out or somebody buys
you that way, what happens?

00:11:47.139 --> 00:11:49.475 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: What happen
is I think if you look

00:11:49.475 --> 00:11:53.379 align:middle line:84%
at the early days of McAfee, we
were the fastest growing company

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:55.281 align:middle line:90%
in the world ever recorded.

00:11:55.281 --> 00:11:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And why? I didn't
have a sales force.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.685 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Privately held
at that time, right?

00:11:59.685 --> 00:12:02.121 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Yeah, it was
privately held for two years

00:12:02.121 --> 00:12:05.091 align:middle line:84%
and I took it public and
ran it for two more years.

00:12:05.091 --> 00:12:06.225 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: OK.

00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:07.393 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: But it even
privately and publicly,

00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:09.261 align:middle line:84%
it was the fastest
growing company.

00:12:09.261 --> 00:12:11.497 align:middle line:90%
Our profit margin is pretaxed

00:12:11.497 --> 00:12:13.866 align:middle line:84%
for 96 percent, that
I've heard of.

00:12:13.866 --> 00:12:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Huge.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.468 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Huge.

00:12:15.468 --> 00:12:16.569 align:middle line:84%
Why? We didn't have
a sales force.

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:18.204 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have a
marketing force.

00:12:18.204 --> 00:12:22.241 align:middle line:84%
All we had were people who took
orders on the phone and staff

00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:23.709 align:middle line:90%
that wrote the software.

00:12:23.709 --> 00:12:27.613 align:middle line:84%
It was a new; it was a
completely new approach

00:12:27.613 --> 00:12:28.981 align:middle line:90%
to business.

00:12:28.981 --> 00:12:31.517 align:middle line:84%
We didn't-- we didn't put out
disks or paper or anything,

00:12:31.517 --> 00:12:33.619 align:middle line:84%
the software was
downloaded from our system.

00:12:33.619 --> 00:12:34.954 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And you made one--

00:12:34.954 --> 00:12:37.089 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: And we gave it
and we gave it away for free.

00:12:37.089 --> 00:12:40.192 align:middle line:84%
If you wanted to keep it, if
you wanted updates, you tell us

00:12:40.192 --> 00:12:41.694 align:middle line:90%
and you sign up for updates

00:12:41.694 --> 00:12:44.330 align:middle line:84%
which we charge you
by the month for.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:45.398 align:middle line:90%
The--

00:12:45.398 --> 00:12:46.465 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: That's how
you made the money?

00:12:46.465 --> 00:12:47.633 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: That's how
we made the money.

00:12:47.633 --> 00:12:49.735 align:middle line:84%
And the first year,
there were four employees

00:12:49.735 --> 00:12:51.804 align:middle line:84%
and we have 11 million
dollars in revenue.

00:12:51.804 --> 00:12:53.973 align:middle line:90%
And that's just kept going on.

00:12:53.973 --> 00:12:55.174 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Unbelievable.

00:12:55.174 --> 00:12:57.176 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: So it was a lot
of fun because it was--

00:12:57.176 --> 00:13:00.346 align:middle line:84%
it was high technology and it
was things that I truly enjoyed

00:13:00.346 --> 00:13:05.584 align:middle line:84%
than working with companies
directly on infections

00:13:05.584 --> 00:13:08.621 align:middle line:84%
that they would get and
solving their security issues.

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:12.124 align:middle line:84%
After four years, we had
thousands of employees.

00:13:12.124 --> 00:13:13.926 align:middle line:90%
We had personnel issues.

00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:15.094 align:middle line:90%
I had stockholders.

00:13:15.094 --> 00:13:16.862 align:middle line:84%
I had board of directors
meetings.

00:13:16.862 --> 00:13:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And you're
an entrepreneur.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:18.964 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: I'm not entrepreneur.

00:13:18.964 --> 00:13:20.099 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Entrepreneurs
don't like that stuff like?

00:13:20.099 --> 00:13:21.701 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: No, it was
like it was a nightmare.

00:13:21.701 --> 00:13:23.869 align:middle line:84%
I dreaded getting up and
going to work in the morning.

00:13:23.869 --> 00:13:27.006 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting at a table,
some long mahogany table

00:13:27.006 --> 00:13:30.710 align:middle line:84%
and everybody's got these
stuffy suits on and stern looks

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:33.112 align:middle line:84%
and I am explaining
why our margins are

00:13:33.112 --> 00:13:34.613 align:middle line:84%
up one percent or
down another bit.

00:13:34.613 --> 00:13:35.581 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And they don't get it.

00:13:35.581 --> 00:13:36.782 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: And they
don't get it.

00:13:36.782 --> 00:13:37.917 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is interested
in the short term but what

00:13:37.917 --> 00:13:39.185 align:middle line:90%
about this quarter's earnings.

00:13:39.185 --> 00:13:40.553 align:middle line:90%
Who cares?

00:13:40.553 --> 00:13:42.722 align:middle line:84%
Where I'm worrying about our
earnings three years from now

00:13:42.722 --> 00:13:44.490 align:middle line:90%
because we have to survive.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:48.027 align:middle line:84%
The American business
environment is

00:13:48.027 --> 00:13:50.096 align:middle line:90%
so focused on them now.

00:13:50.096 --> 00:13:52.364 align:middle line:90%
I want my returns today.

00:13:52.364 --> 00:13:55.067 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the world is
looking at 20 years from now.

00:13:55.067 --> 00:13:56.802 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: That's right,
China like-- it's like China.

00:13:56.802 --> 00:13:58.104 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Like China.

00:13:58.104 --> 00:13:59.605 align:middle line:84%
That's why-- it's why it's
hard to compete with China,

00:13:59.605 --> 00:14:01.173 align:middle line:90%
if we're worried about today.

00:14:01.173 --> 00:14:04.276 align:middle line:84%
So after-- after a couple of
years, after going public ago,

00:14:04.276 --> 00:14:06.345 align:middle line:90%
"I'm not enjoying this anymore."

00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:07.046 align:middle line:90%
I'm not.

00:14:07.046 --> 00:14:08.247 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I want out.

00:14:08.247 --> 00:14:09.415 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: I want out and
they didn't want me out.

00:14:09.415 --> 00:14:10.249 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:14:10.249 --> 00:14:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: You were the company.

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:13.919 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: I hired a guy name
Bill Larson [assumed spelling]

00:14:13.919 --> 00:14:18.424 align:middle line:84%
who was a Senior vice President
at IBM, very, very, you know,

00:14:18.424 --> 00:14:24.363 align:middle line:84%
gang ho, go-getter brilliant
guy, Bohemian, made him the COO,

00:14:24.363 --> 00:14:25.998 align:middle line:90%
stayed with him for six months,

00:14:25.998 --> 00:14:28.534 align:middle line:84%
the board loved him,
everybody loved him.

00:14:28.534 --> 00:14:30.336 align:middle line:90%
And then I said goodbye.

00:14:30.336 --> 00:14:31.137 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I'm out of here.

00:14:31.137 --> 00:14:32.338 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: I'm out of here.

00:14:32.338 --> 00:14:33.706 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Did you sell
your stock and get out or?

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:35.474 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: I did because if
I kept my stock, then I'd end

00:14:35.474 --> 00:14:37.343 align:middle line:84%
up still coming to
board meetings, I'd be--

00:14:37.343 --> 00:14:38.377 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: On the company store.

00:14:38.377 --> 00:14:39.845 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: I want
to cut the strings.

00:14:39.845 --> 00:14:40.613 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: OK.

00:14:40.613 --> 00:14:41.981 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: And I went off

00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:43.783 align:middle line:84%
and immediately formed another
company called Tribal Voice

00:14:43.783 --> 00:14:46.152 align:middle line:84%
and where we did the first
instant messaging system.

00:14:46.152 --> 00:14:48.621 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You have a midas
touch when it comes to this?

00:14:48.621 --> 00:14:49.488 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Apparently.

00:14:49.488 --> 00:14:51.824 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Touch me, would you?

00:14:51.824 --> 00:14:55.861 align:middle line:84%
So you get bought out,
you sell your stock--

00:14:55.861 --> 00:14:57.062 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Yes.

00:14:57.062 --> 00:14:59.198 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And McAfee
subsequently gets purchased

00:14:59.198 --> 00:15:00.599 align:middle line:90%
by Intel, what happened there?

00:15:00.599 --> 00:15:04.069 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: They are purchased by
Intel for eight billion I think.

00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.837 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: How much?

00:15:04.837 --> 00:15:06.105 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Eight billion.

00:15:06.105 --> 00:15:08.274 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Eight billion
from a little tiny company--

00:15:08.274 --> 00:15:10.576 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: A little tiny
company for eight million.

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:14.113 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's a fast-growing
field.

00:15:14.113 --> 00:15:15.314 align:middle line:90%
And software security

00:15:15.314 --> 00:15:18.617 align:middle line:84%
and information security
is really the [inaudible]

00:15:18.617 --> 00:15:22.755 align:middle line:84%
of everything without the
security, we lose everything.

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:26.058 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think about it, if there
were no software protections,

00:15:26.058 --> 00:15:29.361 align:middle line:84%
firewalls, antivirus software,
you couldn't run your computer

00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:31.530 align:middle line:84%
for more than five
minutes before it crashed.

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:32.665 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Gees.

00:15:32.665 --> 00:15:34.700 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: So it's an
extremely important part

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.169 align:middle line:84%
of this entire information
process.

00:15:37.169 --> 00:15:41.040 align:middle line:84%
But in any case, I
started Tribal Voice

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.474 align:middle line:84%
which was an instant
messaging company

00:15:42.474 --> 00:15:45.377 align:middle line:84%
and then the same thing
happened only much quicker, OK?

00:15:45.377 --> 00:15:48.581 align:middle line:90%
So I sold out after 18 months

00:15:48.581 --> 00:15:50.449 align:middle line:84%
for I think 17 million
and went up--

00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:51.517 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Good for you.

00:15:51.517 --> 00:15:52.651 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: -- and
formed another company.

00:15:52.651 --> 00:15:55.221 align:middle line:84%
And I'm afraid that's
the only thing I'm good

00:15:55.221 --> 00:15:56.422 align:middle line:90%
for is starting things--

00:15:56.422 --> 00:15:58.157 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Starting,
selling, and getting out.

00:15:58.157 --> 00:15:59.692 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Start out and selling
and just getting out because--

00:15:59.692 --> 00:16:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What do you
think of the Facebook boys?

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:02.895 align:middle line:90%
Zuckerberg

00:16:02.895 --> 00:16:03.963 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Well I think
Facebook is spectacular.

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:07.132 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as a social--
as a social tool,

00:16:07.132 --> 00:16:09.735 align:middle line:84%
I personally don't spend
much time on Facebook,

00:16:09.735 --> 00:16:11.704 align:middle line:84%
I prefer to do face
time with real people.

00:16:11.704 --> 00:16:13.105 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:16:13.105 --> 00:16:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: I think this is one
of the props in the world today.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.109 align:middle line:84%
By the way our technology
has isolated us

00:16:17.109 --> 00:16:19.078 align:middle line:90%
from the human community.

00:16:19.078 --> 00:16:20.412 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: So true.

00:16:20.412 --> 00:16:23.983 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: We go into places
and people are just looking

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:27.119 align:middle line:84%
at their smartphones and
they're texting and--

00:16:27.119 --> 00:16:29.989 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I saw a couple of
four people go to dinner, right,

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:32.057 align:middle line:84%
not one of them John
looked at each other.

00:16:32.057 --> 00:16:33.259 align:middle line:84%
That's right, they're
just on their phones.

00:16:33.259 --> 00:16:34.526 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: And they're texting

00:16:34.526 --> 00:16:35.261 align:middle line:84%
and they could be texting
each other for all I know.

00:16:35.261 --> 00:16:36.095 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:16:36.095 --> 00:16:37.396 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: I mean, you know--

00:16:37.396 --> 00:16:38.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: They don't know
how to talk with each other.

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.598 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Or they use it for--

00:16:39.598 --> 00:16:41.934 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, it could be the
man texting the other man's

00:16:41.934 --> 00:16:44.169 align:middle line:84%
wife, you know, well,
meet you after--

00:16:44.169 --> 00:16:48.140 align:middle line:84%
you don't have a clue
but it's not comfortable,

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:52.044 align:middle line:84%
it's not a comfortable image
in my mind of the direction

00:16:52.044 --> 00:16:53.479 align:middle line:90%
that humanity is taking.

00:16:53.479 --> 00:16:56.649 align:middle line:84%
Given what we're doing
with that technology.

00:16:56.649 --> 00:17:00.286 align:middle line:84%
Now, we could use
technology totally differently

00:17:00.286 --> 00:17:05.157 align:middle line:84%
if we had more wisdom
and more courage.

00:17:05.157 --> 00:17:09.261 align:middle line:84%
But I fear that if it
continues in this way,

00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:12.898 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have remote
sects, remote everything.

00:17:12.898 --> 00:17:13.732 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Remote everything.

00:17:13.732 --> 00:17:14.800 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Remote everything.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.034 align:middle line:84%
And so-- and we're
going to think we live

00:17:16.034 --> 00:17:21.407 align:middle line:84%
in an absolute heaven of
reality but it will collapse

00:17:21.407 --> 00:17:22.640 align:middle line:90%
around us at some point.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.543 align:middle line:84%
Reality will intrude
no matter what we do.

00:17:24.543 --> 00:17:26.412 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Or somebody's,
dotcom companies--

00:17:26.412 --> 00:17:29.581 align:middle line:84%
fab companies like
Twitter and, you know,

00:17:29.581 --> 00:17:32.384 align:middle line:84%
we saw what Facebook
did to Myspace.

00:17:32.384 --> 00:17:33.786 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Right.

00:17:33.786 --> 00:17:35.521 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Will there always be
a new evolution-- I mean now--

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:36.755 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Of course.

00:17:36.755 --> 00:17:37.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: -- it's, you know,
Snapchat and Instagram--

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:38.691 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Of course.

00:17:38.691 --> 00:17:39.825 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: They keep coming.

00:17:39.825 --> 00:17:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: There will
always be an evolution

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.430 align:middle line:84%
because there is no end
to technological growth.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.232 align:middle line:84%
There is no end to
human imagination.

00:17:47.232 --> 00:17:48.634 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:17:48.634 --> 00:17:51.937 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: And the imagination--
the image of Twitter for example

00:17:51.937 --> 00:17:56.275 align:middle line:84%
which occurred to the founders,
wow, what a great concept.

00:17:56.275 --> 00:17:58.043 align:middle line:84%
I believe there will
be a greater concept

00:17:58.043 --> 00:17:59.011 align:middle line:90%
and a greater concept.

00:17:59.011 --> 00:17:59.778 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: How do
they monetize that?

00:17:59.778 --> 00:18:00.746 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: pardon?

00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: How do
they monetize that?

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.881 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: There
is the question.

00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:04.350 align:middle line:84%
They-- actually Twitter
went public two days ago,

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:05.351 align:middle line:90%
three days ago.

00:18:05.351 --> 00:18:06.685 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: A couple
of days ago, yeah.

00:18:06.685 --> 00:18:08.887 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: It came out of
the price of 26 dollars

00:18:08.887 --> 00:18:11.423 align:middle line:90%
and opened instantly at 45.

00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:13.025 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: With minimal
earnings, right?

00:18:13.025 --> 00:18:13.726 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: No earnings.

00:18:13.726 --> 00:18:14.426 align:middle line:90%
To my knowledge--

00:18:14.426 --> 00:18:15.728 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: No earnings.

00:18:15.728 --> 00:18:17.363 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: -- I don't think
they're making any money.

00:18:17.363 --> 00:18:21.266 align:middle line:84%
However, anything that the
world has to use, believe me,

00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:22.968 align:middle line:84%
you will find a way
to make money.

00:18:22.968 --> 00:18:24.603 align:middle line:84%
And this is why people
are investing.

00:18:24.603 --> 00:18:25.537 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:18:25.537 --> 00:18:27.306 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: So that
was astonishing.

00:18:27.306 --> 00:18:29.641 align:middle line:90%
So for-- in 30 seconds,

00:18:29.641 --> 00:18:32.578 align:middle line:84%
people got 90 percent
on their investment.

00:18:32.578 --> 00:18:33.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Just crazy.

00:18:33.245 --> 00:18:34.013 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Isn't it?

00:18:34.013 --> 00:18:34.847 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It's just crazy.

00:18:34.847 --> 00:18:36.849 align:middle line:90%
So John McAfee then sales out,

00:18:36.849 --> 00:18:40.119 align:middle line:84%
you've got your funds,
you go to Belize.

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:40.986 align:middle line:90%
Why did you go there?

00:18:40.986 --> 00:18:42.655 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: A couple of reasons.

00:18:42.655 --> 00:18:44.790 align:middle line:84%
It's the most beautiful
country in the world physically.

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.325 align:middle line:90%
I mean-- or geographically--

00:18:46.325 --> 00:18:47.659 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:18:47.659 --> 00:18:48.827 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: -- as the world's
second longest barrier reef.

00:18:48.827 --> 00:18:52.364 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful, crystal
clear, emerald waters

00:18:52.364 --> 00:18:54.133 align:middle line:90%
on the inside of the reef.

00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:55.467 align:middle line:90%
Very calm.

00:18:55.467 --> 00:18:57.603 align:middle line:84%
It's the only place in the
world where you can have a dock

00:18:57.603 --> 00:18:59.304 align:middle line:84%
in front of your house
right on the ocean.

00:18:59.304 --> 00:19:00.806 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Had your
vacation there before?

00:19:00.806 --> 00:19:01.340 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Oh yeah.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.141 align:middle line:90%
Many times.

00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:03.042 align:middle line:90%
It's a great vacation spot.

00:19:03.042 --> 00:19:04.143 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:05.110 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Great
snorkeling and diving spot.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:06.245 align:middle line:84%
One of the greatest
in the world.

00:19:06.245 --> 00:19:08.714 align:middle line:84%
And then the jungles,
whoa, I've--

00:19:08.714 --> 00:19:10.783 align:middle line:84%
you know, I had a place
in Ecuador and I had been

00:19:10.783 --> 00:19:13.686 align:middle line:84%
down the Amazon, nothing
like the rivers of Belize.

00:19:13.686 --> 00:19:14.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Nothing like that?

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.055 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Nothing like
the rivers of Belize.

00:19:16.055 --> 00:19:18.957 align:middle line:84%
You know, the lines with
crocodiles, and the storks,

00:19:18.957 --> 00:19:22.161 align:middle line:84%
and howler monkeys, and spider
monkeys and every manner

00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:26.098 align:middle line:84%
of wildlife, beautiful, and
more importantly, the plants.

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:29.568 align:middle line:90%
There are 2,700 species

00:19:29.568 --> 00:19:31.937 align:middle line:84%
of plants along the
jungle rivers in Belize.

00:19:31.937 --> 00:19:33.272 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, they're
easy to collect.

00:19:33.272 --> 00:19:34.506 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yes.

00:19:34.506 --> 00:19:36.875 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: And while
companies like Merck and Bayer,

00:19:36.875 --> 00:19:40.279 align:middle line:84%
the large pharmaceuticals
have tested all of them,

00:19:40.279 --> 00:19:42.314 align:middle line:84%
they've only tested them
against specific things

00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:44.783 align:middle line:90%
like does it kill bacteria?

00:19:44.783 --> 00:19:45.617 align:middle line:90%
Yes or no.

00:19:45.617 --> 00:19:46.919 align:middle line:90%
If it doesn't, throw it away.

00:19:46.919 --> 00:19:50.355 align:middle line:84%
I retested these things,
not just to kill bacteria

00:19:50.355 --> 00:19:52.558 align:middle line:84%
but does it interrupt
the communication,

00:19:52.558 --> 00:19:53.792 align:middle line:90%
think back to your-- ?

00:19:53.792 --> 00:19:54.593 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Possible, another
company at that time?

00:19:54.593 --> 00:19:55.794 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Pardon?

00:19:55.794 --> 00:19:56.795 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Another company
you're going to form.

00:19:56.795 --> 00:19:57.763 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: It was
Cormix [phonetic].

00:19:57.763 --> 00:19:58.330 align:middle line:84%
I founded a company
called Cormix.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:19:59.698 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: OK.

00:19:59.698 --> 00:20:02.000 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: -- and I hired some
PhD, a chemist and biologist

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.336 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of local
people to collect plants

00:20:04.336 --> 00:20:05.771 align:middle line:90%
and grind them and extract.

00:20:05.771 --> 00:20:08.173 align:middle line:84%
And I was having
a great old time

00:20:08.173 --> 00:20:11.343 align:middle line:84%
until the army came
in and shut me down.

00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:12.311 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:20:12.311 --> 00:20:13.745 align:middle line:84%
They came in and
tried to extort you.

00:20:13.745 --> 00:20:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Well,
the army didn't.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.949 align:middle line:84%
There was a politician
who tried to extort me.

00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:18.317 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: OK.

00:20:18.317 --> 00:20:20.085 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: I said no and well,
the politicians own the army

00:20:20.085 --> 00:20:22.988 align:middle line:84%
so they sent 42 soldiers
and riot here.

00:20:22.988 --> 00:20:27.092 align:middle line:84%
Shot my dog in front of my
eyes, destroyed my laboratory,

00:20:27.092 --> 00:20:29.328 align:middle line:84%
kept me handcuffed in
the sun for 14 hours

00:20:29.328 --> 00:20:30.562 align:middle line:90%
with my hands behind my back.

00:20:30.562 --> 00:20:31.597 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Were you scared?

00:20:31.597 --> 00:20:32.965 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: No I was
pissed off George.

00:20:32.965 --> 00:20:34.166 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I don't blame you.

00:20:34.166 --> 00:20:35.901 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: I wasn't
scared at all, I was angry.

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:37.236 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I don't blame you.

00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:38.303 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: And then they left.

00:20:38.303 --> 00:20:40.172 align:middle line:84%
The politician came
back a week later

00:20:40.172 --> 00:20:42.141 align:middle line:84%
after I got everything
cleaned up and said, "Gosh,

00:20:42.141 --> 00:20:44.409 align:middle line:84%
I was so sorry to hear
about what happened to you."

00:20:44.409 --> 00:20:45.878 align:middle line:84%
He said, "What a
mistake that was."

00:20:45.878 --> 00:20:47.312 align:middle line:84%
He said, you know, "They
must have been looking

00:20:47.312 --> 00:20:48.647 align:middle line:90%
for somebody else.

00:20:48.647 --> 00:20:50.816 align:middle line:84%
And he, by the way, have you
reconsidered your donation?"

00:20:50.816 --> 00:20:52.217 align:middle line:90%
I said, "Absolutely not."

00:20:52.217 --> 00:20:53.552 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Donation they call it?

00:20:53.552 --> 00:20:54.186 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Right.

00:20:54.186 --> 00:20:55.154 align:middle line:90%
Well, a donation.

00:20:55.154 --> 00:20:56.555 align:middle line:84%
They didn't say give
me the money.

00:20:56.555 --> 00:20:58.223 align:middle line:84%
So why don't you donate to my
campaign and when I get elected,

00:20:58.223 --> 00:21:01.326 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you all of these
lands and tax breaks and--

00:21:01.326 --> 00:21:03.095 align:middle line:90%
I'm not interested, thank you.

00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:04.830 align:middle line:84%
So instead of giving
him the money,

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.064 align:middle line:84%
I called the international
press,

00:21:06.064 --> 00:21:07.366 align:middle line:84%
I called the Wall
Street journal first.

00:21:07.366 --> 00:21:09.234 align:middle line:84%
I said, "You know,
I haven't talked

00:21:09.234 --> 00:21:10.402 align:middle line:90%
to you guys in five years.

00:21:10.402 --> 00:21:11.403 align:middle line:90%
I have a story for you."

00:21:11.403 --> 00:21:12.104 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And they
knew who you were.

00:21:12.104 --> 00:21:12.804 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Of course.

00:21:12.804 --> 00:21:14.139 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: They remember.

00:21:14.139 --> 00:21:15.407 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: They remember in
New York Times and so I went

00:21:15.407 --> 00:21:18.343 align:middle line:84%
to everybody at the London
Times, people who reported

00:21:18.343 --> 00:21:21.680 align:middle line:84%
on me many times before
and I told my story.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.815 align:middle line:84%
And it was all over the world
that, you know, McAfee--

00:21:23.815 --> 00:21:24.816 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Now you're
in Belize, right?

00:21:24.816 --> 00:21:26.218 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Yes I was in Belize.

00:21:26.218 --> 00:21:29.354 align:middle line:84%
So I figured, you know, I was
under the mistaken impression

00:21:29.354 --> 00:21:30.322 align:middle line:90%
that all countries have laws.

00:21:30.322 --> 00:21:31.356 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:21:31.356 --> 00:21:34.793 align:middle line:84%
And that these laws
will protect you.

00:21:34.793 --> 00:21:36.795 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, what
an idiot I am.

00:21:36.795 --> 00:21:39.298 align:middle line:84%
There are no laws in
places like Belize.

00:21:39.298 --> 00:21:41.366 align:middle line:90%
The law is the law of power.

00:21:41.366 --> 00:21:42.634 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Exactly.

00:21:42.634 --> 00:21:44.536 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: You know, the
method of the law is extortion.

00:21:44.536 --> 00:21:50.475 align:middle line:84%
The fundamental drive of the
law is fear and that's it.

00:21:50.475 --> 00:21:53.145 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Your neighbor gets
killed, you and I theorized,

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:55.113 align:middle line:90%
they bumped him off to get you.

00:21:55.113 --> 00:21:56.582 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: I think they did.

00:21:56.582 --> 00:21:59.551 align:middle line:84%
And this was seven months
later and every single day,

00:21:59.551 --> 00:22:00.953 align:middle line:90%
I got kicked in another story.

00:22:00.953 --> 00:22:03.255 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at that
period, there were thousands

00:22:03.255 --> 00:22:05.224 align:middle line:90%
of newspaper and TV stories

00:22:05.224 --> 00:22:08.126 align:middle line:84%
about McAfee raided,
dog killed--

00:22:08.126 --> 00:22:09.127 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I was reading
these accounts.

00:22:09.127 --> 00:22:10.729 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Laboratory destroyed.

00:22:10.729 --> 00:22:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: This poor guy.

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:14.566 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: But as long as
the press was looking at me,

00:22:14.566 --> 00:22:16.168 align:middle line:84%
the police just couldn't
do anything.

00:22:16.168 --> 00:22:19.037 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't just shoot me in
broad daylight or hire someone

00:22:19.037 --> 00:22:20.973 align:middle line:84%
because it was being
too obvious, right?

00:22:20.973 --> 00:22:23.642 align:middle line:84%
But my neighbor gets whacked
while we want to question him

00:22:23.642 --> 00:22:25.844 align:middle line:84%
like we question all
of the neighbors.

00:22:25.844 --> 00:22:27.946 align:middle line:84%
They didn't say, "We
think you did it,

00:22:27.946 --> 00:22:29.314 align:middle line:84%
we want to question
all the neighbors."

00:22:29.314 --> 00:22:32.017 align:middle line:84%
But Mr. McAfee refuses
to be questioned.

00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:34.653 align:middle line:84%
Duh, and police, if
they question you,

00:22:34.653 --> 00:22:35.654 align:middle line:90%
they can hold you forever.

00:22:35.654 --> 00:22:37.055 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: They hold you forever.

00:22:37.055 --> 00:22:38.690 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: 60 days at the time,
if they don't like your answer,

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:41.627 align:middle line:84%
set another 60 days
without a court order.

00:22:41.627 --> 00:22:42.894 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: At what
point did you say,

00:22:42.894 --> 00:22:44.763 align:middle line:84%
"I got to get out
or dodge here?"

00:22:44.763 --> 00:22:47.232 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Well, and clear that
it could not-- I kept thinking,

00:22:47.232 --> 00:22:49.434 align:middle line:90%
OK, I can recover this.

00:22:49.434 --> 00:22:52.104 align:middle line:84%
I can-- eventually, the
world is going to see

00:22:52.104 --> 00:22:55.007 align:middle line:84%
that this was a setup
but no, absolutely not.

00:22:55.007 --> 00:22:56.141 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: How did you get out?

00:22:56.141 --> 00:22:56.842 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: It just kept
getting worse and worse.

00:22:56.842 --> 00:22:58.844 align:middle line:90%
That was difficult.

00:22:58.844 --> 00:23:03.415 align:middle line:84%
I had been in Belize long
enough to know how the army

00:23:03.415 --> 00:23:06.918 align:middle line:84%
and the police work and I knew
that number one, they never work

00:23:06.918 --> 00:23:08.954 align:middle line:84%
on rainy days, they don't care
what happens that day, OK?

00:23:08.954 --> 00:23:10.355 align:middle line:90%
So if there's a checkpoint--

00:23:10.355 --> 00:23:13.258 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, they had
checkpoints at all the exits.

00:23:13.258 --> 00:23:14.259 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Looking for you.

00:23:14.259 --> 00:23:16.194 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Looking for me.

00:23:16.194 --> 00:23:18.930 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that-- sort
of it was a rainy day,

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:20.999 align:middle line:84%
there was this waiver,
everybody through.

00:23:20.999 --> 00:23:24.670 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, I've arranged to have
two reporters from Vice come

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:26.171 align:middle line:90%
down and exit with me.

00:23:26.171 --> 00:23:29.675 align:middle line:84%
So they got to report it and
I got to have two Americans

00:23:29.675 --> 00:23:31.276 align:middle line:84%
to make it look like
we were a crowd.

00:23:31.276 --> 00:23:32.678 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:23:32.678 --> 00:23:34.680 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Then I took off one
of my ex-girlfriend's boyfriend

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.949 align:middle line:84%
who was American took him
and myself and my girlfriend

00:23:37.949 --> 00:23:41.386 align:middle line:84%
and I was in disguised and every
checkpoint, they just wave us

00:23:41.386 --> 00:23:43.689 align:middle line:84%
on through from inside
their cars.

00:23:43.689 --> 00:23:45.991 align:middle line:90%
OK, so that was number one.

00:23:45.991 --> 00:23:51.163 align:middle line:84%
Number two, all the borders
including the water passages

00:23:51.163 --> 00:23:53.398 align:middle line:84%
were controlled by
the coast guard.

00:23:53.398 --> 00:23:56.802 align:middle line:84%
So I arranged to have a friend
of mine who look like me

00:23:56.802 --> 00:24:00.572 align:middle line:84%
and pretended to be me be
arrested in Southern Mexico

00:24:00.572 --> 00:24:02.374 align:middle line:84%
and have that spread
over the news.

00:24:02.374 --> 00:24:03.442 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:24:03.442 --> 00:24:04.776 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So they
thought they had you?

00:24:04.776 --> 00:24:07.079 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: They sent everybody
up north and so I escaped

00:24:07.079 --> 00:24:08.413 align:middle line:90%
over the Southern Border

00:24:08.413 --> 00:24:10.582 align:middle line:84%
and everything was
empty, no one was there.

00:24:10.582 --> 00:24:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Gosh.

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:12.851 align:middle line:84%
And here-- did you
feel secure here now?

00:24:12.851 --> 00:24:14.286 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: No, of course
I don't feel secure here.

00:24:14.286 --> 00:24:15.287 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: You don't?

00:24:15.287 --> 00:24:17.022 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: The police
has a long arm

00:24:17.022 --> 00:24:18.857 align:middle line:84%
and I continue to
talk about them.

00:24:18.857 --> 00:24:20.325 align:middle line:84%
If you'll look at
my blog, I have--

00:24:20.325 --> 00:24:23.261 align:middle line:84%
there's something every other
day that I post, it's true.

00:24:23.261 --> 00:24:27.299 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for example,
there is a--

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:31.303 align:middle line:84%
OK, I reported when I first came
back the police were selling

00:24:31.303 --> 00:24:35.507 align:middle line:84%
passports to Iranians and
to other terrorist groups.

00:24:35.507 --> 00:24:36.641 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: To get in here or in--

00:24:36.641 --> 00:24:37.909 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: To get into
America, not to get me

00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:39.010 align:middle line:90%
but just to get in to America.

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:39.678 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right, right.

00:24:39.678 --> 00:24:40.512 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:24:40.512 --> 00:24:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Nobody believe me.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.048 align:middle line:90%
Last week, they reported

00:24:43.048 --> 00:24:48.820 align:middle line:84%
in a Belizean newspaper
someone took 155 files

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:52.691 align:middle line:84%
from the government and gave
it to the press of people

00:24:52.691 --> 00:24:56.361 align:middle line:84%
that they were buying passports
for 100,000 dollars a pop--

00:24:56.361 --> 00:24:57.596 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: God.

00:24:57.596 --> 00:24:59.031 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: -- from this
one man in the government--

00:24:59.031 --> 00:25:01.199 align:middle line:84%
the man that I had
named previously.

00:25:01.199 --> 00:25:03.869 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not making this stuff
up and it did come to light.

00:25:03.869 --> 00:25:05.337 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Was this the guy
who was trying to shake you

00:25:05.337 --> 00:25:06.705 align:middle line:90%
down or somebody else?

00:25:06.705 --> 00:25:07.372 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: No.

00:25:07.372 --> 00:25:08.740 align:middle line:90%
It was someone else.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.142 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: OK.

00:25:10.142 --> 00:25:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: But it's shocking and
what's more shocking George is

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:13.879 align:middle line:84%
that the news never
gets here to America.

00:25:13.879 --> 00:25:14.579 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: No.

00:25:14.579 --> 00:25:15.714 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: For example,

00:25:15.714 --> 00:25:18.884 align:middle line:84%
one of our most prominent
American citizens,

00:25:18.884 --> 00:25:23.622 align:middle line:84%
he owns for example, the largest
Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise

00:25:23.622 --> 00:25:28.393 align:middle line:84%
in America, he owns oil-leases
in Belize and Pakistan.

00:25:28.393 --> 00:25:30.495 align:middle line:84%
He owns a food processing
company,

00:25:30.495 --> 00:25:34.099 align:middle line:84%
he owns the largest shrimp
farm in Central America,

00:25:34.099 --> 00:25:35.300 align:middle line:90%
a very well connected man.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.835 align:middle line:90%
He's a commercial pilot.

00:25:36.835 --> 00:25:41.072 align:middle line:84%
Extremely rich, he was one of
the people in this package.

00:25:41.072 --> 00:25:44.376 align:middle line:84%
There's this-- has his passport
photo in all the documentation

00:25:44.376 --> 00:25:45.544 align:middle line:90%
and how much money he paid.

00:25:45.544 --> 00:25:46.611 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Unbelievable.

00:25:46.611 --> 00:25:47.412 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Now you
have to ask yourself,

00:25:47.412 --> 00:25:48.280 align:middle line:90%
why is an American citizen--

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.481 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: What does he need?

00:25:49.481 --> 00:25:51.817 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: He is also of
Muslim descent by the way

00:25:51.817 --> 00:25:55.220 align:middle line:84%
and he owns banks here in
America that are affiliated

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.989 align:middle line:84%
with Muslim terrorists
and with--

00:25:57.989 --> 00:26:01.059 align:middle line:84%
America is just not going to
let him fly around at will

00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:03.562 align:middle line:84%
but with the Belizean passport,
he goes to Belize, he flies,

00:26:03.562 --> 00:26:04.396 align:middle line:90%
you know, where he want.

00:26:04.396 --> 00:26:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: This is a huge story.

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:06.731 align:middle line:90%
Huge.

00:26:06.731 --> 00:26:07.566 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Well, it's
out there for any--

00:26:07.566 --> 00:26:08.934 align:middle line:90%
you could Google it yourself.

00:26:08.934 --> 00:26:11.470 align:middle line:84%
The problem is it doesn't get
reported here in the states.

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:12.838 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And these people

00:26:12.838 --> 00:26:15.240 align:middle line:84%
who bought the passports God
knows what they need them for.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.708 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: I know what
they needed it for.

00:26:16.708 --> 00:26:18.143 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Nice way to
enter the country, right?

00:26:18.143 --> 00:26:19.811 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: A nice way to enter
the country because what happens

00:26:19.811 --> 00:26:22.414 align:middle line:84%
with Belizean passport, you
can travel throughout all

00:26:22.414 --> 00:26:25.083 align:middle line:84%
of Central America and all the
caricom countries that is all

00:26:25.083 --> 00:26:28.587 align:middle line:84%
of the Caribbean-- is
it Caribbean Union.

00:26:28.587 --> 00:26:31.156 align:middle line:84%
In Mexico, you just walk
across like anybody else.

00:26:31.156 --> 00:26:33.825 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I would hope homeland
security has read this story

00:26:33.825 --> 00:26:35.193 align:middle line:90%
and they're jumping--

00:26:35.193 --> 00:26:36.261 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: If they have, they're
not doing anything about it.

00:26:36.261 --> 00:26:38.396 align:middle line:84%
This man is still free
and flying around.

00:26:38.396 --> 00:26:39.598 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Unbelievable.

00:26:39.598 --> 00:26:43.368 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: So in any case,
it's been an interest--

00:26:43.368 --> 00:26:44.536 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: What a ride John.

00:26:44.536 --> 00:26:45.437 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: It has
been a ride sir.

00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:46.138 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: What a ride.

00:26:46.138 --> 00:26:46.938 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing next?

00:26:46.938 --> 00:26:48.073 align:middle line:90%
What's up--

00:26:48.073 --> 00:26:50.775 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Well, there
are a couple of things.

00:26:50.775 --> 00:26:54.646 align:middle line:84%
When I formed the
company to create privacy

00:26:54.646 --> 00:26:56.648 align:middle line:84%
for its citizenry
electronically,

00:26:56.648 --> 00:26:59.851 align:middle line:84%
it's sort of a secondary
internet.

00:26:59.851 --> 00:27:02.654 align:middle line:84%
It's not to replace the internet
but to give you a switch.

00:27:02.654 --> 00:27:07.192 align:middle line:84%
I mean for example, if you're
Googling, you know, where to eat

00:27:07.192 --> 00:27:09.227 align:middle line:84%
or general information,
you don't care

00:27:09.227 --> 00:27:10.962 align:middle line:84%
if anybody is watching
you usually.

00:27:10.962 --> 00:27:12.364 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: You don't think--

00:27:12.364 --> 00:27:14.165 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: If you're sending a
private message to your wife,

00:27:14.165 --> 00:27:16.067 align:middle line:90%
your girlfriend, your son,

00:27:16.067 --> 00:27:18.503 align:middle line:84%
if you have a private
communication, it doesn't have

00:27:18.503 --> 00:27:20.305 align:middle line:84%
to be a juicy communication
but just something

00:27:20.305 --> 00:27:22.240 align:middle line:84%
that really doesn't
need to be shared,

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.475 align:middle line:84%
then you switch to
private network.

00:27:23.475 --> 00:27:24.943 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And you switch
over to that, that's smart.

00:27:24.943 --> 00:27:28.413 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: So hopefully, it will
be available in about every year

00:27:28.413 --> 00:27:34.085 align:middle line:84%
and if the NSA lets me build it,
then I think it will be a boon

00:27:34.085 --> 00:27:35.253 align:middle line:90%
for the American citizen.

00:27:35.253 --> 00:27:36.888 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Could they
put the kibosh on it?

00:27:36.888 --> 00:27:38.089 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Well of course.

00:27:38.089 --> 00:27:39.090 align:middle line:84%
It's the government, they
can do what they want.

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:40.525 align:middle line:84%
They can audit me
a million times--

00:27:40.525 --> 00:27:41.459 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:27:41.459 --> 00:27:42.727 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: -- they
can, you know,

00:27:42.727 --> 00:27:45.430 align:middle line:84%
they can pass a law saying
this is illegal, whatever.

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:47.232 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Are you back to stay?

00:27:47.232 --> 00:27:47.999 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: I think so.

00:27:47.999 --> 00:27:49.167 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:27:49.167 --> 00:27:52.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think I would
be better off trying

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:56.741 align:middle line:84%
to fix the small ills within
this country than to flee

00:27:56.741 --> 00:27:58.743 align:middle line:84%
from them in two
things which, you know,

00:27:58.743 --> 00:28:00.745 align:middle line:84%
just out of the frying
pan, into the fire maybe.

00:28:00.745 --> 00:28:01.947 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Sure.

00:28:01.947 --> 00:28:03.415 align:middle line:84%
Well, and you got your
taste on the outside.

00:28:03.415 --> 00:28:04.349 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Yes.

00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:05.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You see
what it's like.

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:07.519 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Yes, I have seen
what it's like firsthand.

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:09.654 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I've got my
issues with government

00:28:09.654 --> 00:28:12.791 align:middle line:84%
but there's never been
a country like this.

00:28:12.791 --> 00:28:16.361 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: No, there hasn't, you
know, and I will say for anybody

00:28:16.361 --> 00:28:20.432 align:middle line:84%
to hear that we live in the
greatest country on this planet.

00:28:20.432 --> 00:28:21.633 align:middle line:90%
It is not perfect.

00:28:21.633 --> 00:28:22.767 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: People want to--
they want to track you,

00:28:22.767 --> 00:28:24.703 align:middle line:84%
they want to read your
blogs, where do they go?

00:28:24.703 --> 00:28:25.537 align:middle line:90%
How do we do this?

00:28:25.537 --> 00:28:27.238 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Who is mcafee.com?

00:28:27.238 --> 00:28:29.074 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: OK, simple as that.

00:28:29.074 --> 00:28:30.408 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: That's it.

00:28:30.408 --> 00:28:33.778 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: John, as you look
at the future of technology,

00:28:33.778 --> 00:28:36.481 align:middle line:84%
where are we going to
be five years from now?

00:28:36.481 --> 00:28:37.949 align:middle line:90%
I mean, people are saying

00:28:37.949 --> 00:28:40.819 align:middle line:84%
that your desktop
computer will be passe--

00:28:40.819 --> 00:28:41.586 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Of course.

00:28:41.586 --> 00:28:42.354 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Do you think so?

00:28:42.354 --> 00:28:43.188 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Oh absolutely.

00:28:43.188 --> 00:28:45.390 align:middle line:90%
I mean, already, I am annoyed

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:49.327 align:middle line:84%
that they are purposely
not putting functions

00:28:49.327 --> 00:28:51.129 align:middle line:90%
in our smartphones like--

00:28:51.129 --> 00:28:52.464 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That they could.

00:28:52.464 --> 00:28:54.432 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: That they could
like file transfers and things

00:28:54.432 --> 00:28:57.235 align:middle line:84%
so that we still have to buy
laptops and desktops, right?

00:28:57.235 --> 00:28:58.637 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Smart move,
you're right.

00:28:58.637 --> 00:29:01.606 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: So it boils down to
two things and two things only.

00:29:01.606 --> 00:29:06.011 align:middle line:84%
The size of the screen and your
method of inputting the keypad.

00:29:06.011 --> 00:29:07.078 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That's right.

00:29:07.078 --> 00:29:08.446 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: But the
keypad is becoming pass,

00:29:08.446 --> 00:29:11.349 align:middle line:84%
you've got an android font for
phone, a current software--

00:29:11.349 --> 00:29:12.651 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Touchscreen.

00:29:12.651 --> 00:29:16.087 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: OK so now, have
you used the voice function?

00:29:16.087 --> 00:29:16.955 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yes.

00:29:16.955 --> 00:29:17.922 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: It's spectacular.

00:29:17.922 --> 00:29:19.224 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I've sent
text via voice.

00:29:19.224 --> 00:29:20.358 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: It's spectacular.

00:29:20.358 --> 00:29:22.027 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: If I want to
do Google, it's voice.

00:29:22.027 --> 00:29:23.228 align:middle line:90%
>> McAfee: Yeah.

00:29:23.228 --> 00:29:25.730 align:middle line:84%
Within five years, it will
be 100 percent accurate.

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:28.600 align:middle line:84%
The annoying features now
are the software should know

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.335 align:middle line:84%
where to put the periods,
the commas, and everything--

00:29:30.335 --> 00:29:31.703 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: It doesn't
know that yet.

00:29:31.703 --> 00:29:34.272 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: But however, in five
years, I guarantee it will.

00:29:34.272 --> 00:29:35.573 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
need keyboards.

00:29:35.573 --> 00:29:37.642 align:middle line:90%
If we can speak, and it's faster

00:29:37.642 --> 00:29:39.844 align:middle line:84%
than typing, we'll
need keyboards.

00:29:39.844 --> 00:29:41.880 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is
screen size, you know,

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.448 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
good your eyes are--

00:29:43.448 --> 00:29:45.283 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Minds like
that and it's very small.

00:29:45.283 --> 00:29:46.685 align:middle line:90%
I'm still using the--

00:29:46.685 --> 00:29:48.353 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: Yeah and trying to
scroll around, it is annoying.

00:29:48.353 --> 00:29:49.688 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:29:49.688 --> 00:29:51.022 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: That's going to
be fixed in a number of ways.

00:29:51.022 --> 00:29:55.226 align:middle line:84%
There are optical systems in
play where you put on a pair

00:29:55.226 --> 00:29:57.629 align:middle line:84%
of glasses in the screen and
it just loads in front of you.

00:29:57.629 --> 00:30:01.633 align:middle line:84%
Full size that-- maybe that's
going to be the answer--

00:30:01.633 --> 00:30:03.034 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I love technology.

00:30:03.034 --> 00:30:07.072 align:middle line:84%
>> McAfee: I brought a device
by the way, where was I, Japan--

00:30:07.072 --> 00:30:09.407 align:middle line:90%
somewhere recently that will--

00:30:09.407 --> 00:30:12.310 align:middle line:84%
put it on your desk and
it displays the screen

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:14.179 align:middle line:90%
in high resolution on your wall.

00:30:14.179 --> 00:30:15.547 align:middle line:90%
Small, little device.

00:30:15.547 --> 00:30:16.948 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Well that's great.

00:30:16.948 --> 00:30:18.183 align:middle line:90%
We're going to come back again.

00:30:18.183 --> 00:30:21.186 align:middle line:84%
John McAfee has been our
guest here on Beyond Belief

00:30:21.186 --> 00:30:23.455 align:middle line:84%
but stay tuned because
we'll have other programs

00:30:23.455 --> 00:30:27.358 align:middle line:84%
with John right here
on Beyond Belief.
