00:00:24.298 --> 00:00:26.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.290 align:middle line:10%
Our very special
guest William Henry

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.530 align:middle line:10%
is an author, investigative
mythologist, and a futurist

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.660 align:middle line:10%
and has been writing
about human transformation

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.900 align:middle line:10%
and merging with
technology back since 2002.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.830 align:middle line:10%
He's the author of 18 plus
books, the spiritual advisor

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.950 align:middle line:10%
and presenter on the History
Channel's "Ancient Aliens,"

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.930 align:middle line:10%
and the host of
several Gaia programs,

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.530 align:middle line:10%
including his upcoming series
"Ascension Keepers" which

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.400 align:middle line:10%
airs in the fall.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.540 align:middle line:84%
William, welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM HENRY:
Thank you, George.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.453 align:middle line:90%
Pleasure to be here.

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When we
talk about ascension,

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.290 align:middle line:84%
and I want to get
into that in a moment,

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.010 align:middle line:84%
but how did you get
involved in all this?

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.968 align:middle line:90%
What's your background?

00:00:59.968 --> 00:01:01.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, I
started researching

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.960 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrial
phenomena back

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.160 align:middle line:84%
in the '90s, deep researcher
of Sitchin and von Danikan,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.960 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.085 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That captured yo.

00:01:09.085 --> 00:01:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Absolutely.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.880 align:middle line:10%
Because it became
really apparent

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.350 align:middle line:10%
that the visitors were here
to assist us in our evolution.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.150 align:middle line:10%
They might even have
been responsible

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.460 align:middle line:10%
for tweaking human DNA,
fashioning the body

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.990 align:middle line:10%
into its present form.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.100 align:middle line:90%
The question was why.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.300 align:middle line:90%
Why were they here?

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And back then, Sitchin
had this hypothesis

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.010 align:middle line:90%
that they were here for gold.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And that became a big
foundational idea.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.880 align:middle line:84%
But in those same
stories, they always

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.870 align:middle line:84%
talked about the gods helping
humans transform into gods

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.030 align:middle line:90%
or celestial beings themselves.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And that just really
captured my attention.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.108 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know, where did
this take place, which temples,

00:01:44.108 --> 00:01:45.900 align:middle line:84%
and what were the texts
that spoke of this.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I started really deeply
researching this whole idea

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.130 align:middle line:90%
of human transformation.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I like Sitchin's
theory but the gold part was

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.390 align:middle line:90%
a little far fetched for me.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.660 align:middle line:84%
He literally said
in his books that he

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.870 align:middle line:84%
didn't know why they were here,
and that he thought, perhaps,

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.310 align:middle line:90%
it had to do with gold.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And his readers
kind of treated that

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.550 align:middle line:84%
as the Gospel of
Zecharia Sitchin.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.170 align:middle line:84%
It became a fact rather
than a possibility.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And then that
discussion about they

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.080 align:middle line:84%
needed to sprinkle
particles of gold

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.340 align:middle line:84%
in their atmosphere
to temper the sun.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And that was all
Sitchin's imagination.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.760 align:middle line:84%
But what got my
imagination was he

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.120 align:middle line:84%
said that that god that came
here to mine that gold was also

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.530 align:middle line:90%
an alchemist.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.315 align:middle line:84%
So why did he need to come clear
across the galaxy to mine gold

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:30.690 align:middle line:84%
and create a slave
race to do it?

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.648 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And why here?

00:02:31.648 --> 00:02:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: In
alchemical traditions,

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.310 align:middle line:84%
the idea of the alchemist
is to take an impure metal

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.900 align:middle line:90%
and turn it into a pure metal.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, they think
of the alchemist

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.690 align:middle line:84%
as taking an impure soul and
turning it into a pure soul.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.580 align:middle line:84%
So what if the
gods, the Annunaki,

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.320 align:middle line:84%
came here on a mission to
help us to transform our soul?

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.790 align:middle line:84%
That was the operating principle
I started to take off on.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And the texts are
reflective of that idea.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When we talk about
ascension, what does that mean?

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Ascension really
is a quest for wholeness.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.620 align:middle line:84%
It's the idea that we can
regain our true nature.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.810 align:middle line:84%
Many of the ascension
keepers that we'll

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.660 align:middle line:84%
talk about have this belief
that our present flesh and blood

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.010 align:middle line:84%
body is not our original
form or our true nature.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.590 align:middle line:84%
They believe that we were
originally light beings,

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.730 align:middle line:84%
that we had an existence,
a pre-physical existence,

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.180 align:middle line:84%
as a light being, and that
we somehow became trapped

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.680 align:middle line:90%
in our physical bodies.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And part of the
ascension process

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.790 align:middle line:84%
is to learn to transcend
our physical bodies

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.610 align:middle line:84%
and return to our original or
true nature as a light being.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.680 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are we moving
in that direction?

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: We are.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.100 align:middle line:84%
There's two tracks that
we're moving along.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.877 align:middle line:84%
One is a spiritual,
an organic movement.

00:03:44.877 --> 00:03:47.460 align:middle line:84%
People around the world by the
millions, hundreds of millions,

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.580 align:middle line:84%
are practicing yoga,
doing meditation.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.870 align:middle line:84%
This is all about feeding the
light body, the organic light

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:53.670 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Then the second track
is transhumanism

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.690 align:middle line:84%
where your AI
developers are thinking

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.890 align:middle line:84%
that we can create a
non-physical body that

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.095 align:middle line:90%
lives in a simulated reality.

00:04:04.095 --> 00:04:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Have you found that
historically past cultures have

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.300 align:middle line:90%
talked about ascension?

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.730 align:middle line:90%
I mean, do they understand this?

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Oh, absolutely.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.438 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
the fascinating things

00:04:13.438 --> 00:04:15.691 align:middle line:84%
about the show "Ascension
Keepers," and also the work

00:04:15.691 --> 00:04:18.149 align:middle line:84%
that I'm doing, is that you
have a lot of people that are--

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:20.524 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of millions of people
into ascension these days.

00:04:20.524 --> 00:04:23.430 align:middle line:84%
Again, they're doing yoga
or meditation aimed at that.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.420 align:middle line:84%
They don't realize that it has
a timeline, an ancient timeline

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.890 align:middle line:84%
that was begun long, long ago
where extraterrestrial beings,

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.830 align:middle line:84%
angelic beings were coming to
earth to assist us in getting

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.570 align:middle line:90%
on this ascension pathway.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.975 align:middle line:84%
So I trace it back
at least 5,000 years,

00:04:38.975 --> 00:04:40.350 align:middle line:84%
all the way back
to the beginning

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.897 align:middle line:84%
of Egyptian civilization,
maybe even before then.

00:04:42.897 --> 00:04:44.730 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And William,
what about religions?

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Because religions talk
about ascension a lot.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, you die,
you go to heaven.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Jesus died, went up in a
cloud, and he was gone.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.570 align:middle line:90%
Is that the same thing?

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes it is.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.280 align:middle line:84%
It's part of this whole
timeline where Christianity

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.340 align:middle line:90%
didn't emerge out of a bubble.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.583 align:middle line:84%
There was a pre-history
of Christianity

00:05:04.583 --> 00:05:06.000 align:middle line:84%
where these Christian
mystics were

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.350 align:middle line:84%
drawing from ancient ascension
masters in Babylon, in Sumeria,

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.580 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt, Iraq, elsewhere, and
drawing all this information

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.880 align:middle line:84%
together and trying to
present a way for humans

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.790 align:middle line:84%
to transform and to
transform human civilization.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.890 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I assume
ascension is a good thing.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Ascension, absolutely.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Because what is at
its heart, ascension

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.660 align:middle line:90%
is a quest for wholeness.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And wholeness means to become
more holy and even more

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.770 align:middle line:90%
compassionate.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And these ascension masters
and ascension keepers

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.960 align:middle line:84%
were all about trying
to get the human race

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.390 align:middle line:84%
to live from a more
of a heart place

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.930 align:middle line:84%
and to create a civilization
based on love, righteousness,

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.710 align:middle line:84%
devout living as a
preamble to connecting

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.210 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrial
civilizations.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is ascension like
evolution in that spiritual

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.590 align:middle line:84%
evolution where the
more spiritual you get,

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.240 align:middle line:84%
the higher you
get on that plane?

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.210 align:middle line:84%
In these ascension
teachings, they

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.000 align:middle line:84%
talk about those who have
completed their Earthly

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.030 align:middle line:84%
cycle, then move on
to higher dimensions.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.330 align:middle line:84%
They talk about seven
heavens and nine heavens.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.010 align:middle line:84%
These are what we
today call dimensions.

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And so they clearly are
referring to this progression,

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.380 align:middle line:84%
this evolutionary
progression that we can make,

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.090 align:middle line:84%
that we're all on this
evolutionary ladder.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.790 align:middle line:84%
We're all scaling
the ladder to heaven.

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:26.000 align:middle line:84%
We're all somewhere
on this progression,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.920 align:middle line:84%
individually and then
collectively as well.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And what we're trying to do
is become a higher love-based

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:32.900 align:middle line:90%
civilization, ultimately.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.985 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What if we
don't get to that point?

00:06:34.985 --> 00:06:36.110 align:middle line:90%
What if we can't get there?

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, this
is part of the risk.

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, on the
technological side,

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.210 align:middle line:84%
they speak of civilizations
as Type 0, Type I, Type III,

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Type II civilizations based
on how they harvest energy,

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.167 align:middle line:84%
if they're using it from
their biological material

00:06:52.167 --> 00:06:53.750 align:middle line:84%
of the planet or if
they're getting it

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.815 align:middle line:84%
from their local star, or
even the center of the galaxy.

00:06:56.815 --> 00:06:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And we find something similar
in the ascension teachings.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.030 align:middle line:84%
We have civilizations
that collapse.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:02.900 align:middle line:90%
They don't make it.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.240 align:middle line:90%
Atlantis is a very good example.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.430 align:middle line:84%
In Plato's story,
this is a civilization

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.950 align:middle line:84%
founded by extraterrestrial
beings, gods,

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.730 align:middle line:84%
who implanted within
humanity a divine aspect.

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:15.170 align:middle line:90%
And it diminished.

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And that ultimately
led to the collapse

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.980 align:middle line:90%
of the Atlantian civilization.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.950 align:middle line:84%
So yes, some civilizations
don't make it.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: In your wonderful
new series with Gaia,

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:29.782 align:middle line:84%
"Ascension Keepers," you talk
about the origins of ascension.

00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: About 200 to 300
years before the Christian era,

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.150 align:middle line:84%
a remarkable mystical
movement arose.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:40.630 align:middle line:84%
The core ideas of this movement
came from Alexandria, Egypt.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.140 align:middle line:84%
But it spread to Palestine,
where these mystics set up

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.600 align:middle line:90%
shop, so to speak.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.770 align:middle line:84%
In Egypt, these
mystics were called

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.430 align:middle line:90%
the therapeutae, the healers.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:53.460 align:middle line:84%
They were known for their
flowing white robes.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.670 align:middle line:84%
They established an embassy
outside the walls of Alexandria

00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:00.510 align:middle line:84%
on the shores of Lake
Marietas near Alexandria.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:04.080 align:middle line:84%
In Palestine, they were
called Essenes and Nazarites

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.440 align:middle line:90%
or Nazarenes, meaning watchers.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Because they were watching for
a high celestial being they

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.670 align:middle line:84%
believed was soon
to visit Earth.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:18.270 align:middle line:84%
Although they were primarily,
but not exclusively Jewish,

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:22.320 align:middle line:84%
the Essenes were master weavers
of Egyptian, Iranian, Greek,

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.200 align:middle line:90%
and Tibetan ascension practices.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.440 align:middle line:84%
In fact, for three centuries,
beginning in 300 BCE,

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.600 align:middle line:84%
the forerunners of
this mystic tribe

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.510 align:middle line:84%
had been following
the way of the Magi,

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:37.049 align:middle line:84%
researching and merging
Babylonian, Egyptian, Iranian,

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Pythagorean, and Buddhist
alchemical philosophies

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.830 align:middle line:84%
and ascension practices
that feature humans opening

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:48.510 align:middle line:84%
holes in space and
ascending into heaven.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.520 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion,
they would heavily

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:54.720 align:middle line:84%
influence the Essenes
and early Christianity.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.910 align:middle line:10%
From these teachings,
they began writing

00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:00.510 align:middle line:10%
about translating
humans into angels,

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.330 align:middle line:10%
opening gateways to
heaven, and the emergence

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.870 align:middle line:10%
of a new improved
child of light who

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.300 align:middle line:10%
would win a war over
the sons of darkness

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.880 align:middle line:10%
and inaugurate a
new era of light.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.020 align:middle line:90%


00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Calling themselves the perfect
ones or the way of perfection

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.170 align:middle line:84%
or perfect light
humans, they seek

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:23.780 align:middle line:84%
to lead a revolution
in human evolution

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.250 align:middle line:84%
that would result
in the appearance

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:29.480 align:middle line:84%
of a new type of human and
a different human experience

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.060 align:middle line:90%
in our world.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.322 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Sounds like a
very enlightening program.

00:09:33.322 --> 00:09:34.780 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little
bit more about it.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:37.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, what I've done
is establish this timeline,

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.072 align:middle line:84%
this sort of stair
step, if you will,

00:09:40.072 --> 00:09:42.280 align:middle line:84%
of people that are on the
ascension path today, which

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.670 align:middle line:84%
is basically all of us, to
say this had a beginning,

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:46.750 align:middle line:90%
this had an origin.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:48.820 align:middle line:84%
As we follow this
progression, we

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:52.087 align:middle line:84%
begin to realize that this
has been going on a long time.

00:09:52.087 --> 00:09:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And some of the greatest
mystics of all time

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.378 align:middle line:84%
have been involved
in this and have

00:09:55.378 --> 00:09:58.120 align:middle line:84%
been focusing on this
idea of how do we advance

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.710 align:middle line:90%
the human race spiritually.

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:00.580 align:middle line:90%
How do we ascend?

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.940 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How do you teach
a child some of this?

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.160 align:middle line:84%
So they really get ready
as they become an adult.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, for
one thing, you really

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:09.700 align:middle line:90%
build their self-esteem.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.280 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
key aspects of this.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.680 align:middle line:84%
You teach them to
love themselves.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.350 align:middle line:84%
Because that's something that
so many people have to overcome.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:21.515 align:middle line:84%
Childhood traumas, that gap
that so many people have

00:10:21.515 --> 00:10:23.140 align:middle line:84%
in their lives that
they try to fill up

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.910 align:middle line:84%
with drugs or alcohol or
other things like that--

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:26.710 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Escapism.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:27.752 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Escapism, right.

00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:32.440 align:middle line:84%
So if we can start by just
placing within each child's

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:35.260 align:middle line:84%
heart this understanding
that they are loved and loved

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.940 align:middle line:84%
by all, that would completely
transform their lives.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: William, how did the
ancients understand ascension?

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
the cultures did.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.380 align:middle line:90%
How did they know?

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, I think
they had helpers.

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.075 align:middle line:84%
In many of these
traditions, you have--

00:10:49.075 --> 00:10:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: From above?

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:50.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.050 align:middle line:84%
You have outside beings,
extraterrestrials or angels,

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:53.680 align:middle line:90%
that are coming in.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.222 align:middle line:84%
They're always trying
to make contact

00:10:55.222 --> 00:10:58.240 align:middle line:84%
with other worldly beings
that have already gone

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.710 align:middle line:90%
through this process before us.

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:01.840 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes, for example,
we focus very heavily

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.160 align:middle line:90%
on the Essenes in the series.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And they were--
their sole reason

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.927 align:middle line:84%
for existence was to call
in a high celestial being.

00:11:08.927 --> 00:11:10.510 align:middle line:84%
This is what the
Dead Sea Scrolls say,

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:12.940 align:middle line:84%
that they went out
into the desert

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:16.570 align:middle line:84%
to fulfill this prophecy of
an ancient prophecy by Isaiah

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.400 align:middle line:84%
that a group of
people would make way

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.110 align:middle line:90%
for the arrival of the lord.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And they went out
to literally call

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.352 align:middle line:84%
in this high celestial being
who ended up being Jesus.

00:11:24.352 --> 00:11:26.560 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We'll get into
the Essenes in just a moment

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.230 align:middle line:84%
because that's a fascinating
culture all by itself.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.100 align:middle line:90%
What about angels?

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.517 align:middle line:84%
Where do they fit
into this thing?

00:11:31.517 --> 00:11:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, the angels
have always been with us.

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And many of these traditions
believe that humans

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.800 align:middle line:90%
could become angels.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:45.130 align:middle line:84%
The angels in this viewpoint
live in a higher celestial

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:46.030 align:middle line:90%
state of being.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.380 align:middle line:90%
They call it celestial flesh.

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.840 align:middle line:90%
They have bodies of light.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.730 align:middle line:90%
And we have bodies of flesh.

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And the angels are immensely
compassionate beings.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:57.205 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are we moving
towards the bodies of light?

00:11:57.205 --> 00:11:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes, we are.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:58.370 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: As individuals?

00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes, we are.

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:00.820 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.480 align:middle line:84%
Especially today, we are taking
evolution into our own hands

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.420 align:middle line:84%
now and playing god,
especially with transhumanism.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.390 align:middle line:84%
But then on the other side,
you have the organic ascension

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:12.220 align:middle line:84%
as well, where people
are taking control

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.810 align:middle line:84%
of their thoughts,
their emotions,

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:17.752 align:middle line:84%
and recognizing that,
hey, I can become more

00:12:17.752 --> 00:12:19.210 align:middle line:84%
through a spiritual
transformation.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I was going to say,
how can an individual ascend

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.270 align:middle line:90%
on their own?

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:24.370 align:middle line:90%
Or do you need a teacher?

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: No.

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:26.143 align:middle line:90%
You can do it on your own.

00:12:26.143 --> 00:12:29.500 align:middle line:84%
We all have it hardwired within
our DNA, this capability.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.530 align:middle line:84%
That old analogy
of the caterpillar

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:35.410 align:middle line:84%
morphing into a butterfly
is totally apropos here.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:37.570 align:middle line:90%
We have it hardwired into us.

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.680 align:middle line:84%
What we need is the
inspiration and some guidance

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:41.480 align:middle line:90%
for doing this.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And my wife Claire and I did
a program called "Arcanum"

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.800 align:middle line:84%
on Gaia where we looked at
all this sacred art that

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:53.200 align:middle line:84%
was created with the intention
of being a method of focusing

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.860 align:middle line:84%
for meditation on images
of higher celestial

00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.520 align:middle line:84%
beings with the recognition
that our neuro circuitry

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:04.336 align:middle line:84%
is wired such that what
we see, we can become.

00:13:04.336 --> 00:13:08.110 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Have we forgotten
things that we may have learned

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:09.000 align:middle line:90%
a long time ago?

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: We've been called
a species with amnesia.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And the question is,
what have we forgotten.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And probably the main
thing that we've forgotten

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:18.010 align:middle line:90%
is our true self.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:21.550 align:middle line:84%
We identify with our physical
flesh and blood bodies.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:24.850 align:middle line:84%
But within that body is our
light body, our true self.

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we need to
get back to and focus on.

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did we start
out as light bodies?

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:32.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: According to the
gnostic teachings that we

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.060 align:middle line:90%
discuss in the show, yes.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.770 align:middle line:84%
That's their
foundational belief,

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:38.320 align:middle line:84%
that when Adam and
Eve were originally

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.910 align:middle line:84%
in the Garden of
Eden, this place

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:43.270 align:middle line:84%
of pure light and pure love,
they were not in physical flesh

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:44.440 align:middle line:90%
and blood bodies.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.380 align:middle line:84%
It was only after that
encounter with the serpent

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:49.660 align:middle line:84%
and the eating of
the forbidden fruit

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.820 align:middle line:84%
and our punishment
for that, that we

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:54.353 align:middle line:84%
acquired our physical
flesh and blood bodies.

00:13:54.353 --> 00:13:55.270 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Interesting.

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:56.630 align:middle line:90%
How can we ascend now?

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:57.430 align:middle line:90%
How can we do that?

00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: We can
begin by focusing

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.670 align:middle line:84%
on a quest for wholeness and
becoming more compassionate.

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:05.770 align:middle line:84%
The foundational
teaching that runs

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:08.830 align:middle line:84%
through all of these ascension
teachings throughout the world

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:13.450 align:middle line:84%
is that what our ultimate aim
is to become more compassionate,

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:14.830 align:middle line:90%
to become more loving beings.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And that is something
all of us can do.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Then we begin to focus on
our next level of evolution

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:24.040 align:middle line:84%
beginning to gain
awareness of our light body

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:27.130 align:middle line:84%
and those capabilities that the
light body has of telekinesis

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:30.240 align:middle line:84%
and clairvoyance and
other psychic abilities.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Tell us about the
title of "Ascension Keepers,"

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:34.130 align:middle line:90%
your new Gaia show.

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well,
ascension keepers refers

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:38.450 align:middle line:84%
to these groups that
have been appearing

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:42.470 align:middle line:84%
over several thousand years that
have been preserving and then

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:44.390 align:middle line:84%
updating these
ascension teachings.

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:47.540 align:middle line:84%
We looked at the clip a
moment ago from Alexandria,

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:50.042 align:middle line:90%
which is such a pivotal moment.

00:14:50.042 --> 00:14:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I love
Egypt, by the way.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.560 align:middle line:84%
Love Egypt,
especially Alexandria.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And when Alexander
conquered the world,

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.550 align:middle line:90%
he literally changed the world.

00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:59.750 align:middle line:90%
And he was deeply mystical.

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And so were his
generals that took over

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.083 align:middle line:90%
after his death, the Ptolemies.

00:15:04.083 --> 00:15:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And they're the ones that built
the Library of Alexandria.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.720 align:middle line:84%
They built the
city of Alexandria

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.460 align:middle line:90%
as an ascension center.

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And they brought scholars
from all over the known world

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.830 align:middle line:84%
to gather this
knowledge together

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:20.070 align:middle line:84%
about how humans can transform
into higher celestial beings.

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.520 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: These
ascension keepers,

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.130 align:middle line:84%
are we being monitored
by something?

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:26.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: I believe that we are.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.630 align:middle line:84%
I believe, whether you're
talking about flesh and blood

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.640 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial
beings, we're clearly

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.510 align:middle line:84%
being observed and
watched, monitored.

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And we're also being observed
by spiritual beings as well.

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: William, you
mentioned the Essenes.

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And of course, my
knowledge of the Essenes

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.860 align:middle line:84%
came when that little boy
stumbled inside a cave

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:49.620 align:middle line:84%
and found the Dead Sea Scrolls
written by the Essenes.

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:50.420 align:middle line:90%
Who were they?

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: The
Essenes were a tribe

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.370 align:middle line:90%
of primarily Jewish mystics.

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:58.160 align:middle line:84%
They had buddhists that
were part of their order.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:02.300 align:middle line:84%
They had zoroastrians from Iran
that were part of their order.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.190 align:middle line:90%
They were scholars.

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:06.890 align:middle line:84%
They were mystical scholars
who believed that humans

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:09.830 align:middle line:90%
could transform into angels.

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:11.770 align:middle line:84%
They called themselves
the perfect ones.

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:13.700 align:middle line:84%
That word perfect
means to become

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.010 align:middle line:84%
more whole, more
holy, more complete,

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:17.510 align:middle line:90%
and more compassionate.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And they claimed in
the Dead Sea Scrolls,

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.400 align:middle line:84%
and this is one of the great
controversies about the scrolls

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.910 align:middle line:84%
and one of the reasons why
they were so vigorously opposed

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:29.330 align:middle line:84%
and sequestered when they
were first discovered in 1947,

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:31.820 align:middle line:84%
is that the Essenes
talked profusely

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:35.935 align:middle line:84%
about celestial beings,
aliens, celestial cites.

00:16:35.935 --> 00:16:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Ironic that's
when Roswell happened, too.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:39.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.550 align:middle line:90%
Yes, very interesting.

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:41.600 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And so they were deeply
interested in this idea

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:46.650 align:middle line:84%
of how humans connect
with celestial beings,

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:49.775 align:middle line:84%
and how humans, in fact,
can become celestial beings.

00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:51.925 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Was Jesus an Essene?

00:16:51.925 --> 00:16:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: It's very
controversial.

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:58.310 align:middle line:84%
There's no question that Jesus
taught what the Essenes taught.

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:01.430 align:middle line:84%
He was probably
raised as an Essene.

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:03.560 align:middle line:84%
The Dead Sea Scrolls
don't mention Jesus

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.180 align:middle line:90%
by name, of course.

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:07.400 align:middle line:10%
But people like
Edgar Cayce, who have

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.160 align:middle line:10%
done some extraordinary
research on the Essenes,

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:14.089 align:middle line:10%
and his readings about the
Essenes were validated.

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Cayce's readings were
done a couple of decades

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.319 align:middle line:84%
before the scrolls
are discovered.

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:20.329 align:middle line:84%
And the scrolls
validate what Cayce

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:23.359 align:middle line:84%
had said, that the virgin
Mary was an Essene.

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:24.890 align:middle line:90%
So was John the baptist.

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And the virgin
Mary was, in fact,

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.990 align:middle line:84%
one of a number of
temple priestesses

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:33.320 align:middle line:84%
that were carefully
raised to house,

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.340 align:middle line:84%
to embody this divine child
that the Essenes were calling

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.930 align:middle line:90%
in that ended up being Jesus.

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:41.180 align:middle line:84%
So while we can't
say definitively

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.850 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus was an
Essenes, the beatitudes,

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:46.260 align:middle line:84%
his sermon on the mount,
straight out of the Essene

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:47.060 align:middle line:90%
play book.

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's like
they wrote it for him.

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:51.451 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's look at more
of the Essenes from "Ascension

00:17:51.451 --> 00:17:53.490 align:middle line:90%
Keepers."

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: We will use this
word perfect as a sort

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:58.690 align:middle line:84%
of a golden needle
to weave a thread

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:01.420 align:middle line:84%
through various
ascension traditions.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.780 align:middle line:84%
The word perfect means to become
more whole, more holy, more

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:08.630 align:middle line:90%
complete, and cosmic.

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:10.580 align:middle line:10%
According to mystical
Jewish tradition,

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.480 align:middle line:10%
Adam and Eve as archetypes
of the human race,

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.670 align:middle line:10%
wore celestial garments of
light which was actually

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:23.980 align:middle line:10%
a luminescent body that glows or
radiates light like a rainbow.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:27.300 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes believed our
purpose and goal in life

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:31.230 align:middle line:84%
was to return to our
original divine state

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:33.780 align:middle line:84%
and recover our
garments of light.

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.270 align:middle line:84%
Remembering our
light bodies would

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:40.050 align:middle line:84%
lead to a transformed
world, they believed.

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Early sources say the
Essenes lived on Mount Carmel

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:43.900 align:middle line:90%
in northern Israel.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.700 align:middle line:84%
But they also operated a
hermetically sealed compound

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:50.810 align:middle line:90%
at Qumran and elsewhere.

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:53.460 align:middle line:10%
Calling themselves
the children of light,

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.810 align:middle line:10%
the Essenes literally saw
themselves in a cosmic war

00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:58.460 align:middle line:10%
against the children
of darkness,

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:02.390 align:middle line:10%
who they believed were
incarnated as the Roman Empire.

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:03.980 align:middle line:84%
They claimed they
were making the way

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.930 align:middle line:84%
for the arrival of
a high celestial

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:10.610 align:middle line:84%
being who would lead a
revolution in human evolution,

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:13.820 align:middle line:84%
transforming Earth and
humanity into a golden planet

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.860 align:middle line:84%
of righteousness
and the human race

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:19.032 align:middle line:84%
into its most perfect
state of being.

00:19:19.032 --> 00:19:20.990 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: William, why
are the Dead Sea Scrolls

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:22.460 align:middle line:90%
so controversial?

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:25.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, for one
reason, think about it, 1947,

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.810 align:middle line:84%
it's right after
World War II when

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:28.655 align:middle line:90%
they're suddenly discovered.

00:19:28.655 --> 00:19:29.960 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Again, Roswell.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Roswell, right.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:32.020 align:middle line:90%
Same time.

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.020 align:middle line:84%
We have the gnostic gospels
that were discovered

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:36.000 align:middle line:90%
in Nag Hammadi, Egypt in 1945.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.520 align:middle line:90%
So something's going on.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And then in the early
'50s when the scholars got

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:44.270 align:middle line:84%
their first glimpse
at a small fragment

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:47.750 align:middle line:84%
of the scrolls, a
small portion of them,

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:49.830 align:middle line:90%
they realized, wait a minute.

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:53.900 align:middle line:84%
This is almost saying that this
is the basis for Christianity.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And these scrolls are talking
about celestial beings

00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:59.630 align:middle line:84%
and alien civilizations
and a new superhuman race.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:02.540 align:middle line:84%
We just got rid of the Nazis
who talking about a master race.

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, this is
the age of Billy Graham

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:08.360 align:middle line:84%
and his crusades, and Ike
fighting those godless commies.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And here's the Essenes
advocating communism.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.830 align:middle line:90%
They lived communally.

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And Elvis and his rock
and roll revolution, this

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.000 align:middle line:90%
is all too much.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.480 align:middle line:84%
So what happened is
that the scholars that

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.060 align:middle line:84%
were in control of
the Dead Sea Scrolls

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:26.300 align:middle line:84%
literally locked them
away from academic eyes

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:31.050 align:middle line:84%
for four decades because of the
controversy surrounding them,

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:33.650 align:middle line:84%
and all of the
academic infighting

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:36.000 align:middle line:84%
that went on for
control of them as well.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.450 align:middle line:90%
And so it wasn't until 1996--

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:39.530 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That late.

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:40.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.470 align:middle line:84%
When the University
of California

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:44.810 align:middle line:84%
illegally published
their original photos

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:46.550 align:middle line:84%
of the complete
set of the scrolls,

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:49.400 align:middle line:84%
that that is the only time when
the academics started to get

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.050 align:middle line:90%
access to the Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Didn't they find or
release additional Dead Sea

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.340 align:middle line:90%
Scrolls eventually?

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:56.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: They did.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is what is
yet to even make it

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:00.980 align:middle line:90%
into the popular literature yet.

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And as it does,
it's going to show

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:05.870 align:middle line:84%
that Christianity
is foundationally

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:08.270 align:middle line:90%
based on the Essene teachings.

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about these
previous ascension teachings

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:13.520 align:middle line:84%
that the Essenes were
bringing together.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.895 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Who taught them?

00:21:14.895 --> 00:21:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, the Essenes
were part of this movement that

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:19.580 align:middle line:84%
came out of Alexandria,
Egypt, where

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:23.000 align:middle line:84%
we had mystics coming from
India, from Iraq, from Iran,

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.350 align:middle line:90%
and Egypt.

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:26.390 align:middle line:84%
They were, in part, the
teachers of the Essenes,

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:27.530 align:middle line:90%
but also the Essenes.

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is the reason why
Qumran was hermetically sealed,

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:35.090 align:middle line:84%
is because the Essenes claimed
they were living with angels.

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:37.760 align:middle line:84%
They were living with
extraterrestrial beings.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.800 align:middle line:84%
Now the only thing
we can compare it to,

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.710 align:middle line:84%
George, is just imagine you
have some group of people that

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:45.350 align:middle line:84%
suddenly go out in the
middle of the desert in Utah

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:48.320 align:middle line:84%
and create this
hermetically sealed compound

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:51.180 align:middle line:84%
and maintain that they are
living with extraterrestrials,

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:53.180 align:middle line:84%
and that these extraterrestrials
are giving them

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:54.657 align:middle line:90%
this advanced knowledge.

00:21:54.657 --> 00:21:56.240 align:middle line:84%
How would the United
States government

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.530 align:middle line:90%
react to something like that?

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:01.458 align:middle line:84%
They would react exactly
the same way Rome acted back

00:22:01.458 --> 00:22:02.750 align:middle line:90%
during the time of the Essenes.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:03.960 align:middle line:84%
They're going to try
to shot them down.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:04.460 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They're
going to suppress it.

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: They're going
to suppress them.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.160 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now, were the Essenes
a population of men, women,

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:10.070 align:middle line:90%
children?

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:12.755 align:middle line:90%
Or were they just people, guys?

00:22:12.755 --> 00:22:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: There were--
it was mostly men.

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:17.622 align:middle line:84%
But there were women and
children in the order as well.

00:22:17.622 --> 00:22:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They sound like
Jesuits or something.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, yeah, they're
highly academic and highly

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:26.510 align:middle line:84%
mystical and had this
absolute insistence on purity.

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
was because they

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.560 align:middle line:84%
said they're living with
extraterrestrial beings,

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.100 align:middle line:84%
super high vibrational
angelic extraterrestrial type

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.470 align:middle line:84%
beings that were literally
living with them.

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they had
this mandate on purity.

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did they understand
the Adam and Eve concept

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:43.970 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that?

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:46.010 align:middle line:84%
Did it originate
with them or not?

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:47.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: No.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:50.630 align:middle line:84%
This had been part of
Jewish mysticism for a while

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:51.650 align:middle line:90%
before the Essenes.

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:54.830 align:middle line:84%
But they absolutely
believed that we do not

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:57.080 align:middle line:84%
belong in these flesh
and blood bodies

00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:02.300 align:middle line:84%
that we live in today, that we
had an original form as a light

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.510 align:middle line:84%
being, and that the
body of the angels,

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:07.907 align:middle line:84%
and that we need to get
back to that original form.

00:23:07.907 --> 00:23:09.240 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What happened to them?

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:09.770 align:middle line:90%
Where'd they go?

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: What happened
to the Essenes?

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:17.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, in 67 CE, Rome
invaded Jerusalem, destroyed

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:20.810 align:middle line:84%
the temple of Solomon, wiped
out all of the Essenes living

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:21.877 align:middle line:90%
at Masada, Carmel.

00:23:21.877 --> 00:23:22.960 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Killed them all?

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.002 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Killed them all.

00:23:24.002 --> 00:23:26.240 align:middle line:84%
Left their rotting bodies
floating in the Dead Sea

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.740 align:middle line:84%
and took the children
as sex slaves.

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:28.940 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And hence that's why
the hid the Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:31.357 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: And that's when the
Essenes, having foreknowledge

00:23:31.357 --> 00:23:32.780 align:middle line:84%
of this, hid the
Dead Sea Scrolls

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:34.670 align:middle line:90%
in the caves near Qumran.

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:38.330 align:middle line:84%
Now some of them probably
escaped before this time.

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:40.180 align:middle line:84%
Knowing that this
invasion was imminent,

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:44.107 align:middle line:84%
it's claimed that they went to
the border of China and Tibet.

00:23:44.107 --> 00:23:44.940 align:middle line:90%
They went to France.

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:45.980 align:middle line:90%
Some went to Russia.

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.480 align:middle line:84%
They probably went
to Egypt as well.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.552 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Might they have
ascended into the sky?

00:23:49.552 --> 00:23:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Some of them, I
believe, absolutely did.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:53.868 align:middle line:90%
No question.

00:23:53.868 --> 00:23:55.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think of the
power of this, George,

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.570 align:middle line:84%
that if you have this
knowledge about how

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:02.560 align:middle line:84%
to transform the human body
into a higher celestial form

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.840 align:middle line:84%
and you're living with
extraterrestrials,

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.805 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be marked
for elimination by most

00:24:07.805 --> 00:24:08.605 align:middle line:90%
governments.

00:24:08.605 --> 00:24:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why were
authorities hiding this?

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:11.830 align:middle line:90%
What were they afraid of?

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:13.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well,
because back then,

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.535 align:middle line:84%
there was there was no
empire greater than Rome.

00:24:16.535 --> 00:24:17.660 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Of course not.

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And if you said
that, off goes your head.

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:23.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:26.110 align:middle line:84%
So the Essenes were threatening
to Rome in that regard,

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:28.590 align:middle line:84%
because they're talking
about a complete flip-flop

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:31.360 align:middle line:84%
of civilization and the power
structure on this planet,

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.842 align:middle line:84%
and linking us to the cosmic
realms and to greater empires

00:24:34.842 --> 00:24:36.550 align:middle line:84%
than we can even
conceive on this planet.

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:39.190 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The Dead Sea
Scrolls, physically,

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:40.300 align:middle line:90%
are made up of what?

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Some are lamb skin.

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:43.990 align:middle line:90%
Some are papyrus.

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:45.563 align:middle line:90%
They're very fragile.

00:24:45.563 --> 00:24:47.980 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this was part of the
problem when they discovered

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:51.620 align:middle line:84%
is that the scholars that
originally handled them totally

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:52.420 align:middle line:90%
mishandled them.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.430 align:middle line:84%
They would leave them
exposed to the elements

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:56.370 align:middle line:84%
and didn't take care
of them very well.

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:58.870 align:middle line:84%
They were literally
disintegrating right

00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:59.810 align:middle line:90%
before our very eyes.

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:01.810 align:middle line:84%
As long as they were in
those jars in the caves,

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:04.960 align:middle line:84%
they were hermetically sealed
and they were absolutely fine.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.577 align:middle line:84%
And then when exposed
to the elements,

00:25:06.577 --> 00:25:07.660 align:middle line:90%
they started to decompose.

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:08.320 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They fell apart.

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And they're almost a couple
of thousand years old.

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes, they are.

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's remarkable.

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: It's truly remarkable.

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:17.500 align:middle line:84%
What a gift it is that we
have this knowledge today.

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.778 align:middle line:84%
We're able to go back and
piece this puzzle together.

00:25:19.778 --> 00:25:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Who interpreted them?

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:23.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were
written in what?

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:25.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: They were
written mostly in Aramaic.

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And you had scholars,
there's a whole team

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:32.200 align:middle line:84%
that were assembled to
initially decipher the scrolls

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.117 align:middle line:90%
and to translate them.

00:25:33.117 --> 00:25:35.783 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did they have an oh my
god moment when they're looking

00:25:35.783 --> 00:25:37.225 align:middle line:84%
at them, and they
said, oh, look.

00:25:37.225 --> 00:25:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: It was
so controversial.

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:39.940 align:middle line:90%
So controversial.

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:41.860 align:middle line:84%
Because it became so
apparent that this

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.470 align:middle line:90%
is the origins of Christianity.

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And some even go
so far as to say

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:50.800 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus may have even
held these actual documents.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:51.648 align:middle line:90%
He quoted from them.

00:25:51.648 --> 00:25:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Maybe he even
wrote some of them.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: He probably didn't
literally write them.

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:58.090 align:middle line:84%
But it's very possible
that he himself actually

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:01.600 align:middle line:84%
handled these manuscripts
and studied from them.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.770 align:middle line:84%
That is so profound
to think about that.

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: A lot of people
confuse the Dead Sea Scrolls

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:10.150 align:middle line:90%
with the bible in Genesis.

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Are we talking about two
different things here?

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:16.440 align:middle line:84%
We're talking two completely
different scenarios.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.880 align:middle line:84%
The book of Genesis
was primarily

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.980 align:middle line:90%
composed around 600 BCE.

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.920 align:middle line:84%
So this is about 300
years before the Essenes

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.590 align:middle line:84%
started getting their
movement together.

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:28.070 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And who wrote Genesis?

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, that's
a good question.

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:33.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they say Moses
wrote the book of Genesis.

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:36.070 align:middle line:84%
There was no real
awareness or understanding

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:37.540 align:middle line:84%
of that before
the time of Moses.

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:39.123 align:middle line:84%
And some people
believe actually Moses

00:26:39.123 --> 00:26:41.230 align:middle line:84%
channeled the book of
Genesis from Yahweh,

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:43.540 align:middle line:84%
that Yahweh told
Moses this history.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:46.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You have devoted
several episodes of "Ascension

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Keepers" to the
teachings of gnostics.

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:53.400 align:middle line:90%
I want to get into that.

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:57.350 align:middle line:10%
>>HENRY: After the genocide
of the Essenes in 68 CE,

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:59.570 align:middle line:10%
the first to fourth
centuries CE saw

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:04.280 align:middle line:10%
the Essene ascension teachings
go underground and reform

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:06.710 align:middle line:10%
as gnostic.

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:09.290 align:middle line:84%
This religion was so
named because it depended

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:13.160 align:middle line:84%
upon personal spiritual
revelation, the gnosis

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.250 align:middle line:90%
or knowledge of god.

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Gnosis simply means knowledge,
especially of divine mysteries,

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:25.040 align:middle line:84%
pointing to the mystical
desire of the gnostics

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:29.240 align:middle line:84%
to expand their consciousness
beyond ordinary perception

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:32.570 align:middle line:90%
and to see beyond the veil.

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:35.240 align:middle line:84%
This enables access
to the divine realm.

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.120 align:middle line:10%
And according to some
scholars, the mystical path

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:41.030 align:middle line:10%
by which the gnostics
attained illumination

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:43.490 align:middle line:10%
is mapped and teachable.

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:47.770 align:middle line:10%
This means anyone
can follow this path.

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Whereas in the past,
ascending to god's throne

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:53.230 align:middle line:84%
and seeing his face
was prohibited--

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:56.220 align:middle line:84%
and in my humble opinion,
thanks to the Essenes,

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:59.170 align:middle line:90%
now a shift had happened.

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:01.060 align:middle line:84%
The gnostics,
practicing what they

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:03.760 align:middle line:84%
called [INAUDIBLE]
and merkaba teachings,

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:07.330 align:middle line:84%
now began to emphasize
the practice of ascension

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:10.195 align:middle line:90%
and seeing god.

00:28:10.195 --> 00:28:12.320 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I think if you'd
lived during those days,

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.608 align:middle line:84%
you would have been a
gnostic or an Essene.

00:28:14.608 --> 00:28:15.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: I'm pretty sure.

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:16.775 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: One or the other.

00:28:16.775 --> 00:28:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Absolutely.

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:21.020 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, totally resonate
and get these stories.

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:23.870 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking about the
Essenes, feel very comfortable

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:25.850 align:middle line:84%
and have almost
a cellular memory

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:27.950 align:middle line:84%
of what that must have
been like to be there.

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Can you be both
a gnostic and an Essene?

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:31.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Oh, absolutely.

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Because gnosis really just means
knowledge or enlightenment.

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:36.770 align:middle line:84%
It's about the quest
for enlightenment.

00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So these were
well educated people?

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:41.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Super well educated.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
the misnomers about

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:45.590 align:middle line:84%
like the disciples
of Jesus for example,

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:48.380 align:middle line:84%
they're often presented as
these fairly simple fishermen

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.120 align:middle line:84%
and carpenters and
things of this nature.

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.640 align:middle line:84%
But actually, these are some
of the most highly trained

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.220 align:middle line:90%
mystical initiates of all time.

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.870 align:middle line:84%
They were very,
very illuminated.

00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:00.095 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What did they feel
about extraterrestrials?

00:29:00.095 --> 00:29:02.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, they didn't
use the word extraterrestrial.

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:05.270 align:middle line:84%
But they talk
profusely about angels

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:08.990 align:middle line:84%
and that humans could become
angels or celestial beings

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:10.430 align:middle line:90%
and dwell in other worlds.

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:13.310 align:middle line:84%
One of their great
inspirations was Pythagoras,

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:15.210 align:middle line:90%
the great mathematician.

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:17.487 align:middle line:90%
Numerology came from him.

00:29:17.487 --> 00:29:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Absolutely.

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:19.945 align:middle line:84%
So many of our
mathematical principles.

00:29:19.945 --> 00:29:22.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, Pythagoras believed
that all the planets

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:24.780 align:middle line:84%
in our solar system
are inhabited.

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:27.260 align:middle line:10%
And that the further out
that you go into space,

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:31.010 align:middle line:10%
the lighter we become, that
there are other planets that

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:32.840 align:middle line:10%
are inhabited and that
the beings are not

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.480 align:middle line:10%
in flesh and blood form.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.260 align:middle line:90%
They're in a light body form.

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And that through sound
and through meditation,

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:41.855 align:middle line:84%
we can return to
that light body form.

00:29:41.855 --> 00:29:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You've talked about
beamers with the gnostics.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:45.800 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.570 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking
about cars, are we?

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: No, we're not talking
about "Star Trek," although we

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:51.010 align:middle line:90%
kind of are.

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:54.820 align:middle line:84%
In one of the gnostic
traditions called

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:58.320 align:middle line:84%
manichaeism that
came out of Iran.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
teacher named Mani

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:03.410 align:middle line:84%
who was a researcher
like the Essenes.

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:08.320 align:middle line:84%
He referred to the gnostics
as having a beaming garment.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.640 align:middle line:84%
This is a robe of light
that they would wear.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.140 align:middle line:90%
It's a transmittable garment.

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:13.645 align:middle line:90%
The Annunaki originally wore.

00:30:13.645 --> 00:30:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Sounds like
a teleportation device.

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:16.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:17.080 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And so once they had
this robe of light

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:21.950 align:middle line:84%
that they literally manifested
from within their body,

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:24.980 align:middle line:90%
they beamed or radiated light.

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:28.880 align:middle line:84%
But they could also then be
teleported or transported--

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.130 align:middle line:84%
translated is one of
the terms they used--

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:32.780 align:middle line:90%
throughout the cosmos.

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:36.230 align:middle line:84%
In "Star Trek" vernacular,
we call that beaming.

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:38.930 align:middle line:84%
So I like to call
the gnostics beamers

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:41.510 align:middle line:84%
because they were
intent on re-acquiring

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:45.090 align:middle line:84%
this robe of radiating light
and then beaming themselves

00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:45.890 align:middle line:90%
through the cosmos.

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is what they
talk about in these texts,

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:50.420 align:middle line:84%
that they have the ability, once
they attain their light body,

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:52.820 align:middle line:84%
they can beam themselves
to another planet,

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:56.930 align:middle line:84%
then reform their physical flesh
and blood body if they want to.

00:30:56.930 --> 00:30:59.052 align:middle line:84%
And that is a natural
human ability,

00:30:59.052 --> 00:31:00.260 align:middle line:90%
according to these teachings.

00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Were there other
regions on the planet

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:06.440 align:middle line:84%
at the time that were so
enlightened as the gnostics

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.760 align:middle line:90%
were, the Essenes?

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Absolutely.

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:11.030 align:middle line:84%
You're going to point
to the Himalayas,

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:14.380 align:middle line:84%
for example, regions
in China and Tibet.

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:17.090 align:middle line:84%
They're the researching
the exact same things.

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is why Alexandria
was so important

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:23.300 align:middle line:84%
because the Ptolemies were
the successors of Alexander

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:25.370 align:middle line:84%
the Great, sought
to conquer the world

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:27.650 align:middle line:84%
and to bring all these
scholars together

00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:31.160 align:middle line:84%
in one place for the
first time in Alexandria.

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's an amazing series
of events that occurred here.

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Oh, truly.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.550 align:middle line:84%
It's a history that most
of us are not aware of.

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:40.460 align:middle line:84%
But once we plug
into it, we can see

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:42.890 align:middle line:84%
that we're part of
this progression,

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:45.830 align:middle line:84%
this evolutionary progression
that it seems to be reaching

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:48.300 align:middle line:90%
its apex in our time.

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What did the gnostics
try to teach people in that

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:51.910 align:middle line:90%
time period, William?

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, they
wanted them to recognize

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:58.100 align:middle line:84%
that this material world that
we live in and are so identified

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:00.230 align:middle line:90%
with is illusory.

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:03.500 align:middle line:84%
That it's brought to
life by our imagination,

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.800 align:middle line:84%
and to take our focus off
of our physical existence

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:10.130 align:middle line:84%
and put it on our
immaterial light body.

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And in so doing, you
gain access to all kinds

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:16.070 align:middle line:84%
of mystical capabilities,
spiritual capabilities,

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:17.112 align:middle line:90%
and also mystical realms.

00:32:17.112 --> 00:32:18.862 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Would you
call them good people?

00:32:18.862 --> 00:32:19.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Absolutely.

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:24.290 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Essenes called
themselves the good Christians.

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:29.780 align:middle line:84%
The Cathars later embodied
this whole gnostic or ascension

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:30.710 align:middle line:90%
keeper tradition.

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And they called themselves
the good Christians as well.

00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And Jesus
was exactly what?

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:39.900 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the
Essenes and the gnostics,

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:41.450 align:middle line:90%
was he part of the group?

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: From an
Essene perspective,

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.920 align:middle line:90%
Jesus embodied their teachings.

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:50.870 align:middle line:84%
He demonstrated their
teachings in his resurrection

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:52.400 align:middle line:90%
and his ascension.

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.950 align:middle line:84%
He is a high
celestial being that

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:58.670 align:middle line:84%
was called in by
the Essenes, who

00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:02.270 align:middle line:84%
came through the virgin Mary,
a carefully prepared priestess

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:05.720 align:middle line:84%
that was specially readied
for this specific purpose

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:09.880 align:middle line:84%
of carrying this
high celestial being.

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, like John the
baptist, was probably

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:15.570 align:middle line:84%
nurtured by the Essenes,
taught from a very young age

00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:18.980 align:middle line:84%
their spiritual principles
to help him remember

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:21.070 align:middle line:90%
his spiritual capabilities.

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And then he demonstrated in
his life and his teachings

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:26.485 align:middle line:90%
the Essene way.

00:33:26.485 --> 00:33:28.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did his
parents teach him this?

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:30.460 align:middle line:90%
How did he learn this?

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:31.570 align:middle line:90%
Or was it god given?

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, some
of it was inherent,

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:37.870 align:middle line:84%
that had to be remembered as
he came into the Earth plane.

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:39.340 align:middle line:84%
But yes, there were
other teachers.

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:43.600 align:middle line:84%
John the baptist, his cousin,
was an Essene master initiator.

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.610 align:middle line:84%
The baptism by John
in the river Jordan

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:47.950 align:middle line:84%
was a cosmic
awakening for Jesus.

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And immediately after that,
he went up to the top of Mt.

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:53.320 align:middle line:84%
Hermon and demonstrated
his ability

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:56.440 align:middle line:84%
to put on the robe of light,
which is their primary quest.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.195 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Were they
fanatics, William?

00:33:58.195 --> 00:33:59.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:04.220 align:middle line:84%
They have a reputation as
being elitist and fanatics.

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:07.630 align:middle line:84%
But that is not really
fair because their purpose

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:11.020 align:middle line:84%
in doing this was not out
of self-righteousness.

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:13.810 align:middle line:84%
It was about how to
transform the human race.

00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:16.840 align:middle line:84%
They were fed up with
the lack of understanding

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.340 align:middle line:84%
that the average
person has about

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:21.200 align:middle line:84%
their spiritual capability and
the ability that each of us

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:22.000 align:middle line:90%
has to ascend.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.602 align:middle line:84%
Because what they're
up against are

00:34:23.602 --> 00:34:25.060 align:middle line:84%
religious and
political authorities

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:27.156 align:middle line:84%
that say, who are you
to think you can ascend.

00:34:27.156 --> 00:34:28.739 align:middle line:84%
If god wants you to
ascend, he's going

00:34:28.739 --> 00:34:30.159 align:middle line:90%
to send you an invitation.

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:31.810 align:middle line:90%
Until then, sit down, shut up.

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:34.554 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Were they
anti-government at the time?

00:34:34.554 --> 00:34:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Basically, yeah.

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:41.199 align:middle line:84%
They primarily had real problems
with way the temple of Solomon

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:42.400 align:middle line:90%
was being run.

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:45.280 align:middle line:84%
This holy place, the holiest
place on Earth to them,

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:47.650 align:middle line:90%
had been desecrating by priests.

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:49.389 align:middle line:84%
And they decided that
they'd had enough.

00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:51.344 align:middle line:84%
And so they said, we're
going off on our own.

00:34:51.344 --> 00:34:52.719 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
it our own way.

00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:54.386 align:middle line:84%
And this is when they
get the reputation

00:34:54.386 --> 00:34:55.973 align:middle line:90%
of being elitist and so forth.

00:34:55.973 --> 00:34:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But they pulled
it off, didn't they?

00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:59.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: They did pull it off.

00:34:59.350 --> 00:34:59.800 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:00.600 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And they knew that
their mission would

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:04.420 align:middle line:90%
be incomplete at that time.

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:07.720 align:middle line:84%
They were content to wait
for another iteration

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:09.958 align:middle line:84%
or reincarnation of the
Essenes at a later time.

00:35:09.958 --> 00:35:12.250 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did they try to go
out and teach people this?

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:13.375 align:middle line:90%
Or did they keep it closed?

00:35:13.375 --> 00:35:15.858 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: They kept
it very closed.

00:35:15.858 --> 00:35:16.900 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's the thing.

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.700 align:middle line:90%
They weren't proselytizers.

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:20.590 align:middle line:84%
They weren't out on the
streets of Jerusalem,

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:24.190 align:middle line:84%
for example, saying,
hey, come be an Essene.

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:26.740 align:middle line:84%
You had to kind of be
called into the order.

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And then there were
very strict initiations

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:31.870 align:middle line:84%
that were undergone prepatory
to joining the Essenes.

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I would guess
the sanhedrin hated them.

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:35.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Oh, absolutely.

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:35.750 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The saw
that as a threat.

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: They saw that as
a threat because, in a way,

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:42.340 align:middle line:84%
the Essenes were
walking their talk.

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the other
high priests were not

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:45.975 align:middle line:90%
walking their talk at all.

00:35:45.975 --> 00:35:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did they
capture some of them?

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:48.910 align:middle line:90%
Did they kill them?

00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:49.870 align:middle line:90%
Crucify them?

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:50.670 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:52.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: When Rome came in--

00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:54.160 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Look what they did
to Jesus, for crying out loud.

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:54.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.320 align:middle line:84%
It was the 10th
legion that came in.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:59.775 align:middle line:84%
And they were just a
horrific killing machine.

00:35:59.775 --> 00:36:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Those that they
didn't kill, they

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:03.140 align:middle line:90%
took as sex slaves and slaves.

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:04.915 align:middle line:90%
And it was just horrific.

00:36:04.915 --> 00:36:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What were they
so opposed to, the Romans

00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:07.810 align:middle line:90%
at the time?

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, they're opposed
to the human awakening.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.420 align:middle line:84%
They're opposed
to losing control.

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Because if people are becoming
gnostic and Essenes and awaken,

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:21.700 align:middle line:84%
their allegiance is not
to an Earthly authority.

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Their allegiance is now
to a cosmic authority,

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.030 align:middle line:90%
beyond the Earth.

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's the danger,
from Rome's perspective.

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If you were a gnostic
during that time period,

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:32.740 align:middle line:84%
how would you have
handled yourself?

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:36.743 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: If you're a gnostic in
that time period, as an Essene

00:36:36.743 --> 00:36:38.410 align:middle line:84%
you would have been
wearing a white robe

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:41.200 align:middle line:84%
indicative of your purity
or quest for purity

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:44.560 align:middle line:84%
and also your quest for
your luminous robe of light.

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:48.250 align:middle line:84%
You would have been a being of
immense love and compassion.

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And you would have
been very scholarly.

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.760 align:middle line:90%
They were vegetarian.

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.152 align:middle line:90%
Up with the sun, out on a limb.

00:36:54.152 --> 00:36:55.735 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They were
a health fanatics.

00:36:55.735 --> 00:36:57.152 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: They were
health fanatics

00:36:57.152 --> 00:36:59.410 align:middle line:84%
and totally dedicated to
their spiritual lives.

00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What organization or
group of people today would be

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:04.940 align:middle line:90%
considered like gnostics?

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything you
can relate to that?

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: I think we don't
have specific organizations.

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:12.760 align:middle line:84%
But what you've got
are masses of people

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:15.040 align:middle line:84%
around the planet
that are recognizing

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:20.260 align:middle line:84%
that this way of life is a
better way of life, a cleaner

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:23.590 align:middle line:90%
diet, meditation, yoga.

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:25.720 align:middle line:84%
These are all things that
the Essenes practiced.

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And people are getting
tremendous benefit

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:28.690 align:middle line:90%
out of that today.

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:30.085 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Were they god fearing?

00:37:30.085 --> 00:37:30.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes.

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.920 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They were.

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:32.990 align:middle line:90%
So they believed in a god?

00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes.

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:34.270 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:35.810 align:middle line:84%
They followed the
10 commandments.

00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:39.220 align:middle line:84%
Even though they didn't agree
with the source of the 10

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:41.760 align:middle line:84%
commandments, they
certainly followed them.

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.240 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now, what do you
mean by they didn't agree with

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:43.585 align:middle line:90%
the source?

00:37:43.585 --> 00:37:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, part
of what happened,

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:47.800 align:middle line:84%
and this is the motivating
incident, really,

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:52.570 align:middle line:84%
that got the Essene revolution
going was back around 600 BCE.

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:55.480 align:middle line:84%
There was a book that was
mysteriously discovered

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.680 align:middle line:90%
in the temple of Solomon.

00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:58.540 align:middle line:84%
They were refurbishing
the temple.

00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:00.322 align:middle line:84%
And here comes this
book out of nowhere.

00:38:00.322 --> 00:38:01.780 align:middle line:84%
No one had ever
heard of it before.

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:03.700 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
book of Deuteronomy.

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And the king, the
then king, a boy king

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:10.000 align:middle line:84%
named Josiah and the priests
that were handling him,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.840 align:middle line:90%
said this is the new law.

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And Josiah literally
went out onto the portico

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:17.230 align:middle line:84%
of the temple of Solomon
and read the 10 commandments

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:18.330 align:middle line:90%
to the people.

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:21.427 align:middle line:84%
And the Jews had never heard
of Moses before this time.

00:38:21.427 --> 00:38:23.260 align:middle line:84%
They had never heard
of the 10 commandments.

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And they're going,
well, wait a minute.

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Where
did this come from?

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:26.977 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Where did
this come from?

00:38:26.977 --> 00:38:28.660 align:middle line:84%
We worship a divine
feminine deity.

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:30.340 align:middle line:90%
We call her Hathor and Isis.

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:31.390 align:middle line:90%
And we use images.

00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:32.777 align:middle line:90%
And now you're prohibiting that.

00:38:32.777 --> 00:38:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And Josiah even said,
you're forbidden

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:37.150 align:middle line:84%
from even looking into
the stars for fear

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:39.540 align:middle line:84%
that you will reconnect
with the hosts of heaven.

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And the mystical Jewish people
are going, wait a minute.

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:44.470 align:middle line:84%
You've just taken
away our religion.

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:45.303 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Overnight.

00:38:45.303 --> 00:38:46.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Overnight.

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And then immediately
following this

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:51.790 align:middle line:84%
is when Nebuchadnezzar comes
into Jerusalem and takes 10,000

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:55.510 align:middle line:84%
or so Jews captive
into exile in Babylon.

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And he
was from then Iraq.

00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:59.570 align:middle line:84%
There was no Iraq,
but that area.

00:38:59.570 --> 00:38:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:00.430 align:middle line:90%
Babylon.

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:01.230 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And so the Jews
then go to Babylon.

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:05.107 align:middle line:84%
And the Babylonian
priests are talking

00:39:05.107 --> 00:39:06.190 align:middle line:90%
about the divine feminine.

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:07.523 align:middle line:90%
They're talking about ascension.

00:39:07.523 --> 00:39:10.600 align:middle line:84%
They're going, this is
our original religion.

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And then when they're invited
to go back to Jerusalem,

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:15.520 align:middle line:84%
many of them said,
no, thank you.

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:18.550 align:middle line:84%
We're not going back
there because there's

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:19.810 align:middle line:90%
been a changing of the gods.

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:22.390 align:middle line:84%
They've changed our
religion on us overnight.

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:23.860 align:middle line:90%
We're going to stay here.

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Others of them went to China
and Tibet and France and Russia

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:27.580 align:middle line:90%
and elsewhere.

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:29.800 align:middle line:84%
But then when they
came back to Jerusalem,

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.620 align:middle line:84%
their temple, the temple of
Solomon, had been destroyed.

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:34.960 align:middle line:90%
Their religion had been gutted.

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And some of them decided
to stay and stick it out.

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:38.890 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what happens.

00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And over the course of
the next few 100 years,

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:44.230 align:middle line:84%
they still had this
feeling like, we want

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:46.310 align:middle line:90%
our original religion back.

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:48.810 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to hear
these stories that suddenly

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:49.810 align:middle line:90%
have been imposed on us.

00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And we want to follow
the path of ascension.

00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is what motivated the
Essenes to say, OK, enough's

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:55.850 align:middle line:90%
enough.

00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:58.690 align:middle line:84%
We've given it an
opportunity to see

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:01.840 align:middle line:84%
how this new religion works,
how the new ideas take hold.

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.223 align:middle line:90%
We don't like it at all.

00:40:03.223 --> 00:40:05.640 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go to Qumran
and we're going to start over.

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:06.623 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And they did.

00:40:06.623 --> 00:40:07.540 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: And they did.

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:08.340 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.455 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Did they get
slaughtered because of that?

00:40:11.455 --> 00:40:13.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Eventually they did.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.130 align:middle line:84%
From about 150 BCE
until 68 CE, they're

00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:21.250 align:middle line:90%
fairly peacefully coexisting.

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And then something was happening
after the time of Jesus.

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:27.700 align:middle line:84%
He demonstrates the
Essene teachings.

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:28.720 align:middle line:90%
And that's enough.

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:31.780 align:middle line:90%


00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine a planet
full of Christlike beings

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:35.260 align:middle line:90%
doing what Jesus could do?

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:37.038 align:middle line:90%
It's completely out of control.

00:40:37.038 --> 00:40:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And they're not going
to pay taxes to Rome.

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:40.747 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to be
all kinds of problems.

00:40:40.747 --> 00:40:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And so Rome is like, enough
of this supernatural nonsense.

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And it got to the point where,
as the historians at the time

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:50.900 align:middle line:84%
said, the temple of Solomon was
displaying these light shows

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:51.700 align:middle line:90%
during the day.

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:53.890 align:middle line:84%
People would look up into
the skies in Jerusalem

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:55.810 align:middle line:90%
and see celestial battles.

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And Rome's like, enough
of this nonsense.

00:40:58.210 --> 00:40:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And they came in
and they literally

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:04.090 align:middle line:84%
leveled the temple of Solomon,
completely destroyed it.

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And then they went after the
Essenes and all the mystics

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:09.250 align:middle line:84%
that had any awareness or
understanding whatsoever

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:12.580 align:middle line:84%
of this process of ascension
and human transformation.

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:14.710 align:middle line:90%
And it was genocide.

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:18.520 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Outside of programs
like "Ascension Keepers,"

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:22.430 align:middle line:84%
do people understand what
happened a long time ago?

00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:25.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: There have been
books that have been written.

00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:28.233 align:middle line:84%
But it's never really been
put together in a timeline.

00:41:28.233 --> 00:41:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
great opportunity

00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:32.530 align:middle line:84%
that we had with "Ascension
Keepers," is to show

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:36.008 align:middle line:84%
this progression
and this timeline.

00:41:36.008 --> 00:41:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If you were
living in that time period,

00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:45.210 align:middle line:84%
what would you have said
publicly to people about what

00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:46.440 align:middle line:90%
was happening?

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: I wouldn't say much.

00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:48.780 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Or would
you have kept quiet?

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:50.030 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: You would have kept--

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I can't
imagine you quite.

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:53.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:54.480 align:middle line:90%
But you would have kept quiet.

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.580 align:middle line:84%
You would want to
protect the order.

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:59.550 align:middle line:84%
You would not want to have
impure people coming in.

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:02.310 align:middle line:84%
Again, you're living with
angels or extraterrestrials.

00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to
protect that scenario.

00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:08.995 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why it
was kept very quiet.

00:42:08.995 --> 00:42:10.370 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, it was well

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:11.860 align:middle line:90%
known what they were doing.

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Without
the Dead Sea Scrolls,

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:16.250 align:middle line:84%
what would we have
known about this?

00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:17.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Throughout
the centuries,

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:21.230 align:middle line:84%
there have been references to
the Essenes and who they were

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:23.060 align:middle line:90%
and some speculation.

00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:25.010 align:middle line:84%
But without the
Dead Sea Scrolls,

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:27.410 align:middle line:84%
we don't have their
actual documents.

00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:30.290 align:middle line:84%
We don't have the actual
beliefs and teachings.

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:32.290 align:middle line:84%
Like their community
rule, for example,

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:33.980 align:middle line:90%
was their constitution.

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And its first few sentences
says that we're here

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:39.140 align:middle line:84%
to call in this high
celestial being who

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:42.110 align:middle line:84%
will reveal secrets that have
been withheld from humanity.

00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And he's here to help us to
get our crown of salvation

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:46.370 align:middle line:90%
and our robe of glory.

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:48.810 align:middle line:84%
So they're very, very
clear and very detailed,

00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:52.160 align:middle line:84%
very specific about what
their business is all about,

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.840 align:middle line:90%
what they're here for.

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And so without that community
rule, without those documents,

00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:00.050 align:middle line:90%
we don't have their exact words.

00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:01.788 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very
interesting to look

00:43:01.788 --> 00:43:03.830 align:middle line:84%
at what people have said
throughout the centuries

00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:05.925 align:middle line:84%
about the Essenes
and then to actually

00:43:05.925 --> 00:43:07.925 align:middle line:84%
compare it with what we
have in their documents.

00:43:07.925 --> 00:43:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Was it an accident
that we found these Dead Sea

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:11.800 align:middle line:90%
Scrolls?

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: You can say
it was an accident.

00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:17.030 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
it seems as if there

00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:18.455 align:middle line:90%
was a clock that was ticking.

00:43:18.455 --> 00:43:19.355 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: No
coincidences, William.

00:43:19.355 --> 00:43:20.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: No coincidences.

00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:24.740 align:middle line:84%
You have the gnostic gospels
coming out of Egypt in 1945,

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:27.050 align:middle line:84%
starting to question the
origins of Christianity.

00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:31.250 align:middle line:84%
The gospel of Thomas is
in those gnostic gospels.

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:33.620 align:middle line:84%
We start to get a
different look at Jesus

00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:35.720 align:middle line:90%
and the origins of Christianity.

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Then the Dead Sea
Scrolls come out.

00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And now we have this
even greater idea

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:41.430 align:middle line:90%
about what's going on.

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:42.690 align:middle line:90%
And it's revolutionary.

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:44.600 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now let's
add a new ingredient.

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:45.700 align:middle line:90%
Who are the Cathars?

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:48.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: So the Cathars
lived in southern France

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:50.760 align:middle line:90%
in the 13th century.

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.380 align:middle line:90%
They're like the Essenes.

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:54.170 align:middle line:90%
They're very scholarly.

00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:54.980 align:middle line:90%
They're mystics.

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:57.650 align:middle line:84%
They call themselves
the good Christians.

00:43:57.650 --> 00:44:01.250 align:middle line:84%
They originate primarily in
Toulouse in southern France.

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Only 700 years ago.

00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:03.290 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:03.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:04.060 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:04.850 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Not a long time ago.

00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: And in
Toulouse, Toulouse

00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:10.070 align:middle line:84%
is like a modern day
recreation of Alexandria

00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:13.010 align:middle line:84%
where you now have
scholars coming from Spain

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:14.900 align:middle line:84%
and from the Middle
East, all coming

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:18.590 align:middle line:84%
to Toulouse saying, OK,
it's time to re-inaugurate

00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:19.850 align:middle line:90%
these ascension teachings.

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And the Cathars, they
called themselves

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:24.460 align:middle line:84%
the pure ones or
the perfect ones,

00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:28.460 align:middle line:84%
claimed that they're
reincarnations of the Essenes.

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And they're back again
to bring these teachings

00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:35.002 align:middle line:90%
into human civilization.

00:44:35.002 --> 00:44:36.335 align:middle line:90%
They're following this timeline.

00:44:36.335 --> 00:44:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why do they think
they were reincarnated?

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: That was
part of their belief.

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:42.200 align:middle line:84%
They call themselves
the good Christians

00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:46.575 align:middle line:84%
and they maintain that they were
reincarnations of the earliest

00:44:46.575 --> 00:44:47.375 align:middle line:90%
Christians.

00:44:47.375 --> 00:44:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are the Cathars
still around today?

00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:50.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Some are.

00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:54.450 align:middle line:84%
But very much like
the Essenes in 1244,

00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:58.940 align:middle line:84%
the Cathars were exterminated
by the catholic church,

00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:00.155 align:middle line:90%
as many as 1 million.

00:45:00.155 --> 00:45:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Physically?

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:02.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes.

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:04.940 align:middle line:84%
The church sent
30,000 storm troopers

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:06.620 align:middle line:84%
into the Languedoc
of southern France.

00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:07.703 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And killed them?

00:45:07.703 --> 00:45:10.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: They'd take
12,000, 14,000 people,

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:12.770 align:middle line:84%
put them in a cathedral
like they did at Beziers,

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:14.930 align:middle line:84%
lock the doors and
light it on fire.

00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:18.358 align:middle line:84%
That's how the catholic
church dealt with the Cathars,

00:45:18.358 --> 00:45:20.150 align:middle line:84%
very much like Rome
dealt with the Essenes.

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:21.755 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Violent
religion at the time.

00:45:21.755 --> 00:45:22.713 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Well, exactly.

00:45:22.713 --> 00:45:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Because, one, like the
Essenes, the Cathars

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:27.380 align:middle line:90%
were extremely wealthy.

00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:30.950 align:middle line:84%
This teaching attracted
very wealthy families.

00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And when people came into the
Essene order or the Cathar

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:36.110 align:middle line:84%
order and went through
the period of initiation,

00:45:36.110 --> 00:45:38.570 align:middle line:84%
if they decided they
were going to commit

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:40.700 align:middle line:84%
to becoming a
Cathar or an Essene,

00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:42.740 align:middle line:84%
they turned over
all their assets.

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And so the Essenes
had 180 tons of gold

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:47.565 align:middle line:84%
that they had stashed
throughout Jerusalem.

00:45:47.565 --> 00:45:48.520 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Where's
that gold today?

00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:49.320 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes.

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:50.420 align:middle line:90%
Well, people want to know.

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:51.378 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Is it hidden?

00:45:51.378 --> 00:45:54.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Their copper scroll
tells all about these hidden

00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:55.010 align:middle line:90%
locations.

00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:58.470 align:middle line:84%
You have people today actively
looking for that gold.

00:45:58.470 --> 00:46:00.620 align:middle line:84%
So these were very
wealthy orders

00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:04.340 align:middle line:84%
that attracted some of the most
educated people of their times

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:06.710 align:middle line:84%
because they recognized
that it was very pure

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:10.340 align:middle line:84%
and it was ultimately a
way out of Earth life.

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And they recognize that this is
a path towards ascension, which

00:46:13.850 --> 00:46:15.740 align:middle line:84%
was ultimately more
valuable than anything

00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:16.910 align:middle line:90%
you can accumulate on Earth.

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:22.400 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What would you call
similar people today to Cathars

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.050 align:middle line:90%
at that time?

00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:25.810 align:middle line:84%
Are there groups
like that anymore?

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:27.290 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: I'm sure there are.

00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:28.970 align:middle line:84%
There are small
pockets of people

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:31.290 align:middle line:84%
that are trying to
live by the Essene

00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:32.990 align:middle line:84%
and the Cathar and
the gnostic ways.

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:35.300 align:middle line:84%
But again, the
beauty of our time

00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:38.780 align:middle line:84%
is that it's so distributed,
that it's planet-wide now,

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:41.240 align:middle line:84%
where people are tapping
into these teachings

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:42.770 align:middle line:90%
and beginning to utilize them.

00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:45.815 align:middle line:90%
And it's having a huge impact.

00:46:45.815 --> 00:46:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Would you have
considered yourself a Cathar,

00:46:48.310 --> 00:46:50.110 align:middle line:84%
if you had lived
during that century?

00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:51.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: I hope so.

00:46:51.490 --> 00:46:54.580 align:middle line:84%
I've been to the Languedoc
region of southern France

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:57.640 align:middle line:84%
where the Cathars lived
a dozen times or more,

00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:00.550 align:middle line:84%
and take groups
there to experience

00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:03.160 align:middle line:84%
what's left of their
culture and the castles

00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:05.050 align:middle line:90%
that they left behind.

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have a lot
of direct memories.

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:10.780 align:middle line:84%
But I have a lot of senses
that I've been there before.

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Who created them?

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:13.060 align:middle line:90%
Or how did they start?

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: They came out of
actually Eastern Europe.

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:19.840 align:middle line:84%
See, after the Essenes
were decimated,

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.690 align:middle line:90%
there was a diaspora of Essenes.

00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And people remembered some
of the Essene teachings

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:29.470 align:middle line:84%
throughout Europe, throughout
Spain, and elsewhere.

00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And then it's like
there's a cosmic clock.

00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:34.780 align:middle line:90%
It says it's time to reform.

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And so in particular,
the Cathars

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:39.130 align:middle line:84%
started a group
called the Bogomils.

00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:41.750 align:middle line:84%
There was a preacher
named Bogomil who was a--

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:42.550 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: One guy.

00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:44.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: One guy, yeah.

00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And he was a
researcher who started

00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:50.710 align:middle line:84%
to bring the Essene
teachings together,

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:54.640 align:middle line:84%
what was left of them,
and put out this call.

00:47:54.640 --> 00:48:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And it started the reformulation
of this ascension teaching

00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:01.540 align:middle line:90%
among the Cathars.

00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:03.650 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yet it faded away.

00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: It lasted
about 50 years or so.

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.770 align:middle line:90%
And it was extremely vibrant.

00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:10.510 align:middle line:90%
It was just extraordinary.

00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:12.490 align:middle line:84%
The troubadour tradition
came out of this.

00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:14.110 align:middle line:84%
This is one way that
they transmitted

00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:16.720 align:middle line:84%
these teachings was through
the songs of the troubadours.

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:18.550 align:middle line:90%
They'd go throughout the land.

00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:22.210 align:middle line:90%
And it was hugely popular.

00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is another
reason why it

00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:24.970 align:middle line:84%
was a threat to the
catholic church.

00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Because the catholic
church is saying,

00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:29.650 align:middle line:84%
we have the monopoly
on Christianity.

00:48:29.650 --> 00:48:33.553 align:middle line:84%
And what you're teaching is
not entirely opposed to us.

00:48:33.553 --> 00:48:35.470 align:middle line:84%
But we don't teach people
how to become angels

00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:37.840 align:middle line:84%
and how to transform into
their celestial flesh.

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:40.602 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Here's more of
the Cathars from "Ascension

00:48:40.602 --> 00:48:42.265 align:middle line:90%
Keepers."

00:48:42.265 --> 00:48:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: The 11th
through 13th centuries

00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:46.470 align:middle line:84%
may be called the
gnostic renaissance

00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:48.960 align:middle line:90%
in Europe, especially France.

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:51.810 align:middle line:84%
They were marked by an
effervescent resurgence

00:48:51.810 --> 00:48:55.890 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual movements of
clearly gnostic nature.

00:48:55.890 --> 00:49:00.900 align:middle line:84%
It was as if the Essene soul
group reincarnated en masse.

00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:04.080 align:middle line:10%
Foremost among our ascension
keepers during this time

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:06.600 align:middle line:10%
were the Cathar mystics,
who call themselves

00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:10.350 align:middle line:10%
the Albegensis after the town
of Albi in southern France

00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:12.090 align:middle line:10%
where they were centered.

00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:15.360 align:middle line:84%
They were also known as
the good Christians or bon,

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:18.090 align:middle line:90%
which is French for good.

00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Like the Essenes,
the Cathars sought

00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:23.970 align:middle line:84%
to return to our Edenic
state, our primordial state

00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:27.420 align:middle line:90%
as light beings before the fall.

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:29.850 align:middle line:84%
Coincidentally, or
perhaps not, bon

00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:32.370 align:middle line:84%
is Tibet's oldest
spiritual tradition

00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:34.800 align:middle line:84%
and is the lineage out
of which the rainbow body

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:36.290 align:middle line:90%
teaching emerged.

00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:39.580 align:middle line:84%
We'll firm up this
connection as we go.

00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:42.760 align:middle line:84%
Their Italian name, Cathari,
is from the Greek root

00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:45.450 align:middle line:90%
signifying the pure ones.

00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:48.150 align:middle line:10%
The Cathars were male
and female aesthetics

00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:51.840 align:middle line:10%
who claimed knowledge of how
to perfect the human body

00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:54.990 align:middle line:10%
into a more pure or
illumant state of being

00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:59.713 align:middle line:10%
and ascend to the celestial
city of the Essenes.

00:49:59.713 --> 00:50:01.380 align:middle line:84%
They walked away from
the world in order

00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:04.380 align:middle line:84%
to follow Christ and
Mary, both the mother Mary

00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:08.130 align:middle line:84%
and the Magdalene, in their
transfiguration and ascension

00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:10.800 align:middle line:84%
into an angelic or
spiritualized body

00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:14.040 align:middle line:84%
and enter the heavenly
realm, a dimension inhabited

00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:16.538 align:middle line:90%
by blessed spiritual beings.

00:50:16.538 --> 00:50:19.080 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Speaking of spiritual,
what were you wearing there?

00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:20.038 align:middle line:90%
What was that necklace?

00:50:20.038 --> 00:50:20.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Oh, yeah.

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:24.470 align:middle line:90%
I have this winged scarab.

00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:25.915 align:middle line:90%
Egyptian.

00:50:25.915 --> 00:50:27.915 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's a symbol of
rebirth and resurrection.

00:50:27.915 --> 00:50:29.940 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why did the
authorities want to hide

00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:31.200 align:middle line:90%
the Essenes and the Cathars?

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:32.242 align:middle line:90%
What were they afraid of?

00:50:32.242 --> 00:50:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, what they're
afraid of is a higher

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:38.160 align:middle line:84%
spiritual authority
taking over the Earth

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:41.120 align:middle line:84%
and transforming the Earth
into a spiritualized planet.

00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:42.750 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And they
would lose control.

00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:44.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: They
would lose control.

00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, we
live in this matrix

00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:51.440 align:middle line:84%
that is entirely dominated
by all that is physical.

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And now many of us
are gaining awareness

00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:55.830 align:middle line:84%
that this isn't
all that there is,

00:50:55.830 --> 00:50:59.160 align:middle line:84%
that there is this extraphysical
or spiritual dimension

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:00.570 align:middle line:90%
that we can tap into.

00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And in so doing, it
flips our consciousness.

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:09.180 align:middle line:84%
We aren't as prone to
following the authorities.

00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And we aren't as prone
to being good citizens

00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:13.620 align:middle line:90%
in a political sense.

00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:15.480 align:middle line:84%
We want to be good
cosmic citizens.

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And we start to
identify with something

00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:18.480 align:middle line:90%
greater than ourselves.

00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: In some way, William,
authorities still don't want

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:24.000 align:middle line:90%
the message to get out.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.800 align:middle line:84%
They're not happy
with social media,

00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:30.150 align:middle line:84%
for example, where the
masses can discuss things.

00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:33.240 align:middle line:84%
Your program "Ascension
Keepers," for example,

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:35.190 align:middle line:90%
is an enlightened program.

00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:36.720 align:middle line:84%
I wonder how many
authorities are

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:37.928 align:middle line:90%
happy about things like that.

00:51:37.928 --> 00:51:38.728 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:51:38.728 --> 00:51:40.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're in this time
right now where humanity

00:51:40.830 --> 00:51:42.510 align:middle line:90%
is at a fork in the road.

00:51:42.510 --> 00:51:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to go more
deeper into materialism

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:48.360 align:middle line:84%
or are we going to focus
on our spiritual quest?

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we're at right now.

00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And so it's literally,
as the Essenes described

00:51:52.850 --> 00:51:54.600 align:middle line:84%
it, a battle between
the children of light

00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:55.808 align:middle line:90%
and the children of darkness.

00:51:55.808 --> 00:51:59.790 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How do you
consider yourself?

00:51:59.790 --> 00:52:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Would you say that you're
the modern day Essene?

00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: I try to
follow the Essene path.

00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:07.980 align:middle line:90%
I don't label myself an Essene.

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:13.050 align:middle line:84%
But I would absolutely say
I'm part of this timeline.

00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:16.410 align:middle line:84%
There isn't necessarily
a word for what we are.

00:52:16.410 --> 00:52:18.750 align:middle line:90%
We're into ascension.

00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:21.690 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a label like
Cathar or gnostic or Essene.

00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:24.325 align:middle line:84%
I used to identify myself
as a Christian gnostic.

00:52:24.325 --> 00:52:26.700 align:middle line:84%
People didn't really like that
because they don't think--

00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:27.290 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They freak.

00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:30.420 align:middle line:84%
Gnosis and Christianity
are incompatible.

00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:33.235 align:middle line:90%
But I don't think so.

00:52:33.235 --> 00:52:34.860 align:middle line:84%
When you're calling
yourself a gnostic,

00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:36.990 align:middle line:84%
it means that you believe
the light is within you.

00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:38.655 align:middle line:90%
And you can enlighten yourself.

00:52:38.655 --> 00:52:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I bet if you went
and talked to 10 people

00:52:41.070 --> 00:52:44.790 align:middle line:84%
on the streets and said, I'm
a gnostic, they would freak,

00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:47.070 align:middle line:84%
not know what it
was, and run away.

00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:48.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: That's probably true.

00:52:48.690 --> 00:52:50.490 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's probably true.

00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:52.560 align:middle line:84%
But more and more,
that's shifting.

00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:54.600 align:middle line:84%
People are gaining
this awareness.

00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's so
exciting about our time.

00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:58.815 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are you an
ascension keeper, yourself?

00:52:58.815 --> 00:53:00.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: I would say so, yes.

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:04.795 align:middle line:84%
I've devoted a good part of
my life now to this process

00:53:04.795 --> 00:53:06.420 align:middle line:84%
and am committed to
the rest of my life

00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:07.795 align:middle line:84%
to following the
process as well.

00:53:07.795 --> 00:53:08.640 align:middle line:90%
So absolutely.

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:12.810 align:middle line:84%
I hope that through this show,
the work we do here at Gaia,

00:53:12.810 --> 00:53:16.260 align:middle line:84%
will leave a legacy and a
pathway for people to follow.

00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:20.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's taken me a long
time to get on this path

00:53:20.550 --> 00:53:22.170 align:middle line:90%
and to navigate through it.

00:53:22.170 --> 00:53:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And just imagine if you, from
the time you're very young,

00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:26.820 align:middle line:84%
you have an opportunity
to follow this path.

00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:28.362 align:middle line:84%
It would be absolutely
extraordinary.

00:53:28.362 --> 00:53:30.735 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are you
seeing change now?

00:53:30.735 --> 00:53:32.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:35.270 align:middle line:84%
There's so much light
coming into our world.

00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:37.890 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, you see
a lot of darkness as well.

00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:42.683 align:middle line:84%
And it can become very
frustrating sometimes to see,

00:53:42.683 --> 00:53:44.100 align:middle line:84%
makes it feel like
sometimes we're

00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:46.322 align:middle line:90%
very far away from our goal.

00:53:46.322 --> 00:53:48.780 align:middle line:84%
But that at the same time, we
realize how close we actually

00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:49.080 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:51.870 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why is it so important
today for people to understand

00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:52.670 align:middle line:90%
this?

00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, we have a
huge force on our planet

00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:59.640 align:middle line:84%
right now called artificial
intelligence and transhumanism.

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:05.310 align:middle line:84%
There is a belief that is become
mainstream since the 1950s

00:54:05.310 --> 00:54:07.380 align:middle line:84%
when Francis Crick and
James Watson discovered

00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:09.610 align:middle line:84%
the double helix
structure of DNA,

00:54:09.610 --> 00:54:13.035 align:middle line:84%
they also discovered that
our DNA appears to be digital

00:54:13.035 --> 00:54:17.290 align:middle line:84%
and that our DNA code
is eerily computer-like.

00:54:17.290 --> 00:54:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And what this led
to was this belief

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:22.980 align:middle line:84%
that's held by most of
your technology companies.

00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:24.210 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's beyond belief.

00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:25.380 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah, right.

00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:26.720 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly.

00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:30.060 align:middle line:84%
This belief, this
motivating principle

00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:32.620 align:middle line:90%
that you're just information.

00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:34.620 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing spiritual
about you, whatsoever.

00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:35.537 align:middle line:90%
You don't have a soul.

00:54:35.537 --> 00:54:38.050 align:middle line:84%
That's a delusional
concept from our childhood.

00:54:38.050 --> 00:54:39.180 align:middle line:90%
You're just information.

00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:40.590 align:middle line:90%
So it's OK now for us to--

00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:42.030 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Are they right?

00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: They believe
they're right.

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:45.090 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You don't?

00:54:45.090 --> 00:54:46.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: No, I don't.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:46.800 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely don't.

00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:49.920 align:middle line:84%
I still believe that
we have an existence

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:52.050 align:middle line:90%
outside of this reality.

00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:52.950 align:middle line:90%
They don't.

00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:56.280 align:middle line:84%
When you talk about people that
believe in simulation theory,

00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:57.720 align:middle line:90%
Elon Musk is a very good one.

00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:00.240 align:middle line:84%
He says there's one
in billions of chances

00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:02.370 align:middle line:84%
that we don't live
in a simulation.

00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:04.920 align:middle line:84%
What he's not saying there,
but what he believes,

00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:07.620 align:middle line:84%
if he believes that, is that
you're just information.

00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:10.537 align:middle line:84%
You don't have an existence
outside this simulation.

00:55:10.537 --> 00:55:11.370 align:middle line:90%
You're just nothing.

00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:12.828 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Wiped
out just like that.

00:55:12.828 --> 00:55:14.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: All you are is matter.

00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:16.350 align:middle line:90%
Therefore, you don't matter.

00:55:16.350 --> 00:55:17.400 align:middle line:90%
That is the belief.

00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is what is transpiring
into this dehumanizing

00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:24.300 align:middle line:84%
wave going across the planet
right now, that we see

00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:26.400 align:middle line:90%
in politics and in religion.

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:29.160 align:middle line:84%
It's all based on this belief
that you're just information

00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:33.090 align:middle line:84%
and it's OK to copy and paste
you into some other reality.

00:55:33.090 --> 00:55:35.670 align:middle line:84%
Your soul is just the
contents of your brain.

00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And we can record your
brain and copy you

00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:39.660 align:middle line:84%
into some cartoon
avatar that lives

00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:42.340 align:middle line:84%
in Facebook's new simulated
reality, and this kind

00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:43.140 align:middle line:90%
of thing.

00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:44.430 align:middle line:90%
And that's so dangerous.

00:55:44.430 --> 00:55:45.420 align:middle line:90%
That's very dark.

00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:48.360 align:middle line:84%
The gnostics would say that
is a simulation created

00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:51.180 align:middle line:84%
by extraterrestrial beings
they called archons.

00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:52.320 align:middle line:90%
They don't have a soul.

00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:55.830 align:middle line:84%
They want to trick you into
living in a simulated reality

00:55:55.830 --> 00:55:57.990 align:middle line:90%
so they can take your soul.

00:55:57.990 --> 00:56:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that that's
what is happening now.

00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And so these materialists,
as they're called,

00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:05.770 align:middle line:84%
who don't believe in
anything spiritual--

00:56:05.770 --> 00:56:07.680 align:middle line:90%
they're atheists of course--

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.840 align:middle line:84%
and don't believe you
have any existence outside

00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:13.980 align:middle line:84%
of this simulation would
like you to believe that

00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:18.390 align:middle line:84%
so that then they can trap you
into staying in this existence.

00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the gnostics, from all
traditions be it Christian,

00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Buddhist, or others,
Hindu, are absolutely

00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:27.630 align:middle line:84%
adamant that we
have an existence

00:56:27.630 --> 00:56:30.000 align:middle line:90%
outside of this reality.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And so if you believe
in that, then you're

00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:35.430 align:middle line:84%
going to aspire to learn
more about that existence

00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:37.200 align:middle line:90%
outside this reality.

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:39.852 align:middle line:84%
Some people are not
willing to go there.

00:56:39.852 --> 00:56:41.310 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
say, OK, well, I'm

00:56:41.310 --> 00:56:44.070 align:middle line:84%
just going to very
hedonistically enjoy

00:56:44.070 --> 00:56:45.620 align:middle line:90%
this matrix that's been created.

00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And if I don't have a
spiritual existence,

00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:50.790 align:middle line:84%
then I could do anything I
want to anyone at any time.

00:56:50.790 --> 00:56:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's the difference
between a gnostic

00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:55.275 align:middle line:90%
and an atheist or a materialist.

00:56:55.275 --> 00:56:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: As more and
more people, though,

00:56:57.510 --> 00:57:01.755 align:middle line:84%
begin to get this, what does
that do for our society?

00:57:01.755 --> 00:57:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, what
it does is it gives us

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:06.300 align:middle line:90%
some meaning, for one thing.

00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And it says we need a
civilization that's based

00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:11.100 align:middle line:90%
on these spiritual principles.

00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:13.760 align:middle line:84%
The founding fathers were
certainly believers in this.

00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:15.450 align:middle line:84%
The original vision
for America was

00:57:15.450 --> 00:57:18.630 align:middle line:84%
to create, to come to this
physical place, America,

00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:22.020 align:middle line:84%
that is also a psychological
space where people were free.

00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:23.430 align:middle line:84%
They had the pope
and the priests

00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:25.170 align:middle line:84%
and the politicians
off their back.

00:57:25.170 --> 00:57:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And they could live any
kind of life of freedom

00:57:28.530 --> 00:57:30.270 align:middle line:90%
that they wanted to live.

00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And so we have that inherently
in our world as a model.

00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:36.270 align:middle line:90%
That's what America is.

00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And so what it brings
to us is this assurance

00:57:39.570 --> 00:57:42.540 align:middle line:84%
that we are spiritual
beings first,

00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:44.610 align:middle line:90%
having a physical existence.

00:57:44.610 --> 00:57:46.320 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the materialist
view is, you

00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:48.420 align:middle line:84%
don't even have a
material existence let

00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:49.665 align:middle line:90%
alone a spiritual existence.

00:57:49.665 --> 00:57:53.415 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: In your opinion,
what's the future hold for us?

00:57:53.415 --> 00:57:55.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: We're going
to go one of two ways.

00:57:55.830 --> 00:58:00.420 align:middle line:84%
We're going to begin to tap
into our ascension intelligence,

00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:04.710 align:middle line:84%
like the ascension keepers
have promoted for centuries.

00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:06.420 align:middle line:84%
Or we're going to
go into this realm

00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:09.060 align:middle line:84%
of artificial intelligence,
where we give up

00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:11.400 align:middle line:84%
our individuality,
where we acknowledge

00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:15.480 align:middle line:84%
that there is no such thing as
religion or a soul or a god.

00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to live a
machine-like existence, as Elon

00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:20.910 align:middle line:84%
Musk and others
want us to do, merge

00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:24.540 align:middle line:84%
with artificial intelligence
to save the human race.

00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Will it?

00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Will it
save the human race?

00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:27.060 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:28.350 align:middle line:10%
It'll end it.

00:58:28.350 --> 00:58:31.530 align:middle line:10%
Humanity will cease to
exist within 10 years

00:58:31.530 --> 00:58:34.140 align:middle line:10%
if they have their way.

00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:35.323 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Within 10 years?

00:58:35.323 --> 00:58:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: That's when they say
the singularity will happen,

00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:39.390 align:middle line:84%
when the machines
that we're building

00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:41.860 align:middle line:84%
become smarter than we
are, maybe by a little,

00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:43.210 align:middle line:90%
maybe by a lot.

00:58:43.210 --> 00:58:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And we have to merge with AI
in order to continue to exist.

00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:48.775 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Can we save this?

00:58:48.775 --> 00:58:50.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: We can.

00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:54.820 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we can by rapidly
understanding the choice

00:58:54.820 --> 00:59:00.430 align:middle line:84%
that we're making and to
putting safeguards on AI.

00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Some people believe
it's too late.

00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:04.720 align:middle line:10%
And it could
possibly be too late,

00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:08.320 align:middle line:10%
that AI is so advanced now
that it's so completely

00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:11.380 align:middle line:10%
out of control and it
