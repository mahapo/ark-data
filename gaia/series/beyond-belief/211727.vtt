00:00:17.952 --> 00:00:19.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.340 align:middle line:10%
Sev Talk is with us, an ET
contactee and experiencer

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.190 align:middle line:10%
advocate who speaks
at UFO conferences

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.890 align:middle line:10%
all around the planet
and helps people come out

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.830 align:middle line:10%
with their own personal
ET contact stories.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.120 align:middle line:90%
What an incredible job.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.342 align:middle line:84%
How did this all
happen for you, Sev?

00:00:35.342 --> 00:00:37.050 align:middle line:10%
>>SEV TOK: Well, I've
been an experiencer

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.790 align:middle line:10%
since I was 10 years old.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.585 align:middle line:10%
Well, that's my first conscious
memory of having an experience.

00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:42.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could
have been earlier.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.377 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: It could
have been earlier,

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:46.770 align:middle line:84%
but I don't have a
conscious memory of it.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And it continued my
whole life, up until 2017

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.010 align:middle line:90%
when I moved to North Carolina.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.110 align:middle line:10%
I moved to the inner
banks of North Carolina

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.810 align:middle line:10%
right on the water, which
is where I live now.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And my second night there, I
made contact with the Greys.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:03.570 align:middle line:90%
And they burned--

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Again.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Again because
I had met them before.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And back then, I thought
the Greys were evil.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.070 align:middle line:90%
I thought they were bad.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.180 align:middle line:84%
I thought they were
messing with me.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.520 align:middle line:90%
I was afraid of them.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.680 align:middle line:84%
But I've completely
changed my mind now.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't see them
like that anymore.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was the experience
that made you change your mind?

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.070 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.320 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: It was the
second night that we

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.840 align:middle line:84%
moved to the inner
banks of North Carolina

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.805 align:middle line:84%
from Capitol Hill,
Washington, DC.

00:01:29.805 --> 00:01:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a big move.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.922 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Yes, in many ways.

00:01:33.922 --> 00:01:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And in the morning, I was in
the kitchen unpacking dishes

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.277 align:middle line:84%
and I felt something
bite my tush.

00:01:43.277 --> 00:01:44.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, that's a nice ET.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: [LAUGHS] And I yelled
over to my then-partner,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.360 align:middle line:90%
I think something bit my butt.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.605 align:middle line:90%
Will you look at it?

00:01:52.605 --> 00:01:54.180 align:middle line:90%
And he's like, yeah.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.250 align:middle line:84%
So I walk over to
the living room

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.190 align:middle line:84%
and I'm giggling to myself
because I think this is funny.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And I bend over and he's looking
and he's not saying anything.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is starting to
get me really nervous.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.559 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, did a bug bite me?

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:12.060 align:middle line:90%
And he said--

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.665 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It hurt that much.

00:02:13.665 --> 00:02:16.305 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Yeah, it hurt.

00:02:16.305 --> 00:02:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yeah, there's a bug
bite but there's also a red X.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like that?

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.555 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Yes.

00:02:26.555 --> 00:02:28.580 align:middle line:90%
Nine little dots.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.270 align:middle line:90%
And so he took a picture.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw this
picture, I was just stunned.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.175 align:middle line:90%
We were both stunned.

00:02:34.175 --> 00:02:37.445 align:middle line:84%
It's a red X. It was
on my left cheek.

00:02:37.445 --> 00:02:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's made up of
nine small circles.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, there it is.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.352 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it right there.

00:02:43.352 --> 00:02:46.670 align:middle line:10%
>>TOK: That is what I
saw and on my left cheek.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.200 align:middle line:10%
And it was about an inch and
a half to two inches big.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And when I ran my finger across
it, I couldn't feel it at all.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.880 align:middle line:90%
It was flush with my skin.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.838 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was smooth.

00:02:56.838 --> 00:02:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: And it just looked
like little burn marks.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.820 align:middle line:84%
I instinctively knew
it was the Greys.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you think
that was applied to you?

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: I think it was
burned into me maybe laser.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
felt it, though.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: I didn't feel it.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.828 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You did not feel it.

00:03:11.828 --> 00:03:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: No, I've never felt
any of the marks, bruises,

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.770 align:middle line:90%
missing skin.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.960 align:middle line:84%
I've never felt any of the marks
on my skin when they happened.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, why would
they do that to you?

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.235 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Well, I have
a couple of theories

00:03:27.235 --> 00:03:29.140 align:middle line:84%
because it happened
again nine days later.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The same thing?

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.617 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Yes, another red X mark
was burned into my right cheek.

00:03:34.617 --> 00:03:35.417 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My God.

00:03:35.417 --> 00:03:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: And this time, when
I came to in my room, I

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.170 align:middle line:84%
had a conscious memory
of what happened.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.990 align:middle line:90%
I remember I was on this bed.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.000 align:middle line:90%
It was like a hospital-type bed.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And I was in a room
that was dimly lit.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.892 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't recognize the room.

00:03:52.892 --> 00:03:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could have
been in a craft, right?

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: I could have
been in a craft.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.030 align:middle line:90%
And I was paralyzed.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.480 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't move my arms and
I couldn't move my legs.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And I sensed
something behind me.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.630 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't move my head.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.470 align:middle line:84%
So when I turned around,
I made eye contact

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.900 align:middle line:84%
with a Grey that was
standing right here,

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.775 align:middle line:90%
just inches from me.

00:04:12.775 --> 00:04:15.280 align:middle line:90%
And we locked eyes.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.240 align:middle line:90%
And I described it in my book--

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.065 align:middle line:84%
it was like looking into
two pools of black oil.

00:04:20.065 --> 00:04:22.970 align:middle line:90%
And I was terrified.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:23.770 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely--

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:24.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who wouldn't be?

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: --terrified.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And I turned my
head back around,

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.850 align:middle line:84%
and ding, I'm in my
bedroom, wide awake.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.730 align:middle line:84%
After every experience
that I have,

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.940 align:middle line:84%
when I pop back into my
home or into my bedroom,

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.120 align:middle line:84%
my eyes just pop open
and I'm completely alert.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.650 align:middle line:90%
There was no grogginess.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.000 align:middle line:84%
It's not like I'm
slowly waking up.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm completely alert
like I was plopped

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.527 align:middle line:90%
into a different reality.

00:04:48.527 --> 00:04:50.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sev, let's go
back to the beginning

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.030 align:middle line:84%
when you had this very first
experience when you were

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.770 align:middle line:90%
younger, when you were a kid.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.770 align:middle line:84%
Was it the same as what
you've just described?

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.145 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: No, it was
very different.

00:04:58.145 --> 00:04:59.312 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was different.

00:04:59.312 --> 00:05:01.610 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Yeah, so when I
was 10 until I was 12,

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.910 align:middle line:84%
I would find myself outside
and I would see this spaceship

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:06.710 align:middle line:90%
coming.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And it happened so many
times I lost count.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And each time, the
ship would come

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:12.930 align:middle line:90%
from a different direction.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They beam you aboard?

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: I don't remember
that part, but it would come

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.740 align:middle line:90%
and it would hover over me.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was so big, it
just blocked out the sky.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.110 align:middle line:90%
And I was so happy.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.650 align:middle line:84%
I was so happy to see the
being that was in this craft

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.690 align:middle line:84%
because it felt like
a family member.

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.550 align:middle line:90%
It felt like my brother.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And it would land
and a door would open

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.230 align:middle line:90%
and stairs would come down.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:38.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For you.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.410 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Yes, I was
the only one there.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And he would walk down and he
would be checking up on me,

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.890 align:middle line:90%
just making sure that I'm OK.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.348 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Made you
feel comfortable?

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:50.170 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Yes, very much.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.970 align:middle line:90%
I loved him.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:51.150 align:middle line:90%
I loved him.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the craft,
would you go in the craft?

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.940 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: I don't remember.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't have memories of that.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.850 align:middle line:84%
I may have, but I don't
have any conscious memory--

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You may have
gone to other planets.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Well, it's
interesting you

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.200 align:middle line:84%
say that because when I
had that X on my tush, when

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.780 align:middle line:84%
I was in that room on
that bed, paralyzed,

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.730 align:middle line:90%
I knew I was on the moon.

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:09.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it still there?

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.535 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: No, they only
lasted a couple of weeks.

00:06:12.535 --> 00:06:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: God, I was hoping
for a live demonstration

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.040 align:middle line:90%
on Beyond Belief.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.680 align:middle line:84%
I guess we won't go
there today, folks.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.925 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: The Xs are gone.

00:06:19.925 --> 00:06:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They've healed up?

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: But there's
just nothing there.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.937 align:middle line:84%
But I've had other marks
on my body since then.

00:06:24.937 --> 00:06:25.737 align:middle line:90%
Geometric marks.

00:06:25.737 --> 00:06:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wonder
why that design.

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: I don't
know why the X. The

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.050 align:middle line:84%
X is an ancient sign
or an ancient symbol.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It means something.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:35.540 align:middle line:90%
It means something.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.070 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: And the X files.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.482 align:middle line:84%
The X is associated a
lot with the unknown.

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
people, Sev, like

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.320 align:middle line:84%
you are going through
this situation?

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: I think it's millions.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.600 align:middle line:84%
I think millions of people are
having contact, most of whom

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.020 align:middle line:84%
don't even know it because ET
contact doesn't happen just

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.430 align:middle line:90%
in a 3D fashion.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.170 align:middle line:84%
It happens in an
interdimensional,

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.880 align:middle line:84%
multi-dimensional fashion
that feels like a dream.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.300 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people are
having these experiences

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.020 align:middle line:84%
but they're thinking
that they're dreams,

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.270 align:middle line:90%
which is what I used to think.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:06.125 align:middle line:90%
I battled with it.

00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:06.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who wouldn't?

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.000 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: But dreams don't put
two red Xs on your tush.

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.620 align:middle line:90%
And that's how I knew--

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.470 align:middle line:84%
that was my validation
that oh, my gosh,

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.440 align:middle line:84%
this whole entire time,
my whole life, it's true.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.770 align:middle line:84%
I have been in
communication with ETs.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:28.730 align:middle line:84%
So when I saw the second
X, just really no words

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.657 align:middle line:84%
to describe what went through
my body and through my mind.

00:07:31.657 --> 00:07:32.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And how big were the X?

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.010 align:middle line:90%
Hold your fingers up.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Yeah, they're
about this big.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.670 align:middle line:84%
So one on the left cheek,
one on the right cheek,

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.560 align:middle line:90%
directly across from each other.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Perfect alignment.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Yes, they look
just like each other.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And so when I saw
the second X, I

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.850 align:middle line:84%
described it as an
existential crisis

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:54.880 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't know
anything anymore.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.500 align:middle line:84%
It was like my rug of
reality was pulled right out

00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.790 align:middle line:90%
from underneath my feet.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.720 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know who I was anymore.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.570 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what I
was doing in the middle

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:05.395 align:middle line:90%
of the night talking to aliens.

00:08:05.395 --> 00:08:07.020 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
they wanted with me.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.937 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now that's got
to be a scary feeling.

00:08:08.937 --> 00:08:09.810 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Yes, it was--

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.260 align:middle line:90%
I was very scared.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.718 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know who
we were as human beings.

00:08:15.718 --> 00:08:17.010 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know anything anymore.

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you out of it?

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Excuse me?

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.097 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you out of it?

00:08:20.097 --> 00:08:22.602 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: No, well, was
I out of it when--

00:08:22.602 --> 00:08:24.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, just like
you were in a fog or a daze?

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Yes, it was
like there was no time.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:31.290 align:middle line:84%
I was just absolutely
suspended in knowing

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:35.039 align:middle line:84%
nothing, [LAUGHS],, like I
had to reknow everything.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:39.604 align:middle line:84%
I had to reknow who I am and
what I'm doing and who we are.

00:08:39.604 --> 00:08:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And so I said to
my partner then,

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.950 align:middle line:84%
we're going to pretend
like we never saw the Xs.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:48.405 align:middle line:90%
We're just going to ignore this.

00:08:48.405 --> 00:08:48.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How can you ignore?

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Because that's
what I did my whole life.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:51.262 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were there.

00:08:51.262 --> 00:08:52.275 align:middle line:90%
How can you ignore it?

00:08:52.275 --> 00:08:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: That was my MO.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:54.870 align:middle line:90%
That's what I did.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:58.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At this
point, Sev, why do you

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:01.680 align:middle line:84%
think this contact is
occurring with you and so many

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.590 align:middle line:90%
other people, as you've said?

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:06.110 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Well, with
me, individually, I

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:13.700 align:middle line:84%
had begun this personal
spiritual journey

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.910 align:middle line:84%
of becoming the most
authentic version of myself

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:20.180 align:middle line:84%
that I could possibly be because
I believe when you express

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:23.900 align:middle line:84%
your authenticity, that's when
you are the most fulfilled,

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:27.690 align:middle line:84%
the happiest, the
most successful.

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And along that journey,
I had to face the ETs

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:38.970 align:middle line:84%
because I had been lying about
them my whole entire life.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:40.210 align:middle line:90%
And in order to--

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:41.010 align:middle line:90%
excuse me.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.177 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you in denial?

00:09:42.177 --> 00:09:44.080 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: I was-- oh,
yes, for decades.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to
process that or I

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.470 align:middle line:84%
couldn't express
myself authentically

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.120 align:middle line:90%
and I was living a lie.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like if
you're an experiencer,

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:58.107 align:middle line:84%
you can put that off
here and say, OK, I'm

00:09:58.107 --> 00:09:59.190 align:middle line:90%
just going to ignore that.

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to keep all
my experiences here,

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.510 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to try and live
the rest of my life normally.

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:04.845 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work like that.

00:10:04.845 --> 00:10:08.550 align:middle line:84%
That lie, it
permeates everything,

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.670 align:middle line:84%
every area of your
life, into your career,

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:15.250 align:middle line:84%
into your relationships, into
your friendships, everything.

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:18.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the more you weave
the story, the worse it gets.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.950 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Yes, I was
in two relationships

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.770 align:middle line:90%
that became abusive.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And I had adopted at that
time, the victim attitude.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:31.540 align:middle line:90%
I played the victim.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:32.930 align:middle line:90%
I don't do that anymore.

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's through
processing my ET contact

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:37.480 align:middle line:90%
that I lost the victim vibe.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.300 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I can't
live life as a victim.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And that is my own
little lies that I've

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.940 align:middle line:90%
created for some reason.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to
live like that anymore.

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:50.485 align:middle line:84%
And when I chose to do that,
my life completely changed.

00:10:50.485 --> 00:10:54.860 align:middle line:84%
So now I think the
Greys were helping me.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:11:00.340 align:middle line:84%
They were helping me become
more authentic and more

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:01.810 align:middle line:90%
self-empowered.

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
still being visited?

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:05.080 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Yes.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Constantly.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: I'm visited often by a
variety of different beings.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now what do you do
with this gift, I will say,

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.400 align:middle line:84%
that they basically
have given you?

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: The gift of
being a contactee?

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, it's a gift.

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:22.720 align:middle line:90%
Not everybody is aware of it.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.840 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Not everyone is aware of
it, but I think a lot of people

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.310 align:middle line:90%
can be a contactee.

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:30.190 align:middle line:84%
The easiest way to make
contact is through meditation

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:33.820 align:middle line:84%
because I help people make
contact with other worldly

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.990 align:middle line:84%
beings, whether it's an ET or
whether it's a spirit guide,

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:39.970 align:middle line:90%
whether it's a dead person.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:41.860 align:middle line:90%
We can all do that.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.440 align:middle line:84%
All these consciousnesses
exist in what

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.040 align:middle line:84%
I call the playground
of consciousness.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.940 align:middle line:90%
All these beings exist there.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And when you enter that
playground of consciousness,

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.520 align:middle line:84%
you come in contact
with a variety

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.920 align:middle line:84%
of different beings
living on a variety

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.600 align:middle line:90%
of different dimensions.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm trying
to visualize, Sev, you

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.620 align:middle line:90%
with these ETs.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And you've got a sketch which
highlights a little bit what

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.760 align:middle line:90%
these Greys look like.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.310 align:middle line:10%
Let's take a look at this.

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:11.530 align:middle line:10%
And you can describe what it is.

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:12.760 align:middle line:10%
What are we looking at?

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:18.730 align:middle line:10%
>>TOK: That is a baby floating
in a tube that was shown to me.

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:19.780 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Is it liquefied?

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: There was a liquid
type of something in the tube.

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.830 align:middle line:90%
It was blue.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's allowing
the baby to float.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.760 align:middle line:10%
>>TOK: And the
baby's eyes were open

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.990 align:middle line:10%
and they were the bluest
eyes I've ever seen.

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:33.310 align:middle line:10%
And I was in a dark room and
I didn't know where I was.

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:35.080 align:middle line:10%
And I was really confused.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.940 align:middle line:10%
I didn't understand why I
was looking at this baby.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.850 align:middle line:10%
And then I sensed
something behind me.

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:43.360 align:middle line:10%
And when I turned around,
I saw those three Greys--

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.192 align:middle line:10%
tall, medium, and short.

00:12:45.192 --> 00:12:46.900 align:middle line:10%
And this is when I
didn't know that Greys

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.400 align:middle line:10%
came in different sizes.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.410 align:middle line:10%
And they were nice.

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:52.450 align:middle line:10%
And they said to
me, telepathically,

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.150 align:middle line:10%
because all the
communication is telepathic,

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.640 align:middle line:10%
"We're just going to stay here.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.260 align:middle line:90%
Just take your time.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:00.730 align:middle line:90%
No hurry."

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:03.710 align:middle line:10%
And I turned back around
to look at this baby.

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:04.960 align:middle line:10%
And I was really confused.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.420 align:middle line:10%
I did not even feel
anything for the baby.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:08.650 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Was the baby alive?

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:09.940 align:middle line:10%
>>TOK: Yes.

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:13.510 align:middle line:10%
And even though you can't tell
its sex because of its legs,

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:14.770 align:middle line:10%
I knew it was a boy.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.430 align:middle line:84%
So I come back to-- in
my room, once again,

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.380 align:middle line:90%
ding, my eyes are open.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:21.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm fully alert.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:24.563 align:middle line:84%
And I just told myself,
OK, that's something else

00:13:24.563 --> 00:13:25.480 align:middle line:90%
we're going to ignore.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to tell
anybody and we're just

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:27.670 align:middle line:90%
going to ignore it.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:28.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: But then
many years later, I

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:32.027 align:middle line:84%
had an experience in
Roswell, New Mexico.

00:13:32.027 --> 00:13:32.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Yes, with
my then partner.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And I was given information
about the hybridization

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:39.310 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:41.447 align:middle line:84%
And they reminded
me of that event.

00:13:41.447 --> 00:13:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
of the hybridization program?

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:44.920 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.440 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: I've only been given
information with respect

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.900 align:middle line:84%
to the Greys and
humans, that program.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:50.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Their program.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Yeah, I think
there's other programs.

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think humans
might be involved--

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:54.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are they doing?

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:54.790 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: --in some of them too

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:55.915 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do they want?

00:13:55.915 --> 00:13:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Well, what
they told me is

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:02.050 align:middle line:84%
that they lost the ability to
be empathetic and sympathetic.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
your race dies out.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And so they are
choosing humans that

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:15.910 align:middle line:84%
are, for the most part, a
very empathetic, sympathetic,

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:20.230 align:middle line:84%
loving, and also,
for the most part,

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:24.700 align:middle line:84%
have very strong psy
or psychic abilities.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do we?

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Yes, we do,
but they're especially

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:32.060 align:middle line:84%
choosing people that have
better than normal skills

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:33.290 align:middle line:90%
to hybridize with.

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
a hybrid look like

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.030 align:middle line:84%
as a cross between
a human and a Grey?

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Well, I've only
been shown that baby.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And then I also had
another experience

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:45.080 align:middle line:84%
where I was healing
very sickly babies.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.865 align:middle line:84%
And they looked human but
they were coughing up blood.

00:14:47.865 --> 00:14:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And there were humans
involved in that.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:50.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Human head, human eyes?

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:54.335 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Yeah, but they were
wrapped in a lot of cloth.

00:14:54.335 --> 00:14:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And one of them started
rolling off the table.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And when I pulled
the cloth, I could

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.980 align:middle line:84%
see its neck was like
as thin as my pinkie.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And I freaked out, and then
ding, I'm back in my room again

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.540 align:middle line:84%
and I don't remember
anything else.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.243 align:middle line:90%
And there were humans there.

00:15:09.243 --> 00:15:10.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Other humans.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.420 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Humans, yes.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:14.150 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if they
were masked as humans

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.340 align:middle line:84%
or if there are
hybridization programs that

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:19.640 align:middle line:90%
include human beings and Greys.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:20.663 align:middle line:90%
I'm not quite clear.

00:15:20.663 --> 00:15:21.830 align:middle line:90%
I think there might be many.

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Though you have
not had any human babies,

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:28.650 align:middle line:84%
is it conceivable you have
participated in a hybridization

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.120 align:middle line:90%
program for breeding?

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.787 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Yeah, I was
told that's why I was

00:15:31.787 --> 00:15:32.953 align:middle line:90%
shown that baby in the tube.

00:15:32.953 --> 00:15:34.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was that your baby?

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:38.370 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Yeah, it's still
hard for me to admit.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.510 align:middle line:84%
It's still hard for
me to talk about that.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:42.075 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I
don't blame you.

00:15:42.075 --> 00:15:43.330 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: That's what they said.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to tell
you what they said.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you get
emotional over that?

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:49.263 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: It's just
hard to believe.

00:15:49.263 --> 00:15:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many hybrid
kids do you have out there?

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:52.263 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: I don't know.

00:15:52.263 --> 00:15:53.340 align:middle line:90%
And I really don't--

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:56.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't talk about myself
as being a hybrid mother.

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:59.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't talk about myself
as having hybrid children.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.760 align:middle line:84%
I just tell the story about
my hybridization experience,

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.538 align:middle line:90%
and that's it.

00:16:04.538 --> 00:16:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do we
know about the program?

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Is it a nine-month gestation
period like a human baby?

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: I don't know.

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:13.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No idea.

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: I don't know, no.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
speed things up?

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:18.980 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Possibly.

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:22.880 align:middle line:84%
They did tell me that there
are billions of these embryos

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.060 align:middle line:90%
and they're in a frozen state.

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And that we're on the path
of annihilating ourselves.

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:31.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We are.

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Yes, but
it's not definite

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:39.743 align:middle line:84%
because we have an infinite
amount of potential futures.

00:16:39.743 --> 00:16:41.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they ever
tell you what planetary

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.940 align:middle line:90%
system the Greys come from?

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.770 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: They didn't tell me.

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:47.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you have any guess?

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:49.160 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: No, it's interesting.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.750 align:middle line:84%
People have asked
me before, well,

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.360 align:middle line:84%
when you're talking to them,
don't you ask them their names

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.170 align:middle line:84%
or don't you ask them
where they come from?

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:56.790 align:middle line:90%
And I never do.

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And I really don't have a good
answer for that, other than--

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:03.355 align:middle line:84%
maybe this might come
close to explaining it,

00:17:03.355 --> 00:17:05.480 align:middle line:84%
but when you haven't been
home for a while and then

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.695 align:middle line:90%
you go home.

00:17:06.695 --> 00:17:09.619 align:middle line:84%
Well, you don't look at your
mother and say, where am I

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:11.300 align:middle line:90%
or who are you?

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:12.530 align:middle line:90%
You just know.

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:13.875 align:middle line:90%
It's like that feeling.

00:17:13.875 --> 00:17:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You just pick
up where you left off.

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:19.084 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Yeah, there's
just no desire to ask.

00:17:19.084 --> 00:17:20.975 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why is it happening?

00:17:20.975 --> 00:17:22.182 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Because we need help.

00:17:22.182 --> 00:17:23.099 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We need help?

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Yes.

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:24.555 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or they need help.

00:17:24.555 --> 00:17:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: We're like the
bad boys in the galaxy

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:27.810 align:middle line:84%
and we're causing
a lot of trouble.

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:28.650 align:middle line:90%
We're troublemakers.

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:30.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they going to
replace us with the hybrids?

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Well, if we
annihilate ourselves--

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:34.470 align:middle line:90%
if we do.

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:35.270 align:middle line:90%
It's not a given.

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What if we don't?

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: I don't know what's going
to happen to those embryos.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.040 align:middle line:84%
They did tell me
that there was a fear

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.130 align:middle line:84%
within the Galactic
system, that these embryos,

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:48.750 align:middle line:84%
if they got into the hands
of negative entities or lower

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:49.667 align:middle line:90%
vibrational entities--

00:17:49.667 --> 00:17:51.167 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there's
some out there?

00:17:51.167 --> 00:17:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Yes.

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:52.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unfortunately.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Would they turn
them into killing machines?

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was told that these
beings, these embryos

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:04.500 align:middle line:84%
have been designed to be so
loving and so caring and so

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:08.100 align:middle line:84%
gentle and so kind that they
would make horrible killing

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.090 align:middle line:90%
machines.

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sev, hundreds
of thousands of humans

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:14.940 align:middle line:84%
disappear off the face of
this planet every year.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.080 align:middle line:90%
They're just gone.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.040 align:middle line:90%
They vanish.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.600 align:middle line:90%
People can't find them.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.010 align:middle line:90%
Maybe some are killed.

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:21.540 align:middle line:90%
Who knows what?

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:25.410 align:middle line:84%
Is it conceivable that
these aliens, these Greys

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:29.000 align:middle line:84%
are taking them, bringing
them to their planet,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.240 align:middle line:84%
and doing God
knows what to them?

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Well, yeah,
it's conceivable.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.800 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if it's just
the Greys that's doing that,

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:41.270 align:middle line:10%
but we could also maybe be
doing it of our own volition.

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:44.150 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some people
are finding a portal

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:46.160 align:middle line:84%
and choosing to
enter that portal.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.710 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some people are
going into a portal

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:51.170 align:middle line:84%
into another alternate,
parallel reality,

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.930 align:middle line:84%
don't even realize
that they're there.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:56.720 align:middle line:84%

Saint Louis hockey team.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: [LAUGHS] The
Blues are beings--

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.100 align:middle line:90%
I call them the Blues.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And they came to me in
the middle of the day

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.490 align:middle line:84%
when I was sitting
in my living room.

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:16.755 align:middle line:90%
And they just showed up.

00:19:16.755 --> 00:19:17.880 align:middle line:90%
And there were two of them.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You like them?

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:20.670 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Oh, they're so loving.

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:21.660 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.520 align:middle line:90%
And they're gorgeous.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And they were just undulating
kaleidoscope streams of light.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.230 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't even draw
them if I had to.

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:36.480 align:middle line:84%
They're hard to draw, but it
was mostly blues, light blues,

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.930 align:middle line:84%
silver, and a little
bit of spring green

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:40.980 align:middle line:90%
that was just flash.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.510 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Why visit you?

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Ever since I
was a little girl,

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.450 align:middle line:84%
I've been playing in that
playground of consciousness,

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:50.080 align:middle line:90%
as I describe it.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.190 align:middle line:84%
I've been communicating
with beings in other worlds.

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:54.730 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just open--

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:55.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm just open to it.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did they visit you?

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:04.350 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: They visit in 3D,
but they also visit like--

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:07.050 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to describe, but when
you're in a meditative state

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:10.482 align:middle line:84%
and you're having
communication, whatever that is.

00:20:10.482 --> 00:20:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at some of the images

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:13.630 align:middle line:90%
on what you're talking about.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And you can explain
what they are and like,

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:21.595 align:middle line:84%
in this case, how the Blues
appear to you, how they pop up.

00:20:21.595 --> 00:20:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: That is my rendition.

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:26.095 align:middle line:90%
I tried to--

00:20:26.095 --> 00:20:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You did this?

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:28.100 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Yeah.

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:28.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nice job.

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:35.035 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: I tried to draw as close
as possible to what I saw.

00:20:35.035 --> 00:20:37.870 align:middle line:84%
That's not really
exactly what they look

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:39.700 align:middle line:90%
like but it is very similar.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.070 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
that clothing on.

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:45.140 align:middle line:84%
But why I chose
these two beings--

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.020 align:middle line:84%
and I blurred them
a little bit--

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.750 align:middle line:84%
is because the colors
were very much like that,

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.190 align:middle line:84%
the faces were very
much like that.

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And they look like very
kind and nice beings.

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And when they showed
up on my living room--

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.620 align:middle line:84%
that's the house that
I was living in--

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.570 align:middle line:84%
they literally just
showed up on my couch.

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And I took a picture
with my cell phone,

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:04.660 align:middle line:90%
but they didn't come up.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:05.720 align:middle line:84%
They didn't come
up in the picture.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They didn't
show up on it.

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:07.360 align:middle line:90%
How tall are they?

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Oh, eight,
nine feet, maybe.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:10.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That tall?

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Yes.

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing-- and
I'm blinking like this.

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:16.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, I cannot
believe what I'm seeing.

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And the love that they exuded,
I describe it as more than the

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:24.050 align:middle line:84%
love that you feel
from your mother.

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:26.390 align:middle line:84%
I have never felt love
like that in my life.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
they said to me

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:32.180 align:middle line:84%
was, when you look into our
eyes, you look into your own.

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they give you
any secrets of the universe?

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:36.773 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Well, yes.

00:21:36.773 --> 00:21:37.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can you share them?

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:41.490 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: They told me about
our dimensional DNA.

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:43.430 align:middle line:84%
They told me about
DNA activation.

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And I do share that information
on my website, in my writings,

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:48.890 align:middle line:90%
on my YouTube channel.

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:53.518 align:middle line:84%
And they told me about Tesla,
Disney, and Tchaikovsky.

00:21:53.518 --> 00:21:55.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did they
tell you about them?

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:58.490 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: These three men have been
three of my most favorite men

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:00.275 align:middle line:90%
since I was a little girl.

00:22:00.275 --> 00:22:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And they told me that those
three men were connected

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:04.880 align:middle line:90%
and they were communicating.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With the ETs.

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: With the rest of the
universe, yes, with everything.

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:15.035 align:middle line:84%
And they said that
Disney and Tesla met.

00:22:15.035 --> 00:22:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And they said when you
listen to Tchaikovsky music--

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:20.180 align:middle line:84%
which has always been my
favorite classical music--

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:22.250 align:middle line:90%
it's a DNA activator.

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what do you
mean by DNA activator?

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Well, our DNA is
made up of many pieces

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:31.250 align:middle line:84%
that our scientists
are not even aware of.

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:34.220 align:middle line:84%
We have multi-dimensional
qualities to our DNA,

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:37.890 align:middle line:84%
very high-frequency
parts to our DNA.

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And when those high-frequency
parts are focused upon,

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:42.830 align:middle line:90%
they're activated.

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:44.360 align:middle line:90%
That raises your vibration.

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And when you raise
your vibration,

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:49.280 align:middle line:84%
then you're plugged into
the higher dimensions

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.470 align:middle line:84%
and the higher elements
of this universe.

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they leave
you, these blues,

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.280 align:middle line:90%
any specific message?

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Well, other than
Tchaikovsky being a DNA

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.520 align:middle line:84%
activator and that
it's no accident

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.500 align:middle line:84%
that one of Disney's
most famous movies,

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:06.740 align:middle line:84%
Fantasia, is filled
with Tchaikovsky music.

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Classic movie too.

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:09.570 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Yes, one of my favorites.

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:10.903 align:middle line:90%
So that is not just a cartoon.

00:23:10.903 --> 00:23:11.945 align:middle line:90%
When you watch Fantasia--

00:23:11.945 --> 00:23:13.862 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were these all
hybrids, these three--

00:23:13.862 --> 00:23:15.920 align:middle line:90%
Tesla, Disney, Tchaikovsky?

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.030 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Are they--

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:18.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hybrids or humans.

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:19.618 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Possibly.

00:23:19.618 --> 00:23:20.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're not sure.

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:23.408 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: I'm not sure
but it's very possible.

00:23:23.408 --> 00:23:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might have gotten
a little boost from the ETs.

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.367 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: I think we're
all really hybrids.

00:23:27.367 --> 00:23:30.090 align:middle line:84%
I think we all have
ET DNA within us

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:31.435 align:middle line:90%
because we have Stardust in us.

00:23:31.435 --> 00:23:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, we do.

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: And some of
us have activated

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.950 align:middle line:90%
that ET DNA more than others.

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And some of us have
more ET DNA than others.

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:40.110 align:middle line:90%
But I think it's in all of us.

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're actually 14
billion years old, aren't we?

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: At least.

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have Stardust,
as you mentioned, in this.

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:48.990 align:middle line:90%
What is the Mantis?

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: The Mantis is a being
that many, many people see.

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:53.700 align:middle line:90%
It looks like a praying mantis.

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:54.210 align:middle line:90%
It looks like a giant bug.

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:55.418 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK, I've seen those.

00:23:55.418 --> 00:23:56.400 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Yeah, or Mantid.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.110 align:middle line:90%
Some people call them Mantids.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:00.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Take a
picture of that too.

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:02.440 align:middle line:90%
Those are creepy-looking.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.240 align:middle line:90%
Aren't they?

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.950 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Well, they
might look creepy

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:06.400 align:middle line:90%
but it's a really good story.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.960 align:middle line:84%
So I help experiencers around
the world that can contact me

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:10.950 align:middle line:90%
through my website.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also the
assistant state director

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.920 align:middle line:90%
for North Carolina for MUFON.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.170 align:middle line:84%
So I also help
experiencers through MUFON.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:21.270 align:middle line:84%
This is an experiencer
that contacted me.

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:22.740 align:middle line:90%
His name is Ralph Connor.

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:23.860 align:middle line:90%
He lives in Virginia.

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:25.780 align:middle line:90%
And he painted this.

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.250 align:middle line:90%
And he was on a spaceship.

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And he came in
contact with the Greys

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:31.330 align:middle line:90%
and with these mantid beings.

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And he said that he
felt like his mind was

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:40.750 align:middle line:90%
in this magnetic field.

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:44.558 align:middle line:84%
And that the Mantid's
mind and his mind melted.

00:24:44.558 --> 00:24:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They blended together.

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:47.975 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Yes, and that the
Mantid knew everything

00:24:47.975 --> 00:24:48.850 align:middle line:90%
that he was thinking.

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And he, in turn, knew everything
all the beings on the craft

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:54.085 align:middle line:90%
were thinking.

00:24:54.085 --> 00:24:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And he said it was really
beautiful feeling of unity.

00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And he said he'll
never forget it.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:01.630 align:middle line:90%
It was really very empowering.

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The one on the left,
Sev, what is that, a pencil?

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:05.300 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:05.770 align:middle line:90%
What are they holding?

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: That is a wand.

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot
of experiencers who've

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.400 align:middle line:84%
seen ETs holding
wands, but we really

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.910 align:middle line:84%
aren't quite sure
what that wand is.

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:14.710 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:15.752 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do they do?

00:25:15.752 --> 00:25:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: I mean, if you watch
Men in Black, they have a wand.

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:20.050 align:middle line:90%
Who knows what that wand is?

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:22.020 align:middle line:90%
We really don't know.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are those beings
prevalent all over the place?

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: The Greys and the
Mantids, they seem to be.

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:30.300 align:middle line:84%
A lot of experiencers
have met them.

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.490 align:middle line:84%
I have not met the
Mantids that I'm aware of.

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they friendly?

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:36.990 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Yes, they're very loving.

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What star system
might they be from?

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.420 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: I don't know.

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got to
get those answers for us.

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:43.295 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: OK, next time.

00:25:43.295 --> 00:25:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On your
next visitations.

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:48.390 align:middle line:84%
You don't seem to ask
them a lot of questions.

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:50.115 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: They talk to me.

00:25:50.115 --> 00:25:52.450 align:middle line:84%
They give me a lot
of information.

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And I just sit there and I
just allow them to just fill me

00:25:56.850 --> 00:25:57.690 align:middle line:90%
with information.

00:25:57.690 --> 00:25:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't seem to
tell you a lot about themselves,

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:00.480 align:middle line:90%
though.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.605 align:middle line:90%
Is there a reason for that?

00:26:01.605 --> 00:26:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: No, and that could be
maybe because I already know.

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I already know,
George, and I can't remember.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.783 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or maybe
you won't tell us.

00:26:07.783 --> 00:26:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: I would tell
you if I remembered.

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:10.362 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You would?

00:26:10.362 --> 00:26:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Yeah, I'd tell you
everything if I remembered,

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:13.470 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:16.545 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this a good thing or
a bad thing, these visitations?

00:26:16.545 --> 00:26:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: I think it's
wonderful because they're

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:20.180 align:middle line:90%
helping mankind.

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And people say, why
don't they just land

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.000 align:middle line:90%
in front of the White House?

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, we all know why
that's not going to happen

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.160 align:middle line:90%
because that's just chaos.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:34.620 align:middle line:84%
These ETs are very wise and
they are helping us transform.

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:36.960 align:middle line:84%
They're helping us realize
that we're all connected

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:37.800 align:middle line:90%
and we're all one.

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.930 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
important message.

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Every experiencer who gets that
message changes and they start

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.320 align:middle line:84%
to live their life
consciously aware

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.590 align:middle line:84%
of the energy they're
creating, the mark

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:55.140 align:middle line:84%
that they're leaving
on the planet to humans

00:26:55.140 --> 00:27:01.260 align:middle line:84%
and to animals, to flora, fauna,
to the oceans, to the air.

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:05.430 align:middle line:84%
A lot of experiencers become
very sensitive to their role

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:07.650 align:middle line:84%
on Earth and they
want to make sure

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:12.370 align:middle line:84%
that they are as loving
and as kind as possible.

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:16.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These ET experiencers,
do they get the word out

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.070 align:middle line:90%
to other people?

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:18.480 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Some do.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.840 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them still don't want
to come out or talk about it,

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.312 align:middle line:84%
and I completely
understand that.

00:27:23.312 --> 00:27:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
afraid of the reaction?

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:26.835 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Yeah, but
that's changing now.

00:27:26.835 --> 00:27:28.170 align:middle line:90%
So much is happening right now.

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:30.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're not afraid.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: No, but I was.

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:35.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I hid it for
decades, for 40 years.

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.140 align:middle line:90%
Over 40 years, I hid it.

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:38.550 align:middle line:90%
I was afraid.

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.310 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want my clients to
know I was talking to aliens.

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:42.750 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want my
friends to know.

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:44.442 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want anybody to know.

00:27:44.442 --> 00:27:45.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
embarrassed then?

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:46.700 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Yeah.

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's so horrible
about this whole experience

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:53.580 align:middle line:84%
or phenomena is that
we get embarrassed.

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:55.500 align:middle line:90%
And that's why I'm out.

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to experiencers
to be embarrassed or ashamed

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.080 align:middle line:84%
anymore because this is
remarkable, what's happening.

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:04.650 align:middle line:84%
We're coming in contact, face
to face, eyeball to eyeball,

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:07.470 align:middle line:84%
with a being from another
planet or star system,

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:09.190 align:middle line:90%
and then we're hiding it.

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm out
here speaking, I'm

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:15.040 align:middle line:84%
asking experiencers
to contact me.

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.750 align:middle line:84%
I'll help them if
they need some help.

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:18.140 align:middle line:84%
You have to come
out to yourself.

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.837 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to come out and
be on TV or do conferences,

00:28:20.837 --> 00:28:22.670 align:middle line:84%
but it's important you
come out to yourself.

00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people are
having these experiences, Sev,

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:27.430 align:middle line:84%
and they don't know
who to turn to,

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:31.060 align:middle line:84%
they don't know who to tell, and
they keep it within themselves?

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Yeah, most of them.

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:33.910 align:middle line:90%
So they could go to MUFON.

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:35.950 align:middle line:84%
They could come to me
through my website.

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They
won't be ridiculed.

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: No, MUFON is
really good at making sure

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:45.040 align:middle line:84%
that whoever contacts MUFON
is dealt with in a very

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:47.140 align:middle line:90%
non-judgmental manner.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.385 align:middle line:84%
It's very important that
if you're an experiencer

00:28:49.385 --> 00:28:51.760 align:middle line:84%
and you want to talk to someone,
that you talk to someone

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.110 align:middle line:90%
who's not going to judge you.

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of the compliments
I get on our radio show, Coast

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:59.650 align:middle line:84%
to Coast, is people say,
you don't ridicule people.

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:00.920 align:middle line:90%
You listen to them.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:01.960 align:middle line:90%
You let them talk.

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.805 align:middle line:90%
You don't judge them.

00:29:03.805 --> 00:29:06.100 align:middle line:84%
Because it would
be easy to say, you

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:09.290 align:middle line:84%
didn't get picked up by
ETs, this doesn't happen,

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:12.100 align:middle line:90%
but what benefit does that do?

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:15.370 align:middle line:84%
So understand people that
they're actually going through,

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:19.060 align:middle line:84%
real or not, some
incredible experiences

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.223 align:middle line:90%
that affect them deeply.

00:29:20.223 --> 00:29:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Oh, it
changes their lives.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And who am I to
say it's not happening?

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:28.120 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Yes, and that's what's
so wonderful about you, George.

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, that's a very
valuable role that you play.

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:33.190 align:middle line:10%
You're part of
this transformation

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:35.570 align:middle line:10%
that Earth is undergoing
to be a kinder,

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:36.830 align:middle line:10%
gentler place, hopefully.

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:38.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and what
we want on this program,

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Beyond Belief, is to
get people like you

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:44.710 align:middle line:84%
to tell us their experiences
and what's going on.

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:47.650 align:middle line:84%
If we help just one person
watching this program

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:51.070 align:middle line:84%
right now, who's saying,
that's what's happening to me.

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:53.500 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know,
it's well worth it.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:54.460 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Oh, it sure is.

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:55.835 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now this
happened to you

00:29:55.835 --> 00:29:57.610 align:middle line:90%
when you were a young person.

00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:01.120 align:middle line:84%
Is that happening a lot
to our younger people?

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Oh, yes because
the little ones

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:06.040 align:middle line:84%
are really plugged in,
and so a lot of kids

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.210 align:middle line:90%
are having experiences.

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the
ETs cloak themselves.

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:15.642 align:middle line:84%
They look like clowns,
or in one case--

00:30:15.642 --> 00:30:16.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I hate clowns.

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.633 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: OK, [LAUGHS].

00:30:17.633 --> 00:30:19.300 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, a lot of people
don't like clowns.

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:20.842 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't dress
up like a clown.

00:30:20.842 --> 00:30:23.840 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: They look like
cuddly little things,

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:27.160 align:middle line:84%
and so the kids don't even
really realize that it's an ET.

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.243 align:middle line:84%
And often, if kids say
something to their parents,

00:30:29.243 --> 00:30:31.743 align:middle line:84%
their parents just pretty much
just dismiss the whole thing.

00:30:31.743 --> 00:30:33.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They put
it away, absolutely.

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.440 align:middle line:90%
Spirits, ghosts, all that stuff.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.340 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: We're born plugged in.

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And then our friends,
society, family

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:44.830 align:middle line:84%
slowly erodes that
and tells us we really

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:46.360 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't be plugged in.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you help
people cope with their own ET

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:50.350 align:middle line:90%
experiences?

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:53.110 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Well, first,
I allow them just

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:54.520 align:middle line:90%
to tell me their entire story.

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And for some people, it's
been a lifetime of stories.

00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:57.850 align:middle line:90%
And I just listen.

00:30:57.850 --> 00:30:59.017 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Will they tell you?

00:30:59.017 --> 00:31:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Yes because I
protect their privacy.

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:05.890 align:middle line:84%
If they contact me
through my website,

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:08.890 align:middle line:84%
I do not share their
information unless they give me

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:09.760 align:middle line:90%
permission to.

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you give
us some big names?

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:13.590 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: No.

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:14.730 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:17.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You won't,
or you can't?

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:19.710 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Well, I don't
think I should.

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:21.948 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, not everybody wants
their name out there.

00:31:21.948 --> 00:31:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, that's true.

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:24.190 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: They really don't.

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that are sharing
their names, I'm so grateful.

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:28.980 align:middle line:84%
But they've done a lot
of processing in order

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:29.970 align:middle line:90%
to get there.

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How close
are we to getting

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:34.363 align:middle line:90%
to the truth of all of this?

00:31:34.363 --> 00:31:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Well, you know,
lately right now,

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:37.950 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot going
on in the news.

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And so right now, there's that
whistleblower that's saying

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:42.930 align:middle line:90%
that there's--

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a great story.

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: --saucers and remains of
beings that our government is

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:48.600 align:middle line:90%
holding on to.

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:51.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Air Force Intelligence
officer David Grusch.

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:52.140 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Yes.

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:55.020 align:middle line:90%
And so that's shocking people.

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's opening the
door just a little bit.

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:00.570 align:middle line:84%
It's getting
people, maybe people

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:02.970 align:middle line:84%
who don't believe,
to think, oh my gosh,

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:04.350 align:middle line:90%
maybe this could be real.

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will the
hybridization programs

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.110 align:middle line:90%
continue and things like that?

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:09.750 align:middle line:90%
That's not stopping, is it?

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: I don't know
if it's stopping.

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:14.940 align:middle line:84%
A lot of experiences
are coming to me

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:18.180 align:middle line:84%
with those types of
experiences, men and women.

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:19.600 align:middle line:90%
But it tends to be mostly women.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: It's hard to tell
with these experiences

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:25.710 align:middle line:84%
if they happened in the past or
if they're happening right now.

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:27.720 align:middle line:90%
There really is no time.

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:32.340 align:middle line:84%
I am not even really even
sure if an experience that I

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:35.550 align:middle line:84%
remember happened at
that moment or I'm just

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:38.820 align:middle line:84%
remembering something that
happened to me years ago.

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:39.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm not certain.

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:42.150 align:middle line:84%
But when I got the
X, it feels like it

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:43.320 align:middle line:90%
happened at that moment.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.810 align:middle line:84%
Because there was a bug bite
that went along with it.

00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:47.130 align:middle line:90%
There was a little bit of--

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It seems
to be that people

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:52.050 align:middle line:84%
who are in contact
with ETs generally

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:59.060 align:middle line:84%
become a little more
cultural, aesthetic, artistic.

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:00.530 align:middle line:90%
Why does that happen?

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:03.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like your drawing was
very well done, by the way.

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Yes.

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:05.780 align:middle line:84%
I've been an artist
my whole life.

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.580 align:middle line:84%
But you bring up a
really good point,

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:12.090 align:middle line:84%
in that many experiencers become
artists after their contact.

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:12.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:13.940 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Yes.

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:17.780 align:middle line:84%
A lot of experiencers
start to express themselves

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:18.980 align:middle line:90%
artistically.

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:21.260 align:middle line:84%
When you express
yourself artistically,

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:23.340 align:middle line:90%
you're channeling divine energy.

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these
experiences, the ETs

00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:28.790 align:middle line:84%
are giving us
spiritual information

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:33.920 align:middle line:84%
about self-empowerment
and about unity.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.750 align:middle line:90%
And this changes the person.

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And it makes them
realize, oh, how

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:41.420 align:middle line:84%
can I show more love to
myself, and how can I

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:43.340 align:middle line:90%
show more love to humanity?

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, I really like to draw,
or I really like to paint,

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:48.170 align:middle line:90%
or I really like to play music.

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:50.450 align:middle line:90%
That brings me great joy.

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:52.940 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to start
doing that for myself.

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And then also people,
when they hear

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.600 align:middle line:84%
my music, when they
see my paintings,

00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.193 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
feel the joy, too.

00:33:59.193 --> 00:34:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sev, what do
you say to someone who's

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:03.780 align:middle line:84%
watching this
program who says, I

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:06.030 align:middle line:90%
think this is happening to me?

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:06.850 align:middle line:90%
What do they do?

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:08.080 align:middle line:90%
Where do they go again?

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:08.880 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned--

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.530 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Well, they
can come to me.

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:13.080 align:middle line:10%
My website, planetsev.com.

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:14.790 align:middle line:10%
And it's private.

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:16.590 align:middle line:10%
You just fill out
a few questions.

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:17.915 align:middle line:90%
And I'll email you.

00:34:17.915 --> 00:34:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You'll
get back to them.

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:20.832 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Oh yes, I'll
get back to them.

00:34:20.832 --> 00:34:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'll help you
as much as I can.

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:24.010 align:middle line:90%
And I do that for free.

00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:26.909 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been the
greatest story of someone

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:32.350 align:middle line:84%
who has come to you with an
experience that you remember?

00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:33.969 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
give us any names.

00:34:33.969 --> 00:34:35.110 align:middle line:90%
No names.

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:37.810 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: You mean maybe
the most unusual story?

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Whatever you
think is one of the best.

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:40.940 align:middle line:90%
Tell it to us.

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: It's really hard
to pick one of the best,

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:44.770 align:middle line:84%
because I think they're
all so excellent.

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell us one, though.

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: OK.

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:48.610 align:middle line:90%
There is a young lady.

00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And she's had many,
many, many experiences.

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:54.699 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them have to do with
the hybridization program.

00:34:54.699 --> 00:34:57.100 align:middle line:84%
It's very complex because
some of these experiences

00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:59.590 align:middle line:84%
are very happy experiences,
and some of them

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:00.580 align:middle line:90%
are very stressful.

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:02.890 align:middle line:84%
It seems like when a
human being is involved,

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:04.140 align:middle line:90%
they're stressful experiences.

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:05.807 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
mean a human being?

00:35:05.807 --> 00:35:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Well sometimes we have
experiences that are just ET,

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.920 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes you have
ET and human together.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.215 align:middle line:90%
I've had those experiences.

00:35:13.215 --> 00:35:15.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mean there's
been a human with the ET?

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Yeah.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.667 align:middle line:84%
And those tend to be
a little stressful.

00:35:17.667 --> 00:35:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like an assistant?

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: I don't know
what's going on there.

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:21.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:24.130 align:middle line:84%
It seems like when human beings
get involved, things just get--

00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:25.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe they're hybrids.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:27.910 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: The humans?

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they're not all
that nice, though.

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:32.750 align:middle line:90%
You know, MILAB?

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:34.140 align:middle line:90%
Military abductions.

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: I have had
several of those.

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:39.800 align:middle line:90%
And they're not nice.

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:42.720 align:middle line:84%
They're either neutral
or they're horrible.

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.810 align:middle line:84%
I've never heard of a
nice MILAB experience.

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:48.307 align:middle line:84%
And those in my experiences,
sometimes they were just human

00:35:48.307 --> 00:35:49.890 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes there
were ETs involved.

00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:51.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
so you're saying

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:55.370 align:middle line:84%
some of these experiences
are not always beneficial.

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: That brings up a really
good point about perspective.

00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:00.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because originally
in the beginning,

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:02.840 align:middle line:84%
you talked about how
you're not scared anymore.

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.070 align:middle line:90%
How everything's great.

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>>TOK: Yeah.

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:05.787 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But now
you're telling me

00:36:05.787 --> 00:36:09.240 align:middle line:84%
that there could be a little
nefarious thing going on here.

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:12.170 align:middle line:10%
>>TOK: So there are so many
different types of beings--

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:14.780 align:middle line:10%
high energy, low energy.

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:16.310 align:middle line:10%
High vibe, low vibe.

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:19.640 align:middle line:10%
And just like on Earth, when
you're with low vibe people,

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.800 align:middle line:10%
they tend to be
difficult. They really

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.730 align:middle line:10%
don't have your best
interests at heart.

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:27.630 align:middle line:84%
So when I help
people make contact,

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:31.560 align:middle line:84%
it's very important that we talk
about the quality of the energy

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:32.640 align:middle line:90%
that they're exuding.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:36.840 align:middle line:84%
It's really important to exude
or radiate a high vibration.

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:40.003 align:middle line:84%
That way, you'll align
with high vibration beings.

00:36:40.003 --> 00:36:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
beings that tend to be

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:42.962 align:middle line:90%
loving and kind and supportive.

00:36:42.962 --> 00:36:45.045 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thank you, Sev,
for being on the program.

00:36:45.045 --> 00:36:46.900 align:middle line:84%
>>TOK: Oh, It's
been my pleasure.

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
everything you do.

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:50.273 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's always
fascinating to me

00:36:50.273 --> 00:36:52.950 align:middle line:10%
to talk to somebody
who's an ET contactee

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:55.740 align:middle line:10%
and find out the things
they've gone through

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:57.480 align:middle line:10%
and how they have handled it.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And Sev has handled it in a
very gracious, intelligent way.

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
