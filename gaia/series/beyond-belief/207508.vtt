>>SONIA BARRETT:
Life is a science,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.410 align:middle line:84%
and I think it
wants to be hacked.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.270 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we are all living under
a birth to death program

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.890 align:middle line:90%
that's simply just that--

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.570 align:middle line:90%
a birth to death program.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.660 align:middle line:84%
The body waits for instructions
from a more evolved

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.860 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.030 align:middle line:90%
It's all data.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.430 align:middle line:90%
We are just streams of data.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.160 align:middle line:90%
We have to become outrageous.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Like a tree, that's how
creation branches out.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.600 align:middle line:90%
It branches, because we branch.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.890 align:middle line:84%
I think that we got locked
into this limited version

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.020 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves in order to
experience the most limiting

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.450 align:middle line:84%
possibilities, and I think
we've-- it's clear that

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.380 align:middle line:90%
we've done that.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.398 align:middle line:90%

>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

Sonia Barrett with us,
the executive producer

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.830 align:middle line:10%
of an award-winning documentary,
"The Business of Disease."

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.260 align:middle line:84%
She's also the author
of "The Holographic

as well as the host of a radio

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.810 align:middle line:84%

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.368 align:middle line:90%
Sonia, welcome.

00:01:21.368 --> 00:01:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: Well, thank
you so much for having me.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.060 align:middle line:90%
It's good to be back.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And how are you?

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.755 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: I'm great.

00:01:25.755 --> 00:01:26.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm great.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's new?

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: Well,
everything is new.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.810 align:middle line:10%
Everything is new, and nothing
is new so, lots going on.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.870 align:middle line:10%
Getting through our new
version of the world today,

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.560 align:middle line:10%
so I think that's
what's going on

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.170 align:middle line:10%
for me right now-- just
happy to seem like we're

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.070 align:middle line:10%
being on the other side
to some degree as opposed

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.650 align:middle line:10%
to what we witnessed
maybe last year.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't think
human beings have ever

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.340 align:middle line:84%
gone through what we've gone
through over the last year

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.140 align:middle line:90%
and a half.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.260 align:middle line:84%
It's been truly
remarkable, yet we

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.090 align:middle line:90%
seem to be getting through it.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: Yes, and I think that
the idea that maybe we've never

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.720 align:middle line:84%
gone through this before, I
think that human beings have

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.830 align:middle line:84%
gone through a tremendous
amount of change

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.197 align:middle line:84%
for the course of humanity's
existence on the planet.

00:02:14.197 --> 00:02:15.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: We've gone through
a lot of different changes.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.700 align:middle line:84%
But the beauty with human
beings, to some degree,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.230 align:middle line:90%
is the fact that we adapt.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, we manage to adapt,
because we are survivors,

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.510 align:middle line:90%
so we know how to survive.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.700 align:middle line:84%
If we know how to do nothing
else, we know how to survive.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's one of
the key ingredients as to why

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.058 align:middle line:84%
we are managing to get
through it at this time.

00:02:37.058 --> 00:02:38.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sonia, if you
were giving a speech

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.180 align:middle line:84%
before a vast audience
of men and women,

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.230 align:middle line:90%
how would you start it?

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.910 align:middle line:90%
What would you say to them?

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: In terms of what?

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.400 align:middle line:90%
This time that we're in?

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: Well, I think I
would probably focus on the fact

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.250 align:middle line:84%
that change is
significant right now,

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.490 align:middle line:84%
but I think how we cope with
that change and the fact

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.940 align:middle line:84%
that there is a collective
change, but at the same time,

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.100 align:middle line:84%
there is individual change, so
not to fear what is going on,

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.280 align:middle line:84%
but to understand that
throughout human history,

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.200 align:middle line:84%
there has always been
transitions and changes that

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.000 align:middle line:90%
happen.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.270 align:middle line:84%
That's how we
evolve as a species.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.440 align:middle line:84%
That's how we continue
to expand and to explore.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.200 align:middle line:84%
So look at this from
the standpoint of,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.710 align:middle line:84%
what can I do personally
with this change in my life?

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.160 align:middle line:84%
How can I convert it
to an opportunity?

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When we talk about
customizing reality, what

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.820 align:middle line:90%
do we mean by that?

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: Well, when
you look at the way

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.140 align:middle line:84%
that we are as human beings,
what I noticed a long time ago,

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.280 align:middle line:84%
when I started out on
this quest of curiosity,

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.420 align:middle line:84%
gradually, I started to
think, are we customized?

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And by that, I mean, is
everything sort of structured?

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.690 align:middle line:84%
Is there just a series of
protocols that we're living by?

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Is there just a series
of ideas and concepts

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.930 align:middle line:84%
that have become
our reality that

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.020 align:middle line:84%
have shaped the way that
we perceive reality?

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And my conclusion
is that I think so.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.890 align:middle line:84%
I think that we are
customized to a great degree,

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.649 align:middle line:84%
I think more than we
even want to realize,

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:21.810 align:middle line:90%
because it's so deeply embedded.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.600 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the things and concepts
and ideas that form who we are,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.700 align:middle line:84%
they're so deeply
embedded generation

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.180 align:middle line:84%
to generation that it's
hard to notice that,

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.600 align:middle line:84%
well, perhaps we are just
not as authentic individually

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.710 align:middle line:90%
as we might think.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we control
our own reality,

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.460 align:middle line:84%
or does something else
control that for us?

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: And that is--

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.840 align:middle line:84%
that can be a very
tricky question, too,

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.550 align:middle line:84%
because yes, I do believe that
we do control our reality.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.450 align:middle line:84%
However, we are going
to function according

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.230 align:middle line:84%
to the data, the
information that we've

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.770 align:middle line:84%
been exposed to, the
conditioning that we have,

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.670 align:middle line:90%
the programming that we have.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: Everything that
has been embedded in us

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.630 align:middle line:84%
is what's shaping us, so we are
making choices and decisions

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.860 align:middle line:90%
from that core place.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.290 align:middle line:84%
So yes, you are
controlling your reality,

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.730 align:middle line:84%
but what is the root
of what you believe?

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:21.630 align:middle line:90%
What is the root?

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Where is the actual
foundation, and what

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.010 align:middle line:84%
is that data that is
at the core of what

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.750 align:middle line:90%
forms you as a human being?

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's a big
question, but I think

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.070 align:middle line:84%
it's one that should
really be explored.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That ties right
into a Gaia program

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.690 align:middle line:84%
called "Down the
Quantum Rabbit Hole,"

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.590 align:middle line:84%
where Dr. Daniel Monti
and Dean Radin discuss

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.870 align:middle line:90%
that version of reality.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.410 align:middle line:10%
>>DANIEL MONTI: Back
in the 17th century,

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.550 align:middle line:10%
we came out of a period of
time, where we saw the universe

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.500 align:middle line:10%
as this living,
vibrant entity to that

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.675 align:middle line:10%
of the world as a machine.

00:06:00.675 --> 00:06:03.000 align:middle line:10%
And with that,
scientists came along,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.150 align:middle line:10%
such as Descartes
and Newton, which

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.260 align:middle line:10%
solidified that concept, because
they were describing science

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.000 align:middle line:10%
and mathematics of a non-living
world, of inanimate objects,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.650 align:middle line:10%
and did some very
beautiful calculations

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.880 align:middle line:10%
and enhanced our understanding
of non-living systems.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.250 align:middle line:10%
Descartes really looked
at the world as a machine.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.860 align:middle line:10%
He was very
interested in clocks.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.490 align:middle line:10%
The problem is they
applied this model

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.480 align:middle line:10%
of a clock or a wind-up toy
soldier to living systems,

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.130 align:middle line:10%
as if we understood the parts,
the different components

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.490 align:middle line:10%
of the system well enough,
we would understand how

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.977 align:middle line:10%
the system works as in a clock.

00:06:46.977 --> 00:06:48.810 align:middle line:10%
>>DEAN RADIN: The key
underlying assumptions

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.330 align:middle line:10%
that most scientists
still work under

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.700 align:middle line:10%
is that we live in a
clockwork universe.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.590 align:middle line:10%
We live in a
mechanistic universe

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.880 align:middle line:10%
that is conceived of
as gears and knobs

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.010 align:middle line:10%
sort of linking together.

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:05.950 align:middle line:84%
That is going to change, because
we know that that is not true.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.130 align:middle line:84%
We know from a physics point
of view, it's not true.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.370 align:middle line:84%
The impact of that change
is still somewhat difficult

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.400 align:middle line:84%
to guess, but one
of the areas that I

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.230 align:middle line:84%
know it's going to
make a big impact

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:21.230 align:middle line:84%
is in how we understand the
nature of human experience,

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.250 align:middle line:84%
because human experience, in a
clockwork world, doesn't fit.

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, in mainstream
psychology, for many years,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.850 align:middle line:84%
the very idea of an
internal experience

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.090 align:middle line:90%
was considered to be laughable.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:35.890 align:middle line:84%
There was no
internal experience.

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.160 align:middle line:84%
It was explained away, and the
reason it was explained away

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.302 align:middle line:84%
is because of this idea of
living in a clockwork world.

00:07:43.302 --> 00:07:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I tend to
agree with Dean Radin.

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:46.052 align:middle line:90%
What do you think, Sonia?

00:07:46.052 --> 00:07:47.740 align:middle line:90%
Do you agree with him?

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: Well,
yes, to some degree.

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:53.290 align:middle line:84%
I think that much of what
we're dealing with in terms

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:57.070 align:middle line:84%
of reality is completely
time-based in terms

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:01.310 align:middle line:84%
of our interpretation of time,
in terms of our understanding,

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:05.290 align:middle line:90%
I think, of what time is.

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think at the
same time, it's

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:10.190 align:middle line:84%
also relative in terms
of the individual.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:14.350 align:middle line:84%
But I think that we do
live in a reality, where

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:18.700 align:middle line:84%
there is more fluidity, I
think, than is realized.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Again, we are dealing
with our exposure

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.400 align:middle line:84%
to different kinds
of influences.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.990 align:middle line:84%
That's affecting the way that
we are experiencing reality.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.090 align:middle line:10%
No matter which
way we go, we have

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:34.750 align:middle line:10%
to recognize that we are
being influenced, in the end,

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.960 align:middle line:10%
by each other and
by our understanding

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.610 align:middle line:10%
and by what we see.

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.559 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, I think
that's what it is.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
need to break out

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:49.000 align:middle line:84%
of that is where my
position is, is to break out

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.250 align:middle line:84%
of this construct, this narrow
version and interpretation

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:57.490 align:middle line:84%
of reality, and recognize
that we really aren't living

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:01.090 align:middle line:84%
by the sort of singular
interpretation,

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:05.380 align:middle line:84%
and you dare not step
outside of that model.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, I dare to step
outside of that model,

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.120 align:middle line:84%
because I think we
need to understand more

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.710 align:middle line:90%
about this idea of time.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:14.800 align:middle line:84%
Life is a science, and I
think it wants to be hacked.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.390 align:middle line:90%
It wants to be interpreted.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:18.370 align:middle line:90%
It wants for us to understand.

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What fascinates
me about this, too,

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.860 align:middle line:84%
is talking about the grand
design of all of this

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.540 align:middle line:90%
and how it was designed.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:29.250 align:middle line:90%
I mean, does that perplex you?

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: When you say, does it
perplex me, do you mean am I--

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:35.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like the creation,
how it all happened.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: Well, I think that's
what everybody is still trying

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.260 align:middle line:90%
to come to an agreement on--

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.750 align:middle line:90%
exactly how did it happen?

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:47.590 align:middle line:84%
Will we figure out
specifically how it happened?

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:50.170 align:middle line:84%
Because what did they say--
past, present, and future,

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:52.490 align:middle line:84%
everything is happening
all at the same time.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Are we coming into
existence at the same time

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:56.980 align:middle line:90%
that we are actually existing?

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:00.910 align:middle line:84%
I think there's so many
interesting perceptions

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:05.050 align:middle line:84%
that we can have, look
at about exactly what's

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:09.760 align:middle line:84%
going on in terms of reality
and in terms of our effect

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.350 align:middle line:90%
on all of it.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, where do
we go from here?

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:17.710 align:middle line:84%
We have to really break through
the cycle, the old cycle

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:20.780 align:middle line:84%
of perception-- of our
perception, which is, I think,

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.450 align:middle line:90%
a very limiting one.

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Even when we are curious or
we believe that we are even

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:34.780 align:middle line:84%
super aware, for myself, I
really started to notice, well,

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.640 align:middle line:90%
just how authentic are you?

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, how do you know
that you like the color blue?

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:42.220 align:middle line:90%
Because you like it.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:46.150 align:middle line:84%
I think we just have to go back
to really recognizing that.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:48.597 align:middle line:90%
How the universe was designed--

00:10:48.597 --> 00:10:50.680 align:middle line:84%
that's-- I mean, well,
it's not just the universe,

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.330 align:middle line:90%
but its creation in general.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:53.830 align:middle line:90%
How was that designed?

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:57.820 align:middle line:84%
I think until we can
step out of this box

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:01.990 align:middle line:84%
of human understanding,
everything

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:04.360 align:middle line:84%
that we interpret
is going to be based

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:08.740 align:middle line:84%
on our narrow human
interpretation

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.410 align:middle line:90%
from mathematics on.

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What might we
discover about ourselves?

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: Well, I think one
of the things we will discover

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:23.150 align:middle line:84%
is that, for me, I recognize
that the body actually

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:28.130 align:middle line:84%
plays a much larger
role than we give it.

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.580 align:middle line:90%
This is fascinating technology.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.920 align:middle line:84%
The entire construct of creation
is fascinating technology.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.210 align:middle line:84%
It's just a technology,
as I said before--

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:38.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's brilliant.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:38.810 align:middle line:90%
It's brilliant technology.

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:39.893 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: It's brilliant.

00:11:39.893 --> 00:11:44.190 align:middle line:84%
It's beyond our minuscule
interpretation of technology,

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:44.990 align:middle line:90%
because what?

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:50.000 align:middle line:84%
We can only make comparisons
according to our perception

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.530 align:middle line:90%
of what technology is.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:56.240 align:middle line:84%
But on a vast level,
the body is something

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.870 align:middle line:90%
that has not been understood.

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:01.280 align:middle line:90%
We haven't hacked it yet.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.900 align:middle line:90%
We haven't accessed it yet.

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.000 align:middle line:90%
We haven't turned it on yet.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.640 align:middle line:84%
I think that that
play-- this plays

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.520 align:middle line:84%
a huge role in the
bigger picture of what

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.260 align:middle line:90%
we're trying to understand.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we could go
into all kinds of levels

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.880 align:middle line:90%
with, well, what is the body?

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.730 align:middle line:84%
The body's its own,
really, intelligence,

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.670 align:middle line:84%
so we've got different
levels of intelligence

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:24.110 align:middle line:90%
by which we're operating.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And the body is, on its own,
almost a separate intelligence

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:31.910 align:middle line:84%
to some degree,
designed that way

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:33.530 align:middle line:90%
because it's good at surviving.

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: It's designed to--
like a system, like a system,

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:38.300 align:middle line:90%
like a computer system.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.910 align:middle line:84%
It's designed to stay
alive at all costs.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:44.900 align:middle line:84%
It's designed to be able
to keep this organism going

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:49.130 align:middle line:84%
so that that which occupies
the organism occupies the body,

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:52.370 align:middle line:84%
can continue to have
the experience here

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:54.892 align:middle line:84%
in this particular
version of reality.

00:12:54.892 --> 00:12:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
beginning to say, Sonia,

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.223 align:middle line:84%
that the heart literally is
another brain within the body.

00:13:00.223 --> 00:13:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:02.917 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:13:02.917 --> 00:13:06.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It creates emotion,
so a loved one dies.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.760 align:middle line:90%
You get very depressed.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.500 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you would die.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:13.713 align:middle line:84%
And they say that the heart
really has a brain to itself.

00:13:13.713 --> 00:13:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we're going
to find out even more about not

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.860 align:middle line:84%
just the heart, but all the
other organs, but absolutely.

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.260 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
the heart, which

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:29.360 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to be the greatest
generator in the body,

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.610 align:middle line:84%
like a natural
generator, now you've

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:34.400 align:middle line:84%
got all the frequencies
being processed

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.410 align:middle line:84%
through the heart, all
the emotions, which

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:38.420 align:middle line:90%
are electrochemical impulses.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.000 align:middle line:84%
You've got all these
frequencies that are being

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.080 align:middle line:90%
processed through the heart.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you say somebody
can die of a broken heart,

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.510 align:middle line:84%
you can really understand how
the frequency of sadness--

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:50.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It makes sense.

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: --can
affect the heart.

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:55.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, the heart also
sends that message

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:56.850 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of the body.

00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:00.140 align:middle line:84%
It sends that message
to our very DNA

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:03.110 align:middle line:84%
that it's all data
that's being moved about.

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:05.390 align:middle line:90%
We are just streams of data.

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:10.850 align:middle line:84%
So the heart is processing data
interpreted as frequencies.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: So I think
it's fascinating

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.090 align:middle line:84%
that we have the
gut, but brain, so we

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:19.520 align:middle line:84%
have all these
different aspects of us

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.940 align:middle line:84%
that, when we can
unlock that information,

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.560 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be a
lot more powerful.

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it
will change the way we

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:32.720 align:middle line:90%
respond and react emotionally.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.730 align:middle line:84%
That's going to make
a huge difference,

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:38.690 align:middle line:84%
because right now,
we are consumed,

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:43.160 align:middle line:84%
and our bodies are affected
in a drastic manner

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.500 align:middle line:84%
by the way emotions
are processed

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:50.180 align:middle line:84%
and the data that is being
processed in our emotions.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:53.150 align:middle line:84%
That is definitely
affecting the body

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:55.140 align:middle line:84%
through health and
so many other ways.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:55.940 align:middle line:90%
The heart is.

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did how did you
get to this point of knowledge?

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: For me,
again, curiosity.

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:02.630 align:middle line:90%
I've always been curious.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:04.523 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Trial and error?

00:15:04.523 --> 00:15:05.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: That's every day.

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:06.600 align:middle line:90%
That's every day.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:10.190 align:middle line:84%
But as a child, I think
some people are born--

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:12.890 align:middle line:84%
they come into this
life with a curiosity.

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:18.440 align:middle line:84%
I, for sure, came in with a
curiosity that was definitely--

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:22.010 align:middle line:84%
some of it was definitely a
lot different than most people,

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:23.420 align:middle line:90%
because I questioned death.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, most people
don't question death,

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:27.110 align:middle line:84%
not in the manner
in which I have.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:28.410 align:middle line:90%
I've questioned that.

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:32.270 align:middle line:84%
So over the years, over
time, in the early '90s,

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:35.220 align:middle line:84%
I'd say around '92, after
going through a divorce,

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.520 align:middle line:84%
I think that was my
moment of saying,

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:43.430 align:middle line:84%
I need to understand more
about this game called life.

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:48.920 align:middle line:84%
What is this thing that I'm
involved in, and who is me?

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.300 align:middle line:90%
Who is I?

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.590 align:middle line:90%
What am I referring to?

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:55.190 align:middle line:84%
So there was a lot of
questions that came up for me.

00:15:55.190 --> 00:16:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And on my own, I set
out to discover this.

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, I didn't
know how to meditate.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.670 align:middle line:90%
So I started from scratch.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:07.670 align:middle line:90%
There were no workshops.

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.837 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know anything about
anything-- metaphysics,

00:16:09.837 --> 00:16:12.170 align:middle line:84%
nothing, quantum physics,
absolutely nothing.

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:16.040 align:middle line:84%
So I started from
scratch in my own quest

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.700 align:middle line:84%
and stayed very committed
to this discovery

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:23.750 align:middle line:84%
as I unlocked myself
and as I realized

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:28.040 align:middle line:84%
I could access these different
levels of information.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.660 align:middle line:90%
That's what started to happen.

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And it was like a
child in a candy store.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And I started to go
deeper and deeper into it.

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:35.975 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you evolved.

00:16:35.975 --> 00:16:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: And I-- and
I continue to do that.

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how I go
back to the idea of time

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:46.290 align:middle line:84%
and what that really
means for us and the body.

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And it goes back to my very
earlier question as a child--

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.610 align:middle line:84%
well, if I question
the idea of death,

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:55.550 align:middle line:84%
it would mean that I'd
have to eventually question

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:57.000 align:middle line:90%
the idea of time.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.210 align:middle line:84%
So gradually, all these pieces
started to just show up for me.

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:04.609 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
get a better picture

00:17:04.609 --> 00:17:09.109 align:middle line:84%
as to what we didn't
understand and also the fact

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:15.470 align:middle line:84%
that maybe we are all
living under a program,

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:18.770 align:middle line:84%
a birth to death program
that's simply just that--

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:20.480 align:middle line:90%
a birth to death program.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Is there something outside
of that, beyond that?

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:25.849 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
started to question.

00:17:25.849 --> 00:17:32.360 align:middle line:84%
I started to see that, ah,
you're living under the ceiling

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:36.470 align:middle line:84%
of commonality, of
common acceptance,

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:40.660 align:middle line:84%
common protocols of what
reality can be and cannot be.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
really important for us

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:45.080 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that we
are living according

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:52.130 align:middle line:84%
to what we're told is acceptable
to process and what is not.

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:57.260 align:middle line:84%
So then, everybody conforms to
these ideas about what reality

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.150 align:middle line:90%
can be and cannot be.

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Even in our
expansiveness sometimes,

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:04.130 align:middle line:84%
we are still locked
in this system,

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:06.060 align:middle line:90%
this construct of limitations.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:06.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Precisely.

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: That's
what I discovered.

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And so I have done
everything to continue

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.360 align:middle line:84%
to move beyond that--
not good or bad, better

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.040 align:middle line:84%
or worse-- that's
what I discovered--

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:19.490 align:middle line:84%
but where you are when you
understand what you understand,

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:20.520 align:middle line:90%
that's where you are.

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.370 align:middle line:84%
It's not good or
bad, but can you

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:24.950 align:middle line:84%
continue to build
on that awareness

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:28.160 align:middle line:84%
without limiting yourself
to what's comfortable?

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And I decided I
didn't want to be

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:32.570 align:middle line:84%
comfortable with
my understanding.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:36.210 align:middle line:84%
I needed to hack the
bigger construct.

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:37.288 align:middle line:90%
So here I am.

00:18:37.288 --> 00:18:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's tap into "Down
the Quantum Rabbit Hole" again,

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:42.920 align:middle line:84%
where Lynne McTaggart
talks about humanity

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.203 align:middle line:90%
and how it views itself.

00:18:45.203 --> 00:18:47.120 align:middle line:10%
>>LYNNE MCTAGGART: Science
creates the stories

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:51.990 align:middle line:10%
that we live by, and science
has told us a very bleak story.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:55.700 align:middle line:10%
It's told us that we're some
sort of genetic mistake,

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.550 align:middle line:10%
that we have genes
that use us, basically,

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:00.230 align:middle line:10%
to move on to the
next generation,

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:02.210 align:middle line:10%
and we randomly mutate.

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:05.300 align:middle line:10%
It said that we are
outside of our universe,

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.730 align:middle line:10%
that we're alone,
that we are separate,

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:11.090 align:middle line:10%
and that we are this
sort of lonely mistake

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:14.930 align:middle line:10%
on a lonely planet
in a lonely universe.

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:17.850 align:middle line:10%
And that informs our
view of the world.

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:20.510 align:middle line:10%
It informs our
view of ourselves.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:23.820 align:middle line:10%
And we're now realizing
that this view,

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:28.610 align:middle line:10%
this view of separateness is one
of the most destructive things.

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:33.638 align:middle line:10%
It's the thing that creates
all the problems in the world.

00:19:33.638 --> 00:19:36.393 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING] It's
time to get wise.

00:19:36.393 --> 00:19:38.810 align:middle line:10%
>>MCTAGGART: And we're now
realizing that that paradigm is

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:41.160 align:middle line:10%
wrong, that we aren't separate.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.470 align:middle line:90%
We are all one.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:43.850 align:middle line:90%
We're all together.

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:48.470 align:middle line:84%
At the very northernmost element
of our being, we are connected.

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And so we're trying to
understand and absorb,

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:55.830 align:middle line:84%
what are the
implications of that?

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:58.717 align:middle line:84%
What does this really
mean to me and my life?

00:19:58.717 --> 00:20:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sonia, do you agree
with Lynne McTaggart there?

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: I do agree with her.

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:08.060 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that
I like to point out always

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:13.200 align:middle line:84%
is that where we are when it
comes to science, where we are,

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:17.140 align:middle line:84%
whether as individuals
or as scientists,

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.850 align:middle line:84%
are we right or
wrong in that moment?

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:24.530 align:middle line:84%
I think that that is just where
we are in our understanding.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And so the question
then is, can you

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:30.460 align:middle line:84%
keep pushing beyond
what we know now?

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Because what we
know at this time,

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:36.263 align:middle line:84%
in 20 years, or maybe
even next week--

00:20:36.263 --> 00:20:37.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could change.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.263 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: --could change.

00:20:38.263 --> 00:20:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
science is constantly

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:45.580 align:middle line:84%
refiguring and discovering,
because we will never--

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:50.200 align:middle line:84%
there will never be a bottom
of discovery, like an ultimate.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:54.460 align:middle line:10%
I-- well, I'd say that is one
of the things that I realized.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And that freed me,
because I didn't

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:02.320 align:middle line:84%
have to try to get reality
to be stuck in a construct.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:07.180 align:middle line:84%
But realize that reality
is showing itself to me,

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.120 align:middle line:84%
or maybe I am seeing
it according to where

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.900 align:middle line:90%
I am in my understanding.

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I free myself and
I allow myself to see more

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.630 align:middle line:84%
beyond that, then I
will always continue

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:22.600 align:middle line:84%
to see a next level,
a next version,

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.410 align:middle line:90%
a next new understanding.

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:26.950 align:middle line:90%
But if you lock yourself into--

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:29.830 align:middle line:84%
and some scientists have
done that, where they say,

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:31.030 align:middle line:90%
absolutely not.

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:32.570 align:middle line:90%
This is the way it is--

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:35.770 align:middle line:84%
then that's where
you are, until you're

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:37.780 align:middle line:90%
ready to change that construct.

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, in a way,
sadly, human beings--

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.770 align:middle line:84%
not all human beings, but I
think humans in general look

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:49.300 align:middle line:84%
to scientists to
give them permission

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:52.903 align:middle line:84%
for what it is OK to
understand and to perceive--

00:21:52.903 --> 00:21:54.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, or guidance.

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: --reality.

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:55.450 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:57.770 align:middle line:90%
So we tend to do that.

00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And so it sort of brings us
into that sort of hive space,

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:05.020 align:middle line:84%
even though, yes, we are
one, but individually,

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:10.540 align:middle line:84%
our responsibility is to bring
a uniqueness to this oneness

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:11.420 align:middle line:90%
that we are.

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:16.390 align:middle line:84%
That's why that which is which
cannot be defined shows itself

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:21.610 align:middle line:84%
as individuals, as everything
that we see around us in order

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:26.920 align:middle line:84%
to have the unique experiences
that come from each thing,

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:30.050 align:middle line:84%
each plant life, each
star, each everything.

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: And so I don't
see things as we were wrong,

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:37.430 align:middle line:90%
and that's not-- we were wrong.

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:41.270 align:middle line:84%
I think that that's just
where we were in that moment.

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:44.230 align:middle line:84%
But the individual
has an opportunity

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:49.150 align:middle line:84%
to always go beyond what
science has discovered.

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:53.770 align:middle line:84%
I do not believe in waiting for
science to give me permission

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:56.440 align:middle line:84%
to understand, because most
of the time, what I realize

00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:03.280 align:middle line:84%
is what maybe I discovered, then
here comes science saying that.

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's been like
that for ages.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.120 align:middle line:84%
Through all the ages
with different stages,

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.740 align:middle line:84%
with-- it's always
been that way.

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:13.000 align:middle line:84%
So I think we are
in a moment in time,

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.730 align:middle line:90%
where humanity has the choice.

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:18.550 align:middle line:84%
They've always had the choice,
but I think this moment in time

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:22.300 align:middle line:84%
is saying, you have an
opportunity to step it up.

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:25.840 align:middle line:84%
I think that the
bigger picture wants--

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:29.740 align:middle line:84%
is ready for humans, then,
to go into a different level

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.680 align:middle line:84%
of evolution, like
nature continues

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:36.310 align:middle line:84%
to branch out, like a tree
constantly branching out.

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:37.570 align:middle line:90%
And here we are.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:39.520 align:middle line:84%
So regardless of
what may be going

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:43.030 align:middle line:84%
on the political front
and all of the insanity,

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:44.920 align:middle line:90%
they're playing their roles.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.580 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
it can be an opportunity

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:53.350 align:middle line:84%
that drives the individual to
go deeper into self-discovery.

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I like to
look at it that way.

00:23:55.150 --> 00:24:00.640 align:middle line:84%
We are being forced to wake up
and to discover more deeply,

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:05.320 align:middle line:84%
or we can stay on what I
like to call the default

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.780 align:middle line:84%
evolution, which means
that, sure, you can

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:14.110 align:middle line:84%
stay on the treadmill and wait
for a default kind of evolving,

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:17.530 align:middle line:84%
or as an individual, I
can say, you know what?

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:20.620 align:middle line:90%
I am so ready to discover more.

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.428 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody is
here to do that.

00:24:22.428 --> 00:24:24.220 align:middle line:84%
So, again, it's not a
right or wrong thing.

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:29.170 align:middle line:84%
I think we're all here as free
agents on different missions

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:32.000 align:middle line:84%
in this life in terms
of what we discover

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.070 align:middle line:90%
and what we experience.

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:35.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sonia, what does the
collective consciousness mean

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:36.970 align:middle line:90%
to you?

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: When I think
collective consciousness,

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:45.070 align:middle line:84%
I think that, just
overall, all the beings

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:46.990 align:middle line:84%
and all humans that
are here, if we're

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:51.130 align:middle line:84%
talking on just a human level,
all humans that are here,

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:56.440 align:middle line:84%
I think, collectively, we
have certain understandings,

00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:02.830 align:middle line:84%
certain beliefs, certain things
that we collectively agree on

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:04.760 align:middle line:90%
that form our reality.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:09.010 align:middle line:84%
So I think there are these
collective agreements, rather,

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:13.150 align:middle line:84%
that we use to form
our world, which

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:16.950 align:middle line:84%
is how we are able to
relate to each other,

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:19.230 align:middle line:84%
to have connections with
each other, relationships

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:22.410 align:middle line:84%
with each other, because
there are these common views

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:23.730 align:middle line:90%
and common perceptions.

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:27.460 align:middle line:84%
However, there are aspects
that are going to be different.

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:30.060 align:middle line:84%
But what a human
being looks like--

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:31.810 align:middle line:84%
we kind of agree on
these certain things--

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:33.185 align:middle line:84%
you know, what a
tree looks like,

00:25:33.185 --> 00:25:34.950 align:middle line:84%
what a chair-- there's
certain things that

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:38.280 align:middle line:84%
are just a core part of
collective consciousness.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, collective
consciousness may also

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:44.670 align:middle line:84%
have an agreement
or an attachment

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:50.340 align:middle line:84%
to, again, a standard
birth to death program.

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:53.563 align:middle line:84%
But here, I'm going to throw
this in real quickly, because I

00:25:53.563 --> 00:25:54.480 align:middle line:90%
have to throw this in.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:57.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: All right,
so we like to think

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.540 align:middle line:84%
that the whole world,
like all human beings

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:05.400 align:middle line:84%
are basically the same in the
sense of the birth to death

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.360 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:10.200 align:middle line:84%
But I started looking at
it, and I think, well, I

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.820 align:middle line:90%
don't know all human beings.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:13.710 align:middle line:90%
I don't know who is here.

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:18.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the many
versions of reality

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:19.890 align:middle line:84%
that are existing
right here, right

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:22.920 align:middle line:84%
now, with human beings that
are operating, perhaps,

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:27.390 align:middle line:84%
in maybe a more elevated
space of thinking

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:30.180 align:middle line:84%
than the birth to death
program that we all

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:31.660 align:middle line:90%
seem to be attached to.

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.435 align:middle line:90%
So I started to look at that.

00:26:33.435 --> 00:26:35.310 align:middle line:84%
I thought, you know,
well, I don't know that.

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:37.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm being told that
everybody lives

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:40.410 align:middle line:84%
this way or everybody
thinks this way or the media

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:43.530 align:middle line:84%
presents this to me or religion
presents these same concepts.

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:45.150 align:middle line:90%
But what if that's not so?

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:48.870 align:middle line:84%
So collective
consciousness is precisely,

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:51.330 align:middle line:84%
in my interpretation,
what I've described.

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:53.040 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, I think there

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.560 align:middle line:84%
are other aspects
of human beings

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.540 align:middle line:84%
that are very much
here that may be

00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:02.040 align:middle line:90%
living beyond what this base--

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:05.850 align:middle line:84%
these base concepts that
we seem to be experiencing.

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we, as human beings,
understand our own limitations?

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:13.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: Do we understand
our own limitations?

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:18.090 align:middle line:84%
I think that we set
limitations on ourselves

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:21.480 align:middle line:84%
based on, again,
what we're told, what

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.820 align:middle line:90%
we're conditioned to believe.

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.950 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, I don't know

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:30.690 align:middle line:84%
that the majority
recognizes that there really

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:32.110 align:middle line:90%
are no limitations.

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:33.720 align:middle line:90%
I think that's the big question.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:36.685 align:middle line:84%
There really are no
real limitations.

00:27:36.685 --> 00:27:37.485 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:27:37.485 --> 00:27:38.652 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There shouldn't be.

00:27:38.652 --> 00:27:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: There
shouldn't be, but we are

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:43.860 align:middle line:90%
going to respond in our boxes.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And some boxes are smaller,
and some boxes are bigger.

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Either way, we're still
in these various boxes.

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And so it's recognizing, what
are the boundaries that I'm

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:56.100 align:middle line:90%
operating within?

00:27:56.100 --> 00:28:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Are these boundaries based
on external data perceptions?

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:06.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, how did I
end up in this box?

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think, also, know thyself
becomes a really big one.

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:14.370 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell the truth to
yourself about where you are?

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:16.860 align:middle line:84%
Can you be honest without
thinking that this

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:18.450 align:middle line:90%
is a judgment or a blame?

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:22.590 align:middle line:84%
I think until we can really
tell the truth to ourselves

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:28.890 align:middle line:84%
about maybe the limiting world
that we express or operate

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:32.970 align:middle line:84%
within, it's very hard for
us to move beyond that.

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And I remember a couple
of times a while back,

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:38.160 align:middle line:84%
I had said to my husband,
I said, you know,

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.860 align:middle line:90%
my world feels really small.

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:42.405 align:middle line:90%
I was doing so many things.

00:28:42.405 --> 00:28:43.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's condensed, right?

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Yeah.

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it
was that moment

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:49.170 align:middle line:84%
of realizing that even
though people look at Sonia

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:52.650 align:middle line:84%
and think, gosh, you have these
outrageous concepts, which

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:53.670 align:middle line:90%
we love.

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:58.750 align:middle line:84%
I still kept feeling like, no,
my world needs to be bigger.

00:28:58.750 --> 00:28:59.850 align:middle line:90%
It needs to be more.

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think when we
can come to that space

00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:08.190 align:middle line:84%
and recognize, my world is not--
my personal world, in my mind,

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:12.030 align:middle line:84%
needs to be bigger, we
have to become outrageous

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:14.100 align:middle line:90%
in our thinking.

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:16.920 align:middle line:84%
When I say, "outrageous,"
outrageousness

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:21.660 align:middle line:84%
allows us to step outside the
box, not be so comfortable,

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.370 align:middle line:90%
because creation--

00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:27.030 align:middle line:84%
it wants us to discover
all potentials.

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:28.050 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
we're here to do.

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:33.270 align:middle line:84%
We're here to
experience, express

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:35.370 align:middle line:90%
all that can be imagined.

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And yes, that's why we have
crazy things that happen,

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:39.280 align:middle line:90%
because it's all there.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.540 align:middle line:90%
It's all a possibility.

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:43.590 align:middle line:84%
So just as we can
experience the crazy things,

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:46.740 align:middle line:84%
then we should be
able to move forward,

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:51.000 align:middle line:84%
continuously move forward
into possibilities

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.280 align:middle line:84%
that far exceed our little
tiny box of being born.

00:29:56.280 --> 00:30:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And then we live these tiny
lives, and then we die.

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:04.230 align:middle line:84%
That, for me, as a child,
was very questioning.

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:05.460 align:middle line:90%
And I'm talking--

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:07.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- maybe
four or five years old.

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:09.000 align:middle line:90%
The whole thing was just--

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:09.315 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:30:09.315 --> 00:30:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: --bizarre to me.

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:13.200 align:middle line:84%
It felt like an
airport, I always say,

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.640 align:middle line:90%
of arrivals and departures.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And I used to think, doesn't
anybody think this is odd?

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.200 align:middle line:90%
We come in.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.130 align:middle line:90%
People come in.

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:21.240 align:middle line:90%
Then they leave.

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And then we somehow
adjust, because we adapt.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:25.500 align:middle line:90%
That's what we do.

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:26.370 align:middle line:90%
We adjust.

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:27.810 align:middle line:90%
We adjust to the pain.

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:28.650 align:middle line:90%
We handle it.

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:29.560 align:middle line:90%
We deal with it.

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.950 align:middle line:84%
But I'm thinking,
no, no, there's

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:33.880 align:middle line:90%
something else going on here.

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:39.300 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, so I've spent the time
pushing the boundaries to see

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:43.650 align:middle line:84%
that there is so much more
that wants me to see it,

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:48.420 align:middle line:84%
because like a tree, that's
how creation branches out.

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:51.430 align:middle line:90%
It branches because we branch.

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:52.980 align:middle line:90%
But if we don't branch--

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:55.770 align:middle line:84%
we can't branch if we're
not asking those questions.

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:58.410 align:middle line:90%
If it's safe, you can't branch.

00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:00.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm here to branch.

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dr. Joe Dispenza on
"Down the Quantum Rabbit Hole"

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:06.332 align:middle line:84%
echoes exactly
what you're saying.

00:31:06.332 --> 00:31:08.790 align:middle line:10%
>>JOE DISPENZA: When the soul
emerges, when a person begins

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:14.430 align:middle line:10%
to wake up, they weigh, they
begin to weigh what they know

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:17.490 align:middle line:10%
and what's working
for them against what

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:20.050 align:middle line:10%
is that inner urge
and that inner drive.

00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:23.190 align:middle line:10%
And for some people,
it's a clean cut.

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:24.930 align:middle line:10%
They make the break.

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:27.030 align:middle line:10%
They understand
what it is, and they

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:30.060 align:middle line:10%
begin to gain knowledge
and apply that knowledge.

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:34.660 align:middle line:10%
Other people have to have
their system fall apart.

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:39.700 align:middle line:10%
They have to go through the
disruption of that ordered

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:43.690 align:middle line:10%
and finalized complete state
of the personality that

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:46.090 align:middle line:10%
keeps everything intact
and everything in order

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:48.010 align:middle line:10%
based on how the person's wired.

00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:51.100 align:middle line:10%
So the tragedy, in
one sense, is really

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.710 align:middle line:10%
just the death of an old self.

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:56.530 align:middle line:10%
And it allows them a birth.

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:58.270 align:middle line:10%
And the birthing
process, at times,

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:01.120 align:middle line:10%
can be difficult,
because it's painful.

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:03.610 align:middle line:10%
And what's painful about
it more than anything else

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:08.500 align:middle line:10%
is that we no longer are
producing the same thoughts

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.090 align:middle line:10%
that make the same chemicals.

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:13.360 align:middle line:10%
We're breaking the addiction
to all those agreements

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.380 align:middle line:10%
chemically.

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:17.260 align:middle line:10%
That is an uncomfortable
state for the human being,

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:21.710 align:middle line:10%
because they can't connect
to any person, place, thing,

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:23.170 align:middle line:10%
or event out in their world.

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:25.780 align:middle line:10%
And because that
discomfort gives them

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:29.350 align:middle line:10%
a sense of no
relation to anything,

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:34.330 align:middle line:10%
that is borderline
nervous breakdown.

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:37.150 align:middle line:10%
It's borderline
insanity, because you

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:39.063 align:middle line:10%
look for some
evidence in your life

00:32:39.063 --> 00:32:40.480 align:middle line:10%
that you're doing
the right thing.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:43.210 align:middle line:10%
And everywhere you look
for evidence in your life

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:46.270 align:middle line:10%
is with the people you've had
all those agreements with.

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:48.520 align:middle line:10%
So you can't even turn
and talk to those people,

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:51.920 align:middle line:10%
because they're going to ask you
to go back to the same person

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:55.250 align:middle line:10%
so that they can keep
that agreement intact.

00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:59.980 align:middle line:10%
If the person has the knowledge
to be able to understand that,

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:04.030 align:middle line:10%
and they can ride their
way all the way through it,

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:08.180 align:middle line:10%
they'll begin to understand
that a new self is emerging.

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:10.660 align:middle line:10%
And those old patterns
will literally crumble.

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:13.630 align:middle line:10%
They'll literally
disconnect in the brain.

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:15.550 align:middle line:10%
And it'll give
them an opportunity

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:18.700 align:middle line:10%
to give birth to a new self.

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:22.180 align:middle line:84%
That new self will have a whole
new set of people in their life

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:23.830 align:middle line:90%
equal to who they become.

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:27.037 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So in a different
way, Sonia, he agrees with you.

00:33:27.037 --> 00:33:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Oh, absolutely.

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:30.970 align:middle line:84%
He's saying precisely
that, because the body

00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:32.260 align:middle line:90%
is a chemical factory.

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And so everything is
functioning in the body based

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:42.010 align:middle line:84%
on the emotions and
the belief systems

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:45.440 align:middle line:84%
and all of those things,
because, again, it's all data.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.550 align:middle line:84%
It's all information that's
being moved about all day

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:52.670 align:middle line:84%
long in the organs, in the
cells, all information.

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:56.560 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, what
level of information

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.330 align:middle line:90%
is being processed in the body?

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And if your belief system
is tiny, which is fine.

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:06.220 align:middle line:90%
If it's narrow, then that's--

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:07.810 align:middle line:84%
your body is
processing it that way.

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you'll
be that way, too.

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:08.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Pardon me?

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If it's narrow,
you'll end up being narrow.

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRETT: Absolutely.

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:11.970 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:34:11.970 --> 00:34:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And so all of these
things come into play

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:21.460 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of the life that
we live, how long we live,

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:24.100 align:middle line:90%
our sicknesses.

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:28.750 align:middle line:84%
It's this incredible science
that really is all up to us,

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:30.760 align:middle line:90%
when we understand.

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:35.199 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, change can be
very tough for anybody,

00:34:35.199 --> 00:34:36.040 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of people.

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.050 align:middle line:84%
It just depends on
what that change is.

00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And we want to be comfortable,
because comfort is safe.

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:47.270 align:middle line:84%
We want to feel safe, which is
why religion works so well too,

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:49.420 align:middle line:84%
because it gives
you-- and again, this

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:51.380 align:middle line:90%
is not a good or bad thing.

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:53.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying
the reason why we

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:59.140 align:middle line:84%
get drawn to these constructs
is because it gives us answers.

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:02.600 align:middle line:84%
We feel that it gives us
some answers, some security,

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:08.230 align:middle line:84%
some sense of direction,
some sense of knowing what

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:12.640 align:middle line:84%
could happen after
this body is released,

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.175 align:middle line:90%
after this body is no more.

00:35:14.175 --> 00:35:14.975 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:35:14.975 --> 00:35:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: So I think that
that kind of, in a way,

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:21.730 align:middle line:84%
becomes a setup, to some
degree, for a human being,

00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:26.320 align:middle line:84%
because what if there is
more beyond just waiting

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.970 align:middle line:90%
to leave the planet?

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:30.160 align:middle line:84%
What if there is
so much more there?

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that's what
I started to discover

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:36.400 align:middle line:90%
is how much more there is.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And I have not even
scratched the surface,

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:44.050 align:middle line:84%
but every day, I just engage
in new levels of awareness.

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say,
also, that when

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:51.790 align:middle line:84%
you look at ancient practices,
you know, like qigong--

00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:52.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to say qigong--

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:56.380 align:middle line:84%
or even meditation
like Vipassana--

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:57.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tai chi.

00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: --meditation, all
of these ancient tools were

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:04.420 align:middle line:90%
actually discovering or--

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:08.770 align:middle line:84%
yeah, discovering and
preparing the human

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:12.400 align:middle line:84%
for what happens
actually in the body

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.220 align:middle line:84%
and how to actually
regulate this form, which

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:18.670 align:middle line:84%
is why the idea of moving
Qi through the body

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:20.180 align:middle line:90%
is so significant.

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:23.080 align:middle line:90%
So it's all a divine technology.

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.880 align:middle line:90%
Do we know how to do that?

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.350 align:middle line:84%
No, we don't, because we're
not taught that in school.

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:30.250 align:middle line:84%
We are taught that
someone else is always

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:33.920 align:middle line:84%
going to know better
for you, for your body,

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:37.090 align:middle line:84%
so we're very disconnected
from the language of the body,

00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:40.420 align:middle line:84%
from even being in communication
with our body and our brain

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:42.040 align:middle line:90%
and our whole construct.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:46.270 align:middle line:84%
But that's what those ancient
practices were really about

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:51.070 align:middle line:84%
is getting the human to come
back, be in a centered space

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:56.470 align:middle line:84%
to actually be present, to
be the pilot for this body,

00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:59.950 align:middle line:84%
and to regulate this
life force energy that

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:02.520 align:middle line:90%
moves through this vessel.

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we understand
that, I mean,

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:09.730 align:middle line:84%
it's limitless as to how we
can manage our bodies and even

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:10.540 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk about the
human body and its ascension.

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:15.790 align:middle line:84%
William Henry had
a chance to talk

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:17.830 align:middle line:84%
to me on this very
program, and he

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:21.130 align:middle line:84%
talked about what it means
for humanity's endgame.

00:37:21.130 --> 00:37:22.540 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAM HENRY:
Ascension really

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:24.250 align:middle line:10%
is a quest for wholeness.

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:28.910 align:middle line:10%
It's the idea that we can
regain our true nature.

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:31.060 align:middle line:10%
Many of the ascension
keepers that we'll

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:34.810 align:middle line:10%
talk about have this belief
that our present flesh and blood

00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:38.140 align:middle line:10%
body is not our original
form or our true nature.

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:40.810 align:middle line:10%
They believe that we were
originally light beings,

00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:44.980 align:middle line:10%
that we had an existence,
a pre-physical existence

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:48.400 align:middle line:10%
as a light being, and that
we somehow became trapped

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.780 align:middle line:10%
in our physical bodies.

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:51.400 align:middle line:10%
And part of the
ascension process

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.980 align:middle line:10%
is to learn to transcend
our physical bodies

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:56.830 align:middle line:10%
and return to our original or
true nature as a light being.

00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:59.180 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Are we moving
in that direction?

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:00.040 align:middle line:10%
>>HENRY: We are.

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.380 align:middle line:10%
There's two tracks that
we're moving along.

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:06.010 align:middle line:10%
One is a spiritual or
an organic movement.

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:08.680 align:middle line:10%
People around the world, by the
millions, hundreds of millions,

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.810 align:middle line:10%
are practicing yoga,
doing meditation.

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:11.680 align:middle line:10%
This is all about--

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:12.040 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:14.770 align:middle line:10%
>>BARRETT: --feeding the light
body, the organic light body.

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:16.840 align:middle line:10%
Then the second track
is transhumanism,

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:18.940 align:middle line:10%
where your AI
developers are thinking

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:23.140 align:middle line:10%
that we can create a
non-physical body that

00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:25.840 align:middle line:10%
lives in a simulated reality.

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
agree with that?

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BARRETT: I--
yeah, I agree to--

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:33.160 align:middle line:90%
well, to a great extent.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:37.270 align:middle line:84%
I think that as far as the
light body, absolutely.

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:39.250 align:middle line:84%
I think that we
are so much more.

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:44.680 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, I do
see that the body, once we

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:48.340 align:middle line:84%
understand in terms of
that idea of ascension,

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:50.480 align:middle line:84%
doesn't necessarily
involve death.

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.280 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I know.

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:55.720 align:middle line:84%
I go completely off
the rails with that.

00:38:55.720 --> 00:39:01.360 align:middle line:84%
Or do we move to a space,
to a level of understanding,

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:05.500 align:middle line:84%
a level of awareness, where
this interface system that we

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:08.830 align:middle line:84%
call a brain and
the entire system

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:13.480 align:middle line:90%
is able to take the information?

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Because now you're operating
on a completely different level

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.180 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, which,
obviously, is a higher level

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:21.490 align:middle line:90%
of vibration or frequency.

00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Can we then literally transform
the structure of this body?

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:29.200 align:middle line:90%
I feel that we can.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:32.950 align:middle line:84%
I feel that is something
that is extremely possible.

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:36.040 align:middle line:84%
I think that's one of the
things that we are locked out

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.840 align:middle line:90%
of with this program.

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:41.020 align:middle line:84%
I think that everything
since we are--

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:43.270 align:middle line:84%
since there's-- its
wave and particle,

00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:46.750 align:middle line:84%
that's what we're dealing with--
appearing and disappearing--

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:52.120 align:middle line:84%
that this body can
definitely deconstruct--

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:54.730 align:middle line:84%
is the word "deconstruct--"
or transform.

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:57.220 align:middle line:90%
I think that it can transform.

00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:00.110 align:middle line:84%
It can be just pure
sound, which it is.

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:00.910 align:middle line:90%
It's sound.

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:01.480 align:middle line:90%
It's color.

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:02.470 align:middle line:90%
It's light.

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:05.620 align:middle line:84%
It's all of these
frequencies, then,

00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:08.900 align:middle line:84%
of the electromagnetic
spectrum and beyond that.

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:13.810 align:middle line:84%
So I think opening ourselves
up to a much bigger picture

00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:19.480 align:middle line:84%
is a necessity to see that
we don't have to be afraid

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.380 align:middle line:90%
that we can't do it.

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:25.180 align:middle line:84%
I think that this is where we're
going into what would probably

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:28.240 align:middle line:90%
be then considered superhuman.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:30.370 align:middle line:84%
I think that that's just
our natural ability.

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:32.530 align:middle line:84%
I think those things
are just natural to us.

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:36.760 align:middle line:84%
I think that we got locked
into this limited version

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:42.400 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves in order to
experience the most limiting

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.340 align:middle line:90%
possibilities.

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's clear
that we've done that.

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:48.520 align:middle line:90%
But I do feel that the body--

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:53.800 align:middle line:84%
the body waits for
information and instructions

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:57.760 align:middle line:84%
from a more evolved
consciousness

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:01.480 align:middle line:84%
that will, at that
point, occupy this form.

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:06.940 align:middle line:84%
I think there is no limit to the
evolution of the consciousness

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:10.390 align:middle line:84%
that you are, that I am,
one consciousness but as

00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:14.710 align:middle line:84%
individuals, as we appear
in individual form.

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:15.980 align:middle line:90%
I think it's all possible.

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And if we say that we
are everything, see,

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.010 align:middle line:84%
it becomes a contradiction,
because we say,

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:21.940 align:middle line:90%
we are everything.

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:24.340 align:middle line:84%
Everything is really made
up of the same substance.

00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Different patterns, different
mathematical formulas that

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:30.370 align:middle line:90%
shape different constructs--

00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:32.640 align:middle line:84%
then if we are
everything, that means,

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:37.440 align:middle line:84%
then, this body can
completely be transformed

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:41.850 align:middle line:90%
into any space-time realm.

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:43.800 align:middle line:90%
We're doing that already.

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:48.300 align:middle line:84%
But we're more conscious of
this construct of reality.

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:50.940 align:middle line:10%
We seem to be very--
we're fixed on this,

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:54.030 align:middle line:10%
but it doesn't mean that we're
not traveling about in time.

00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:59.350 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it's a much bigger
picture about what is possible.

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:02.853 align:middle line:10%
And I find that
extremely exciting.

00:42:02.853 --> 00:42:05.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief," Sonia.

>>BARRETT: Thank you.

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.740 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Humankind--
it's our nature

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:11.250 align:middle line:10%
to try to better ourselves,
keep doing what we're doing,

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:14.500 align:middle line:10%
and with people like Sonia
Barrett, we'll get there.

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
