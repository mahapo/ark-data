00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:27.430 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well, welcome
to another edition and "Beyond

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.230 align:middle line:10%
Belief".

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.800 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and we have
a very special guest for you

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.430 align:middle line:10%
on a topic that's very dear
to my heart, of course.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.770 align:middle line:84%
What happens when the
power grid goes down?

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.020 align:middle line:84%
But David Adair is with us,
the "Rocket Man", of course.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.540 align:middle line:90%
He's a great researcher.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.830 align:middle line:84%
He's been studying
this for years.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter of fact,
when he was a little boy,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.740 align:middle line:84%
he started dabbling in
rockets and things like that.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:50.990 align:middle line:90%
And he'll tell you about that.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.530 align:middle line:90%
David, welcome to the program.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID ADAIR: Thanks, George.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.990 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How old were you
when all this started for you?

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: About when
memory starts--

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.459 align:middle line:84%
probably when I was
about four or five.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:05.835 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Four or
five years old--

00:01:05.835 --> 00:01:06.634 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:01:06.634 --> 00:01:08.843 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --you started
dabbling in rocketry and stuff

00:01:08.843 --> 00:01:09.642 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:01:09.642 --> 00:01:10.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.230 align:middle line:10%
When I first started,
there was just

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.200 align:middle line:10%
little toy rockets that
was just sitting there,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.550 align:middle line:10%
and I can't have that.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.030 align:middle line:10%
They've got to move.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.560 align:middle line:84%
So I had my oldest brother take
a rock that I tied a string to,

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.510 align:middle line:84%
and he threw it
over this tree limb.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And I tied the
string to the rocket,

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.760 align:middle line:84%
and I could pull on the
string and watch the rocket--

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.885 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You pulled
it up, right?

00:01:27.885 --> 00:01:29.634 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, I'm
only like four or five.

00:01:29.634 --> 00:01:31.710 align:middle line:84%
My brother, what he
was impressed with

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.580 align:middle line:84%
was I figured out how to
tie a string to a rock

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.450 align:middle line:84%
and get the string
over the limb.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.990 align:middle line:84%
But by that time I
was 11, I had read

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.350 align:middle line:84%
enough to where I could start
implementing flying rockets.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And I started out
with solid rockets,

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.475 align:middle line:84%
and then moved on
up to liquid fuel.

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And your parents
let you play around

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.100 align:middle line:90%
with this stuff?

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.725 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, that's
the amazing part.

00:01:53.725 --> 00:01:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was really
good at mechanics.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.990 align:middle line:90%
My dad was a mechanic.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.290 align:middle line:84%
My dad was a Lee
Patty's mechanic,

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.450 align:middle line:84%
and so I had enormous
workshops to work with.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And the first engine
I ever overhauled

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.480 align:middle line:84%
was a 426 Chrysler hemi
engine, and that thing

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.670 align:middle line:84%
had two four barrels and
about 900 horsepower.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
a monster engine.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.670 align:middle line:84%
How old were you
when you did that?

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: I was 11 and 1/2.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jesus.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.514 align:middle line:84%
How did you even fit into
the engine to get to it?

00:02:21.514 --> 00:02:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It was
just about-- well,

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.690 align:middle line:84%
the Hohner weighs
about as much as I did.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.356 align:middle line:84%
I had to get another mechanic to
help me pick it out and line it

00:02:27.356 --> 00:02:28.490 align:middle line:90%
with the cylinders.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.389 align:middle line:84%
But once I got that part done,
it was just assembling it.

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you were
very intelligent

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.710 align:middle line:84%
when it had to do with
technology and rocketry.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.440 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever make something
that blew up on the launchpad?

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Oh lord, it's
more the other way around,

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.610 align:middle line:90%
did I have anything that worked?

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.480 align:middle line:90%
Most of it was blowing up.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm lucky I've got
all my fingers.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I was going to say.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: I had no--

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.030 align:middle line:84%
I was quick to get
out of the way.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.820 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I had a
lot of explosions.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.300 align:middle line:90%
Some of them were spectacular.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was your very
first successful rocket engine,

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.830 align:middle line:84%
where you launched
an actual rocket?

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:11.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I was 13 years old,
and this one was really good.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.990 align:middle line:84%
It was about-- almost
as tall as I was.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.140 align:middle line:84%
About 4 and 1/2 feet
tall, five-foot tall.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Made out of
what, paper and balsa?

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.880 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Steel.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:21.095 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Steel?

00:03:21.095 --> 00:03:21.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yes.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.268 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was the
real deal, wasn't it?

00:03:23.268 --> 00:03:26.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, I skipped
right-- drive well,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.180 align:middle line:84%
I used the SS rockets,
the little model rockets.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I used to do that too.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.310 align:middle line:90%
I loved them.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: OK, I use those for
wind direction, windstream--

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You shoot them
first, the little parachutes

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.440 align:middle line:90%
would come out.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I'd shoot them up, see
the drift, take the stopwatch,

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.410 align:middle line:90%
and calculate the upper winds.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.060 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a letter to Verness
and told him some things

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.060 align:middle line:90%
he can do to improve it.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.282 align:middle line:84%
I didn't tell him
that I was just

00:03:46.282 --> 00:03:47.490 align:middle line:90%
using them for wind trackers.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.766 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That company is
still here in Colorado.

00:03:49.766 --> 00:03:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, yeah, it is.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.310 align:middle line:90%
And I talked to Verne.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.284 align:middle line:90%
He's still alive.

00:03:53.284 --> 00:03:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is he really?

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.390 align:middle line:84%
He's up in age now, but I
was able to talk to him.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.190 align:middle line:90%
Really nice guy.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.620 align:middle line:84%
But he sent me a an awful
lot of motors and rockets,

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.430 align:middle line:90%
and I'd critique them for him.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How high up did
this first rocket go?

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: This one was
a cryogenics electric.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.185 align:middle line:84%
The fuels are 325 degrees
below zero, so it's a--

00:04:14.185 --> 00:04:15.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's cold.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.490 align:middle line:90%
It's what we call a feely.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.459 align:middle line:84%
It's a liquid fuel
rocket engine.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And this one went
about 52,000 feet.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.320 align:middle line:90%
A little bit more than--

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 52,000 feet?

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it come
down via parachute?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.070 align:middle line:84%
I had radio guidance
on it, and I

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.990 align:middle line:84%
had a little wire that trailed
out of as it was descending.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you found it?

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It went right
back in the yard.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.219 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:41.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, how far did it drift away?

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.850 align:middle line:90%
That's almost 10 miles high!

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, because of the upper
winds and the jet evaders

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.010 align:middle line:84%
I had built inside
the stress vanes

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.460 align:middle line:90%
allows me to steer things.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a steerable rocket.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And so I flew into
the wind on lift off.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.540 align:middle line:90%
It drifted back.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I calculated
it on drift time to come back--

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.790 align:middle line:84%
see, it's in freefall for a
while, and then the ejection

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.560 align:middle line:90%
cycle and all that goes off.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.559 align:middle line:84%
But I got good
because I was lazy.

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:10.100 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to go
chase them, and I

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.780 align:middle line:90%
didn't want to end up in trees.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you have
little friends with you too

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.910 align:middle line:90%
running around?

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:14.951 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Actually, I did.

00:05:14.951 --> 00:05:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's the funny
part, because--

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Iet's see, we were 10,
11, 12, those ages.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.500 align:middle line:90%
And this very first one was big.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And my mother saw my
friends down by the rocket.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And I were up about
100 yards away,

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.340 align:middle line:84%
and I called
everybody yet to me.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.820 align:middle line:90%
I said, you can't stand there.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.067 align:middle line:84%
They're used Fourth of
July rockets, you know?

00:05:35.067 --> 00:05:36.650 align:middle line:84%
Light a fuse, stand
right next to it--

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:37.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Little bottle rockets.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, and
watch it go up.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.140 align:middle line:84%
I said, you can't
stand down there, guys.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.580 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.920 align:middle line:90%
Well, you'll see in a minute.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.077 align:middle line:90%
So they came on up.

00:05:43.077 --> 00:05:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [SWOOSHING]

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Oh, I incinerated the
whole lower end of the yard.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.590 align:middle line:90%
It was just burnt to a crisp.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.170 align:middle line:84%

age, David, did NASA

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:56.102 align:middle line:84%
or other people start
noticing what you were doing?

00:05:56.102 --> 00:05:57.570 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: I was 13.

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:58.217 align:middle line:90%


00:05:58.217 --> 00:05:59.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right away.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.610 align:middle line:90%
That day, huh?

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, yeah.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.870 align:middle line:90%
They--

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.411 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
they know about you?

00:06:02.411 --> 00:06:05.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, that was-- it
was an accident, actually.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.340 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to figure out
how some of these rockets

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.000 align:middle line:84%
are malfunctioning, but I need
really high-speed cameras,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.800 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.180 align:middle line:90%
1,000 frames a second or faster.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought I'd
call the local news--

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.065 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And borrow one, huh?

00:06:20.065 --> 00:06:20.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Exactly.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:21.683 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I was a kid, you know?

00:06:21.683 --> 00:06:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You weren't
going to buy one.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.150 align:middle line:84%
You didn't have the
money for it then.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And they
got me on the phone,

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.689 align:middle line:84%
and they said, how
fast do you need?

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:28.730 align:middle line:84%
I said it's got to be over
1,000 frames a second.

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.563 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, what
are you photographing?

00:06:30.563 --> 00:06:31.980 align:middle line:90%
I said, rockets.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And they were
quiet for a second.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Are you the person
launching rockets

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.861 align:middle line:84%
we hear thundering in the
distance on a clear blue sky?

00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:41.235 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what
city was this?

00:06:41.235 --> 00:06:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: This was Mt.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:42.480 align:middle line:90%
Vernon.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And so I
said, yeah, I think

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.560 align:middle line:84%
that's my rockets
you're hearing.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.360 align:middle line:90%
Can you help me?

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.540 align:middle line:84%
They said, you bet, and
they come flying out there

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.440 align:middle line:90%
to see all this.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.210 align:middle line:90%
And their cameras helped.

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.120 align:middle line:84%
But the very first one
I launched for them,

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.336 align:middle line:90%
it came out of the pit.

00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And my dad was sitting
on the back of the car,

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.740 align:middle line:84%
and he's smoking his pipe, and
the rocket comes ripping out

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.812 align:middle line:90%
of there, and at such force.

00:07:07.812 --> 00:07:08.770 align:middle line:90%
I mean, these are mis--

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:09.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And loud.

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.148 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Oh, it's deafening.

00:07:12.148 --> 00:07:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And my dad said, David,
look at the photographers.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:15.290 align:middle line:90%
Turn around.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:16.706 align:middle line:84%
And both them are
staring straight

00:07:16.706 --> 00:07:17.887 align:middle line:90%
up watching the rocket--

00:07:17.887 --> 00:07:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With their mouths open.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: --and the cameras are
hanging down by their side.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah,
instead of shooting--

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:22.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: They didn't
take a sing-- they

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:23.920 align:middle line:90%
didn't get a single picture.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.336 align:middle line:84%
So I told them I kind of thought
that was going to happen,

00:07:26.336 --> 00:07:28.790 align:middle line:84%
that's why I packed two
more, so let us reload.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.770 align:middle line:90%
And we got some great photos.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.610 align:middle line:84%
But that's when
they wrote a story

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:35.900 align:middle line:90%
and it went on the front page.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.545 align:middle line:84%
And boy, after that,
everybody started

00:07:37.545 --> 00:07:38.670 align:middle line:90%
coming out of the woodwork.

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So I would
assume by that time,

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.160 align:middle line:84%
the media was doing
some stuff on you,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.514 align:middle line:84%
And the boys noticed, OK, who's
this 13-year-old kid, right?

00:07:47.514 --> 00:07:48.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Well, that's funny.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.830 align:middle line:84%
When we launched the
first one and my mother

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.650 align:middle line:84%
was in the kitchen, and
everything in the kitchen

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:55.670 align:middle line:90%
starts moving.

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:58.097 align:middle line:84%
And that's called the
rockets going off.

00:07:58.097 --> 00:07:59.180 align:middle line:90%
And she comes running out.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.555 align:middle line:84%
And last time she
saw my friends,

00:08:00.555 --> 00:08:02.830 align:middle line:84%
they were down there
by the launchpad.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And when I actually launched,
they were behind me.

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And she said,
where's your friends?

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And I turned around
to look at them,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.670 align:middle line:90%
they're gone like Bugs Bunny.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:11.470 align:middle line:90%

ahead for a second, David.

to your involvement

remarkable interview.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.220 align:middle line:10%
He said that he'd worked
out in the Nevada desert

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:45.150 align:middle line:10%
at a top-secret facility
known as Area 51.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.820 align:middle line:10%

highly classified project,

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:59.420 align:middle line:10%
His story was a
worldwide sensation,

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:05.170 align:middle line:10%
and Area 51 became a household
name, synonymous with UFOs,

little green men.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.800 align:middle line:10%
And yet, neither the US
government nor its military

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.280 align:middle line:10%
have ever denied his claims.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.450 align:middle line:10%
And they still don't
officially confirm

that Area 51 exists,
despite satellite photos

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:23.730 align:middle line:10%

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:51.820 align:middle line:84%
Bob Lazar walked into
his television station.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.910 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of Area 51?

>>ADAIR: It's still
a mystery to me.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:01.300 align:middle line:84%
My exposure was this very
contained in one day,

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.190 align:middle line:84%
but I saw enough
in one day to know

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:07.810 align:middle line:84%
that this has been an
ongoing operation with plans

When we come into
land, the runaways

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:17.860 align:middle line:84%
were marked out with flags,
and chalk lines, and all that.

they were getting

ready to build a lot of--

>>NOORY: Had the story
about UFOs and things

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.720 align:middle line:90%
really popped by that time?

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Not much.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:40.094 align:middle line:84%

term "Area 51" not until--

00:10:40.094 --> 00:10:41.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hardly anybody did.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.485 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I knew
it by was Groom Lake,

00:10:44.485 --> 00:10:46.690 align:middle line:90%
and it was a dry lake bed.

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:50.689 align:middle line:84%
And I even had an argument
with Arthur Rudolph over that.

00:10:50.689 --> 00:10:52.480 align:middle line:84%
I said, why are we
going to a dry lake bed?

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.780 align:middle line:90%
Look at the jet you're on.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:54.820 align:middle line:90%

up and get on the plane.

want you there for?

brought me there

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.820 align:middle line:84%
to see a piece of hardware
they were working on,

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.820 align:middle line:84%
and it was an electromagnetic
fusion containment engine.

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was made by us?

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: No.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:17.664 align:middle line:84%
And I know it wasn't,
because I'd just

00:11:17.664 --> 00:11:18.955 align:middle line:90%
got through building my my own.

it was not from our
technological base.

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:25.200 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't ours.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.370 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't theirs,
meaning the Soviets.

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:29.800 align:middle line:84%
It was from some--
it was off-world.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And the most telltale
thing about it

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.350 align:middle line:90%
was the way it was constructed.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Mine was about 3
and 1/2 feet long,

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.090 align:middle line:90%
about 18 inches in diameter.

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:42.550 align:middle line:84%
But this thing, when they
pulled the curtain up on it,

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:46.990 align:middle line:84%
it's sitting on the stage, it's
the same size of an 18-wheeler.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: They're very
condescending to a 17-year-old.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 14 years
before that was Roswell.

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:04.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Exactly.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And I said, where did
you guys get this?

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:11.050 align:middle line:84%
You want me to help you with
it, it's got a big damaged area,

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:12.530 align:middle line:90%
and it's not running.

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:15.110 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, we're
working on it, but--

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, where's the
people working on it?

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, they're
on summer vacation,

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.181 align:middle line:90%
like you get summer vacation.

00:12:20.181 --> 00:12:21.430 align:middle line:90%
Well, did you leave any notes?

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.990 align:middle line:90%
Can I read?

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, well, they have
homework like you do, son.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.540 align:middle line:84%
They take their
homework with them.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And I knew right then they're
lying through their teeth.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:29.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.040 align:middle line:90%
What was your job?

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.780 align:middle line:90%
What did they want you to do?

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: They wanted me to show
them how the first ignition

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:37.590 align:middle line:90%
process occurred--

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of this
piece of machinery?

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:40.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, and--

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you know?

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I had a better
handle on it than they did,

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:45.701 align:middle line:84%
cause I'd just gotten
through building one,

00:12:45.701 --> 00:12:48.370 align:middle line:90%
although mine was small.

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:51.415 align:middle line:84%
But it's like if you're building
an internal combustion engine

00:12:51.415 --> 00:12:52.780 align:middle line:90%
and you have a Model A engine.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.130 align:middle line:90%
That's what mine was.

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And then you have a big
Lamborghini engine next to it.

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:00.220 align:middle line:84%
One is way more sophisticated
and more powerful--

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:00.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Night and day.

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: --but they both
still are internal combustion

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:02.830 align:middle line:90%
engines.

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So mine is an
electromagnetic fusion

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:07.410 align:middle line:84%
containment device,
and so was theirs.

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:09.430 align:middle line:84%
But theirs was so
much more powerful.

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:11.129 align:middle line:90%
And I was just--

00:13:11.129 --> 00:13:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, when
you say "theirs",

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:14.350 align:middle line:90%
it really wasn't theirs, right?

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:14.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:15.860 align:middle line:90%
Well, wherever it came from.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wherever it came from.

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:17.373 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: And I asked them.

00:13:17.373 --> 00:13:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I said-- at the end,
after I got to inspect it,

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.880 align:middle line:90%
we got into an argument.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
started asking things.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And I said, this is not from
the neighborhood, is it, boys?

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And seeing a
17-year-old, they didn't

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.620 align:middle line:84%
think I'd be putting it
together so quick in my head.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And I said this thing
is a power plant.

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:43.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- it's more than an
engine, it's a power plant,

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:45.057 align:middle line:90%
and it came out of a vehicle.

00:13:45.057 --> 00:13:45.890 align:middle line:90%
Where's the vehicle?

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:46.300 align:middle line:90%


00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:46.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And in
proportion to size--

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.273 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You were getting close.

00:13:49.273 --> 00:13:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, and
the proportional size,

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:55.094 align:middle line:84%
that ship would have to be
bigger than a football field.

00:13:55.094 --> 00:13:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And I said, there's a
crew that comes with it.

00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:58.660 align:middle line:84%
What did you do
with them people?

00:13:58.660 --> 00:13:59.460 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.126 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were asking way too
many questions for them, right?

00:14:02.126 --> 00:14:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I was--
yeah, I got in trouble

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.310 align:middle line:90%
the second we went down there.

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And you could see this
cavernous underground.

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:11.410 align:middle line:84%
It stretched so far that
it bent with the curvature

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:12.370 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:13.170 align:middle line:90%
That's how big--

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:13.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: You couldn't
see the end of it.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And my first question
out of my mouth

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.640 align:middle line:84%
was, what did you guys
do with all the dirt?

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And they got so
angry about that.

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
well, why would you

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.660 align:middle line:90%
get angry about asking what--

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.340 align:middle line:84%
you guys are packing some
kind of technology down here.

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.655 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Didn't they expect
you to ask these questions?

00:14:29.655 --> 00:14:30.425 align:middle line:90%
My gosh.

00:14:30.425 --> 00:14:31.925 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: They
thought-- well, you've

00:14:31.925 --> 00:14:33.750 align:middle line:84%
got to remember our
society structure.

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:38.150 align:middle line:84%
In 1971, teenagers just
didn't get any respect.

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:41.054 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, teenagers
weren't called down to Area 51

00:14:41.054 --> 00:14:42.470 align:middle line:84%
to analyze some
UFO engine, right?

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.575 align:middle line:90%


00:14:42.575 --> 00:14:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Well, that's true.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, they didn't-- well,
you know what it was?

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.880 align:middle line:90%
They were in a hurry.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.380 align:middle line:90%
They had a problem.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:52.430 align:middle line:84%
They were racing to something
called First Strike,

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.540 align:middle line:84%
and I'd never heard
of that before.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.679 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, is this
some kind of baseball game?

00:14:56.679 --> 00:14:57.970 align:middle line:90%
And then as they kept talking--

00:14:57.970 --> 00:14:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I wish it were.

00:14:59.070 --> 00:14:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Then when they-- yeah, after I
heard him use the term "MAD",

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.240 align:middle line:84%
I knew what that was,
Mutual Assured Destruction.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:05.690 align:middle line:90%


00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And I went, oh god,
they're trying to win MAD.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.570 align:middle line:84%
The only way to win MAD
would be first strike.

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And I went, oh man, I just gave
them an operating prototype

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.570 align:middle line:84%
up on a desert floor
that just landed there,

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:22.350 align:middle line:84%
and my engine, my
rocket, is not designed

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:26.340 align:middle line:84%
for a launch in this atmosphere,
in this gravity field.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they able, David,
to ever duplicate that engine?

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:29.620 align:middle line:90%


00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:29.885 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: No.

00:15:29.885 --> 00:15:31.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were
never able to do it.

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And where do you
think it is today?

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.080 align:middle line:90%
Still there?

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:34.790 align:middle line:90%


00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I think
it's still there,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.570 align:middle line:84%
because you just can't move
something around like that

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:39.569 align:middle line:90%
without people noticing.

00:15:39.569 --> 00:15:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How big do
you estimate the craft

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.110 align:middle line:84%
to be that that piece
of machinery was in?

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:44.910 align:middle line:90%


00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:46.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Bigger than
a football field.

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:48.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and we
do get reports of that.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:49.048 align:middle line:90%


00:15:49.048 --> 00:15:50.131 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: That's something.

00:15:50.131 --> 00:15:51.870 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, whenever I
hear triangle reports

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:54.810 align:middle line:84%
of what they call
"motherships" and stuff,

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:56.280 align:middle line:90%
yeah, I think I saw one of them.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:59.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it look like
it was made with technology

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:00.000 align:middle line:90%
that we possessed?

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:00.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: No.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, were
there bolts in there

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:01.950 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that?

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:02.040 align:middle line:90%


00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:02.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: No.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.720 align:middle line:84%
That's what-- that
was the telltale sign.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:10.050 align:middle line:84%
On mine, I had miles of the
wiring, nuts and bolts--

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:10.973 align:middle line:90%


00:16:10.973 --> 00:16:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: --weld
lines, seal lines.

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Solder
points, everything.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Exactly, all this.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And on this thing, as big
as it was, not one wire.

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:20.460 align:middle line:90%
Not one bolt. Not one nut.

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:21.720 align:middle line:90%
Not one weld line.

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.370 align:middle line:90%
Not a seam anywhere.

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:25.680 align:middle line:84%
It looked like an
eggplant that just grew.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I started
realizing, this thing is more--

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:30.810 align:middle line:90%
it's not a machine.

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:33.810 align:middle line:84%
It looks like it's organic,
but yet it is a machine.

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:34.610 align:middle line:90%
It's both.

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.710 align:middle line:84%
It's inorganic and
organic at the same time.

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.650 align:middle line:84%
You have been a
champion for fighting

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:42.210 align:middle line:90%
to protect our power grid.

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.080 align:middle line:84%
You've been doing
this for years.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.530 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about
the various things you've

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:49.500 align:middle line:84%
been doing to try to
get that grid protected.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.880 align:middle line:84%
But there are a
couple of sources

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.740 align:middle line:84%
that could knock the
grid down, and that

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:56.880 align:middle line:84%
would be either a solar
flare or CME from the sun,

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.790 align:middle line:84%
or an EMP attack,
a nuke, detonated

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:02.430 align:middle line:84%
in the atmosphere that would
sprinkle down and wipe out

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:03.540 align:middle line:90%
the power grid as well.

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Right.

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:06.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about
solar flares, first of all.

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And we have avoided and dodged
some of them in the past.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:11.520 align:middle line:90%
We've been lucky.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.320 align:middle line:90%


00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.089 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Just-- we've
been incredibly lucky.

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:18.780 align:middle line:84%
We should go to a lottery,
because you'll probably win,

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:20.819 align:middle line:90%
you've been so lucky.

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:24.250 align:middle line:84%
The thing with the CMEs,
the Coronal Mass Ejection--

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:28.380 align:middle line:84%
think of on a hot day, you take
your hand against your forehead

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.980 align:middle line:84%
and you wipe the sweat off,
and sling it off your hand,

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.580 align:middle line:84%
and you see the
little beads of sweat.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:33.135 align:middle line:90%


00:17:33.135 --> 00:17:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, that's
exactly what the sun's doing.

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:36.344 align:middle line:84%
It's throwing off
beads of sweat,

00:17:36.344 --> 00:17:38.010 align:middle line:84%
but these beads are
a little bit bigger.

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:38.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh yeah.

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:38.700 align:middle line:90%


00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: They are this
size and mass of Mt.

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:41.970 align:middle line:90%
Everest.

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:45.810 align:middle line:84%
They are highly-charged
plasma ball,

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:49.950 align:middle line:84%
and it's moving at
just below light speed.

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:52.655 align:middle line:84%
It will cover 93 million
miles in eight hours.

00:17:52.655 --> 00:17:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's how long
it would take to get here?

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:55.030 align:middle line:90%


00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:56.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Right, 8 to 12
hours, depending on orbit.

00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:58.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It doesn't
kill people directly--

00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:58.505 align:middle line:90%


00:17:58.505 --> 00:17:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: No.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --but it
takes out the grid.

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Right.

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:02.492 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The electrical
systems, computers.

00:18:02.492 --> 00:18:03.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR:

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Anything
that's powered up.

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:05.210 align:middle line:90%


00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:07.851 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: We were hit by one in
September 1869, called the--

00:18:07.851 --> 00:18:09.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Carrington Event.

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:09.255 align:middle line:90%


00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: The Carrington Event.

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.289 align:middle line:90%
And it did tear up the--

00:18:12.289 --> 00:18:13.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The telegraph
system, right?

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.905 align:middle line:90%


00:18:13.905 --> 00:18:15.571 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, but
also something else--

00:18:15.571 --> 00:18:18.061 align:middle line:84%
the Trans-Atlantic Ocean
Cable, knocked it out.

00:18:18.061 --> 00:18:19.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That got fried.

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And I was also told
that the railroad--

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:27.090 align:middle line:84%
metal ties on the
railroad got fried,

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:29.430 align:middle line:84%
and people could see
them actually crackling.

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.514 align:middle line:90%


00:18:29.514 --> 00:18:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, it was a--
well, it would make sense.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.520 align:middle line:90%
That's a terrific ground an--

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's like an antenna.

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:34.920 align:middle line:90%


00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.390 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, exactly, which--

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:39.510 align:middle line:90%


00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:43.920 align:middle line:84%
there's something about
that concerning UFOs.

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we can't contain
the solar flare from the sun.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:52.230 align:middle line:84%
If we are directly
in-line with the sun,

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:56.430 align:middle line:84%
and an X flare, which is a big
one, comes out of that sun,

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:57.450 align:middle line:90%
it's going to hit us.

00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:57.550 align:middle line:90%


00:18:57.550 --> 00:18:58.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Oh, it will.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
saying within 8 hours

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:02.160 align:middle line:90%
it starts to affect me?

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:05.935 align:middle line:84%
What about satellites that are
up there, and they get hit too?

00:19:05.935 --> 00:19:06.735 align:middle line:90%


00:19:06.735 --> 00:19:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: They're
toast, unless they're

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Echo A and B.
Those are satellite

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:15.150 align:middle line:90%
designed to be hit by CMEs.

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And on July 23, 2012, type that
computer and read up on that,

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:24.270 align:middle line:90%
we almost died that day.

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:25.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nobody knew it, right?

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:25.695 align:middle line:90%


00:19:25.695 --> 00:19:27.736 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yep, and they
didn't say a word about it

00:19:27.736 --> 00:19:28.620 align:middle line:90%
for two years.

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:31.530 align:middle line:84%
The story was not released
by media or the government

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:33.630 align:middle line:90%
till two years later.

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There is a
difference between CMEs,

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.945 align:middle line:84%
Coronal Mass Ejections,
and solar flares, right?

00:19:38.945 --> 00:19:39.100 align:middle line:90%


00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:39.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yes.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.678 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look.

00:19:41.678 --> 00:19:49.662 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:49.662 --> 00:21:15.590 align:middle line:90%


00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:18.320 align:middle line:84%
David, that video was
provided to us by NASA.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And considering the technology
we have on this planet today,

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:25.250 align:middle line:84%
we've been pretty darn
lucky that we really

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:26.210 align:middle line:90%
haven't been zapped.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:26.795 align:middle line:90%


00:21:26.795 --> 00:21:27.595 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:21:27.595 --> 00:21:30.200 align:middle line:90%
On July 23, we should have died.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.445 align:middle line:84%
If we had been just out of
place by just a fraction of a--

00:21:33.445 --> 00:21:35.945 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because it went out
the side of the sun, didn't it?

00:21:35.945 --> 00:21:36.012 align:middle line:90%


00:21:36.012 --> 00:21:38.012 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, well there
were not one, not two,

00:21:38.012 --> 00:21:39.360 align:middle line:90%
but three CME balls.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:43.130 align:middle line:84%
The size of each one of
them, the size of Carrington,

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:48.290 align:middle line:84%
came at us on July 23, 2012,
crossed 93 million miles

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:51.140 align:middle line:84%
in 8 and 1/2 hours,
and passed so

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:54.010 align:middle line:84%
close they passed
between us and the moon.

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:56.270 align:middle line:84%
They were only
110,000 miles away.

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:58.645 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just a little bit
more and we would've been hit.

00:21:58.645 --> 00:21:59.444 align:middle line:90%


00:21:59.444 --> 00:22:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: If they showed
up one day earlier,

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:02.780 align:middle line:90%
we'd have been hit dead-center.

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:04.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The alignment
was right then, wasn't it?

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:04.670 align:middle line:90%


00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:05.989 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, and it--

00:22:05.989 --> 00:22:07.530 align:middle line:84%
those three hitting
us, the first one

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:12.000 align:middle line:84%
would have stripped away the
Van Allen radiation belts.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.890 align:middle line:84%
Then the other two would
have come in and cascaded

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:21.020 align:middle line:84%
over the surface of the Earth,
and everything would have went.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.060 align:middle line:90%
That much power coming in--

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.280 align:middle line:84%
a normal power line
in your neighborhood

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.410 align:middle line:90%
cares about 5,500 volts.

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:27.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:28.010 align:middle line:90%


00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: These things would
drop 3.2 million volts

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:31.940 align:middle line:90%
into the lines.

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:32.225 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fried.

00:22:32.225 --> 00:22:33.215 align:middle line:90%
They'd all be fried.

00:22:33.215 --> 00:22:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: It's worse than fried.

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:37.100 align:middle line:84%
They'll turn red,
then white, and then--

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:38.150 align:middle line:90%
they're gone.

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:41.480 align:middle line:84%
But before they go, that
gray canisters on the poles,

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.420 align:middle line:84%
the transformers,
they're filled with oil,

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:48.140 align:middle line:84%
and they use the oil
to dissipate the heat.

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:50.970 align:middle line:84%
But with that much surge coming
in, that oil turns into napalm.

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:51.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, Gees.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:51.875 align:middle line:90%


00:22:51.875 --> 00:22:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So imagine
every transformer

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:56.650 align:middle line:84%
in the United States all
exploding simultaneously.

00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:58.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did we get
any warning at all

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:00.270 align:middle line:90%
beyond the six to eight hours?

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:00.750 align:middle line:90%


00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:01.550 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: No.

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We don't?

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:02.225 align:middle line:90%


00:23:02.225 --> 00:23:03.025 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: No.

00:23:03.025 --> 00:23:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So we can't tell
right now that a coronal mass

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:10.880 align:middle line:84%
ejection is brewing on the
sun, and is about to spout?

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:11.680 align:middle line:90%
It has to happen?

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:11.995 align:middle line:90%


00:23:11.995 --> 00:23:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It has to happen, and
then you can start tracking it.

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:19.830 align:middle line:84%
Then the satellites Echo
1 and 2, or A and B,

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:23.430 align:middle line:84%
will start giving an idea
of trajectories and such.

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:25.450 align:middle line:84%
They even have a-- you'd
have enough heads-up

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:28.670 align:middle line:84%
to do a few things,
but not much.

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:31.230 align:middle line:84%
It's just whenever mother
nature feels like it.

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not a matter of
if, it's just a matter of when,

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:35.270 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:36.070 align:middle line:90%


00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:38.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Absolutely,
And we're way overdue.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.540 align:middle line:84%
We've got another
Carrington Event coming,

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:43.230 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know
why we didn't get--

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does the
planet get hit, or maybe

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:46.475 align:middle line:90%
that portion of the planet?

00:23:46.475 --> 00:23:46.970 align:middle line:90%


00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:47.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: No.

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:47.800 align:middle line:90%
When it comes in--

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:49.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's say India was
facing the sun at that point.

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:49.951 align:middle line:90%


00:23:49.951 --> 00:23:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Doesn't matter.

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:55.220 align:middle line:84%
It'll come in, it'll strike
the Van Allen radiation belts.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Normally, the balls
split in half.

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:00.686 align:middle line:84%
They come around to the
back side, they collide,

00:24:00.686 --> 00:24:02.810 align:middle line:84%
then they come down through
the Earth's atmosphere.

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:04.530 align:middle line:84%
They'll come through
the ionosphere,

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:06.440 align:middle line:90%
the stratosphere, mesosphere.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Once they get to
the troposphere,

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:10.259 align:middle line:84%
they're starting to cascade
all over the planet.

00:24:10.259 --> 00:24:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it stays
that way for a while?

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:12.235 align:middle line:90%


00:24:12.235 --> 00:24:13.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:16.040 align:middle line:84%
When the Carrington
Event happened,

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:20.000 align:middle line:84%
that night in New York
City, the Aurora Borealis

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.520 align:middle line:84%
was charred so hot that it went
all the way to the Equator.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.207 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's that light glow
people see in the sky, right?

00:24:25.207 --> 00:24:25.637 align:middle line:90%


00:24:25.637 --> 00:24:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Exactly, the
green Northern Lights.

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:27.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:28.510 align:middle line:90%


00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: That thing was
charged, people in New York

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.490 align:middle line:84%
could read the newspaper at 3
o'clock in the morning by it.

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:35.585 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:24:35.585 --> 00:24:35.907 align:middle line:90%


00:24:35.907 --> 00:24:36.865 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, that's--

00:24:36.865 --> 00:24:38.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they estimate,
David, that some 90%

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.880 align:middle line:84%
of just Americans could
be dead within a year

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.452 align:middle line:90%
if the power grid goes down.

00:24:43.452 --> 00:24:44.535 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Absolutely, and--

00:24:44.535 --> 00:24:46.792 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's frightening!

00:24:46.792 --> 00:24:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I can give
you a day 1 scenario.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.870 align:middle line:84%
One day is enough to
scare you to death.

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:54.390 align:middle line:90%
Just in the first 30 seconds--

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:58.082 align:middle line:84%
let's say you're walking down
a crowded street with people,

00:24:58.082 --> 00:24:59.540 align:middle line:84%
and you're pushing
a baby stroller.

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:03.800 align:middle line:84%
You've got your baby out for a
nice day, and you see a flash.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.780 align:middle line:90%
And this could be just an EMP.

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:06.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: What will happen is
all the transformers explode.

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's covered
in napalm, burning.

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:14.300 align:middle line:90%
You're on fire.

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:15.164 align:middle line:90%
Your baby's on fire.

00:25:15.164 --> 00:25:17.580 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's on fire, running
through the streets screaming

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:20.210 align:middle line:84%
and hollering, don't
know what's happening.

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:21.770 align:middle line:90%
You call for help.

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:23.300 align:middle line:90%
No cell phones.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:24.560 align:middle line:90%
No satellites.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:27.260 align:middle line:84%
No satellite phones,
no landlines,

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:28.940 align:middle line:90%
no communication of any kind.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing.

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:32.270 align:middle line:84%
No ATMs, no gasoline
pumps, nothing.

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Wall
Street is shut down.

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:34.940 align:middle line:90%
There's no money.

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your water plants
that feed us water to our homes

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:39.590 align:middle line:90%
won't be able to pump.

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:44.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Oh, and 20 seconds
after the initial hit,

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:46.880 align:middle line:84%
here comes a half million
people at any one time

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.192 align:middle line:90%
in the sky flying.

00:25:48.192 --> 00:25:49.400 align:middle line:90%
All the Jets are coming down.

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They just
drop right out?

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yep.

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:51.340 align:middle line:90%
They--

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh!

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:52.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: They land on hospitals.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.053 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just my luck to be on a
plane that time, I fly so much.

00:25:55.053 --> 00:25:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, you might be
lucky, you won't be around to--

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.288 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'll be cursing you.

00:25:58.288 --> 00:25:59.254 align:middle line:90%
God, you Adair!

00:25:59.254 --> 00:26:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Ah, but
you're going to get out

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:04.654 align:middle line:84%
of the worst part, because
all of this burning and mayhem

00:26:04.654 --> 00:26:06.320 align:middle line:84%
is going on, and you
can't call anybody.

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:08.832 align:middle line:90%
No first responders, no police--

00:26:08.832 --> 00:26:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Riots are going
to be in the streets--

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:11.195 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: --no National Guard.

00:26:11.195 --> 00:26:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --you know that.

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Oh, yeah.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:13.525 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Chaos, everything.

00:26:13.525 --> 00:26:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Oh, there'll
be a run on everything.

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:19.590 align:middle line:84%
The hospitals, they have 72
hours of emergency diesel

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:22.410 align:middle line:90%
fuel for the power generators.

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:24.720 align:middle line:84%
But when that runs
out, there's nothing.

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:25.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: God.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.550 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: And It won't matter.

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:28.260 align:middle line:84%
All the doctors and
nurses already left.

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:30.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this
a planet killer?

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:31.571 align:middle line:90%
One of-- if we get hit--

00:26:31.571 --> 00:26:32.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:33.360 align:middle line:90%
Actually, it would be.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.250 align:middle line:90%
It would be a series of events.

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:36.981 align:middle line:84%
Because, see, that
much burning is

00:26:36.981 --> 00:26:38.480 align:middle line:84%
going to throw up
enough smoke where

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.810 align:middle line:90%
you get a nuclear winter, and--

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:40.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:41.840 align:middle line:90%
Crops die, everything goes.

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.798 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: --the sun's
blocked out for two years.

00:26:43.798 --> 00:26:46.680 align:middle line:84%
All vegetation dies,
all plant life dies.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.300 align:middle line:90%
We're going with it.

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.600 align:middle line:90%
Everybody dies.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.121 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
saying this is fixable?

00:26:52.121 --> 00:26:53.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: It's totally fixable.

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:55.430 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
go through this.

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:58.740 align:middle line:84%
If you get the SHIELD
Act passed, you will--

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.240 align:middle line:90%
and how much will it cost you?

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.590 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:02.820 align:middle line:90%
It's already in the budget.

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why don't the
electrical companies,

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:08.190 align:middle line:84%
and companies like
Amazon, everybody

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:12.356 align:middle line:84%
who survives on
electronics, why don't they

00:27:12.356 --> 00:27:14.230 align:middle line:84%
come up with the money--
which is just, what?

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:15.430 align:middle line:84%
What was the estimate,
$2 to $3 billion?

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:16.245 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: $10 billion.

00:27:16.245 --> 00:27:17.045 align:middle line:90%
$10 billion.

00:27:17.045 --> 00:27:17.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: $10 billion.

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:19.260 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: And the first $2--

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chump change,
for what we spend.

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: It really is.

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.031 align:middle line:84%
And the first two $2
billion would go right

00:27:23.031 --> 00:27:24.360 align:middle line:90%
into the hardware.

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.045 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you have
old technology, 50 years old,

00:27:27.045 --> 00:27:28.170 align:middle line:90%
that we know that's worked.

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Diverters, surge protectors,
capacitors, Faraday cages.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.680 align:middle line:84%
All this stuff will
go in, and all of that

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.240 align:middle line:90%
costs you $2 billion.

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.385 align:middle line:84%
We send $2 billion
every year to Pakistan.

00:27:38.385 --> 00:27:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:40.650 align:middle line:90%
This is crazy.

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:41.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: It is crazy.

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, let's back
to the CMEs for a second.

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:43.115 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Sure.

00:27:43.115 --> 00:27:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I want
to talk about EMPs.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:48.640 align:middle line:84%
The CMEs, then, these coronal
mass ejections from the sun.

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Right.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The solar
flares are from the sun.

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.610 align:middle line:84%
What's really the difference
between the two of them?

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:58.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, one is
visually put in your head.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.230 align:middle line:90%
One is just a big plasma ball.

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:04.720 align:middle line:84%
The other one is a stream of
energy, of matter, coming out.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And it tries to
stretch out towards Earth,

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:11.175 align:middle line:84%
but the gravity field of
the sun is so intense,

00:28:11.175 --> 00:28:13.620 align:middle line:84%
it pulls that back and it
makes that circle that you

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:15.190 align:middle line:90%
see, a loop coming off the sun.

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mhm.

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:18.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And we call
the a "prominence."

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:20.850 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to
imagine how big this is.

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:24.105 align:middle line:84%
You could push 100
Earths through the loop.

00:28:24.105 --> 00:28:24.980 align:middle line:90%
That's how big this--

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:25.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: The power is
almost unimaginable that's

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:31.080 align:middle line:90%
involved in the solar flares.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.703 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, with the gravity
field as strong as it is,

00:28:33.703 --> 00:28:35.250 align:middle line:90%
it pulls it back.

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Because if that
thing could whip out,

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:39.750 align:middle line:90%
it'd whip all the way to Earth.

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And if a solar flare would
hit Earth directly head-on,

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:47.100 align:middle line:84%
it'd be as bad as
a gamma ray burst.

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that
will happen one day.

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:49.750 align:middle line:90%
One day.

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:50.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Soon.

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:50.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, one day.

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:50.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:52.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hopefully--
we've been hit before,

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.453 align:middle line:90%
but they've been smaller, right?

00:28:53.453 --> 00:28:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yes, very small.

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:56.193 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We've been lucky there.

00:28:56.193 --> 00:28:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And our planet,
which not every planet has it,

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:01.980 align:middle line:84%
but our planet has
a radiation belt.

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:06.540 align:middle line:84%
It's got multiple layers of
atmosphere, and it protects us.

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:09.945 align:middle line:84%
And we're just the right
distance away from the sun

00:29:09.945 --> 00:29:11.280 align:middle line:90%
to withstand this.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:16.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, an EMP, and
Electromagnetic Pulse,

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:19.630 align:middle line:84%
is from a nuke detonated
in the atmosphere.

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:20.430 align:middle line:90%
Correct?

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:21.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Correct.

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:25.830 align:middle line:84%
When the cyclotrons are
spinning on the nuclear weapon

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:29.280 align:middle line:84%
and they detonate, they send
down an electromagnetic pulse

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.420 align:middle line:90%
wave.

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's the thing
does all the damage.

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:33.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:33.840 align:middle line:90%
Frightening.

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.256 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: The way
we found out-- we

00:29:35.256 --> 00:29:38.880 align:middle line:10%
didn't know anything about
an EMP until Project Orange.

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:42.660 align:middle line:10%
That's when we fired missiles
off the back of a ship

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.640 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of
the Pacific, and we

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.880 align:middle line:10%
detonated nuclear weapons
in space at night.

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what happened?

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: We knocked out
the entire Indonesian

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:53.606 align:middle line:90%
coast of power.

00:29:53.606 --> 00:29:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We did that?

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.500 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: We did that, and--

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:56.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We kept that quiet.

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:58.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: We sure did,
because we didn't know we

00:29:58.620 --> 00:29:59.828 align:middle line:90%
didn't know if we did or not.

00:29:59.828 --> 00:30:02.280 align:middle line:84%
People went, were we
responsible for that?

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they
found out that--

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:04.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what happens.

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:05.686 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: --there's EMPs
coming off the thing.

00:30:05.686 --> 00:30:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a
trickle-down effect.

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Former Speaker of the
House Newt Gingrich,

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.040 align:middle line:84%
which I think you presented
some information to--

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --was a
proponent on trying to get

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:16.170 align:middle line:90%
this thing taken care of.

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:17.736 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yes.

00:30:17.736 --> 00:30:19.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Newt Gingrich!

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Asked during the debate to
name the security threats that

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:25.600 align:middle line:10%
worry him, Newt Gingrich
lays out three scenarios.

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.930 align:middle line:10%
A weapon of mass destruction
in an American city, a cyber

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:31.177 align:middle line:10%
attack, and something
many have never heard of.

00:30:31.177 --> 00:30:33.010 align:middle line:10%
>>NEWT GINGRICH:
Electromotive pulse attack,

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:35.230 align:middle line:10%
which would literally destroy
the country's capacity

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:36.030 align:middle line:10%
to function.

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:38.980 align:middle line:10%
>> An Electromagnetic
Pulse Attack, or EMP.

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:43.660 align:middle line:10%
It's been the stuff of
fiction on the Fox show 24

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:46.750 align:middle line:10%
but it's also a real threat
experts say it likely

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:49.660 align:middle line:10%
wouldn't look like that
EMP attack, they say,

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:52.870 align:middle line:10%
is an intense burst of
electromagnetic radiation.

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:55.300 align:middle line:10%
It can be triggered by
detonating a nuclear weapon

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:56.800 align:middle line:10%
at high altitude.

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:59.020 align:middle line:84%
A weapon that could be
launched by a rogue nation,

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:01.630 align:middle line:84%
or a terrorist group
with access to it.

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:03.970 align:middle line:10%
Detonated low to the
ground, atomic weapons

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:06.100 align:middle line:10%
have a devastating
physical shock.

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:08.380 align:middle line:10%
But detonated miles
up in the atmosphere,

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:11.380 align:middle line:10%
experts say the main
impact is electrical.

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:13.510 align:middle line:10%
Energy that doesn't
kill people, but spreads

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:17.020 align:middle line:10%
like lightning, striking any
electrical grid or circuitry.

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:19.270 align:middle line:10%
Feeding into them,
burning them out.

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:21.070 align:middle line:10%
Whole cities could go dark.

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:25.180 align:middle line:10%
Security analyst James Carafano
has written about EMP attacks.

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:27.100 align:middle line:10%
In one single event,
what could be disabled?

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.010 align:middle line:10%
>> JAMES CARAFANO: If you
had a large-scale EMP event

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:31.862 align:middle line:10%
in the United
States, you would--

00:31:31.862 --> 00:31:33.070 align:middle line:10%
everything would be disabled.

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:35.950 align:middle line:10%
Because even things that
weren't knocked out-- let's

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:38.677 align:middle line:10%
say your car, which might be OK.

00:31:38.677 --> 00:31:40.510 align:middle line:10%
But the electrical grid
is going to be gone.

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:42.730 align:middle line:10%
There's going to be no
way to do traffic lights.

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:45.640 align:middle line:10%
There's going to be
no way to land ships.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.750 align:middle line:10%
There's no way to get
fuel to the gas stations

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:48.550 align:middle line:10%
to refill your car.

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:50.200 align:middle line:10%
And if you got them there,
the gas pumps wouldn't work.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Think of this fictional
attack in the movie

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:53.530 align:middle line:10%
"Ocean's 11".

00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:56.780 align:middle line:10%
[EXPLOSION]

00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:59.180 align:middle line:10%
We demonstrated
electromagnetic interference

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:01.670 align:middle line:10%
on a much smaller,
less-threatening scale

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:03.560 align:middle line:10%
at the University
of Maryland, showing

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:06.260 align:middle line:10%
how magnetic fields from
some electronic devices

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:08.470 align:middle line:10%
often interfere
with other devices.

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:10.070 align:middle line:10%
>> You hear this
ringing behind me?

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:11.960 align:middle line:10%
We're showing you what
electromagnetic interference

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:12.760 align:middle line:10%
is.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:14.195 align:middle line:10%
Say this television is a car.

00:32:14.195 --> 00:32:17.065 align:middle line:10%
A car's function is
rolling along normally.

00:32:17.065 --> 00:32:18.890 align:middle line:10%
Here's a cell phone ringing.

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:20.390 align:middle line:10%
When it gets close
to that, you can

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:23.360 align:middle line:10%
see how the audio of the
television signal changes.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.160 align:middle line:10%
You can hear the interference.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.170 align:middle line:10%
That's essentially--
it's interfering

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:28.610 align:middle line:10%
with the car's function.

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:30.930 align:middle line:10%
>> But with a
large-scale EMP attack,

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:32.990 align:middle line:10%
experts say
computers would fail.

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:34.910 align:middle line:10%
Telecommunications cut off.

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:36.980 align:middle line:90%
Bank accounts inaccessible.

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:39.230 align:middle line:84%
They say that's because
the transformers that power

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:41.300 align:middle line:84%
many electrical grids
take a long time

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:43.310 align:middle line:90%
to manufacture and transport.

00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:45.830 align:middle line:10%
And with transportation
knocked down by the attack,

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:47.810 align:middle line:10%
that prolongs the isolation.

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:49.775 align:middle line:90%
Brian Todd, CNN, Washington.

00:32:49.775 --> 00:32:51.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a great analogy.

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Is that one of the
reasons why, by the way,

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:55.610 align:middle line:84%
they want our cell phones turned
off when we're on a plane,

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:56.610 align:middle line:90%
because of interference?

00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yes, interference
with communications.

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:02.877 align:middle line:84%
And think how many people you've
got in the tube of the plane.

00:33:02.877 --> 00:33:03.710 align:middle line:90%
There's 100 people--

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: 100 cell phones
concentrated like that.

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:06.890 align:middle line:90%
It--

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:07.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Radiating like crazy.

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:08.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Right.

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:11.360 align:middle line:84%
They've been able to
compensate some of that now,

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.910 align:middle line:84%
but still, it's very
unwise to have a cell

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:15.260 align:middle line:90%
phone on inside a plane.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:16.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So one of
the reasons we're

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.740 align:middle line:84%
concerned with North
Korea, for example,

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:22.670 align:middle line:84%
is because maybe they don't
have the capability of hitting

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:25.490 align:middle line:84%
the mainland of the
United States with a nuke,

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:27.490 align:middle line:84%
but they surely can hit
it up in the atmosphere.

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well then, you'd
better look at something

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:30.060 align:middle line:90%
on the internet.

00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:30.860 align:middle line:90%
Look up--

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't scare
me, now, David.

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:32.265 align:middle line:90%


00:33:32.265 --> 00:33:33.065 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: All right.

00:33:33.065 --> 00:33:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, look up-- type in "Ship
stopped at Panama Canal."

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:38.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It's a ship coming
from Cuba filled with sacks

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:46.520 align:middle line:90%
of sugar, about 50,000 tons.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And they noticed that
the captain of the ship

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:51.830 align:middle line:84%
was acting weird, and he started
to put a gun in his mouth.

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:54.410 align:middle line:84%
So they tackled him,
pulled the ship aside,

00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:55.820 align:middle line:90%
put all the sugar out.

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:57.290 align:middle line:90%
Found a false bottom.

00:33:57.290 --> 00:33:59.600 align:middle line:84%
This ship is on its
way to North Korea.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Guess what in the
bottom of the ship?

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:05.505 align:middle line:84%
Two Soviet-made surface-to-air
missiles for nuclear weapons.

00:34:05.505 --> 00:34:06.305 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh great.

00:34:06.305 --> 00:34:09.330 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: And it was going to go
to Korea, hook up with the EMP

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:10.130 align:middle line:10%
devices.

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:12.469 align:middle line:84%
And you know where the
ship goes after that?

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:13.399 align:middle line:90%
Mexico City.

00:34:13.399 --> 00:34:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And they
pull up in Mexico,

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.982 align:middle line:84%
they fire the two
missiles, and--

00:34:17.982 --> 00:34:19.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Into the atmosphere?

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.409 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: --and the EMPs.

00:34:19.409 --> 00:34:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Into the atmosphere?

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, over
top of America.

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:25.610 align:middle line:84%
They'll get over top of
maybe Missouri and Arkansas,

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:26.659 align:middle line:90%
and detonate.

00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:28.117 align:middle line:84%
They were getting
ready to do that.

00:34:28.117 --> 00:34:30.139 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's 2013 when
they found the ship,

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:30.710 align:middle line:90%
but it's on the internet.

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And they'll show you the
pictures of the missiles laying

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:34.010 align:middle line:90%
in the bottom of the ship.

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:36.399 align:middle line:84%
They're getting
ready to take us out.

00:34:36.399 --> 00:34:38.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, we've got the
same capability, of course.

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Our submarines are capable of
launching nukes, obviously--

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:42.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Right.

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and we would
probably do the same thing.

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:45.839 align:middle line:90%
Nobody wins, David.

00:34:45.839 --> 00:34:46.639 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: No, it's--

00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:47.514 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nobody wins.

00:34:47.514 --> 00:34:50.659 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Everybody's
losing, and I won't even--

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:54.440 align:middle line:84%
it's another form of M.A.D.,
Mutual Assured Destruction.

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:59.780 align:middle line:84%
But you have wild card players,
like the leader of North Korea.

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:01.400 align:middle line:84%
We're not sure what
he's going to do.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.319 align:middle line:84%
And Iran is doing
the same thing.

00:35:03.319 --> 00:35:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, same thing too.

00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:05.810 align:middle line:90%
And I've been told--

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:09.350 align:middle line:84%
I spent nine years in the Navy,
that if our submarines go out

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:12.800 align:middle line:84%
of communication for a
certain period of time,

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.250 align:middle line:90%
they have been told to launch.

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:15.050 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Right.

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:16.008 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You know what?

00:35:16.008 --> 00:35:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Because then you have to expect
that something has happened

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:21.320 align:middle line:90%
on land, we've been wiped out.

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Something's happened,
we've lost communications.

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.030 align:middle line:90%
They're told to retaliate.

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:26.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:27.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's scary.

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:28.931 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: It's terrifying.

00:35:28.931 --> 00:35:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A mistake
could ruin the planet.

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:32.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Exactly.

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:34.550 align:middle line:84%
We're lucky we-- we're so
lucky through the years

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:37.120 align:middle line:90%
we haven't done that yet.

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:40.610 align:middle line:84%
There are so many black swan
events waiting, lining up.

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:43.460 align:middle line:84%
A black swan event is
an event that occurs,

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:45.860 align:middle line:84%
and it changes
your world forever.

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:46.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: EMPs.

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: YEP.

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Electromagnetic pulse,
an attack in the atmosphere.

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:54.680 align:middle line:90%
How high up do they need to go?

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Not as high
as people think.

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Most people will
say about 300 miles.

00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:00.330 align:middle line:90%
88 miles would do it.

00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:01.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it.

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So those
two Soviet missiles,

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:05.000 align:middle line:84%
although they're from
the Cuban Missile Crisis,

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.330 align:middle line:84%
ironically, they are more
than capable of getting up

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:09.890 align:middle line:90%
high enough to do the damage.

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And one or two
missiles will shut down

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:13.380 align:middle line:90%
the entire country?

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:14.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Exactly.

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:14.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gees.

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:17.360 align:middle line:84%
Because the grid is
connected to the grid, right?

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:17.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Right.

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:19.208 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
a domino effect.

00:36:19.208 --> 00:36:22.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: There are-- there
are 900 electric co-ops.

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:24.260 align:middle line:84%
Combined together,
they make up the grid

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:26.910 align:middle line:90%
of North America, the continent.

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And they are so vulnerable
to attack, it's in--

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:36.900 align:middle line:84%
they're not only vulnerable
to an EMP attack or a CME hit,

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:40.070 align:middle line:84%
there's the physical
side of it you can

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:44.420 align:middle line:90%
attack, like commando units.

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Go to the internet
and look up Metcalf,

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:53.150 align:middle line:84%
which is the substation
of Silicon Valley.

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:56.982 align:middle line:84%
That thing with attacked
by a group of men.

00:36:56.982 --> 00:36:58.190 align:middle line:90%
And it was so sophisticated--

00:36:58.190 --> 00:37:01.331 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it a test attack?

00:37:01.331 --> 00:37:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It was a dry
run, is what is was.

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, that's
what I thought.

00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:04.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: That station
is still knocked out.

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:05.180 align:middle line:90%
It won't come back--

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:05.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Still?

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, it
won't come back--

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's been years.

00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:09.418 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It will be two
years, more, before they even

00:37:09.418 --> 00:37:10.544 align:middle line:90%
start getting the parts in.

00:37:10.544 --> 00:37:11.343 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:37:11.343 --> 00:37:12.424 align:middle line:90%
Do you know Bill Fortsen?

00:37:12.424 --> 00:37:13.840 align:middle line:84%
He's from your
neck of the woods--

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: I've heard of the name.

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:17.060 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: --and wrote a book
called "One Second After"

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:22.571 align:middle line:10%
about this very problem,
CMEs, solar flares, EMPs.

00:37:22.571 --> 00:37:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get
into the SHIELD Act

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.610 align:middle line:90%
in just a moment, David.

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:30.440 align:middle line:84%
But he tells me nobody is
doing anything about this.

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: He's right.

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:32.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:36.440 align:middle line:84%
We're going to-- we spend
billions in national defense.

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:40.670 align:middle line:84%
We spend billions on
hardware, and on ships,

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:42.410 align:middle line:90%
and on submarines.

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:44.660 align:middle line:84%
Why not spend the
$8 to $10 billion,

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:47.630 align:middle line:84%
and I think we can even
get it done for less,

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:49.415 align:middle line:90%
to protect our power grid?

00:37:49.415 --> 00:37:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It's a multitude of
reasons why it's not happening.

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:56.630 align:middle line:90%
One of them is politics.

00:37:56.630 --> 00:38:01.220 align:middle line:84%
The person that killed
the SHIELD Act twice

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:04.820 align:middle line:84%
is the chairwoman of
the Senate subcommittee

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:08.030 align:middle line:90%
on EMP and the SHIELD Act.

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:12.050 align:middle line:84%
So she killed the
act twice, and--

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:12.965 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:38:12.965 --> 00:38:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well,
after she disbanded

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:20.152 align:middle line:84%
the congressional committee
that appointed me,

00:38:20.152 --> 00:38:24.060 align:middle line:84%
I finally pandered down and
asked her off camera, why

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:25.880 align:middle line:90%
are we doing this?

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:31.520 align:middle line:84%
She never-Trumper, which
means that she's a Republican,

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.290 align:middle line:84%
but she will never
let Trump pass

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:36.330 align:middle line:84%
any legislation of any
kind while she's in office.

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:37.910 align:middle line:90%
Never mind it might kill you.

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:39.270 align:middle line:90%
She doesn't care.

00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:42.080 align:middle line:84%
She's murdered everybody in
the United States twice now.

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:43.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If this happens.

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:44.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yes.

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:45.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If this happens.

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:48.950 align:middle line:84%
All right, let's
wrap up the EMPs.

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:51.860 align:middle line:84%
What other nations would be
capable of doing this to us?

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:52.710 align:middle line:90%
Russia?

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:52.940 align:middle line:90%
China?

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:54.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Russia, China.

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pakistan, India?

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.170 align:middle line:90%
Anybody with a nuke, right?

00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, just about.

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:01.910 align:middle line:84%
You've got 11 nations
that are nuclear powers.

00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So far
we've contained it.

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The lid's
been put on this,

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:09.980 align:middle line:84%
because no country is dumb
enough yet to try to plan this.

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:10.860 align:middle line:90%
But it could happen.

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:11.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Oh, absolutely.

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:13.185 align:middle line:90%
It's going to happen.

00:39:13.185 --> 00:39:14.505 align:middle line:90%
It's a matter of when.

00:39:14.505 --> 00:39:16.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
the odds are of us getting hit

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:22.460 align:middle line:84%
by a solar flare or an EMP, a
nuke attack in the atmosphere?

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:26.030 align:middle line:84%
Which one do you think
is most probable?

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:29.674 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I think a CME
is going to get us.

00:39:29.674 --> 00:39:30.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From the sun?

00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:31.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: From the sun.

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And believe it or not,
that's way worse than an EMP,

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:39.170 align:middle line:84%
because an EMP can be
focused on one country,

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:40.115 align:middle line:90%
like North America.

00:39:40.115 --> 00:39:41.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: But the CME,
buddy, it comes in,

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.165 align:middle line:90%
it takes out the whole planet.

00:39:45.165 --> 00:39:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, that's true.

00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:48.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So imagine
all continents burning

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:48.841 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:39:48.841 --> 00:39:49.715 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:39:49.715 --> 00:39:50.930 align:middle line:90%
They're both bad, I guess.

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:52.013 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: They're both bad.

00:39:52.013 --> 00:39:53.807 align:middle line:84%
It's just, which do
you want to get bit by,

00:39:53.807 --> 00:39:55.140 align:middle line:90%
a Gila monster or a rattlesnake?

00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:56.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:39:56.370 --> 00:39:58.666 align:middle line:84%
I mean, which one will
get you the quickest, too?

00:39:58.666 --> 00:39:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:02.820 align:middle line:84%
But it's just
statistical odds are

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:05.409 align:middle line:84%
so bad that we're going to get
hit, Jimmy the Greek wouldn't

00:40:05.409 --> 00:40:06.450 align:middle line:90%
even give you odds on it.

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:07.783 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Smartphones won't work.

00:40:07.783 --> 00:40:09.070 align:middle line:90%
People can't get on Facebook.

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:09.675 align:middle line:90%
They'll go crazy.

00:40:09.675 --> 00:40:10.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Nothing.

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:10.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Teenagers won't be
able to text anybody.

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:13.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:15.390 align:middle line:90%
It'll be like the old days.

00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:15.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:16.340 align:middle line:84%
What was like before
the cellphone?

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:18.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe even
worse than the old days.

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.943 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It'll be
worse, because it'll

00:40:19.943 --> 00:40:23.370 align:middle line:90%
be like 1860, no electricity.

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:26.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No nothing, and
we can't survive that way.

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: All your food will
be gone in the freezer.

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.610 align:middle line:90%
You can't eat it.

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:31.080 align:middle line:90%
There's no food anywhere.

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:33.610 align:middle line:84%
You only got a three week
supply at any one time.

00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long would
it take to get the power

00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:38.930 align:middle line:84%
grid back up after
something like this happens?

00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:40.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Two to 10 years.

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah.

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:43.800 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't have
enough transformers.

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:44.758 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: You have none.

00:40:44.758 --> 00:40:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have
nothing, no backup.

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: There's no spare
parts for the entire grid.

00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:53.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about the
high energy generators.

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:54.935 align:middle line:90%
They weigh 400 tons.

00:40:54.935 --> 00:40:57.480 align:middle line:84%
They're big as a
two story house.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:00.920 align:middle line:84%
If you knock one of them
out, there's no replacements.

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:03.489 align:middle line:84%
It will take a year and a
half for another country

00:41:03.489 --> 00:41:05.280 align:middle line:84%
to build them, because
we don't build them.

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: China builds them.

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:06.810 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:09.521 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: China and, I think,
Germany is the other one.

00:41:09.521 --> 00:41:11.520 align:middle line:84%
It will take a year and
a half to get them here.

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And how are you going
to transport them?

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're going
to need them for themselves.

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:15.740 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: If it's a
planet hit, yeah.

00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:23.009 align:middle line:84%
If we were just isolated hit,
it would still be a decade

00:41:23.009 --> 00:41:24.300 align:middle line:90%
before we get back on our feet.

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, if
we're isolated and hit,

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:29.670 align:middle line:84%
how many other countries will
really come to our defense?

00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:32.350 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't they, at that
time, say, ha ha, finally.

00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:33.150 align:middle line:90%
We got them.

00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:34.566 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, I
would the Soviets

00:41:34.566 --> 00:41:38.389 align:middle line:84%
would move in and adopt
Alaska as it's country.

00:41:38.389 --> 00:41:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
nothing we could do.

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And China
would take over Hawaii.

00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And nobody wants anything
to do with North America.

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.130 align:middle line:90%
It's just a burned down state.

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:48.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They'll
just let it rot.

00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:49.800 align:middle line:90%
And Canada too gets hit.

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:50.600 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.232 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, yeah,
a good lower third

00:41:52.232 --> 00:41:54.190 align:middle line:84%
of it, which is where
most their population is.

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:56.850 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to also remember,
when you lose your power,

00:41:56.850 --> 00:41:58.020 align:middle line:90%
you lose your water pumps.

00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:00.480 align:middle line:84%
You lose the water pumps,
you lose all the cooling

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.549 align:middle line:90%
for the nuclear reactors.

00:42:01.549 --> 00:42:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that's
another crisis.

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: There is 100
reactors in America.

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:11.690 align:middle line:84%
So imagine 100 Fukushimas
at one time in America,

00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:13.770 align:middle line:84%
and it will all be
drifting down wind.

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:14.700 align:middle line:90%
There are two--

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:16.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a
planet killer by itself.

00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, there are
250 million Americans

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:22.620 align:middle line:84%
living within 50 miles
of a nuclear power plant.

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:23.730 align:middle line:90%
They will all die.

00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:25.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez, David.

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:26.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: It just gets worse.

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:27.660 align:middle line:90%
Oh, don't forget.

00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:29.610 align:middle line:84%
We got another little
slight problem.

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:34.530 align:middle line:84%
The 2.3 million convicted
killers in prisons,

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:35.980 align:middle line:90%
they're going to get out.

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you mean
they're going to get out?

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: There's no power to
keep the door locks locked.

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they
just fling open?

00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:41.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:42.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they run?

00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:43.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: And out they come.

00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So everybody
is rioting, disrupting.

00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:47.390 align:middle line:90%
It's chaos.

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And all the gangs
that's in the prisons,

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:51.910 align:middle line:90%
they're free.

00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:54.270 align:middle line:90%
It's just the gangs will rule.

00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:56.730 align:middle line:90%
It will look like Mad Max.

00:42:56.730 --> 00:42:58.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The problem
too with this

00:42:58.830 --> 00:43:02.365 align:middle line:84%
is even if you can survive two
or three days, eventually it's

00:43:02.365 --> 00:43:03.490 align:middle line:90%
going to get you, isn't it?

00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:05.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Absolutely.

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
prolonging the inevitable.

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:07.186 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: The only way
you could survive,

00:43:07.186 --> 00:43:10.840 align:middle line:84%
you'd have to have food for
at least five to 10 years.

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:12.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's impossible.

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Unless you're a big
government funded bunker.

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You'll
run out of water.

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Water be
the first to go.

00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:19.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And what we can survive
three days without water?

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So people
start dying that way.

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: People start
drinking bad water.

00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Now here comes
typhoid and diphtheria

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:33.780 align:middle line:84%
and the host of
third world diseases

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:40.140 align:middle line:84%
will spread like crazy, and
couple that with the violence.

00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:44.070 align:middle line:84%
9 out of 10 Americans will
die in the first 12 months.

00:43:44.070 --> 00:43:47.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give me the
odds on this happening

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:51.660 align:middle line:84%
from either a CME, a
solar flare, or an EMP,

00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:54.097 align:middle line:84%
give me the odds
of that happening.

00:43:54.097 --> 00:43:55.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It depends
on the time frame.

00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:00.420 align:middle line:84%
If you would say at any
time, or, you know, 100%.

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:01.470 align:middle line:90%
It's going to happen.

00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:02.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's going to happen.

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:02.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Absolutely.

00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:03.996 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We don't know when.

00:44:03.996 --> 00:44:04.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: No.

00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:06.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could be tomorrow.

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:07.750 align:middle line:90%
Could be 100 years from now.

00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:08.760 align:middle line:90%
We don't know when.

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It won't be no
100 years not for a CME.

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.575 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think
it'll be sooner?

00:44:11.575 --> 00:44:12.375 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:44:12.375 --> 00:44:14.110 align:middle line:90%
Much sooner.

00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:15.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So the
SHIELD Act, which

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:18.452 align:middle line:84%
is what you're trying
to present and propose,

00:44:18.452 --> 00:44:20.160 align:middle line:84%
you've been working
on this for how long?

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:22.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Oh, god.

00:44:22.590 --> 00:44:28.965 align:middle line:84%
Five years in my own private
capacity, last six months

00:44:28.965 --> 00:44:29.840 align:middle line:90%
on official capacity.

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:31.506 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
get involved in it?

00:44:31.506 --> 00:44:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I was on my
way to Freedom Park.

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Had my little tent,
and my permits,

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:39.560 align:middle line:84%
and I was going to camp
on the White House lawn

00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:42.530 align:middle line:84%
until I could get to
see Bush about this.

00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:43.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:44:43.330 --> 00:44:45.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Trump, excuse me.

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:47.450 align:middle line:84%
But the problem
is, I was heading

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:50.030 align:middle line:90%
out the door, phone rings.

00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And this guy is on the phone
named Glen Rhodes, and he said,

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:57.830 align:middle line:84%
I understand you're on your
way to protest the SHIELD Act.

00:44:57.830 --> 00:44:58.785 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yeah.

00:44:58.785 --> 00:45:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Protest the fact that
it hadn't been passed yet.

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Exactly.

00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:02.804 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's doing
anything about it.

00:45:02.804 --> 00:45:04.830 align:middle line:84%
He said, you're
diabetic aren't you?

00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:05.630 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah.

00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:06.740 align:middle line:90%
You're going on a hunger strike?

00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:07.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Doctors tell me you'll
die in about a week.

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:12.240 align:middle line:90%
I said, probably.

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:15.010 align:middle line:90%
I have no family or relatives.

00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:17.000 align:middle line:84%
He goes, you're
willing to die for--

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You weren't
married then were you?

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:18.310 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: No.

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:18.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: He said, you're willing
to die for the SHIELD Act?

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:22.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:24.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm dying for the
American public.

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:26.780 align:middle line:90%
I think you guys are worth it.

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:28.460 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, before
you run off and do

00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:32.760 align:middle line:84%
that, this is the congressional
committee on the SHIELD Act.

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:35.930 align:middle line:84%
We'd like to appoint you the
national spokesperson provided

00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:40.580 align:middle line:84%
that you don't go protest, and
instead, start working with us.

00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:42.775 align:middle line:90%
And that's how it started.

00:45:42.775 --> 00:45:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
frustrated though, David.

00:45:44.650 --> 00:45:45.420 align:middle line:90%
I've known you for years.

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:45.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Oh, man.

00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:46.790 align:middle line:90%
That ain't even the word for it.

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And every
time I'm with you,

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:50.504 align:middle line:84%
we're not making any
movement with the SHIELD Act.

00:45:50.504 --> 00:45:51.303 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: No.

00:45:51.303 --> 00:45:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If anything,
we're going back.

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I see the
frustration in you.

00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:57.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: It's because I'm 64.

00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:00.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to croak
before too long anyhow.

00:46:00.350 --> 00:46:03.500 align:middle line:84%
But I sure hate to think of
all these families and stuff,

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:04.570 align:middle line:90%
your grandkids.

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:07.040 align:middle line:84%
Look at your grandkids
playing in front of you,

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:08.942 align:middle line:84%
you want them to die
this kind of death?

00:46:08.942 --> 00:46:09.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course not.

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:11.570 align:middle line:84%
That's why I continue
to do what I do.

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:12.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Exactly.

00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:14.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've got
six grandchildren,

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:17.120 align:middle line:84%
and you look at them
whenever you can.

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:19.927 align:middle line:84%
And you go, I want to leave
a better planet for them.

00:46:19.927 --> 00:46:20.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Absolutely.

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.822 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And this is fixable.

00:46:22.822 --> 00:46:23.780 align:middle line:90%
That's what's so crazy.

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:24.738 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Totally crazy.

00:46:24.738 --> 00:46:25.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's fixable.

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:26.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:30.380 align:middle line:84%
You have, well, the
politics gets involved

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:32.420 align:middle line:90%
and then the lobbyists.

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And here's the irony, who
do the lobbyists work for?

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.600 align:middle line:84%
The power company,
the very people

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.282 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to
save and protect.

00:46:40.282 --> 00:46:42.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And like I said, they
should be contributing money

00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:43.760 align:middle line:90%
to get this done.

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Explain exactly what
the SHIELD Act is.

00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: The SHIELD Act
is a congressional act

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:56.850 align:middle line:84%
that will take a $10
billion lump one time out

00:46:56.850 --> 00:46:58.670 align:middle line:90%
of the Department of Energy.

00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Department of Energy's budget
is $30 billion every 12 months.

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:04.617 align:middle line:90%
That's with a B, $30 billion.

00:47:04.617 --> 00:47:06.200 align:middle line:84%
What in God's name
are they spending--

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:07.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: --you know,
every 12 months?

00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On what?

00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So we take
$10 billion from them

00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:13.310 align:middle line:84%
and implement the shield grid,
where we harden the grid that

00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:18.560 align:middle line:84%
can withstand a CME strike
or an EMP pulse and things

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:22.220 align:middle line:84%
like I mentioned earlier,
capacitors, divertors, surge

00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:26.580 align:middle line:84%
protectors, Faraday cages,
old technology, 50 years old.

00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:28.310 align:middle line:90%
We know it works.

00:47:28.310 --> 00:47:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And not one person's
doing anything about it.

00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:31.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not one?

00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:34.700 align:middle line:84%
So where does it sit
right now in legislation,

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:35.810 align:middle line:90%
just sitting there?

00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Senator Lisa
Murkowski's killed both bills.

00:47:39.110 --> 00:47:41.340 align:middle line:90%
It's got to be reintroduced.

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:42.525 align:middle line:90%
Nothing's being done.

00:47:42.525 --> 00:47:44.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it's not
there yet anymore?

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.950 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:46.176 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: It's gone.

00:47:46.176 --> 00:47:48.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there is no
SHIELD Act right now?

00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:49.341 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: There's no commission.

00:47:49.341 --> 00:47:51.360 align:middle line:90%
She disbanded it.

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:53.510 align:middle line:84%
How in God's name did
she get so much power?

00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was just
going to ask you that.

00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.041 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: She's just
a single senator.

00:47:56.041 --> 00:47:58.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How could
one person quash this?

00:47:58.050 --> 00:47:58.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:47:58.850 --> 00:48:01.520 align:middle line:84%
We need to find out how
she got such power, who

00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:05.490 align:middle line:84%
gave her this power and what
other people are involved.

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:09.110 align:middle line:10%
Actually, if you go to my
website, AmericasFallFromSpace,

00:48:09.110 --> 00:48:12.320 align:middle line:10%
and click on the top
bar, raise the shield,

00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:14.120 align:middle line:10%
you'll see all the
people that's involved,

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:15.530 align:middle line:10%
that's caused all this mess.

00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:20.150 align:middle line:84%
You also can send a letter
to the congressional offices

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:22.340 align:middle line:84%
and the Senate office
to tell them you

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:23.690 align:middle line:90%
support the SHIELD Act.

00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:24.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You know Peter Pry?

00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:25.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yes.

00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Peter's trying to
get this done legislatively.

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:29.760 align:middle line:90%
He heads up a commission--

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:30.676 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yes, he does.

00:48:30.676 --> 00:48:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --that tries
to get this done.

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere along the line, David,
with all of us coming at them,

00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:37.550 align:middle line:84%
we've got to get
this thing passed.

00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: You need political
pressure to be applied.

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:42.500 align:middle line:84%
It's just not being
applied right now.

00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:45.710 align:middle line:84%
There's not enough people
even talking about it.

00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:47.330 align:middle line:84%
You grab 100 people
off the street,

00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:50.022 align:middle line:84%
and ask them about
CMEs and EMPs,

00:48:50.022 --> 00:48:51.980 align:middle line:84%
they don't even know what
you're talking about.

00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The SHIELD
Act is now gone.

00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:54.990 align:middle line:90%
It never happened.

00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:58.100 align:middle line:90%
We went right back to zero.

00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:01.430 align:middle line:90%
And we're nowhere.

00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:06.320 align:middle line:84%
It's just there's an
unwritten political law

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:10.220 align:middle line:84%
in American politics,
don't do anything

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:13.910 align:middle line:84%
or say anything that frightens
Americans, because you

00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:14.799 align:middle line:90%
won't get re-elected.

00:49:14.799 --> 00:49:17.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even though you
could be protecting Americans?

00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:17.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:21.620 align:middle line:84%
So not one politician,
no politician

00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:24.620 align:middle line:90%
supported it on either party.

00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:26.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What we need
to happen, David,

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:32.040 align:middle line:84%
is a little CME that hits
directly at some city somewhere

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:34.950 align:middle line:90%
and shuts off power for a year.

00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Protect those people,
move them someplace else,

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:42.310 align:middle line:84%
but we need some event to show
the world we got to fix this.

00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: You know, you can
build an EMP device at home

00:49:45.090 --> 00:49:47.150 align:middle line:84%
by using parts out of
electronics stores?

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:49.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't tell
us how to do it.

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:50.130 align:middle line:90%
Don't tell us.

00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: You can look
it up on the internet

00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:53.590 align:middle line:84%
and there's all the
instructions on how to do it.

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
do you do with it?

00:49:55.090 --> 00:49:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: You detonate it.

00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You detonate it?

00:49:57.900 --> 00:49:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Somebody's
going to do it one day.

00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:00.824 align:middle line:90%
It's just a matter of time.

00:50:00.824 --> 00:50:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you knock out
power in a little city?

00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, and
bring down aircraft

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:07.900 align:middle line:90%
that's over that little city.

00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:09.039 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people will die.

00:50:09.039 --> 00:50:10.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's criminal.

00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yes, it is.

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:16.260 align:middle line:84%
But somebody's going
to do a demonstration,

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:21.025 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to be a person
that's wanted to have fame,

00:50:21.025 --> 00:50:23.150 align:middle line:84%
like the kid that shoots
the people in high school.

00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Look, why don't
we have a David Adair who

00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:28.530 align:middle line:84%
was a kid who
played with rockets

00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:31.800 align:middle line:84%
do a demonstration
before the media

00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:36.060 align:middle line:84%
nationwide before a new
SHIELD Act is introduced?

00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And say, folks, I want
to show you something.

00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And it happens, and the
power is out to some city.

00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I'm more than
capable of doing that,

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:48.780 align:middle line:90%
and I'm actually--

00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:51.457 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would need to do it
with the approval of everybody.

00:50:51.457 --> 00:50:52.290 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Absolutely.

00:50:52.290 --> 00:50:53.706 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or they'll
take you away.

00:50:53.706 --> 00:50:57.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: They would,
and rightly so.

00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:01.230 align:middle line:84%
But I have arguments
from the power companies.

00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And I tell them, oh, you can
take EMP hits all day long?

00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:08.610 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to my local power
company, and they said, yeah.

00:51:08.610 --> 00:51:11.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if I pulled up in
front of you on a trailer,

00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:13.520 align:middle line:84%
I have an EMP device,
let me just pull up,

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:15.880 align:middle line:90%
and I'll detonate it.

00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:18.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, they were ready to
call the SWAT and the police

00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:20.090 align:middle line:84%
and all that one me,
and I'm going, well,

00:51:20.090 --> 00:51:20.770 align:middle line:90%
are you worried about?

00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:23.353 align:middle line:84%
You said you could take it all
day long, nothing would happen.

00:51:23.353 --> 00:51:28.740 align:middle line:84%
Your actions are implying that
great destruction could happen,

00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:31.337 align:middle line:84%
so your actions are not
backing up your words for sure.

00:51:31.337 --> 00:51:32.795 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when
you say detonate,

00:51:32.795 --> 00:51:36.360 align:middle line:84%
are you talking about an
explosion, or just a pulse?

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:37.160 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: It's just a pulse.

00:51:38.430 --> 00:51:40.500 align:middle line:84%
No one would be harmed
by an explosion.

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:41.889 align:middle line:90%
It's not an explosion.

00:51:41.889 --> 00:51:42.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not a bomb.

00:51:42.930 --> 00:51:44.550 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: No, it's not a bomb.

00:51:44.550 --> 00:51:47.100 align:middle line:84%
It's just a pulse
wave that would

00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:49.450 align:middle line:90%
travel across the landscape.

00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:51.387 align:middle line:84%
But, boy, anything
electronic would be gone.

00:51:51.387 --> 00:51:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got to get
something passed, David.

00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: I know.

00:51:54.210 --> 00:51:55.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The clock is ticking.

00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: It is.

00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, it
could happen tomorrow.

00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Th sun, which has been
very quiet lately,

00:52:02.730 --> 00:52:04.190 align:middle line:84%
could pop one of
these things off.

00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:05.731 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: That's when
it normally gets

00:52:05.731 --> 00:52:07.310 align:middle line:90%
you is when it's always quiet.

00:52:07.310 --> 00:52:08.250 align:middle line:90%
It's building up.

00:52:08.250 --> 00:52:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
other countries?

00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:12.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are the Russians
concerned about this?

00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:13.650 align:middle line:90%
China concerned about this?

00:52:13.650 --> 00:52:14.483 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing?

00:52:14.483 --> 00:52:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: They're aware
of it, the concern,

00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:20.010 align:middle line:84%
but they're looking for
America to lead the way.

00:52:20.010 --> 00:52:22.550 align:middle line:84%
If we would suddenly
build ourselves--

00:52:22.550 --> 00:52:25.800 align:middle line:84%
if the SHIELD Act gets
implemented in America,

00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:29.730 align:middle line:84%
I would propose that we go
over to Russia and China

00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:31.410 align:middle line:90%
and help them install it.

00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Now why would you
want to do that?

00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:35.670 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't
want them on fire.

00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:37.770 align:middle line:84%
The smoke will go up
and blot out the sun.

00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:38.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So you want
everybody to get shielded up

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:42.026 align:middle line:90%
from this thing.

00:52:42.026 --> 00:52:43.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The entire planet.

00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:44.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: The entire planet.

00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have relied
too much on electronics.

00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:47.670 align:middle line:90%
We're stuck.

00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:48.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Way too much.

00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're stuck.

00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Murphy's
Law is watching you,

00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:56.490 align:middle line:84%
and he's about to come down
on you with an EMP hammer.

00:52:56.490 --> 00:52:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is this such
a political football?

00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It goes
back to that thing,

00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:06.160 align:middle line:84%
don't say or do anything that
frightens voting citizens.

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And so they're all
quiet about it.

00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah,
but, you know, Newt

00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:13.170 align:middle line:84%
tried to push this when he
was the Speaker of the House.

00:53:13.170 --> 00:53:14.980 align:middle line:90%
He didn't go anywhere with it.

00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:17.160 align:middle line:90%
He's not even in office anymore.

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:19.300 align:middle line:90%
His presidential bid collapsed.

00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:21.130 align:middle line:90%
Nothing worked for him.

00:53:21.130 --> 00:53:22.350 align:middle line:90%
Nobody listened to the guy.

00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Is it because they don't
believe it would happen?

00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:28.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It's something
called normalcy bias.

00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:32.040 align:middle line:84%
It's where you think it
all will just go away,

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:34.920 align:middle line:84%
or it's happened
somewhere else, or that's

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:36.920 align:middle line:90%
not ever going to be real.

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:41.430 align:middle line:84%
You come up with all these
reasons to just dismiss it.

00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:43.480 align:middle line:90%
And that is absolutely fatal.

00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: David, I don't like
paying for car insurance.

00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:48.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't like paying
for house insurance.

00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:50.285 align:middle line:90%
But you know what, I have it.

00:53:50.285 --> 00:53:51.570 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: For the what if.

00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if something
happens, I will say to myself,

00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:56.445 align:middle line:90%
that was a good move, George.

00:53:56.445 --> 00:53:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Absolutely.

00:53:58.510 --> 00:54:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In this particular
case, this is insurance.

00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:04.500 align:middle line:84%
A SHIELD Act is insurance
against the potential

00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:06.060 align:middle line:90%
of something happening.

00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:07.630 align:middle line:90%
We have to do this.

00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Interesting
you mentioned insurance.

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:14.464 align:middle line:84%
No insurance covers EMP or
CME, so it's a total loss.

00:54:14.464 --> 00:54:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:16.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Nobody has
the insurance for this.

00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:17.676 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:54:17.676 --> 00:54:19.680 align:middle line:84%
But our insurance
is the SHIELD Act.

00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: It is.

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:22.730 align:middle line:90%
It will save your bacon.

00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:24.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think
a politician who

00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:27.080 align:middle line:84%
truly comes forward,
it was touched

00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:30.810 align:middle line:84%
on very sporadically in the
last presidential election,

00:54:30.810 --> 00:54:34.070 align:middle line:84%
but I think a politician who
comes forward and outlines

00:54:34.070 --> 00:54:38.600 align:middle line:84%
a plan like this, and tells
people, we can protect this,

00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:41.790 align:middle line:84%
and we can protect
you, let's do it.

00:54:41.790 --> 00:54:42.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: I wish--

00:54:42.590 --> 00:54:45.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think they'd be
welcomed with open arms.

00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:46.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:49.930 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could see
Trump for 20 minutes.

00:54:49.930 --> 00:54:50.940 align:middle line:90%
That's all I need.

00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You'd convince
him in 20 minutes.

00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Oh, yeah.

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:55.640 align:middle line:84%
He'd do something
about it when I leave,

00:54:55.640 --> 00:55:00.230 align:middle line:84%
because I haven't even painted
it nearly as bad as it will be.

00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:03.770 align:middle line:84%
I was just telling you about
the first five minutes.

00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Imagine seven days,
eight days into it.

00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:11.337 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'd rather see our grid
protected than a wall built.

00:55:11.337 --> 00:55:12.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Absolutely.

00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:12.860 align:middle line:90%
It costs less.

00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:14.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Move the
money, you know?

00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:15.736 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It would
cost a lot less.

00:55:15.736 --> 00:55:18.976 align:middle line:84%
And in the long run, it
would save everybody.

00:55:18.976 --> 00:55:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
jobs would it create?

00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: That's the other
good thing, millions.

00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:26.450 align:middle line:84%
Millions of jobs
would be created when

00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:28.340 align:middle line:90%
the SHIELD Act is in place.

00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Because, well, first
thing we would do is we

00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:36.050 align:middle line:84%
stop depending on
China or Germany

00:55:36.050 --> 00:55:37.910 align:middle line:90%
to build our transformers.

00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:40.462 align:middle line:84%
We put a transformer
manufacturing plant right

00:55:40.462 --> 00:55:41.670 align:middle line:90%
in the center of the country.

00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:42.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Smart.

00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:44.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And start
distributing them out.

00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because how
big are these things,

00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:46.380 align:middle line:90%
these transformers?

00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Big as a
two story house.

00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:48.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what I thought.

00:55:48.590 --> 00:55:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: They're gigantic.

00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: A lot of
jobs, good paying jobs.

00:55:52.310 --> 00:55:53.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:54.739 align:middle line:90%
Can you ship those?

00:55:54.739 --> 00:55:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Sure, you can
transport them on highway.

00:55:56.780 --> 00:56:00.450 align:middle line:84%
They have to have escorts,
but, yeah, they're movable.

00:56:00.450 --> 00:56:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We should put
them in different regions

00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:04.270 align:middle line:84%
of the country, just
store them away.

00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:07.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, the idea is
you don't stop building them.

00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:08.840 align:middle line:84%
You start building
them, and then

00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:11.270 align:middle line:84%
you go ahead, where
things are OK,

00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:15.650 align:middle line:84%
and physically move them to
the power plants or substations

00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:18.660 align:middle line:84%
where you need them,
and put a Faraday cage,

00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:19.710 align:middle line:90%
which is like a big net--

00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:20.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:21.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: --mesh of wire it.

00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:22.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Blocks anything.

00:56:22.610 --> 00:56:23.410 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Right.

00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:24.395 align:middle line:90%
And let it sit there.

00:56:24.395 --> 00:56:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And so when something goes bad,
you don't have to transport it.

00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:29.084 align:middle line:84%
It's right there, just
pull it out, hook it up.

00:56:29.084 --> 00:56:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want you to give
us your word that you're

00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:32.900 align:middle line:90%
going to continue pushing this.

00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: I will.

00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:35.116 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
not going to stop.

00:56:35.116 --> 00:56:37.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I've got nothing
better to do right now.

00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:39.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think
you can get it done?

00:56:39.150 --> 00:56:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: It's not going to
be a getting around to it.

00:56:40.550 --> 00:56:42.175 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can't we
find a Congressperson

00:56:42.175 --> 00:56:45.650 align:middle line:84%
to enact the legislation and
get it on the House floor?

00:56:45.650 --> 00:56:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: It could.

00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:49.647 align:middle line:90%
No one's come forward yet.

00:56:49.647 --> 00:56:52.162 align:middle line:84%
It's just I don't know
what it's going to take--

00:56:52.162 --> 00:56:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Find somebody.

00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: --other than
an EMP hit or something.

00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:56.570 align:middle line:84%
That's the way we're
going to operate.

00:56:56.570 --> 00:56:58.190 align:middle line:90%
We're going to reactionary.

00:56:58.190 --> 00:57:00.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a friend
of mine in Missouri--

00:57:00.410 --> 00:57:03.070 align:middle line:84%
I go back and forth
between LA and St. Louis--

00:57:03.070 --> 00:57:05.050 align:middle line:84%
who was running for
state representative.

00:57:05.050 --> 00:57:07.460 align:middle line:90%
He was a lawyer.

00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:11.259 align:middle line:84%
John Kennedy looking
kid, a lot of potential,

00:57:11.259 --> 00:57:13.550 align:middle line:84%
probably end up being the
governor of Missouri one day,

00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:15.500 align:middle line:90%
and God knows how far he can go.

00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And I told him about the
power grid and about EMPs,

00:57:19.050 --> 00:57:19.850 align:middle line:90%
and about it.

00:57:19.850 --> 00:57:20.915 align:middle line:90%
And he said, what?

00:57:20.915 --> 00:57:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And I said, David, you
don't know about this?

00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:24.740 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no.

00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:25.980 align:middle line:90%
Tell me more.

00:57:25.980 --> 00:57:26.900 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And I said, mark my word, use
this as a campaign tactic,

00:57:32.210 --> 00:57:35.930 align:middle line:84%
and you'll get elected, and
God knows how far you can go.

00:57:35.930 --> 00:57:40.730 align:middle line:84%
So he studied it, ran for
the House of Representatives

00:57:40.730 --> 00:57:43.080 align:middle line:84%
in Missouri, and
won the election.

00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah?

00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:45.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a hot potato.

00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:48.290 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: You know, once
the general public,

00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:52.400 align:middle line:10%
once you get them to pay
attention for a few minutes,

00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:54.140 align:middle line:10%
it don't take long
for them to get it.

00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a
no brainer, David.

00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:56.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:58.700 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to have
exceptional IQ to understand

00:57:58.700 --> 00:57:59.540 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Get something
passed, would you?

00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:02.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: I'm working on it.
