00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:18.999 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.620 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and we
have two special guests

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.640 align:middle line:10%
for you today, Dr. JJ
Hurtak and his wife Desiree.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.620 align:middle line:10%
We are going to be
talking about their work

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.690 align:middle line:10%
in the field of anthropology,
ancient civilizations.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.494 align:middle line:84%
And they have done
extensive work.

00:00:35.494 --> 00:00:37.660 align:middle line:84%
One of their books is called
"The Book of Knowledge:

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.950 align:middle line:90%
The Keys of Enoch."

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.166 align:middle line:10%
JJ and Desiree, welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.290 align:middle line:10%
>>JJ JJ: Thank you, George.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.665 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Good to
see both of you.

00:00:43.665 --> 00:00:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And you have been a superstar
on our radio show, "Coast

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.040 align:middle line:90%
to Coast AM."

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.585 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: I have, and I'm
privileged to be here.

00:00:49.585 --> 00:00:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And you, George, are a
great pioneer of the future,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.542 align:middle line:90%
so we're glad to join the team.

00:00:54.542 --> 00:00:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell me about Enoch.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.480 align:middle line:90%
Who was Enoch?

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: Enoch in the
biblical traditions

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.670 align:middle line:84%
is the man who walks
with God, the one who

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.070 align:middle line:84%
was taken in the book of Genesis
to see the divine dimension.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was he a human?

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.460 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: He was a human
who was able to graduate

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.544 align:middle line:90%
into the angelic category.

00:01:13.544 --> 00:01:14.543 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Right.

00:01:14.543 --> 00:01:16.840 align:middle line:84%
He's very much like
Elijah, who was taken up.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And he's also known as one
who initiates into light.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very
interesting, because he

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.850 align:middle line:84%
was one of the ancient
peoples who talked

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.254 align:middle line:90%
about many worlds, many realms.

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:29.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when you
put your book together,

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.300 align:middle line:84%
"The Book of Knowledge:
The Keys of Enoch," how did

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.749 align:middle line:90%
you even start your research?

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: It was based
upon an experience

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.580 align:middle line:90%
I had as a young professor.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.090 align:middle line:84%
I was teaching Oriental
science, traditional teachings

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.120 align:middle line:84%
of the Near East
and the Far East.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And I kept running into
the metaphor of beings

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.440 align:middle line:90%
of light, angelic forms.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And I felt I could not
in intellectual honesty

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.870 align:middle line:84%
speak to my students
about these other realms

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.090 align:middle line:90%
without some type of experience.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And so I began to, shall we
say, compose linguistic formulas

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.130 align:middle line:90%
based upon ancient writings.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And I was also
trained as a musician,

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.539 align:middle line:84%
so I used musical cues and
ancient linguistic expressions.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And at one point,
a morphogenic field

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.690 align:middle line:84%
opened to me in a
moment of prayer.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.470 align:middle line:84%
My body was
bi-located physically

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.610 align:middle line:90%
into another dimension.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, I've seen
literally beings of light.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.870 align:middle line:84%
I was given, as it
were, the background

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.157 align:middle line:90%
of this remarkable book.

00:02:27.157 --> 00:02:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: And as a student, I
can tell you when he came back,

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.270 align:middle line:90%
his whole reality changed.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.490 align:middle line:90%
He knew other situations.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.130 align:middle line:84%
He could describe in
detail things that had been

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.350 align:middle line:90%
talked about for 6,000 years.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.230 align:middle line:84%
So he had information from the
past, the present, and also

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.070 align:middle line:90%
the future.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long were
you technically gone?

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: Two and 1/2 days if
you count the physical time.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, I was teaching
at California Institute

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.790 align:middle line:84%
of the Arts, which is the
California school funded

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.870 align:middle line:90%
by Walt Disney and his brother.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And some of my
students had cameras,

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.880 align:middle line:84%
so they could actually
take pictures of the light

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.970 align:middle line:90%
around my body.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:02.770 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: When you
came back, yeah.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.791 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: And that was what
it was of interest,

00:03:05.791 --> 00:03:08.083 align:middle line:84%
because this light phenomena
continued for a few weeks.

00:03:08.083 --> 00:03:09.874 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, for two
and 1/2 days, though,

00:03:09.874 --> 00:03:11.320 align:middle line:90%
were you physically gone?

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: I was physically
in another dimension

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.590 align:middle line:90%
for two and 1/2 days.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And then when you appeared, you
appeared back in the classroom?

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.032 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: No, I appeared at a
home in Sausalito, California

00:03:21.032 --> 00:03:21.865 align:middle line:90%
where I was staying.

00:03:21.865 --> 00:03:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: Actually,
it was January 2 and 3,

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.410 align:middle line:90%
so it was during vacation break.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: And so pictures were taken
of me because this phenomena

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.030 align:middle line:90%
continued for a while.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And naturally, the book
I wrote, "Keys of Enoch"

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.380 align:middle line:84%
is an Enochian experience
of the light journey

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.461 align:middle line:90%
that I experienced.

00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: But now
many years later,

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.360 align:middle line:84%
we realize that, really,
most things in this book

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.530 align:middle line:90%
have come to pass.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Such as the Great
Pyramid connected

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.960 align:middle line:84%
with Orion, multiverses,
many universes, many realms.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.730 align:middle line:90%
So this is all of what he saw.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And like Enoch, who was
taken to these other heavens,

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.970 align:middle line:84%
if you read the ancient
Ethiopic book of Enoch,

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.800 align:middle line:84%
it's very, very
similar on some levels.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.810 align:middle line:84%
But it's also very
relevant for us today.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were years ahead
of your time, weren't you?

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: 20 years
before Robert Bauval

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.400 align:middle line:84%
in showing the relationship
between the star

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.380 align:middle line:84%
shafts of the Great
Pyramid and the three stars

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.120 align:middle line:90%
in the belt of Orion.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.100 align:middle line:84%
Many years before those NASA
scientists who said the sun now

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.619 align:middle line:90%
is considered a variable star.

00:04:19.619 --> 00:04:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: He actually had
the same words in the thing.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.710 align:middle line:84%
It says the sun is
a variable star.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.022 align:middle line:84%
And then someone from JPL
just about seven years ago

00:04:27.022 --> 00:04:28.480 align:middle line:84%
came out with the
exact same words.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, maybe
they saw the book.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.370 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: Well, it's really
more, I think, consciousness.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.156 align:middle line:84%
Once you bring that
information through,

00:04:35.156 --> 00:04:37.080 align:middle line:84%
people start looking
and coming into that.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.000 align:middle line:90%
That's what we feel.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.190 align:middle line:84%
We're not saying people
really take from the book.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who beamed you
into that other dimension,

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.590 align:middle line:90%
basically?

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: I would say, to use
the biblical expression,

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.980 align:middle line:90%
the sons of light.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.120 align:middle line:90%
The Bene Elohim.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: But they
asked if he was ready.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:51.890 align:middle line:90%
I think that's a difference.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Some people say, oh, you
were abducted by an ET.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.190 align:middle line:84%
But he actually was
asked, are you ready?

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.120 align:middle line:90%
And you said?

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ: I was.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you basically
gave them permission.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ: I gave them permission.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And I said in my
prayer, if I could

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.950 align:middle line:84%
be shown there was a higher
realm of intelligence,

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:12.520 align:middle line:84%
the divine source, something
beyond the average aspect

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.920 align:middle line:84%
of astronomy, I would
dedicate my life

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.930 align:middle line:84%
to bringing forth
the higher message.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And as a result
of my experience,

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.840 align:middle line:84%
I felt a need to bring
together a blueprint of how

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.902 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual and the scientific
converge and harmonize

00:05:25.902 --> 00:05:26.860 align:middle line:90%
at a much higher level.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Whereas on the human level,
they are in opposition,

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.280 align:middle line:90%
as it is traditionally taught.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, when you were--

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.130 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to use
the phrase beamed back,

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.460 align:middle line:84%
because it's easier for
me to comprehend this,

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.080 align:middle line:84%
did you see things in
the future as well?

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.410 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: I did see things
into the future, which

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.920 align:middle line:84%
is in my other books that
I've written since that time.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.870 align:middle line:84%
I saw that there
would be evidences

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.410 align:middle line:84%
of an archive of information
discovered under the Giza

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:54.760 align:middle line:90%
Plateau.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.430 align:middle line:84%
I saw, for example, things
that would be discovered

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.920 align:middle line:84%
in the South Pacific
in terms of an earlier

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.530 align:middle line:84%
branch of the human
experiment of life

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.740 align:middle line:84%
that took place in the isle
of Flores in Indonesia.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.830 align:middle line:10%
And this was confirmed
in the beginning

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.570 align:middle line:10%
of this present century
by anthropologists,

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.594 align:middle line:10%
the Homo floresiensis, as the
diminutive human is called.

00:06:15.594 --> 00:06:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that there
would be increasing

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.990 align:middle line:84%
ET events, or
extraterrestrial events that

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.910 align:middle line:84%
would force the governments
to go into disclosure.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which may or may not
happen at this point, huh?

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: We're very close
to what I consider

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.430 align:middle line:90%
to be the taste of honey.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.950 align:middle line:84%
The fact that we are not
alone in the universe,

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.310 align:middle line:84%
that we as the human race
are one of many, many races

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.640 align:middle line:90%
of cosmic intelligence.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was an
archaeological discovery

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:41.990 align:middle line:90%
in Central Asia.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.320 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.770 align:middle line:10%
>> This is the Taklamakan
Desert, one of the hottest,

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.930 align:middle line:10%
driest places on Earth.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.270 align:middle line:10%
A few years ago,
these salty sands

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.850 align:middle line:10%
began to yield an eerie harvest.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.140 align:middle line:10%
Human mummies.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.970 align:middle line:10%
People who were alive
3,500 years ago.

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.320 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.150 align:middle line:90%


00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:06.975 align:middle line:90%
The mummies are unique.

00:07:06.975 --> 00:07:10.110 align:middle line:84%
A glimpse through a crack
in the door of history.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.300 align:middle line:84%
A door which until
now, China has kept

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:18.360 align:middle line:84%
shut, perhaps to hide a history
that's culturally sensitive.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.150 align:middle line:84%
From the start, the
mummies were an enigma.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.400 align:middle line:90%
They didn't look Chinese at all.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.620 align:middle line:90%
So who were these people?

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.270 align:middle line:90%
Where did they come from?

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And why did they disappear,
leaving only the remains

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:31.440 align:middle line:90%
of the dead behind?

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:36.100 align:middle line:90%


00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.705 align:middle line:84%
It's a forensic mystery
on an epic scale.

00:07:38.705 --> 00:07:42.120 align:middle line:84%
A whole people
missing, believed dead.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Now an international
team of experts

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.330 align:middle line:84%
have come to the
Taklamakan, detectives

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.264 align:middle line:84%
set to solve the
riddle in the sands.

00:07:51.264 --> 00:07:52.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Those were
all great questions.

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:53.930 align:middle line:90%
Who were these people?

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.140 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: The Taklamakan
Desert means he who enters

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.460 align:middle line:90%
does not return.

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:00.200 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the greatest
deserts in Central Asia.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.640 align:middle line:84%
In 1988, with permission
of the Chinese authorities,

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.200 align:middle line:84%
my wife and I had
the opportunity

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.080 align:middle line:84%
to conduct a small
expedition into this area.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And as you can see
by the film, these

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.710 align:middle line:84%
are proto-Europeans, not Asians,
who once lived in Central Asia.

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:16.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: You have red
hair on the mummies.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:21.070 align:middle line:84%
You also have almost a
type of tattoo on the face.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Because these were people
who were living there and got

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.000 align:middle line:90%
into nature, so to speak.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.800 align:middle line:90%
But we were there.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.840 align:middle line:84%
We actually saw some
of these mummies.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why we went is
because "The Keys of Enoch"

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:35.320 align:middle line:84%
talk about the Taklamakan as one
of the key places for, really,

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.270 align:middle line:90%
civilization to start.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And what we feel at
one point that there

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:42.169 align:middle line:84%
was a whole different
climate at the time.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And so people were able to
live there and thrive there.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.960 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: Not only
that, but there was

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.040 align:middle line:84%
the discovery of an
underground hydraulic system.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:49.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.190 align:middle line:90%
They were advanced?

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE: Yeah.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.640 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese still use it
today to water their trees

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.490 align:middle line:90%
and plants.

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: This is the basis of what
we call the Great Wall of China

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.660 align:middle line:84%
going through the desert now to
reclaim much of the Taklamakan

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.741 align:middle line:84%
Desert for future irrigation
and ecological communities.

00:09:04.741 --> 00:09:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It looks like
a treacherous area.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:07.420 align:middle line:90%
Is it?

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:07.930 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ: Yeah, it is.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:09.160 align:middle line:90%
It's mostly desert right now.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.810 align:middle line:84%
But it's really right
down from Tibet.

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:13.060 align:middle line:84%
So you wonder if some
of the Tibetan knowledge

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.800 align:middle line:84%
didn't also come
from the people that

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.175 align:middle line:90%
had lived in the Taklamakan.

00:09:16.175 --> 00:09:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when you say
have lived, where did they go?

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:19.600 align:middle line:90%
What happened to them?

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: Due to climate change
at that time, several thousand

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.450 align:middle line:84%
years before the
present era, it is

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:28.660 align:middle line:84%
believed that most of
the proto-Europeans who

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:33.070 align:middle line:84%
were in the plains area of the
western part of the Taklamakan

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:36.820 align:middle line:84%
basin simply went over
to the European side.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:40.947 align:middle line:84%
The steppes of Russia, Ukraine,
and into Eastern Europe.

00:09:40.947 --> 00:09:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: And that's why
the Chinese don't really

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.160 align:middle line:84%
like this information,
because they weren't Chinese

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.900 align:middle line:90%
as the document said.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a Han
people, and there's also

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.060 align:middle line:84%
the other people, the
Uyghur people, that they

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.710 align:middle line:90%
claim that those were them.

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:55.690 align:middle line:84%
But also, they probably
went to Hungary,

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:58.330 align:middle line:84%
to Europe, made the
whole pilgrimage

00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:59.795 align:middle line:90%
to maybe where we are today.

00:09:59.795 --> 00:10:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: I would say
the Chinese were very

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.980 align:middle line:90%
respectful of our being there.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:06.040 align:middle line:84%
So what Desiree said
reflects only a small branch

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.490 align:middle line:84%
of what we call
traditional sinologists.

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:12.430 align:middle line:84%
The majority of Chinese
archaeologists, anthropologists

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.500 align:middle line:84%
were very helpful,
and acknowledge

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.210 align:middle line:84%
that this is an
information base that

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:18.820 align:middle line:84%
can understand,
really, Eastern as well

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.007 align:middle line:90%
as Western civilization.

00:10:20.007 --> 00:10:21.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it's
almost like Egypt,

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:25.930 align:middle line:84%
where Hawass, for example,
wants everything Egyptian.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:29.440 align:middle line:84%
If you would bring to the
table any possibilities

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.900 align:middle line:84%
that the pyramids may
have been constructed

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:36.370 align:middle line:84%
by outside sources, not
Egyptians, he goes ballistic.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:37.900 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with the Chinese?

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:38.800 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ: Yes.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.830 align:middle line:84%
I would say, knowing Dr.
Hawass in the formal sense,

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:43.900 align:middle line:84%
with a wink of the eye,
there's an understanding

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.110 align:middle line:84%
that there is another
area of Egyptology that

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:50.140 align:middle line:84%
needs to be explored that
is under the sands of Egypt,

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:51.500 align:middle line:90%
not just on the surface.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.100 align:middle line:84%
What we see on the surface is
just the tip of an iceberg,

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.520 align:middle line:84%
of a vast civilization
Desiree and I

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.140 align:middle line:84%
feel is much earlier
and more, shall we say,

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.510 align:middle line:84%
elongated in terms
of its influences.

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If there was one
of those civilizations,

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.000 align:middle line:84%
tell me the effect on
planet Earth at that time.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.440 align:middle line:90%
How advanced were they?

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: Well,
one of the things

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:10.744 align:middle line:84%
that the Chinese
have brought out

00:11:10.744 --> 00:11:12.730 align:middle line:84%
is these people may
have invented the wheel.

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:14.688 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they're
not so happy about that.

00:11:14.688 --> 00:11:15.940 align:middle line:90%
That was one of the reasons.

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.650 align:middle line:84%
So the wheel really changed
our culture, our civilization.

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:20.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Changed everything.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: And we feel--
actually, there's

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:22.470 align:middle line:84%
a picture in "The
Keys of Enoch" that

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.814 align:middle line:84%
talks about these cities that
were on tops of mountains

00:11:24.814 --> 00:11:26.230 align:middle line:84%
that we believe
they had lived in.

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:29.590 align:middle line:84%
This is something that the
Russians, back in the '40s,

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:31.250 align:middle line:90%
were able to get in and see.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:33.250 align:middle line:84%
There's these
ancient cities still

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:37.540 align:middle line:84%
there in the area of the
desert near the Taklamakan.

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.550 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
they were advanced.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:41.420 align:middle line:84%
These were not people
living in huts.

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.496 align:middle line:84%
These are people living
in, we'll say, mud brick.

00:11:44.496 --> 00:11:46.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
have high technology?

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.786 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: Well, it's
always a question.

00:11:47.786 --> 00:11:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Hurtak actually had
brought out the fact

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.200 align:middle line:84%
that there was a
type of disk record.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And we see that
like today in CDs.

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether those were
really electronic or not

00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.830 align:middle line:90%
has yet to be seen.

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:00.820 align:middle line:90%
They haven't really--

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What else would
they have used it for, right?

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.180 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE: I know.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:06.370 align:middle line:84%
But these are possibilities
of documents and records

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:08.530 align:middle line:90%
that may be storage.

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:10.390 align:middle line:90%
Like you take crystal skulls.

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:12.400 align:middle line:84%
People feel that there's
actually information

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.567 align:middle line:90%
coded in the crystal skulls.

00:12:13.567 --> 00:12:14.366 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:12:14.366 --> 00:12:15.640 align:middle line:90%
It's almost as if it's a chip.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:15.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE: Right.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:16.930 align:middle line:90%
So, exactly.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.744 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't even understand
that, say, 40 years ago

00:12:19.744 --> 00:12:21.160 align:middle line:84%
when "The Keys of
Enoch" came out.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.740 align:middle line:84%
How you could code information,
how you can use even

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.300 align:middle line:84%
Wi-Fi to communicate
and do things.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think all these things
some of the ancients had,

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.090 align:middle line:84%
and they used in certain
ways that we're just

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:32.102 align:middle line:90%
understanding today.

00:12:32.102 --> 00:12:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
pretty fascinating.

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: So our work has been,
over the last 45 years,

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.725 align:middle line:84%
to connect where the databases
of earlier civilization

00:12:39.725 --> 00:12:40.600 align:middle line:90%
throughout the world.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Societies that were able
to provide food and water

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.560 align:middle line:84%
for their respective
communities,

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.610 align:middle line:84%
have very advanced astrophysical
calendar systems, as well

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:53.100 align:middle line:84%
as language systems that
provided what we call

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.250 align:middle line:84%
a navigational society to
circumnavigate Mother Earth

00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:00.420 align:middle line:84%
and point out areas of
information and development

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.070 align:middle line:84%
far earlier than
that which we see in

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:06.120 align:middle line:84%
classical Egyptology and Western
European and Oriental history.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
message behind some

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:10.380 align:middle line:84%
of these past
civilizations that we

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.840 align:middle line:84%
need to accept and understand
as people of today?

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.640 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ: Yes.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:19.860 align:middle line:84%
The message is we are all
connected with Mother Earth

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.660 align:middle line:90%
and with Mother Heavens.

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And that we are on
a journey of life

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.280 align:middle line:84%
that connects us in
a very unique way

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.410 align:middle line:90%
with star-born cultures.

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And you see this, whether it's
in the high deserts of South

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.620 align:middle line:84%
America, or in the deserts and
landscapes of the Near East,

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:40.800 align:middle line:84%
in the Far East, people
who were developing

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.020 align:middle line:84%
the astronomical
gifts very early

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:46.082 align:middle line:84%
with great mathematical
skill and understanding.

00:13:46.082 --> 00:13:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: And we feel, in a
sense, we're kind of colonists

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.200 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And we've talked to
Credo Mutwa, who's

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:51.950 align:middle line:90%
a very old friend of ours.

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:55.560 align:middle line:84%
We've known him since the 1980s
and did a documentary with him.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.670 align:middle line:84%
He said that people
lived on Mars.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.700 align:middle line:84%
This is part of
the Zulu culture.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And they came in Merakaiba,
which is very close to the word

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Merkaba, and they came
to Africa because Mars

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.300 align:middle line:90%
was changing its environment.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And we've talked to
many other people

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:12.810 align:middle line:84%
who say even this
planet, of course,

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:16.110 align:middle line:84%
goes through these cycles
of environmental change.

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:18.590 align:middle line:84%
Elizabeth Klarer, if we're
talking about South Africa.

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:19.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if you're
familiar with her.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:21.775 align:middle line:84%
She wrote a book called
"Beyond the Light Barrier."

00:14:21.775 --> 00:14:23.400 align:middle line:84%
She was a very good
friend of ours.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And she wrote in the '70s but
from her experience in the '50s

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:32.400 align:middle line:84%
that she was in contact with
extraterrestrial civilizations

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.440 align:middle line:90%
from Alpha Centauri.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Which is really one
of the closest stars.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:37.840 align:middle line:84%
It's less than five
light years away,

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.298 align:middle line:84%
which is pretty
close when you talk

00:14:39.298 --> 00:14:41.100 align:middle line:90%
about other constellations.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And that they had to
leave this planet because

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.020 align:middle line:90%
of environmental changes.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.880 align:middle line:84%
But they kept a
base in Antarctica.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.520 align:middle line:84%
She said this in the
'70s in her books.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.810 align:middle line:84%
She was way ahead
of her time too.

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: She was a
magnificent person.

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: Merkaba means, in
Hebrew, the spiritual vehicle

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.190 align:middle line:90%
of ascension or space travel.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And so when Desiree made the
reference to the Zulu tradition

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.280 align:middle line:84%
linguistically connected with
the Near Eastern languages,

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.190 align:middle line:84%
we're speaking about
metaphors and symbols

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:10.440 align:middle line:84%
that we have seen in
different language groups

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.580 align:middle line:90%
throughout the world.

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were one of
the first, Dr. Hurtak,

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:18.990 align:middle line:84%
to also talk about similarities
between Earth and Mars

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:21.930 align:middle line:84%
in terms of structures
and pyramids.

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:24.070 align:middle line:84%
How did you come
about that knowledge?

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: Well, I had the
opportunity many years ago

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:29.280 align:middle line:84%
to work in remote
viewing programs.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And I had a
astrophysical experience

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:34.390 align:middle line:84%
of seeing briefly
that there were

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:37.700 align:middle line:84%
structures on Mars similar to
what we find throughout Mother

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:38.500 align:middle line:90%
Earth.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:42.430 align:middle line:84%
Namely, pyramidal grids,
or pyramidal geometries.

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And so I had told
some of my friends

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:47.250 align:middle line:90%
at NASA before the Mariner 9--

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:48.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did they say?

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: Well, they said
they would take a look.

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And so when the
Mariner 9 brought back

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:54.690 align:middle line:84%
over 50,000 pictures, there
in the Elysium quadrangle,

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:57.360 align:middle line:84%
there was a series of
major and minor pyramids.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And I had the opportunity
to get permission

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.560 align:middle line:84%
to publish in "The
Keys of Enoch"

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.230 align:middle line:84%
the actual documents long
before everybody got involved

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.560 align:middle line:90%
in the act in the 1980s.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.950 align:middle line:90%
This is in 1973.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did NASA
say behind the scenes

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:10.765 align:middle line:90%
about some of these structures?

00:16:10.765 --> 00:16:12.765 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: Well, of course,
they think it's just

00:16:12.765 --> 00:16:13.960 align:middle line:90%
wind formations, wind blast.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.350 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at
four structures together,

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:17.680 align:middle line:90%
they form a grid point.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.310 align:middle line:84%
So these things could be,
when you get up there.

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:22.440 align:middle line:84%
But we feel that,
actually, there was

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.940 align:middle line:90%
civilization before on Mars.

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:28.650 align:middle line:84%
Mars now lost its magnetic
field, and so in turn,

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:29.460 align:middle line:90%
its atmosphere.

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:32.340 align:middle line:84%
We know that there was
actually more water on Mars--

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.350 align:middle line:84%
and this is scientifically
proven now--

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:35.707 align:middle line:90%
than there is on Earth.

00:16:35.707 --> 00:16:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So is it gone, or
is it deep within the planet?

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: Well,
some of it obviously

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:40.330 align:middle line:90%
went into the crevasses.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Some of it is still in certain
places, maybe in frozen ice.

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:46.890 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part, because
when you lose your atmosphere,

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:48.830 align:middle line:84%
you lose your
structure, literally.

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: I had the
opportunity to release this

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:54.150 align:middle line:84%
on a worldwide telecast, "Good
Morning Australia," where

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.360 align:middle line:84%
the Australians were a
bit more open minded.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And so we had the
opportunity to show

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:02.941 align:middle line:84%
close-ups of these gargantuan
pyramidal land forms.

00:17:02.941 --> 00:17:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And again, later,
of course, we know

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:08.960 align:middle line:84%
that many Americans got into the
popular literature of pyramids

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.160 align:middle line:84%
and the face on Mars, but
we were the first, really,

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.040 align:middle line:90%
to bring this out.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE: Right.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is called the
Sagan pyramids now.

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Of course, Carl Sagan
was very popular.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.442 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: Carl Sagan brought
out four arguments why

00:17:17.442 --> 00:17:18.650 align:middle line:90%
these were natural phenomena.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:21.180 align:middle line:84%
They were the result of
supersonic wind burst,

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:25.230 align:middle line:84%
a regolithic mantle building,
all sorts of technical language

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:26.520 align:middle line:90%
that a geologist would use.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.970 align:middle line:84%
But clearer examination
of this over the years

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:33.780 align:middle line:84%
privately by think tanks
in our country as well as

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Russia affirm the fact
that these clear standing

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:39.780 align:middle line:84%
forms, three-sided,
four-sided, five-sided,

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:41.520 align:middle line:84%
were not the result
of wind blast,

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.740 align:middle line:84%
but were there as a
type of terraforming

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:47.305 align:middle line:84%
that would exist from a
previous possible extrasolar

00:17:47.305 --> 00:17:48.105 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:17:48.105 --> 00:17:49.646 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and
you wouldn't think

00:17:49.646 --> 00:17:53.460 align:middle line:84%
that wind blast would carve out
four- or five-sided pyramids.

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: This was the argument
of Credo Mutwa, the great Zulu

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.950 align:middle line:84%
shaman who was also an
artist, an architect.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:01.170 align:middle line:84%
He said anybody who
look clearly at this

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:05.587 align:middle line:84%
would see that the supersonic
winds would wear it down.

00:18:05.587 --> 00:18:07.920 align:middle line:84%
But these were structures
that stood there for thousands

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.150 align:middle line:90%
upon thousands of years.

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lots of
theories abound about how

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:13.998 align:middle line:90%
pyramids were constructed.

00:18:13.998 --> 00:18:15.820 align:middle line:10%
>>ANTON PARKS: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.710 align:middle line:10%


00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:21.370 align:middle line:10%
>> In my view, the Great
Pyramid was built by Isis.

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:26.230 align:middle line:10%
I believe it was created to
reincarnate Osiris into Horus.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.280 align:middle line:10%
It is quite complicated.

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.880 align:middle line:10%
The Osirion, the
so-called aquatic temple

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:36.160 align:middle line:10%
dedicated to Osiris in Abydos,
[EGYPTIAN] in Egyptian,

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.040 align:middle line:10%
means it is located
in the city which is,

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:43.060 align:middle line:10%
according to Egyptian history,
the first city of Osiris.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:46.960 align:middle line:10%
Yet to be able to find
seashells on a temple located

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.730 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of
the desert, you have

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:52.930 align:middle line:10%
to go back thousands of
years, at least 10,000 years.

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:56.080 align:middle line:10%
Why would he have made such a
temple with aquatic features?

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.520 align:middle line:10%
Because Osiris,
who's also Enki--

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.430 align:middle line:10%
they are the same person--

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:02.980 align:middle line:10%
had amphibian genes.

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.950 align:middle line:10%
Osiris, Enki, was
killed by his nemesis

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:08.590 align:middle line:10%
Set, who is in fact
Enlil, during one

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:10.750 align:middle line:10%
of their many battles.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:14.530 align:middle line:84%
It took place in Abydos,
which also corresponds

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:18.430 align:middle line:84%
to the Sumerian Apsu, where
Osiris's aquatic temple can

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:20.380 align:middle line:90%
be found.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:24.010 align:middle line:84%
The texts clearly state that
all of Osiris's servants

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:26.030 align:middle line:84%
were slaughtered
during a battle.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:29.950 align:middle line:84%
As well as Osiris himself,
who was crucified on a tree.

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:32.590 align:middle line:90%
This is how he died.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:34.750 align:middle line:10%
Isis is quite a character.

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:38.660 align:middle line:10%
She can't really be found
in Mesopotamian literature,

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.530 align:middle line:10%
although she could be
considered the goddess Ninti.

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:45.630 align:middle line:84%
She is the woman who lives in
the great deeps, underground.

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:48.090 align:middle line:84%
I think that these
underground passageways

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:50.370 align:middle line:84%
could correspond
to the ones we can

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.950 align:middle line:90%
find under the Giza Plateau.

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:57.330 align:middle line:84%
We know that the Giza Plateau
is full of underground passages.

00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:00.480 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the clan
of Osiris lived there.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.185 align:middle line:84%
As far as the resurrection of
Osiris into Horus is concerned,

00:20:04.185 --> 00:20:06.420 align:middle line:90%
Isis organizes it.

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:08.980 align:middle line:84%
The texts are very
clear about that.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And we understand that she
used Osiris's genetic code

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.340 align:middle line:90%
to create Horus.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:18.630 align:middle line:84%
She created the Great Pyramid in
order to accomplish this task.

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:23.470 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid allowed Isis
to find Osiris's soul again.

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:25.260 align:middle line:84%
We don't really
know how, but she

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.470 align:middle line:84%
would have put Horus's
genetic code in the pyramid.

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:31.140 align:middle line:10%
She would have been able to
create another body using

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.290 align:middle line:10%
Osiris's genetic code,
the so-called yuef,

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:36.850 align:middle line:10%
in Egyptian, body.

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:39.210 align:middle line:10%
And thanks to the coding
of the Great Pyramid,

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:42.150 align:middle line:10%
she reached Osiris's
soul so it could come

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:45.255 align:middle line:10%
into the new body of Horus.

00:20:45.255 --> 00:20:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that, of course,
was researcher Anton Parks.

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.330 align:middle line:90%
Do you agree with him?

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:52.000 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: Well, he's using
the mythological symbol

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.120 align:middle line:84%
of Isis and Osiris, which
we're very familiar with.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.370 align:middle line:90%
But there's more to the story.

00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:57.040 align:middle line:90%
We're scientists.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.900 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at the
myth behind the myth,

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.340 align:middle line:90%
the science behind the myth.

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:01.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: Actually,
Osiris was cut

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.060 align:middle line:90%
into something like 14 pieces.

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Isis, she put those pieces
together just long enough

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.640 align:middle line:84%
to continue the
element of, we'll say,

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.020 align:middle line:90%
sacred birth or pharaoh.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: Sometimes the
text will say 14,

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:15.610 align:middle line:84%
sometimes they'll say 16
parts were reassembled.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:17.560 align:middle line:84%
But the thrust of our
work has been to search

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.030 align:middle line:90%
for the tomb of Osiris.

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: In late 1990s,
with the Shore expedition

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.860 align:middle line:84%
and our very good
friend Boris Said,

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.170 align:middle line:84%
who was an archaeologist
in his own right,

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:28.546 align:middle line:90%
we went into the tomb of Osiris.

00:21:28.546 --> 00:21:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it
wasn't called that.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:34.150 align:middle line:10%
And there are, as the film
said, many underground passages

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:35.500 align:middle line:10%
underneath the Giza Plateau.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:39.130 align:middle line:84%
We went in with radar and
sonar because there's water

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:40.870 align:middle line:90%
underneath that structure.

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to find what
was called the tomb itself,

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:49.984 align:middle line:84%
which is on a third level down,
100 feet or 30 meters down.

00:21:49.984 --> 00:21:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
you think of it?

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.816 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: Well, we
were, shall we say,

00:21:52.816 --> 00:21:56.320 align:middle line:84%
shocked that there would
be a moat around the tomb

00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:02.320 align:middle line:84%
itself, showing that this was
organized as a mythological as

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.960 align:middle line:84%
well as a physical presentation
of a different story

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.090 align:middle line:90%
of evolution of Osiris.

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:08.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Clearly thought out.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ: No.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this room
100 feet down, so you

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:12.516 align:middle line:90%
have three tiers going down.

00:22:12.516 --> 00:22:14.515 align:middle line:84%
The second tier actually
had several sarcophagi,

00:22:14.515 --> 00:22:16.750 align:middle line:90%
so it could be part of a family.

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:18.700 align:middle line:90%
And the lowest one had the one.

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:21.010 align:middle line:90%
But the room itself had corners.

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Because you think if
they just dug and they

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:26.140 align:middle line:84%
want to bury someone, they
don't put corners in the room.

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.060 align:middle line:84%
But they actually had
corners in that room,

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.590 align:middle line:90%
and this moat around it.

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And we also could see from
our radar studies on the walls

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:35.020 align:middle line:84%
that there were
probably other passages.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And we believe that it
probably goes all the way

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:38.590 align:middle line:90%
to the Great Pyramid.

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Probably, it's connected a
little bit with the causeway

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.900 align:middle line:84%
from the central
pyramid to the Sphinx.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:45.490 align:middle line:84%
But we also have
certain theories

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:48.250 align:middle line:84%
which we're coming out with
shortly, which is the fact

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:50.630 align:middle line:90%
that water played a key role.

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:54.890 align:middle line:84%
In fact, most of the pyramids
in Egypt are along the Nile.

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:56.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Nile is
not what it used

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:58.660 align:middle line:90%
to be because of the Aswan Dam.

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:01.430 align:middle line:84%
But there used to be a
much more larger flooding.

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:02.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was wider too.

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:03.000 align:middle line:90%
Much wider.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE: Yeah.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And our work with hydrogen
energy and Brown's gas--

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.920 align:middle line:84%
if you're familiar with that,
which is where you take water,

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.850 align:middle line:84%
and you make
hydrogen and oxygen,

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:13.930 align:middle line:84%
and you can actually get gas
out of it to run electricity--

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:16.810 align:middle line:84%
we feel is part of the
puzzle, not the only puzzle,

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:18.770 align:middle line:90%
but part of the puzzle of Egypt.

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:22.240 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: So there's a very
extensive hydraulic system

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.710 align:middle line:84%
that the Egyptians--
we believe--

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:26.840 align:middle line:90%
used for energy production.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you look very carefully
at the hydraulic system

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:32.050 align:middle line:84%
underneath the
sand through radar,

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:35.260 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that possibly,
these were energy stations

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.270 align:middle line:84%
that the Egyptians
were able to employ.

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:40.195 align:middle line:84%
I will want to emphasize,
though, we had an opportunity--

00:23:40.195 --> 00:23:43.390 align:middle line:84%
I in particular-- to go out
into one of the passages.

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And there are numerous
passages under the Giza Plateau

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:50.734 align:middle line:84%
that connect the step pyramid
with the pyramids proper.

00:23:50.734 --> 00:23:52.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you're
claustrophobic,

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:53.620 align:middle line:90%
would you go crazy down there?

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:53.890 align:middle line:90%
>>>>DESIREE: No.

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:55.430 align:middle line:84%
The rooms are quite
big, actually.

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they?

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:56.610 align:middle line:90%
>>>>DESIREE: Yeah.

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:59.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the hardest thing is
going up and down the ladders.

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: The actual passageways
themselves have not

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:03.190 align:middle line:90%
been fully explored.

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:06.360 align:middle line:84%
I had the opportunity
to go into one area.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.110 align:middle line:84%
There is at least,
in my opinion,

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:09.970 align:middle line:90%
three miles' worth of passages.

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:11.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Three miles?

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:13.790 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: From the step pyramid
to the pyramids proper.

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:15.998 align:middle line:84%
>>>>DESIREE: Well, the step
pyramid really also being

00:24:15.998 --> 00:24:16.840 align:middle line:90%
Saqqara.

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.210 align:middle line:84%
Actually, if you've
ever looked inside--

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:22.810 align:middle line:84%
which most people haven't, but
there's some graphs about it--

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:24.880 align:middle line:84%
inside the big step
pyramid at Saqqara,

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.060 align:middle line:84%
you'll find almost like
an energy technology.

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:29.860 align:middle line:84%
They have these vents,
these different corridors.

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.100 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very unusual.

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:32.516 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't
even realize it.

00:24:32.516 --> 00:24:34.820 align:middle line:84%
They think it's just solid
with a bunch of little,

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:36.550 align:middle line:84%
we'll say, corridors
or chambers.

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:38.020 align:middle line:90%
But it's much more complex.

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:40.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What came first, the
pyramids or the passageways?

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: I think they were both
in the context of the blueprint

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:47.710 align:middle line:84%
put together at the same time,
because you cannot construct

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:51.170 align:middle line:84%
any edifice without having
the proper foundation.

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:51.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: So there is what
we call the basement

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.260 align:middle line:90%
complex that was engineered.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And then upon the basement
complex, using water

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:04.460 align:middle line:84%
as a way of putting a, shall we
say, a good level perspective.

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:07.750 align:middle line:10%
The Japanese, by
the way, in 1978

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:09.640 align:middle line:10%
tried to create the pyramids.

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.620 align:middle line:10%
Well, we were there,
and we have a film

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:15.446 align:middle line:10%
showing how they were completely
unable with new technology

00:25:15.446 --> 00:25:17.320 align:middle line:10%
to create a pyramid,
even on the small scale.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:18.120 align:middle line:10%
>>>>DESIREE: Right.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.020 align:middle line:10%
They try to use
barges, and they tried

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:21.670 align:middle line:10%
to use primitive cutting tools.

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:25.690 align:middle line:84%
They ended up having to
use saws and helicopters

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:26.800 align:middle line:90%
to move these bricks.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't even get higher
than a three-story building.

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:29.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:30.610 align:middle line:84%
We don't even have
cranes that could

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:33.030 align:middle line:84%
lift those kinds of
tonnage of blocks today.

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:34.120 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ: Right.

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.340 align:middle line:84%
That was shown in the
documentary, "The Mystery

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:37.835 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Sphinx."

00:25:37.835 --> 00:25:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>>>>DESIREE: And in
some cases, though,

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:42.040 align:middle line:84%
many scholars that have looked
at the Great Pyramid feel that,

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.581 align:middle line:84%
actually, it was
built in two stages.

00:25:43.581 --> 00:25:47.460 align:middle line:84%
So you have the inner part of
it and then the outer part.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:48.660 align:middle line:90%
These are all up for grabs.

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:49.461 align:middle line:90%
But we do feel--

00:25:49.461 --> 00:25:51.835 align:middle line:84%
"The Mystery of the Sphinx,"
which is something that John

00:25:51.835 --> 00:25:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Anthony West, Robert Schoch
talking about the sphinx itself

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:57.647 align:middle line:84%
and how it was built. But
it shows how vibrations--

00:25:57.647 --> 00:25:59.730 align:middle line:84%
and of course, they were
just doing little balls--

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:01.440 align:middle line:90%
can actually lift the blocks.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Because really, to
try to haul these 2-,

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.610 align:middle line:90%
3-ton blocks up is amazing.

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:09.926 align:middle line:84%
But then inside, you get
50-ton, you get 80-ton blocks.

00:26:09.926 --> 00:26:11.050 align:middle line:90%
That's even harder to move.

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:12.856 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my God, yeah.

00:26:12.856 --> 00:26:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: So to revisit your
question about Isis,

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:19.020 align:middle line:84%
no, we feel that
the symbol of Enoch

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:23.100 align:middle line:84%
and the Enochian tradition
represents a higher

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:26.160 align:middle line:84%
level of, shall we say,
cosmic engineering that

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.460 align:middle line:84%
was on the planet in
a much earlier date.

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was there
extraterrestrial help there?

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:33.100 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: In the sense
of what we've seen

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:37.950 align:middle line:84%
in these massive structures,
underground passageways

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:40.410 align:middle line:84%
without lights as we
know it, definitely

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:43.140 align:middle line:84%
a hand of higher intelligence
was involved, yes.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:45.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Without a doubt?

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: Without a doubt,
because in the experience

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:50.880 align:middle line:84%
I had with what I call
ultraterrestrial intelligence,

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.670 align:middle line:84%
intelligence even more advanced
than the extraterrestrial,

00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:58.410 align:middle line:84%
it was clear that that structure
we call the Great Pyramid

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:01.800 align:middle line:84%
would become a type of Bible
in stone, a type of beacon

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:05.370 align:middle line:84%
of information that generations
in the future would call upon.

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:06.170 align:middle line:90%
>>>>DESIREE: Right.

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, of course,
in "The Keys of Enoch"

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.570 align:middle line:84%
as well as many now
with Robert Bauval,

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:13.560 align:middle line:90%
say the pyramid points to Orion.

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
one of the keys.

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Why did the pharaoh
want to go to Orion?

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:20.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, no one knew
what Orion even was.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.200 align:middle line:84%
It was just a big star
constellation there.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:26.430 align:middle line:84%
Now we realize that we're
actually in the arm of Orion

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:30.300 align:middle line:84%
in the Milky Way, that there's
actually the Orion arm.

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And in addition to that,
what Dr. Hurtak had

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:34.440 align:middle line:84%
in his experience is
that, actually, he

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.900 align:middle line:84%
saw how the three stars
in the belt of Orion

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:39.690 align:middle line:84%
were like a vortex point
to other dimensions,

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:40.980 align:middle line:90%
other realities.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And this was true also
in the Mayan culture.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:48.550 align:middle line:84%
So the Mayans recognized Orion
as the father of the gods.

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:50.430 align:middle line:90%
And they actually have--

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:52.470 align:middle line:84%
a lot of their
pyramids are based

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:53.570 align:middle line:90%
on the Orion construction.

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:54.486 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That sure is.

00:27:54.486 --> 00:27:58.236 align:middle line:84%
It's fascinating how they
tie into celestial objects.

00:27:58.236 --> 00:28:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: Not only that, but
with the hydraulic systems

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:04.050 align:middle line:84%
underneath the pyramids, we've
seen this in South America,

00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:05.520 align:middle line:84%
we've seen this in
Central America.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.740 align:middle line:84%
We were able to work
also in the Far East.

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:08.540 align:middle line:90%
>>>>DESIREE: Right.

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:11.880 align:middle line:84%
Like Chichen Itza right
now, the main El Castillo,

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.150 align:middle line:90%
they found water underneath.

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:15.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, no person in
their right mind

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:17.700 align:middle line:84%
would build something
on top of water.

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.080 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that is ridiculous.

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:19.575 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unless.

00:28:19.575 --> 00:28:20.070 align:middle line:90%
Unless.

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE: Unless.

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:22.800 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] Unless
it means something.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.009 align:middle line:90%
Unless it can produce energy.

00:28:24.009 --> 00:28:24.808 align:middle line:90%
Unless there's--

00:28:24.808 --> 00:28:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Christopher Dunn
believes it's a power plant.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:27.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE: Exactly.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.510 align:middle line:10%
And really, to find
water in these places--

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:33.300 align:middle line:10%
even Nikola Tesla
actually wanted water

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:34.500 align:middle line:10%
underneath his structures.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.083 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: But George,
even more important,

00:28:36.083 --> 00:28:38.970 align:middle line:84%
we did music tests with
very special musicologists.

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:42.720 align:middle line:84%
We were able to
examine the range

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:46.560 align:middle line:84%
of musical acoustical
vibration with that

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:50.730 align:middle line:84%
which the human ear could
hear in subatomic resonance.

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:52.225 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 440 and three-fourths--

00:28:52.225 --> 00:28:54.030 align:middle line:90%
432?

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:54.830 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ: Right.

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:56.204 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: Well,
A sharp, F sharp

00:28:56.204 --> 00:29:00.364 align:middle line:84%
were the two vibrations we got
mostly in Egypt and in Mexico.

00:29:00.364 --> 00:29:01.530 align:middle line:90%
We were able to do testing--

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:03.842 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Used to push
the blocks into place?

00:29:03.842 --> 00:29:05.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: Well, it's
a resonant chamber,

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:07.110 align:middle line:84%
but we think that
there was probably

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:08.736 align:middle line:84%
some sort of frequencies
that were used

00:29:08.736 --> 00:29:10.026 align:middle line:90%
to levitate some of the blocks.

00:29:10.026 --> 00:29:12.300 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: The open tomb in the
King's Chamber, the king's

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:14.790 align:middle line:84%
coffer, as it is
called, resonates

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:17.520 align:middle line:84%
with certain musical
sounds or vibrations.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.490 align:middle line:10%
So the chambers or rooms
in the Great Pyramid

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:23.610 align:middle line:10%
represent, in our
research, aspects

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:25.530 align:middle line:10%
of the human circulatory system.

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:28.710 align:middle line:10%
The heartbeat, for
example, 68 to 72 beats,

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:30.365 align:middle line:10%
resonates with certain sounds.

00:29:30.365 --> 00:29:32.490 align:middle line:10%
And I have a picture to
show the audience I brought

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:35.850 align:middle line:10%
with me, in one case when
we use certain sounds

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:37.922 align:middle line:10%
inside the Great Pyramid,
the Grand Gallery

00:29:37.922 --> 00:29:39.630 align:middle line:10%
lit up in golden light
for a few seconds.

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.200 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.320 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: So there's this
whole sound physics

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:46.200 align:middle line:84%
based upon the construction
of the Great Pyramid showing

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.270 align:middle line:84%
that we are in the
reddish portion

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:50.260 align:middle line:90%
of the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.290 align:middle line:84%
The open coffer of
the King's Chamber

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:55.920 align:middle line:84%
represents the humanity
going through a process

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:57.900 align:middle line:90%
of ritualistic ascension.

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:00.360 align:middle line:84%
This, plus the astrophysics,
plus the water hydraulics

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:03.300 align:middle line:84%
underneath, plus the
massive structures all

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:07.300 align:middle line:84%
throughout the Giza Plateau
over 19 square kilometers

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:10.890 align:middle line:84%
suggests that this is a
super civil engineering that

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:13.620 align:middle line:84%
would take several
Einsteins to figure out.

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:17.520 align:middle line:84%
So we've done the math, the
physics, and the music test,

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.794 align:middle line:84%
and this will be published
in a forthcoming book.

00:30:19.794 --> 00:30:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: And what's
very interesting--

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:24.390 align:middle line:84%
and other people have done
this-- you take Easter Island,

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:27.270 align:middle line:84%
and then you move to Nazca,
where you have the Paracas

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:30.150 align:middle line:84%
culture with the elongated
heads and some other interesting

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:31.140 align:middle line:90%
things in Peru.

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And then you move
to Machu Picchu,

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:37.020 align:middle line:84%
and you can draw a straight
line all the way to Giza.

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And then you continue on
to the area of Indonesia,

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:43.700 align:middle line:84%
and that whole
area of Angkor Wat.

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:45.470 align:middle line:10%
Now, when you talk
about Angkor Wat

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:48.530 align:middle line:10%
and you say, how was it built,
and you listen to legend,

00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:51.800 align:middle line:10%
they said the blocks were
all flown into place.

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.439 align:middle line:10%
So how did you get blocks
flying into place if you didn't

00:30:54.439 --> 00:30:55.730 align:middle line:10%
have some sort of vibrational--

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:58.410 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Wouldn't you love to
have been there just to witness

00:30:58.410 --> 00:30:58.760 align:middle line:10%
this?

00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:59.560 align:middle line:10%
>>DESIREE: Yeah.

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.760 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Edgar Cayce, the
late American prophet,

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:05.480 align:middle line:10%
talked about the Hall of Records
at the base of the Sphinx.

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:06.890 align:middle line:10%
What do you think of that?

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Robert Schoch says that
there's something down there.

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: A 9-foot-deep
water capsule

00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:15.154 align:middle line:84%
probably used for baptism
or ritual of some sort.

00:31:15.154 --> 00:31:16.820 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, there's a
much larger chamber

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:18.060 align:middle line:90%
that needs to be explored.

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:23.600 align:middle line:84%
I was there with Dr. Dobecki,
who did the sounding tests

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.890 align:middle line:90%
underneath the--

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There is a
structure down there.

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE: Right.

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:28.650 align:middle line:90%
Boris Said and--

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's a chamber.

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:31.589 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: --and Dobecki
were doing sound testing,

00:31:31.589 --> 00:31:32.880 align:middle line:90%
and you could see this chamber.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a big one too.

00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:35.691 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: And they wanted
to put fiber optic in,

00:31:35.691 --> 00:31:37.160 align:middle line:84%
but it was like
almost impossible.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.285 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The architectural
sketches of the pyramids

00:31:39.285 --> 00:31:40.520 align:middle line:90%
are probably down in there.

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.686 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: And we do feel,
even the tomb of Osiris--

00:31:42.686 --> 00:31:45.620 align:middle line:84%
which is really also a
grid point on the plateau--

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:47.330 align:middle line:90%
is part of that alignment.

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:48.710 align:middle line:90%
That really is all underground.

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:50.765 align:middle line:84%
We feel there's more
under the ground of Giza

00:31:50.765 --> 00:31:53.140 align:middle line:84%
than there is above the ground,
and I think that's very--

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: "The Keys of Enoch"
speak about a chamber

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.060 align:middle line:90%
inside the Sphinx.

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And so we discovered
this chamber,

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:00.080 align:middle line:84%
and underneath the
back of the chamber

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:03.680 align:middle line:84%
of the underground passageway
to the pyramid complex itself.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.380 align:middle line:84%
So we were down
in that structure,

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:09.110 align:middle line:84%
although it was officially
of, shall we say,

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:12.050 align:middle line:84%
denied in the classical
sense of Egyptology,

00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:14.060 align:middle line:84%
we've been able to
see the footprint

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:17.270 align:middle line:84%
that this was part of a much
earlier period of construction.

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:19.311 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: And if I can
jump for one more minute,

00:32:19.311 --> 00:32:21.560 align:middle line:84%
we also recently just last
year went to the Yucatan.

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.380 align:middle line:10%
And near Uxmal is
another site that

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:27.470 align:middle line:10%
has underground structures
literally going also

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:29.030 align:middle line:10%
for 3 or 4 kilometers.

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that is
something like 25 pyramids

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:33.140 align:middle line:90%
that have not been uncovered.

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:34.340 align:middle line:84%
The Mexican government
doesn't even

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:35.800 align:middle line:84%
want to uncover
another pyramid, it

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.970 align:middle line:84%
costs them so much
to maintain each one.

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:40.310 align:middle line:84%
But there's so much
in the whole Yucatan.

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And now recently, of
course, National Geographic

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:44.510 align:middle line:84%
released information
about Tikal,

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:46.910 align:middle line:84%
showing that there's probably
a million-plus people that

00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:48.030 align:middle line:90%
had lived in that area.

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:49.196 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:32:49.196 --> 00:32:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, if there might have been
any ET involvement at all,

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:54.830 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people
try to speculate,

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:55.900 align:middle line:90%
why did they come here?

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:57.320 align:middle line:90%
And did they seed here?

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.600 align:middle line:84%
You know, Zecharia
Sitchin theories

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.750 align:middle line:84%
that the Annunaki came
here and created man

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:05.330 align:middle line:84%
from whatever species might
have been on the planet.

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:08.450 align:middle line:84%
We've got a program on
Gaia called "Deep Space,"

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:10.730 align:middle line:84%
and they somewhat
address the possibilities

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:14.500 align:middle line:84%
that ET may have
jumpstarted life here.

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:17.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Could some of these beings
from another planet not only be

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:20.700 align:middle line:10%
considered alien,
but also human?

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:23.814 align:middle line:10%
If they were human, did
they help seed the planet?

00:33:23.814 --> 00:33:25.980 align:middle line:10%
>>NICK REDFERN: One of the
more interesting theories

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:27.510 align:middle line:10%
when it comes to
ancient astronauts

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:31.080 align:middle line:10%
is the idea of like a
progenitor of civilization.

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:33.720 align:middle line:10%
That's to say, something
along the lines

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:36.960 align:middle line:10%
of a very ancient
highly-advanced culture

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.780 align:middle line:10%
that sort of seeded
the universe, for

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:41.560 align:middle line:10%
want of a better term.

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at a
lot of the entities that

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:48.270 align:middle line:84%
are reported in UFO encounters
going back to, say, the '40s

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:53.190 align:middle line:84%
and '50s, we have the very
human-looking space brothers

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:54.150 align:middle line:90%
with the long hair.

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:55.740 align:middle line:84%
Which a lot of
people dismiss, but I

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:58.320 align:middle line:84%
don't write off a lot of
those stories, personally.

00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.700 align:middle line:90%
Even the Greys.

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, they don't exactly
look like us, but they--

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:06.870 align:middle line:84%
the head, two eyes,
vague nose, vague mouth,

00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:08.040 align:middle line:90%
and two arms and two legs.

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.480 align:middle line:84%
So they are, in that
sense, quite close to us.

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.989 align:middle line:84%
But what I find
interesting is that, when

00:34:12.989 --> 00:34:16.260 align:middle line:84%
you're dealing with
abductions, they very often

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:19.050 align:middle line:84%
take genetic material
from the abductees.

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:23.639 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about eggs,
sperm, DNA, skin samples.

00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:26.639 align:middle line:84%
If we were dealing
with races of entities

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:29.730 align:middle line:84%
that were totally separate,
I find it very difficult

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:34.530 align:middle line:84%
to think that our DNA and the
raw materials they need from us

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:37.170 align:middle line:84%
would be totally
compatible with them.

00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:39.060 align:middle line:84%
That, to me, is too
much of a coincidence.

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:41.100 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
why we can make

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:44.400 align:middle line:84%
a case of an ancient race
seeding the universe.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Which, depending on the
atmosphere, and the gravity,

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:49.320 align:middle line:84%
and the food, and everything
else of the relevant planet

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.389 align:middle line:84%
over millions of
years, the Greys

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:54.300 align:middle line:84%
may have developed in a
different physical fashion

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.170 align:middle line:90%
to what we have.

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:57.211 align:middle line:84%
We're totally different,
really, in many respects

00:34:57.211 --> 00:34:59.490 align:middle line:84%
to Cro-Magnon man,
or Neanderthal man.

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:01.020 align:middle line:90%
But they were still humans.

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:05.040 align:middle line:84%
But they were different builds,
their brain size was different.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.750 align:middle line:84%
So I think we could be dealing
with something like that.

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:10.810 align:middle line:84%
That civilization maybe
doesn't even exist anymore,

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:15.632 align:middle line:84%
but was the original seeding of
the universe or of the galaxy.

00:35:15.632 --> 00:35:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's our buddy Nick
Redfern, fascinating theory.

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:19.923 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: Well, we
agree with a lot of that

00:35:19.923 --> 00:35:24.370 align:middle line:84%
because we personally feel
that we are out there in space.

00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think that he was
kind of alluding to that.

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:27.370 align:middle line:90%
That you're not going to--

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: We're not really
associating the Great Pyramid

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:30.260 align:middle line:90%
with the Greys.

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:34.590 align:middle line:84%
They were beautiful people
of greater height and majesty

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:36.780 align:middle line:84%
of mind and spirit,
so we would consider

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:39.420 align:middle line:84%
them to be
extracelestials as opposed

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:42.480 align:middle line:84%
to these Greys, which
in many ways are--

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:46.270 align:middle line:84%
from the UFO community--
possible bio-robots

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:47.070 align:middle line:90%
that were created.

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:47.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE: Right.

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And so the ideas that
it's Greys or us, that's

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:51.930 align:middle line:90%
not how we see it.

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:54.254 align:middle line:84%
We see that there are
many races out in space.

00:35:54.254 --> 00:35:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And if you go to
another planet, chances

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.330 align:middle line:90%
are you're going to find us.

00:35:57.330 --> 00:36:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's really strange,
because you'd think that there

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.140 align:middle line:84%
would be a little green
man, or a grey person,

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:03.282 align:middle line:90%
but how about finding us?

00:36:03.282 --> 00:36:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: So as futurists, we
must see a positive future.

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:08.220 align:middle line:84%
We have the selective
factor to go with the higher

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.450 align:middle line:84%
architects and bio-engineers
in the universe,

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:14.210 align:middle line:84%
rather than be scared by these
other experimental lifeforms.

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
the key distinction

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:20.220 align:middle line:84%
of our work throughout the
world with university professors

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.290 align:middle line:84%
and anthropologists,
archaeologists

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:25.290 align:middle line:84%
who want to take the high road
in showing that we can judge--

00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:28.800 align:middle line:84%
to use biblical language--
we can judge the angels.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.489 align:middle line:84%
We can take the path of those
who give us real science

00:36:31.489 --> 00:36:32.780 align:middle line:90%
rather than play games with us.

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:33.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE: Yeah.

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:35.190 align:middle line:84%
So we feel we
colonized this planet.

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And almost like
"Lost in Space," we

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:39.180 align:middle line:84%
were stuck out here
for a little while,

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:40.710 align:middle line:84%
maybe in some
primitive conditions.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, more and more came
and we developed this society.

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately,
now, that's why we

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:49.170 align:middle line:84%
have people who are like
our cousins watching us.

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:52.400 align:middle line:84%
The people that saw Elizabeth
Klarer connected with her.

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.480 align:middle line:84%
She even had a baby
with them, because they

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.120 align:middle line:90%
were so close to us.

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.289 align:middle line:90%
Look just like her.

00:36:57.289 --> 00:36:58.830 align:middle line:84%
But they lived on
a different planet,

00:36:58.830 --> 00:37:01.720 align:middle line:84%
so they had a little slightly
different heart rhythm,

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:02.520 align:middle line:90%
she was told.

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.840 align:middle line:84%
So she couldn't
stay there too long

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:05.520 align:middle line:84%
if she wanted to
come back because it

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:09.062 align:middle line:84%
would have been hard on her body
to go back and forth and that--

00:37:09.062 --> 00:37:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: So the name of
the planet is Meton.

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:11.840 align:middle line:84%
It's mentioned in
"The Keys of Enoch."

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And where is that?

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:13.065 align:middle line:90%
What constellation?

00:37:13.065 --> 00:37:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE: Alpha Centauri.

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:14.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: That's
what she's claiming.

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:18.210 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting, this
happened in the '50s to her.

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And so Greys exist,
reptilians exist,

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:24.090 align:middle line:84%
praying mantises exist, but
they're all different races.

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:28.200 align:middle line:84%
When we were on this planet,
we'll say 300,000 years ago,

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:31.620 align:middle line:84%
you had Homo erectus,
you had Homo neanderthal,

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:34.530 align:middle line:84%
you had Homo naledi is now
coming in, you had Homo flores,

00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:36.930 align:middle line:90%
and now you have Denisovans.

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:39.310 align:middle line:84%
So you had five different
races living on this planet

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:39.930 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Similar but different.

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: Similar
but different.

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:42.830 align:middle line:90%
Right, exactly.

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: So our book is a
biophysical code book showing

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:50.190 align:middle line:84%
how we can be programmed,
and how we can all often

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:53.520 align:middle line:84%
participate in the
bioengineering.

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: But what we think
of who created the pyramids

00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:59.110 align:middle line:84%
were not Greys, and I think he
was actually alluding that it

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.600 align:middle line:90%
may be someone more like us.

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:03.900 align:middle line:84%
But were those who
were here to establish

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:08.039 align:middle line:84%
our race, our connection, our
Adamic specie on this planet.

00:38:08.039 --> 00:38:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Hurtak feels that
the pyramids even today

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:12.900 align:middle line:84%
are like chrono monitors,
that they're still sending out

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:15.160 align:middle line:84%
energies and beacons
about consciousness

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:18.190 align:middle line:84%
and what's happening on the
planet so that ETs can pick up.

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And I say ETs, Adamic
species as well,

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:23.660 align:middle line:84%
can pick up on what's
happening and watch the planet.

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:25.122 align:middle line:84%
We have the watchers
all around us.

00:38:25.122 --> 00:38:26.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why come here?

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.340 align:middle line:90%
Why come here to this planet?

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Was it a mission
to seed the planet?

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:31.900 align:middle line:90%
Is that what they may do?

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:34.060 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they go to
Earth-like planets

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:35.860 align:middle line:90%
all throughout the solar system?

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: Well, clearly,
there are many reasons.

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:39.456 align:middle line:84%
Some could come by
in their Lamborghinis

00:38:39.456 --> 00:38:41.560 align:middle line:84%
and stop off long
enough to take pictures

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:43.840 align:middle line:84%
of our interesting
civilizations.

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Others come here with a sense
of co-engineering with aspects

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:50.530 align:middle line:84%
of our human psyche,
our human brain material

00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:54.370 align:middle line:84%
that they need in their
respective planetary societies.

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:59.020 align:middle line:84%
Others may look upon us as
in need of scientific help.

00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And again, "The Keys" speak
of environmental change,

00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:05.680 align:middle line:84%
climate change that
requires cooperation.

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.560 align:middle line:84%
We must understand, we
are a Homo universalis,

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.910 align:middle line:90%
we are universal.

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:11.680 align:middle line:84%
Humanity waking up to
the fact that we're

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.790 align:middle line:90%
part of a cosmic family.

00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to engineer,
I believe, a new sociology

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:21.160 align:middle line:84%
and psychology that we are being
prepared to be cosmic citizens.

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And our friends are--
from the positive sense--

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:26.710 align:middle line:84%
giving us clues to
look at our ancestry

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:30.850 align:middle line:84%
where our ancestors had a much
larger astronomy and cosmology.

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And we must adapt ourselves
to new directions.

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about propulsion?

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:36.070 align:middle line:90%
How did they get in here?

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ: Hyperspace navigation.

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:38.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE: Yeah.

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:41.437 align:middle line:84%
And some of the information he
had was electromagnetic fields,

00:39:41.437 --> 00:39:42.520 align:middle line:90%
and as well as hyperspace.

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:45.280 align:middle line:84%
So even though I said
Alpha Centauri's nearby,

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:48.250 align:middle line:84%
4 or 5 light-years, it
doesn't take that long

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:50.860 align:middle line:84%
to even go to Orion, which is
like 1,000 light-years away.

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:52.693 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there's
different stars in Orion,

00:39:52.693 --> 00:39:55.840 align:middle line:84%
but even some stars of the
belt. So basically, they

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:58.060 align:middle line:84%
can take their
entire, we'll say,

00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:02.300 align:middle line:84%
gravitational field with
them and just move quickly.

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:04.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
bending space and time?

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: Well, that's why they
look so-- and we agree with Bob

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:08.050 align:middle line:90%
Lazar on this--

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:10.008 align:middle line:84%
that's why they look so
funky when they're here

00:40:10.008 --> 00:40:12.700 align:middle line:84%
in our reality, because
they can't function so well

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:14.010 align:middle line:90%
in our gravitational field.

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:16.240 align:middle line:84%
They have to be able
to get that together

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.620 align:middle line:84%
to be able to move
on to the next place.

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:21.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's really-- yeah, bending
space and time in that sense.

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:23.850 align:middle line:84%
Or we worked a lot
with remote viewing.

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And in remote viewing,
you're actually non-local.

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:29.200 align:middle line:84%
So if you can start functioning
with a non-local field,

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:31.330 align:middle line:84%
you're here and
you're also there.

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:32.720 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of teleportation.

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.720 align:middle line:10%
>>JJ: This is pointed out
in our new book called

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.310 align:middle line:10%
"Mind Dynamics in
Space and Time"

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:38.650 align:middle line:10%
with the noted physicist
Elizabeth Rauscher, who worked

00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:40.550 align:middle line:10%
at Stanford Research Institute.

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:45.020 align:middle line:84%
A 600-page book of the real
X-Files that shows the work

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:45.820 align:middle line:90%
behind the scenes--

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:47.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the one
you signed over to me.

00:40:47.650 --> 00:40:48.450 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ: That's right.

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:50.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a book that
will, shall we say,

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:55.270 align:middle line:84%
open the public's eye to things
that have gone on secretly

00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:58.240 align:middle line:84%
for many years as to the
power and potential we all

00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:01.900 align:middle line:84%
have to move matter, to open
the door of space-time reality

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:04.510 align:middle line:84%
to other dimensions,
and to understand

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:06.310 align:middle line:84%
the psychology
behind the phenomena

00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:08.380 align:middle line:84%
of these so-called
strange objects.

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:10.790 align:middle line:84%
We're interested in
the cosmic who's who.

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:12.570 align:middle line:90%
Who is behind these probes?

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:14.050 align:middle line:90%
Who is doing the research?

00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And why are some, shall we say,
considered negative as opposed

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.600 align:middle line:84%
to others that are
transformative?

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.390 align:middle line:84%
What is the spiritual
psychology, if there is any?

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:24.682 align:middle line:84%
And if that's to be defined,
do we need a new language?

00:41:24.682 --> 00:41:25.889 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE: And let's face it.

00:41:25.889 --> 00:41:27.970 align:middle line:84%
If you talk about angels
or you talk about ET,

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:30.700 align:middle line:84%
almost all of the
communication is telepathic.

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:34.090 align:middle line:84%
It's part of this
communication wave.

00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:35.340 align:middle line:90%
Now, we have that ability.

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:37.750 align:middle line:84%
That's what remote
viewing tells us.

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:40.330 align:middle line:84%
That when the remote viewers
really looked at someplace

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:42.520 align:middle line:84%
in Russia and they were
living in California,

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:45.610 align:middle line:84%
they actually didn't send
and receive a signal.

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:48.850 align:middle line:84%
From data from Russell Targ
and Elizabeth Rauscher--

00:41:48.850 --> 00:41:50.470 align:middle line:90%
who we co-wrote that book with--

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:52.810 align:middle line:84%
basically, they put
their minds there.

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:54.850 align:middle line:84%
They were already
there consciously.

00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:56.347 align:middle line:84%
And it was part of
their own field.

00:41:56.347 --> 00:41:58.930 align:middle line:84%
It's very unbelievable for us
to understand that because we're

00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:02.840 align:middle line:84%
so linear, and we use our
voice all the time to speak.

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:06.950 align:middle line:84%
But in actuality, consciousness
is a much more vast reality.

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And so with consciousness
also goes technology.

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:13.229 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: Out of consciousness,
we have the material universe,

00:42:13.229 --> 00:42:14.770 align:middle line:84%
but we also have
the mental universe.

00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're saying is
the whole concept of evolution

00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:18.790 align:middle line:84%
has to be understood
as coming out

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:21.580 align:middle line:84%
of the consciousness
of the universal mind.

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And the universal mind simply
didn't produce humans and ETs.

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:26.620 align:middle line:90%
No, there are other categories.

00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:28.930 align:middle line:84%
Extracelestials,
ultraterrestrials,

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:30.520 align:middle line:90%
even intraterrestrials.

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.080 align:middle line:84%
All of these
different categories

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:34.810 align:middle line:84%
require a whole new
biological textbook,

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:38.120 align:middle line:84%
which we're engaged in
writing with other experts.

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:40.990 align:middle line:84%
So to summarize, we are
interested in looking

00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:44.080 align:middle line:84%
behind the scenes at who is
doing the real research using

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:45.580 align:middle line:90%
the scientific method.

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:48.720 align:middle line:84%
Who is working with a
planetary understanding of what

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:50.410 align:middle line:84%
we call the pyramidal
grid system that

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:53.080 align:middle line:84%
covers all major
cultures, linking us

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:56.290 align:middle line:84%
with these pyramids as
astrophysical computers

00:42:56.290 --> 00:43:00.310 align:middle line:84%
or beacons of information that
other cosmic societies can

00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:01.360 align:middle line:90%
tap into.

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And also, we're working
with a whole understanding

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:06.230 align:middle line:90%
of a new image of humanity.

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:09.850 align:middle line:84%
What will happen to us beyond
disclosure that we are not

00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:11.110 align:middle line:90%
alone in the universe?

00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:13.780 align:middle line:84%
That we are invited to
join the family of nations

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:17.650 align:middle line:84%
of advanced ET and UT
levels of intelligence?

00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what are UTs?

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:21.880 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: Ultraterrestrials
are beyond physical form.

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Ultraterrestrials are
not subject to the laws

00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:27.450 align:middle line:84%
of thermodynamics or
physical classical science

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:28.620 align:middle line:90%
as we define it.

00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:31.510 align:middle line:84%
They are in the realm of what
we call the angelic, the higher

00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:35.500 align:middle line:84%
dimensional of the avatars,
or in the Sanskrit traditions,

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:36.790 align:middle line:90%
the mah avatars.

00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:40.720 align:middle line:84%
The superior minds who have gone
beyond evolution, and yet can

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:43.720 align:middle line:84%
activate some aspects
of human evolution.

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
in other universes?

00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: In some ways,
consciousness universes.

00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And so here we come up with
the idea of multiverse,

00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:54.545 align:middle line:84%
or multi universe as a model
of future understanding.

00:43:54.545 --> 00:43:57.370 align:middle line:10%
In fact, we wrote a scientific
paper on the internet

00:43:57.370 --> 00:43:59.936 align:middle line:10%
with Elizabeth Rauscher
called "The Multiverse"

00:43:59.936 --> 00:44:01.810 align:middle line:10%
where we go into the
mathematics and physics.

00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:05.270 align:middle line:84%
For those who are
interested, go to the website

00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:09.250 align:middle line:84%
of Future Science, or at least
call up our scientific papers.

00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:11.587 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: But what's
interesting is, these beings,

00:44:11.587 --> 00:44:14.170 align:middle line:84%
whether you're praying to God
or looking at extraterrestrials,

00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:17.290 align:middle line:84%
or even looking, in some cases,
at these ultraterrestrial

00:44:17.290 --> 00:44:19.180 align:middle line:84%
beings, in many
cases, they don't

00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:22.655 align:middle line:84%
have to come here, leave
where they are, come here.

00:44:22.655 --> 00:44:25.030 align:middle line:84%
The higher beings actually
just send their consciousness.

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And they can materialize
because it's entangled.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.520 align:middle line:84%
There's this entangled reality
in this consciousness realm

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:33.200 align:middle line:84%
of non-locality, which
scientists are now starting

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:34.000 align:middle line:90%
to understand--

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.470 align:middle line:90%
Bell's theorem, all this--

00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:38.500 align:middle line:84%
and it allows us and
them to communicate.

00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:41.112 align:middle line:84%
And we've been ignoring
that for thousands of years.

00:44:41.112 --> 00:44:42.820 align:middle line:84%
But I think the ancients
understood that.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: So we are
multidimensional beings.

00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:46.990 align:middle line:84%
We are local as
well as non-local.

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:49.370 align:middle line:84%
We can be here but
we can also be there.

00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is taking the
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen, shall

00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:56.620 align:middle line:84%
we say, paradox
into new science.

00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Realizing that we are
now opening the door

00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:01.570 align:middle line:84%
to a whole new realm of
consciousness physics

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:03.250 align:middle line:84%
whereby we'll be
able to understand

00:45:03.250 --> 00:45:05.540 align:middle line:84%
our cosmic "cousins,"
quote unquote.

00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:07.210 align:middle line:84%
We'll be able to
understand the mystery

00:45:07.210 --> 00:45:10.290 align:middle line:84%
of the Christ-like figures
in the ancient text.

00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:14.500 align:middle line:84%
We'll be able to understand our
role in a whole new development

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:16.522 align:middle line:90%
as we become cosmic citizens.

00:45:16.522 --> 00:45:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: And I have to
say, the pyramid is not just

00:45:18.730 --> 00:45:20.100 align:middle line:90%
a single-use technology.

00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:22.550 align:middle line:84%
We believe it's actually
a triple-use technology.

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:25.840 align:middle line:84%
It is a way of connecting with
the star systems of Orion.

00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:28.750 align:middle line:84%
It is a way of getting
technology, energy

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:31.240 align:middle line:84%
and gas connected with
water and hydrogen.

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:34.420 align:middle line:84%
But it is also a way of,
we'll say, initiation.

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Because I and other people
have sat in the King's Chamber,

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:39.520 align:middle line:90%
done sacred prayers and mantras.

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like
the walls go away

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:43.990 align:middle line:84%
and there's a whole new
vibratory structure that's

00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:45.520 align:middle line:90%
there that's able to augment.

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:48.610 align:middle line:84%
In fact, our sound testing
in the King's Chamber

00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:51.880 align:middle line:84%
has shown that the vibrations
that you create actually

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:54.550 align:middle line:84%
don't go up into
alternative sounds,

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:58.460 align:middle line:84%
but they go down into
creating alpha and theta waves

00:45:58.460 --> 00:45:59.260 align:middle line:90%
in your system.

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:00.910 align:middle line:84%
So you're actually
creating almost

00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:02.770 align:middle line:84%
like the Tibetan
sounds in your mind,

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:04.480 align:middle line:84%
and it puts you into
a meditative state.

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: One of our sound engineers
did the sound for the "Star

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:08.290 align:middle line:90%
Trek" series.

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:10.207 align:middle line:84%
We have had some of
the best musicologists

00:46:10.207 --> 00:46:11.290 align:middle line:90%
in the world, as you know.

00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:14.200 align:middle line:84%
Also, Carlos Santana
has worked with us.

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:17.230 align:middle line:84%
His new music illustrates
a whole new generation

00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:20.170 align:middle line:84%
of taking spiritual or
higher elevated sounds

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:24.580 align:middle line:84%
and bringing that into the
social situation of changing

00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:28.720 align:middle line:84%
our culture of death into a
culture of positive thinking,

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:29.900 align:middle line:90%
positive sound.

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:32.920 align:middle line:84%
So vibration, the
physics of acoustics,

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.840 align:middle line:84%
is also part of these pyramid
complexes throughout the world.

00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:38.930 align:middle line:84%
We believe that we are part
of a spiritual evolution.

00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:43.180 align:middle line:84%
We're going into what we call a
spiritual quantum field whereby

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:44.980 align:middle line:84%
we will be able to
understand the mysteries

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:47.110 align:middle line:84%
of the great prophets,
the great avatars,

00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:50.840 align:middle line:84%
and even the Christ figure that
influence Western civilization.

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:55.390 align:middle line:84%
Namely, we believe that there is
a type of higher consciousness

00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:58.570 align:middle line:84%
that will allow us to be
christed or anointed to think

00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:01.120 align:middle line:84%
multi-dimensionally and to work
as multidimensional beings.

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:03.286 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: But we do have
to do something ourselves.

00:47:03.286 --> 00:47:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And I like-- you said,
do we meditate more?

00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:06.490 align:middle line:90%
And yes, that would be good.

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Yoga is very popular here,
I know, with Gaia itself.

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:12.850 align:middle line:84%
So all these things help
us to get more in tune.

00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that
we're interested

00:47:15.310 --> 00:47:17.590 align:middle line:84%
in extraterrestrials, we
do believe they exist,

00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:19.450 align:middle line:84%
but we're also interested
in telling people

00:47:19.450 --> 00:47:23.230 align:middle line:84%
there is a higher beings of
light, ultraterrestrials,

00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:25.570 align:middle line:84%
angelic messengers, whatever
you want to call them.

00:47:25.570 --> 00:47:29.590 align:middle line:84%
Even a divine Godhead, which
we also believe wholeheartedly.

00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And you can work with all
those levels of intelligence,

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:33.370 align:middle line:90%
and they align you.

00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:38.230 align:middle line:84%
They help your physical body to
be more holistic, so to speak.

00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And they also help
our consciousness

00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:41.200 align:middle line:90%
to know what we should do.

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Every moment of the day,
we have decisions to make.

00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:47.300 align:middle line:84%
We have decisions that will take
us in one direction or another.

00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And these higher beings actually
can help us in our direction.

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:52.060 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's up to us.

00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:54.880 align:middle line:84%
We have free will on
everything that we have to do.

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:58.600 align:middle line:84%
But it's also ability that
we have within ourselves

00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:00.221 align:middle line:90%
to go in a divine direction.

00:48:00.221 --> 00:48:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
agree with that, JJ?

00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ: Yes, I do.

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:05.890 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we had the privilege of
working with the late astronaut

00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Gordon Cooper and also
astronaut Edgar Mitchell.

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, both of
them were believers in ETs.

00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Gordon saw things,
Edgar did not.

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:15.120 align:middle line:84%
He always told me he
never saw anything

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:16.890 align:middle line:84%
on the moon or
anything, but he was

00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:20.670 align:middle line:84%
told by people within government
that we're being visited.

00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:23.130 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: I showed him a document
of three vehicles that were

00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:25.080 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of the moon.

00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And he blinked when he
saw this, which is to say,

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:30.630 align:middle line:84%
there's more to the story
than that was officially

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:31.630 align:middle line:90%
released over the years.

00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:33.171 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE: And of
course, Buzz Aldrin

00:48:33.171 --> 00:48:34.921 align:middle line:84%
was someone who also
has come out slightly

00:48:34.921 --> 00:48:35.920 align:middle line:90%
with some understanding.

00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:37.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Slightly, slightly.

00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:39.840 align:middle line:84%
He said it's unidentified,
but he said not

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:41.744 align:middle line:90%
necessarily extraterrestrial.

00:48:41.744 --> 00:48:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: Astronaut Gordon Cooper
and I participated in a book

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:48.030 align:middle line:84%
by the famous American
novelist Sidney Sheldon called

00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:53.460 align:middle line:84%
"Doomsday Conspiracy," and we
go into a fictional account

00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:56.190 align:middle line:84%
of a real story of an
American intelligence

00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:58.590 align:middle line:84%
agent who met with
a extraterrestrial

00:48:58.590 --> 00:48:59.430 align:middle line:90%
in Switzerland.

00:48:59.430 --> 00:49:01.470 align:middle line:10%
And so what we're
saying is, even

00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:04.950 align:middle line:10%
within the camp of the
pioneers of outer space--

00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:07.620 align:middle line:10%
Gordy Cooper and others--
there is a understanding

00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:09.690 align:middle line:10%
that we're being
prepared cosmically

00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:15.370 align:middle line:10%
to pick our place in the greater
role of humanity of the future.

00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:17.730 align:middle line:84%
We are a space-born
intelligence.

00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:19.230 align:middle line:84%
According to the
Greeks, we come out

00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:21.600 align:middle line:84%
of the logos
spermatikos, the sperm

00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:22.920 align:middle line:90%
or the seeds of evolution.

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:24.810 align:middle line:84%
We are shaped by
divine forces, we

00:49:24.810 --> 00:49:28.020 align:middle line:84%
are here to enjoy this life
for a short period of time,

00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:30.480 align:middle line:84%
after which we go back
into the consciousness

00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:32.610 align:middle line:84%
vehicle from which
we've come, or life

00:49:32.610 --> 00:49:34.770 align:middle line:90%
after life, the eternal self.

00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:39.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is amazing that I
think the Bible makes reference

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:42.690 align:middle line:84%
to angels which could
be extraterrestrial.

00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Does not negate the
belief in God by any

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.550 align:middle line:84%
means, but I think that's
what they're talking about.

00:49:47.550 --> 00:49:48.350 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:49:48.350 --> 00:49:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: Well, the late
Dr. Billy Graham

00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:55.320 align:middle line:84%
mentioned that UFOs may be
God's secret angels or agents,

00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:58.290 align:middle line:84%
implying that there's more
to biblical cosmology.

00:49:58.290 --> 00:50:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And part of my work
is to show that many

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.570 align:middle line:84%
of the biblical stories have a
higher understanding in terms

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:06.370 align:middle line:84%
of the consciousness
physics of life.

00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And as we evolve
ourselves, as we

00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:11.340 align:middle line:84%
begin to realize we
are non-local beings,

00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:14.640 align:middle line:84%
we begin to understand what the
ancient scriptures speak of.

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:16.980 align:middle line:84%
They speak of higher
states of awareness

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:19.320 align:middle line:84%
through which we should
we go into dialogue

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:21.450 align:middle line:90%
with the divine process of life.

00:50:21.450 --> 00:50:23.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
believe angels are ETs?

00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:25.960 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: I believe
that the angels are

00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:27.990 align:middle line:84%
of different categories,
some of which

00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:30.660 align:middle line:84%
would be more ultraterrestrial
rather than ETs.

00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:32.040 align:middle line:90%
I make that distinction.

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Angels are beyond
physical technology.

00:50:34.590 --> 00:50:38.520 align:middle line:84%
The physical technology of
ETs can break down in space.

00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Has to be, shall we say,
repaired from time to time.

00:50:41.490 --> 00:50:44.440 align:middle line:84%
The angelic dimension is a
whole category by itself.

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:46.020 align:middle line:84%
So this is the new
face of science

00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:47.220 align:middle line:90%
that we need to look at.

00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:49.085 align:middle line:84%
The ultraterrestrial physics
of universal intelligence.

00:50:49.085 --> 00:50:49.390 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE: Right.

00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:51.348 align:middle line:84%
And that's what he saw
with Enoch and Metatron.

00:50:51.348 --> 00:50:53.160 align:middle line:84%
His body was only taken
to a certain point.

00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And then beyond that, there
was a energy body or light

00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:58.950 align:middle line:84%
body that was taken by
Metatron to higher realms.

00:50:58.950 --> 00:51:01.170 align:middle line:84%
So there's different
levels of intelligence.

00:51:01.170 --> 00:51:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of our work,
to expand our cosmology

00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:06.030 align:middle line:84%
not just to
extraterrestrials, but

00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:07.980 align:middle line:90%
to multidimensional realities.

00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does this tell
you about this planet in whole?

00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:13.950 align:middle line:84%
Everything we've talked about
in "Beyond Belief" today?

00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: It tells us that this
planet is a schoolhouse,

00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:18.990 align:middle line:84%
and we're here for a
certain amount of years

00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:21.420 align:middle line:84%
to acquire the
knowledge we will need

00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:24.060 align:middle line:84%
in the next phase
of cosmic evolution.

00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And in our research, we
have come to the point

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:29.190 align:middle line:84%
that the doors to
the cosmic university

00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:30.870 align:middle line:90%
are beginning to open.

00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Our friends from outer
space have been cautious--

00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:36.420 align:middle line:84%
those that are positive--
in keeping us aware

00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:38.040 align:middle line:90%
that there is more to come.

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing
now the combination

00:51:39.810 --> 00:51:41.840 align:middle line:84%
of what we would call
spiritual evolution

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:43.140 align:middle line:90%
and scientific evolution.

00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:44.640 align:middle line:90%
They're both coming together.

00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:46.766 align:middle line:84%
A whole new realm
of possibilities

00:51:46.766 --> 00:51:49.020 align:middle line:90%
is suddenly being open to us.

00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:50.880 align:middle line:84%
But we must be
very careful in how

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:55.890 align:middle line:84%
we use our positive energy in
association with many societies

00:51:55.890 --> 00:51:56.929 align:middle line:90%
in outer space.

00:51:56.929 --> 00:51:58.220 align:middle line:90%
We have to take the upper path.

00:51:58.220 --> 00:51:58.490 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE: Right.

00:51:58.490 --> 00:51:59.948 align:middle line:84%
And I would say
the important thing

00:51:59.948 --> 00:52:01.770 align:middle line:84%
for people is to
realize we're not alone.

00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And that gives hope
to people that there

00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:06.660 align:middle line:84%
is a future, whether
it's in the physical body

00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:10.290 align:middle line:84%
or in a consciousness higher
body, we have potential.

00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And that we're being
watched and guided,

00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:14.760 align:middle line:84%
technology is being given,
consciousness, ideas,

00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:16.510 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
is being given.

00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:19.860 align:middle line:84%
We have to choose, of course,
but individually, we all

00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:21.000 align:middle line:90%
have a greater potential.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.874 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It could scare
other people, though.

00:52:22.874 --> 00:52:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Dr. David Jacobs believes
that these visitations are not

00:52:26.170 --> 00:52:26.970 align:middle line:90%
friendly.

00:52:26.970 --> 00:52:28.053 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ: He's a good scholar.

00:52:28.053 --> 00:52:29.430 align:middle line:90%
He's a good scientist.

00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And I believe there's
a certain percentage

00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:34.514 align:middle line:84%
of those from other worlds
that we have to be careful of.

00:52:34.514 --> 00:52:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, in
our research, we

00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:39.570 align:middle line:84%
have used, as it were, the
linguistics of the names of God

00:52:39.570 --> 00:52:41.100 align:middle line:90%
used by the prophets.

00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:44.590 align:middle line:84%
The great thinkers,
the great teachers.

00:52:44.590 --> 00:52:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And you see in
prophetic language,

00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:49.650 align:middle line:84%
we believe that there
is a preparation of how

00:52:49.650 --> 00:52:51.806 align:middle line:84%
we can screen or how we
can prepare ourselves

00:52:51.806 --> 00:52:54.180 align:middle line:84%
for different levels of mental
and physical conversation.

00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:54.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE: Right.

00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:56.290 align:middle line:84%
It's like a cosmic
telephone number.

00:52:56.290 --> 00:52:58.560 align:middle line:84%
If you have the right codes,
you call in those beings

00:52:58.560 --> 00:52:59.880 align:middle line:90%
that are more like you.

00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Whereas others are connected
with different types of beings.

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And there are other various
energies in the universe.

00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Just like you'd be attracting
people on this planet,

00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:09.647 align:middle line:84%
you want the really good
guys that are here to help,

00:53:09.647 --> 00:53:11.730 align:middle line:84%
or you want the guys that
are robbing and stealing

00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:12.530 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:14.770 align:middle line:84%
So you have that reality
in the local universe.

00:53:14.770 --> 00:53:16.930 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
ancient book of Enoch

00:53:16.930 --> 00:53:19.180 align:middle line:84%
even talked about, that
the local heavens actually

00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:21.180 align:middle line:90%
have these different realities.

00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:23.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So we have
nothing to fear?

00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: Well we have fear itself,
as the late President Roosevelt

00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:27.250 align:middle line:90%
said.

00:53:27.250 --> 00:53:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: But in terms of being
in the image of the divine,

00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:32.620 align:middle line:84%
in terms of having,
as it were, a higher

00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:36.730 align:middle line:84%
understanding of the scriptural
truths of all great cultures,

00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:39.730 align:middle line:84%
and the understanding of having
a wonderful heart that feels

00:53:39.730 --> 00:53:42.460 align:middle line:84%
compassion, love for
humanity, I feel we take

00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:46.570 align:middle line:84%
a step beyond the fear
dimension into the light,

00:53:46.570 --> 00:53:49.090 align:middle line:84%
into the glory of
God's presence,

00:53:49.090 --> 00:53:51.910 align:middle line:84%
and the recognition of what
he meant when he said he sent

00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:54.580 align:middle line:84%
the Christ into this
world to remind us

00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:57.640 align:middle line:84%
that we have a house of many
mansions to prepare for.

00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:00.936 align:middle line:84%
Why would this higher cosmology
be given, even symbolically,

00:54:00.936 --> 00:54:02.560 align:middle line:84%
if there were not
essential truths that

00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:05.020 align:middle line:84%
were there in the ancient
prophetic language?

00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:11.740 align:middle line:84%
So whether we use the Greek
traditions of [GREEK],, eternity

00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:14.470 align:middle line:84%
after eternity, whether
we use the Hebrew Aramaic,

00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:17.050 align:middle line:84%
or for that matter, the
Eastern Oriental languages that

00:54:17.050 --> 00:54:20.170 align:middle line:84%
speak of the celestial
realms of creation,

00:54:20.170 --> 00:54:22.420 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
great incentive for us

00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:24.970 align:middle line:84%
to engineer a positive
future by taking, as it were,

00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:28.280 align:middle line:84%
a positive look at new
science, psychology,

00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:30.442 align:middle line:84%
sociology, with
the ability to open

00:54:30.442 --> 00:54:32.650 align:middle line:84%
the back door to the Old
Testament and the front door

00:54:32.650 --> 00:54:34.780 align:middle line:84%
to the New Testament,
realizing that we're

00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:37.690 align:middle line:84%
on the edge of the greatest
moment of human history.

00:54:37.690 --> 00:54:40.660 align:middle line:84%
Realizing there are
greater positive forces

00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:41.830 align:middle line:90%
than the few negative.

00:54:41.830 --> 00:54:42.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE: Right.

00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And in "The Keys of
Enoch," when he was given

00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:46.540 align:middle line:84%
this information--
saw it-- he actually

00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:49.950 align:middle line:84%
understood that it was
in 64 areas of science.

00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:53.020 align:middle line:84%
So that our genetics are
advancing so we understand

00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:56.920 align:middle line:84%
our cosmic others, our astronomy
is advancing so we understand

00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:59.780 align:middle line:84%
the heavenly realms, and even
our history, our knowledge--

00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:03.910 align:middle line:84%
look, you have 130,000-year-old
evidence of mastodon bones

00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:07.240 align:middle line:84%
and beings, people,
living in San Diego,

00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:09.355 align:middle line:84%
as you know from
that recent find--

00:55:09.355 --> 00:55:11.350 align:middle line:90%
so that we understand our past.

00:55:11.350 --> 00:55:13.420 align:middle line:84%
That we're not just
6,000 years old,

00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:16.690 align:middle line:84%
or not even just 40,000
or 400,000 years old.

00:55:16.690 --> 00:55:18.660 align:middle line:84%
Chances are we're
actually cosmic.

00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:21.040 align:middle line:84%
So this is part of
the information.

00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And when information
comes into our reality,

00:55:23.950 --> 00:55:26.440 align:middle line:84%
people pick up on it,
and people run with it.

00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:28.940 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: Future science is science
guided by consciousness.

00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And so our work is to emphasize
the consciousness side of what

00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:36.130 align:middle line:84%
all this new science means, of
remote viewing, remote healing,

00:55:36.130 --> 00:55:38.140 align:middle line:84%
remote communication,
and the ability

00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:41.130 align:middle line:84%
to co-engineer with
our cosmic counterparts

00:55:41.130 --> 00:55:43.720 align:middle line:84%
a new cosmology that we're
not alone in the universe,

00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:46.385 align:middle line:84%
and we have responsibilities
as a planetary society

00:55:46.385 --> 00:55:49.630 align:middle line:84%
of helping all humanity to
make this quantum change.

00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:52.065 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give our "Beyond
Belief" audience your website

00:55:52.065 --> 00:55:53.977 align:middle line:90%
and how they can track you.

00:55:53.977 --> 00:55:55.560 align:middle line:10%
>>DESIREE: Well, we
have two websites.

00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:58.450 align:middle line:10%
keysofenoch.org
is our main site,

00:55:58.450 --> 00:56:00.700 align:middle line:10%
and we also have
futurescience.org,

00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:03.070 align:middle line:10%
because we always think
there's going to be a future

00:56:03.070 --> 00:56:04.900 align:middle line:10%
and science is part of it.

00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:07.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ: We have many books
and many music experiences

00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:11.680 align:middle line:84%
with some of the legendary
minds and musicians like Alice

00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:15.280 align:middle line:84%
Coltrane, Jocelyn
Smith from Berlin,

00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:17.590 align:middle line:84%
Steven Halpern from
the United States.

00:56:17.590 --> 00:56:20.680 align:middle line:10%
Some of the great musicians are
using the sacred expressions

00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:24.100 align:middle line:10%
or experiences that
allowed me to see briefly

00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:25.884 align:middle line:10%
the other side, that
we're not alone,

00:56:25.884 --> 00:56:27.300 align:middle line:10%
and there are
beings of light, not

00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:29.620 align:middle line:10%
extraterrestrial but
ultraterrestrials who

00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:32.030 align:middle line:10%
provide for us now this
greater education that we're

00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:32.830 align:middle line:10%
going into.

00:56:32.830 --> 00:56:33.670 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:35.320 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:36.120 align:middle line:10%
>>JJ: Thank you.

00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:38.950 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Isn't it an incredible
theory, the possibilities

00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:42.340 align:middle line:10%
that we've been visited not
just from extraterrestrials

00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:47.180 align:middle line:10%
from other planetary systems,
but now from other universes?

00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:49.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, thanks for
watching "Beyond Belief."

00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:52.590 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:56:52.590 --> 00:56:56.448 align:middle line:90%
