00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.382 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.382 --> 00:00:08.840 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.165 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:11.165 --> 00:00:13.590 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.766 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.255 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:26.449 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:28.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.010 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.439 align:middle line:10%
You know, one of my favorite
holiday songs-- "Hark,

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.740 align:middle line:10%
the Herald Angels Sing."

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.820 align:middle line:90%
It's a great song.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.460 align:middle line:90%
You need to go listen to it.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.630 align:middle line:84%
But it has some
incredible information

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.910 align:middle line:84%
deep within that song that
deals with the angelic realm.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.160 align:middle line:90%
Who are angels?

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.030 align:middle line:90%
What they are here for.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.710 align:middle line:90%
And what their purpose is.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And with us today,
Radleigh Valentine.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.089 align:middle line:84%
I guess I could say you're
an expert in angels.

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.547 align:middle line:84%
>>RADLEIGH VALENTINE:
I think I am.

00:00:57.547 --> 00:00:58.521 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:58.521 --> 00:01:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
this happen for you?

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.097 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: It was a journey.

00:01:02.097 --> 00:01:03.180 align:middle line:90%
A little bit of a journey.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.464 align:middle line:10%
But it was a beautiful journey.

00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:07.600 align:middle line:10%
You know, my first real
experience, I think,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.310 align:middle line:10%
with knowing my guardian
angel-- whose name is Joshua--

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.359 align:middle line:10%
that he was around was I
was walking through a house.

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:16.650 align:middle line:90%
And I had purchased this house.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And I had this sense that
there was something in it.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And every time I would
walk through the house,

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.680 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was
bumping into something.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something bad?

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Well,
it was scaring me

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.040 align:middle line:84%
because I was inexperienced
and uneducated.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.940 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
to think about it.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And so a friend of
mine, very wise friend,

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.930 align:middle line:84%
said, well, what makes you
think it's something bad?

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.690 align:middle line:84%
You have angels all over
your house on the walls.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.190 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's your angel.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.380 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh, wow!

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.040 align:middle line:90%
That's a really great point.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.370 align:middle line:84%
So one day, I just literally
sat down on the edge of my bed.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at my
favorite angel painting.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.930 align:middle line:90%
And I said, you seem to know me.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.410 align:middle line:90%
I don't know you.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.910 align:middle line:90%
I'd really like to know you.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.530 align:middle line:90%
Let's start with your name.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And I heard crystal
clear as a bell, Joshua.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.244 align:middle line:90%
And it scared me.

00:02:02.244 --> 00:02:03.910 align:middle line:84%
I was like, OK, that's
enough for today.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:04.493 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa!

00:02:04.493 --> 00:02:05.387 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:05.387 --> 00:02:06.970 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: We'll
play more tomorrow.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.139 align:middle line:84%
But I literally had
a dream that night

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.310 align:middle line:84%
that was my favorite
dream of my entire life.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.930 align:middle line:90%
It's never been topped.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was a vivid moment
where I was in a store

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.730 align:middle line:84%
by the seashore where they
sold shells and things.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.370 align:middle line:90%
And I was walking around.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.820 align:middle line:90%
And Joshua came around.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.450 align:middle line:90%
And we saw each other.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.970 align:middle line:90%
And we ran.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:31.675 align:middle line:90%
And we embraced.

00:02:31.675 --> 00:02:32.646 align:middle line:90%
And we laughed.

00:02:32.646 --> 00:02:33.520 align:middle line:90%
And we were laughing.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was as though you'd just
found your best friend again.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.850 align:middle line:84%
You hadn't seen each
other in forever.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly in the dream,
I realized this is real.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm not dreaming.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.230 align:middle line:90%
This is real.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.350 align:middle line:90%
This is really happening.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.599 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You made that happen.

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: And
then [POP] suddenly

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.740 align:middle line:90%
I was back in my bed and stuff.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.930 align:middle line:84%
But those two
things, that did it.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.500 align:middle line:90%
That clicked it for me.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And Josh is always with me, just
like anyone's guardian angels

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.800 align:middle line:90%
are always with them.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.050 align:middle line:84%
Almost everybody
has at least two.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Usually you've got one that's
kind of loud, and pushy,

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.100 align:middle line:90%
and really helps you.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.820 align:middle line:90%
That would be Josh.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And another one that's more
soothing, more comforting,

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.200 align:middle line:90%
more peaceful.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which one would
save you from, let's say,

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.537 align:middle line:90%
a car accident?

00:03:19.537 --> 00:03:20.370 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Joshua.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.119 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He would.

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:21.890 align:middle line:90%
He'd step in.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:22.210 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yes.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.660 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I actually have a
really cool story about that.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.540 align:middle line:84%
There was a woman
who was in a car.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.320 align:middle line:90%
And she hit a railing.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.190 align:middle line:90%
And her car went flying.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.530 align:middle line:90%
And it landed.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And a whole bunch
of people saw it.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.840 align:middle line:90%
And she was not harmed.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.040 align:middle line:84%
She was within inches
of other things

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.160 align:middle line:84%
that would have really hurt
her when the car landed.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.290 align:middle line:84%
But the car hardly
had a scratch on it.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And all of these people
came running to help her.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.120 align:middle line:84%
And there were 12
witnesses to this-- 12.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And those witnesses said,
well, where's the passenger?

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.810 align:middle line:84%
Where's the other person
that was in the car with you?

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And she said, there was
no one in the car with me.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.057 align:middle line:84%
And she was like--
but they all saw.

00:04:00.057 --> 00:04:01.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They saw
somebody else there.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: They saw somebody
else in the car with her.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And for her, from that
moment forward, she was like,

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.610 align:middle line:90%
I believe in angels now.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:08.459 align:middle line:90%
I believe in angles.

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When I open up
our phone lines at "Coast

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.750 align:middle line:84%
to Coast," we get
incredible stories

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.020 align:middle line:90%
about angels and miracles.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.459 align:middle line:84%
And one that I will
just never forget,

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Radleigh, it came
from a truck driver.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And he told me that as he was
driving around this curvy road,

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.950 align:middle line:90%
he was dozing off.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And he's driving and trying
to snap himself back awake.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And he said, George,
I just, I fell asleep.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.510 align:middle line:84%
I was going over
the edge of a cliff.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I woke up
to a jar that something

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.230 align:middle line:84%
had pulled my steering
wheel back onto the road.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And I saw a hand on
the steering wheel.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.240 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't mine.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.820 align:middle line:90%
And I was saved.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.620 align:middle line:90%
I woke up.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.180 align:middle line:90%
I grabbed the wheel.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.490 align:middle line:90%
And I contained myself.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.570 align:middle line:84%
I stopped, woke up a little
bit, and then I was fine.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.469 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who that
hand belonged to.

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Right.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was
nobody else in the cab.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.902 align:middle line:84%
That's got to be
his guardian angel.

00:05:09.902 --> 00:05:11.110 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Of course it is.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure of it.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm certain of it.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And you know the
thing about angels

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.180 align:middle line:84%
is that you usually have
to ask for their help

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.670 align:middle line:84%
to get their help but not in
life threatening situations.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.490 align:middle line:84%
In life threatening
situations and in emergencies,

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.740 align:middle line:84%
the angelic realm
has the ability

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.470 align:middle line:84%
to intervene, to just
suddenly stop in and help out.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.920 align:middle line:84%
I know another woman who
was-- she lived in Phoenix.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
dried riverbed.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Her and her friends
had been walking

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.670 align:middle line:90%
that dried riverbed for years.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.160 align:middle line:90%
No big deal.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.077 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly this man
walked up to her and said,

00:05:47.077 --> 00:05:48.660 align:middle line:84%
you've got to get
out of the riverbed.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.160 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be
a flood of water.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.030 align:middle line:90%
Well, this was August.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.020 align:middle line:90%
And she's like, you're crazy.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're nuts.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.930 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Right.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's dry.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: And
he's like, no, you

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.350 align:middle line:90%
have to get out of the riverbed.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.564 align:middle line:90%
And he would not be calmed down.

00:05:58.564 --> 00:05:59.480 align:middle line:90%
And so she said, fine.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.730 align:middle line:90%
We'll get out of the riverbed.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.762 align:middle line:84%
And almost the
moment that they did,

00:06:02.762 --> 00:06:03.970 align:middle line:90%
water came flying down there.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:04.886 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Rushing down.

00:06:04.886 --> 00:06:05.570 align:middle line:90%
Rushing down.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.060 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Right.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.143 align:middle line:84%
And she turned around to
say thank you to the man.

00:06:08.143 --> 00:06:09.340 align:middle line:90%
And there was no man.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's gone.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.445 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Gone.

00:06:10.445 --> 00:06:10.986 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep.

00:06:10.986 --> 00:06:14.100 align:middle line:84%
I hear stories like that
time and time again.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.300 align:middle line:90%
They're there.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.160 align:middle line:90%
What are angels anyway?

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.760 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Angels
are messengers.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.560 align:middle line:90%
They're God's messengers.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.300 align:middle line:84%
There are guardian
angels, which are

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.820 align:middle line:84%
the ones that are assigned
to us at all times.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.210 align:middle line:84%
There are archangels, which are
the next realm up of angels who

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.300 align:middle line:84%
oversee planet
Earth and come in.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.480 align:middle line:90%
They have specialties.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.180 align:middle line:90%
Each one has a specialty.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.840 align:middle line:84%
I work a lot with
Archangel Uriel.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And his specialty
is emotional healing

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.610 align:middle line:84%
but also brilliant
ideas, bright,

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.510 align:middle line:84%
amazing ideas that
he can give you.

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.550 align:middle line:84%
So angels are
messengers from God.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:51.880 align:middle line:90%
They are meant to help us.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.700 align:middle line:90%
That is their purpose.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.680 align:middle line:84%
Some people get a
little whacked out

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.060 align:middle line:84%
about the whole concept
of talking to angels.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.010 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, well, shouldn't
we be talking straight to God?

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:03.280 align:middle line:90%
Are you worshipping angels?

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:03.975 align:middle line:90%
And we are not.

00:07:03.975 --> 00:07:04.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.570 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: I mean we're not.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:11.360 align:middle line:84%
God created the angels to be
of assistance to us as a gift.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little bit
ungrateful to not use that gift

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:16.130 align:middle line:90%
whenever you can.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When the universe
was put together--

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:19.160 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yeah.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By this higher power--

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.640 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yes.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were the
angels put there then?

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.660 align:middle line:90%
How long have they been around?

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.311 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: I
think that-- I don't

00:07:29.311 --> 00:07:31.560 align:middle line:84%
know how to answer the
question of when God showed up.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.020 align:middle line:90%
But there was God.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And then I think
there were angels.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.980 align:middle line:90%
And then I think there was us.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And the other usses on other
planets and other places

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.240 align:middle line:90%
throughout the universe.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.780 align:middle line:84%
I think that I believe-- my
personal belief system is

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.920 align:middle line:84%
that angels exist
on every world.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And they're sort of like
the common denominator--

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:51.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.085 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: That we have.

00:07:53.085 --> 00:07:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you think the
same angels exist everywhere?

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.150 align:middle line:84%
Let's say there are a million
planetary systems, all

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:00.750 align:middle line:90%
inhabited.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:03.320 align:middle line:84%
The same Joshua is
handling other people too?

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.739 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: No, Joshua's
mine. [LAUGHTER] I lay

00:08:05.739 --> 00:08:06.405 align:middle line:90%
claim to Joshua.

00:08:06.405 --> 00:08:08.488 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well then, how
many angels must there be?

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:11.030 align:middle line:84%
There's 6 billion people
here on this planet.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE:
Uncountable numbers.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:12.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 300 million Americans.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Right.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:13.350 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:14.690 align:middle line:90%
Uncountable numbers.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:15.790 align:middle line:90%
Unaccountable numbers.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:16.860 align:middle line:90%
And you cannot count the angels.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One for
each human being?

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: I think
two for each human being

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.810 align:middle line:84%
plus whatever else, what
other worlds are out there.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:28.120 align:middle line:84%
Now the archangel realm,
as we understand it,

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.350 align:middle line:84%
and the information that my
beautiful co-author, Doreen

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Virtue, has brought to
the world, the archangels

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.929 align:middle line:84%
that we mostly talk about
are protecting Earth.

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:40.730 align:middle line:90%
But there are other archangels.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:44.810 align:middle line:84%
There would be other
archangels on other worlds.

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Especially Archangel Michael
who is assigned to planet Earth

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.430 align:middle line:90%
very specifically.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now you
mentioned Doreen Virtue.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:52.430 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yes.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.388 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And of course
you the book with Doreen

00:08:54.388 --> 00:08:57.150 align:middle line:84%
called The Big Book
of Angel Tarot.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:57.859 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yes.

00:08:57.859 --> 00:09:00.066 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're going to talk
about tarot in a second.

00:09:00.066 --> 00:09:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to ask you to
pull some world events for us.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:02.620 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: OK.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:02.910 align:middle line:90%
Let's do that.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:03.909 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With the tarot.

00:09:03.909 --> 00:09:05.256 align:middle line:90%
But tell me about this work.

00:09:05.256 --> 00:09:06.006 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Sure.

00:09:06.006 --> 00:09:09.979 align:middle line:84%
Well, this came after the
cards, the deck of cards.

00:09:09.979 --> 00:09:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What came first?

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.530 align:middle line:90%
The tarot cards or the book?

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.930 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: The tarot
cards came first.

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:17.690 align:middle line:84%
They have been very,
very successful.

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And people's curiosity about
them has just been unlimited.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And whenever you pull a card,
there's symbolism in that card.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And so people were just
writing to us constantly

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:33.840 align:middle line:84%
to say, well, what
does that mean?

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.447 align:middle line:84%
Why are there four
little elements?

00:09:35.447 --> 00:09:36.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Why is
the Archangel Michael

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:38.440 align:middle line:90%
holding two wands?

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.100 align:middle line:90%
What does that all mean?

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.862 align:middle line:84%
And so we realized
very quickly--

00:09:42.862 --> 00:09:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's what
you needed that for.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.028 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: That we were going
to have to write this book.

00:09:47.028 --> 00:09:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And this book talks not only
about a brief history of tarot

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:51.720 align:middle line:90%
because, snore.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.310 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:54.100 align:middle line:90%
So brief history.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.810 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.227 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it
like a study guide?

00:09:58.227 --> 00:10:00.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Well, it
is like a study guide.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.780 align:middle line:84%
But it's also about
tarot in general.

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:06.480 align:middle line:84%
It's like how it works, why it
works, how to create spreads.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Some of the information like
about the astrology of a card.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:12.970 align:middle line:90%
That's true in all tarot decks.

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And so we talked
about the astrology.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:16.950 align:middle line:84%
We talked about the
numerology of the cards.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.510 align:middle line:90%
It's all in the book.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.957 align:middle line:84%
So that someone
can know everything

00:10:20.957 --> 00:10:22.665 align:middle line:84%
there is to know about
angel tarot cards.

00:10:22.665 --> 00:10:26.280 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of this would be
true for any tarot deck.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have taken out
the fear factor in tarot cards,

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.200 align:middle line:90%
haven't you?

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.330 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: That's the
kindest thing, George,

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.530 align:middle line:84%
that anybody can
possibly say to me.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:36.640 align:middle line:90%
Is that.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.290 align:middle line:90%
So, thank you.

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:40.180 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that is what we have done.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.290 align:middle line:84%
The cards-- and not
just the fear, but also

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:44.400 align:middle line:90%
the embarrassment.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.320 align:middle line:84%
The first card in traditional
tarot is the Fool.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:47.820 align:middle line:90%
Well--

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.195 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who wants
to pull that card?

00:10:49.195 --> 00:10:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Who wants
to pull that card?

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:51.929 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't even
mean that you're

00:10:51.929 --> 00:10:53.470 align:middle line:90%
doing something stupid anyway.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.770 align:middle line:84%
It does mean take
a leap of faith.

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:58.670 align:middle line:84%
It does mean go
after what you want.

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And so we renamed
that card the Dreamer.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And we did it for
various reasons.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.790 align:middle line:90%
First of all, be a dreamer.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Dream what you
want, and go get it.

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:10.710 align:middle line:84%
But also, there's that aspect
of the fact that aren't we

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:12.410 align:middle line:90%
all dreaming anyway?

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:13.730 align:middle line:90%
Isn't this one big dream?

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are-- we're
living in a dream, I think.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Living in a dream.

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.090 align:middle line:90%
I believe that.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:18.420 align:middle line:90%
I think we are.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.220 align:middle line:84%
A beautiful, wonderful,
exciting dream.

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And so we renamed
it the Dreamer.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:27.139 align:middle line:84%
We renamed the Devil
card to be Ego.

00:11:27.139 --> 00:11:28.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How about Death?

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:29.210 align:middle line:90%
Is Death in there?

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:30.460 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Death is in here.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.659 align:middle line:90%
We renamed it Release.

00:11:31.659 --> 00:11:32.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Eee!

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: [LAUGHTER]
And then there

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:38.030 align:middle line:84%
were some cards that
had names that we

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.440 align:middle line:84%
changed not because
it was scary.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.189 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing really scary
about the word temperance.

00:11:43.189 --> 00:11:44.480 align:middle line:90%
But nobody knows what it means.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:45.400 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.710 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: The Hierophant.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:48.130 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows what it means.

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:51.650 align:middle line:84%
So we renamed those cards
to be Unity and Balance.

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Because those are words
that people can understand.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:56.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How old
are tarot cards?

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: About
600 years we think.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.960 align:middle line:90%
That's as far back as we can go.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.002 align:middle line:84%
First of all, that's as
far back as we get paper.

00:12:05.002 --> 00:12:06.334 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were they serious then?

00:12:06.334 --> 00:12:07.470 align:middle line:90%
Or was it entertainment?

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:08.886 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: It
was entertainment.

00:12:08.886 --> 00:12:09.516 align:middle line:90%
It was a--

00:12:09.516 --> 00:12:10.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Parlor game.

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:12.121 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Parlor
game called tarrochi.

00:12:12.121 --> 00:12:12.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: That was
very much like bridge.

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everybody would just
come over to somebody's place

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.010 align:middle line:90%
and they played that.

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it
was really big.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:18.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.170 align:middle line:90%
It was really huge in Italy.

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And then when the
French invaded Milan,

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:27.910 align:middle line:84%
they were like, oh,
we want on board.

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.285 align:middle line:90%
We want a piece of this.

00:12:29.285 --> 00:12:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do you think the
parties would have that one

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.310 align:middle line:90%
special reader there?

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:33.869 align:middle line:90%
That person?

00:12:33.869 --> 00:12:36.160 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: I don't think
that happened until a couple

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.105 align:middle line:90%
hundred years later.

00:12:37.105 --> 00:12:37.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.711 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Because I really
think that they were just

00:12:39.711 --> 00:12:41.660 align:middle line:84%
playing the game
tarot, tarrochi,

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:45.070 align:middle line:84%
and using the trump cards and
having a really great time.

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It seems a
little safer than poker.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Yes.
[LAUGHTER] Perhaps.

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:49.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:50.750 align:middle line:90%
Let's shuffle them up.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:51.055 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: OK.

00:12:51.055 --> 00:12:51.570 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:53.945 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we're going to
talk about some world events.

00:12:53.945 --> 00:12:55.132 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: All right.

00:12:55.132 --> 00:12:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
cards do you need

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:59.584 align:middle line:84%
to pull for each event
I'm going to give you?

00:12:59.584 --> 00:13:00.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: We'll do three.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.760 align:middle line:84%
You can usually get some
information by three cards.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.417 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:13:04.417 --> 00:13:05.000 align:middle line:90%
We'll do that.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:05.285 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: OK.

00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You'll shuffle them up.

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:07.020 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: OK.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.165 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then you're
going to pick the cards.

00:13:08.165 --> 00:13:08.520 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yep.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: After I
tell you the event.

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Sure.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:10.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:11.130 align:middle line:90%
You ready?

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:11.840 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yes

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:12.631 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:13:12.631 --> 00:13:15.830 align:middle line:84%
First event will
be World War III.

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:17.578 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Oh, dear gosh.

00:13:17.578 --> 00:13:19.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't hold back.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: All right.

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:20.410 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what we get.

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then we'll
hold them up right there.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:22.623 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yes, we will.

00:13:22.623 --> 00:13:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So everybody
in our viewing audience

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.204 align:middle line:90%
can see what these are.

00:13:27.204 --> 00:13:27.870 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: OK.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: World War III.

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: The first
card is nine of fire.

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And this is a card that
refers to when we're

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.400 align:middle line:84%
feeling really
attacked and we're

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.980 align:middle line:84%
feeling like we need
to defend and protect

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.588 align:middle line:90%
that which we have created.

00:13:45.588 --> 00:13:47.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And then I assume
you need all three

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:50.325 align:middle line:90%
to make a full interpretation.

00:13:50.325 --> 00:13:51.075 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yeah.

00:13:51.075 --> 00:13:52.992 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now I just saw
a grimace on that one.

00:13:52.992 --> 00:13:55.075 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: [LAUGHTER]
You're scaring me, George.

00:13:55.075 --> 00:13:57.564 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I thought
this was not to scare people.

00:13:57.564 --> 00:13:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Well, World
War III is a scary concept.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.350 align:middle line:90%
But this is the Emperor.

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hm.

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Hm.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.648 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does that mean?

00:14:03.648 --> 00:14:06.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's where
people come in

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:08.330 align:middle line:84%
to create structure
and discipline where

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.530 align:middle line:90%
they feel that none exists.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.076 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Almost like a--

00:14:12.076 --> 00:14:12.950 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Emperor.

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:13.658 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Emperor.

00:14:13.658 --> 00:14:15.390 align:middle line:90%
A taking over.

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:16.156 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yeah.

00:14:16.156 --> 00:14:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A police state.

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:20.093 align:middle line:90%
Something like that?

00:14:20.093 --> 00:14:22.310 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Mm-hmm.

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:23.190 align:middle line:90%
But here's--

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:23.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what's this one?

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Well, this is
the good news. [LAUGHTER]

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.479 align:middle line:90%
Because this is the Empress.

00:14:28.479 --> 00:14:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now that's intriguing.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Isn't
that intriguing?

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:35.006 align:middle line:84%
Because here's how I'm
going to translate this.

00:14:35.006 --> 00:14:37.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this is World
War III we're talking about.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.416 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: This is
what we're talking about.

00:14:39.416 --> 00:14:42.260 align:middle line:84%
I think that the Empress
is what avoids World War

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.110 align:middle line:84%
III because she gives
birth to something new.

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:47.350 align:middle line:84%
The Empress always gives
birth to something new,

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:50.160 align:middle line:84%
something creative,
something exciting.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:54.210 align:middle line:84%
I also-- and I don't
know how popular this

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:55.820 align:middle line:84%
will be with some
of your viewers--

00:14:55.820 --> 00:15:02.230 align:middle line:84%
but I personally believe that
our male-dominated control

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:05.170 align:middle line:90%
of society is coming to a close.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:06.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To and end.

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:10.780 align:middle line:10%
>>VALENTINE: And I think
a maternal government,

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.075 align:middle line:10%
a society that's more feminine--

00:15:13.075 --> 00:15:14.450 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Is that
Hillary Clinton?

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:17.550 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm not going to say that.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:19.050 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
what I would say

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:22.240 align:middle line:84%
is that Hillary
Clinton might represent

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.770 align:middle line:84%
what I think is going to
happen, which is more and more

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:28.380 align:middle line:84%
women are going to take
charge of the world.

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Because we haven't
done such a great job.

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:middle line:84%
But can you tell
by the three cards

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.660 align:middle line:84%
that you've selected
if we are headed

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.994 align:middle line:84%
for a major conflict, which
I will call World War III?

00:15:40.994 --> 00:15:41.660 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: OK.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.270 align:middle line:90%
You can call it World War III.

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:46.860 align:middle line:90%
I would say conflict averted.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:47.509 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.912 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying
no World War III.

00:15:49.912 --> 00:15:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: I'm saying
no World War III.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm saying conflict averted.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Because of her.

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:56.439 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Yes,
because of her.

00:15:56.439 --> 00:15:57.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:58.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.520 align:middle line:84%
Now when we go back and
do another question,

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.430 align:middle line:84%
you have to put them
all back in the mix.

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: I'll put
them back in the mix.

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:05.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Because that gives
tarot the opportunity

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:08.670 align:middle line:90%
to use those cards again.

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:09.845 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
nothing up your sleeves?

00:16:09.845 --> 00:16:11.886 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: No. [LAUGHTER]
Nothing up my sleeve.

00:16:11.886 --> 00:16:12.400 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.250 align:middle line:90%
Nothing up my sleeve.

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:13.750 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:14.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:14.930 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.110 align:middle line:84%
So the next question
as you shuffle

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:22.270 align:middle line:84%
those will be the
world's economy.

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:23.241 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: OK.

00:16:23.241 --> 00:16:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let me make
it even more general.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:25.656 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: OK.

00:16:25.656 --> 00:16:27.254 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The United
States economy.

00:16:27.254 --> 00:16:27.920 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: OK.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK?

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.290 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: The
United States economy.

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:31.205 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's see
what the three are.

00:16:31.205 --> 00:16:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Sure.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we will
select three cards.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yes.

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:37.853 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Once again.

00:16:37.853 --> 00:16:40.200 align:middle line:90%


00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.130 align:middle line:90%
Number one.

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.160 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Oh.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.480 align:middle line:90%
Well, an exciting new adventure.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.230 align:middle line:90%
A new opportunity.

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ace of fire.

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:47.705 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Yes, that's
a really great card.

00:16:47.705 --> 00:16:49.020 align:middle line:90%
That's a really great card.

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:57.250 align:middle line:84%
So what that would tell me is
new energy source, new economy.

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Something that
drives the economy.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:16:59.970 align:middle line:90%
Something new.

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Just like housing drove
the economy 10 years ago.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.631 align:middle line:84%
And before that, we
had the internet boom.

00:17:07.631 --> 00:17:08.630 align:middle line:90%
And something like that.

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:10.634 align:middle line:90%
This, to me, is something new.

00:17:10.634 --> 00:17:12.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something
new is going to fuel.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.530 align:middle line:90%
OK, next one.

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Knight of fire.

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:16.266 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Knight of Fire.

00:17:16.266 --> 00:17:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: People are going to
be really passionate about it.

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:20.829 align:middle line:84%
But I also kind of think
that what that says

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:24.880 align:middle line:84%
is that the person who is
going to come up with this

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.609 align:middle line:90%
is going to be very creative.

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:29.564 align:middle line:90%
It's almost like a new--

00:17:29.564 --> 00:17:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it gonna
be just one person?

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:32.410 align:middle line:90%
Or maybe a lot?

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: I think a lot of
people will benefit from it.

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:36.820 align:middle line:84%
But because of that
particular card,

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:40.299 align:middle line:84%
I think that what that means
is that it's one person's idea.

00:17:40.299 --> 00:17:41.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:41.810 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: OK?

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.620 align:middle line:90%
And see, this is a sudden event.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:45.300 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:46.924 align:middle line:84%
So both of these
are like something

00:17:46.924 --> 00:17:48.840 align:middle line:84%
that just happens suddenly
that we don't know.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And these
two, so far, are good.

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.008 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yes.

00:17:51.008 --> 00:17:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:52.970 align:middle line:90%
And then our third card.

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:54.550 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Awake an Awakening.

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:56.401 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Awake an Awakening.

00:17:56.401 --> 00:17:57.400 align:middle line:90%
Now what does that mean?

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.435 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: An awakening
is where we suddenly

00:17:59.435 --> 00:18:01.190 align:middle line:84%
see the world in
a different way.

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:02.020 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.350 align:middle line:84%
The world looks very different
when you're upside down.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And in that particular
card, Archangel Gabriel

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:07.322 align:middle line:90%
is soaring down.

00:18:07.322 --> 00:18:09.530 align:middle line:84%
This is one of those cards
where we changed the name.

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:11.570 align:middle line:84%
This card was called
the hanged man.

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:12.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: We
renamed it Awakening

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.660 align:middle line:84%
because it's a
change in perception.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:20.100 align:middle line:84%
It's a change in the
way we see the world.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if I'm
reading you correctly,

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:25.510 align:middle line:84%
you're saying that in terms
of the economy in the United

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:29.310 align:middle line:84%
States, something
new and refreshing

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:32.159 align:middle line:84%
will help jump start
it and keep it going.

00:18:32.159 --> 00:18:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: And keep it going.

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And it will also
change the way people

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:39.740 align:middle line:90%
see the American economy.

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:43.030 align:middle line:84%
As you know, I actually
have that certified public

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:44.100 align:middle line:90%
accountant background.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.580 align:middle line:84%
So strange bedfellows
from this to that.

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:51.880 align:middle line:84%
But were are constantly
fighting people's beliefs

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.690 align:middle line:84%
in how the economy
is going to turn out.

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:57.110 align:middle line:84%
That's what's hurting
us more than anything.

00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:00.142 align:middle line:84%
Nobody has any faith that
we're going to be OK.

00:19:00.142 --> 00:19:00.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:01.300 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Shuffle those up, and I'll
give you our last question.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:05.250 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: OK.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the
last question will

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:13.460 align:middle line:84%
be: will we get hit with
an X flare from the sun?

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:14.720 align:middle line:90%
Can I be that specific?

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.920 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Why not?

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:16.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:16.996 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: OK.

00:19:16.996 --> 00:19:19.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't see why not.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will we get hit
by an X flare from the sun?

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:25.700 align:middle line:90%


00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:29.259 align:middle line:90%
And card number one will be--

00:19:29.259 --> 00:19:30.550 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Well, there it is.

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:31.965 align:middle line:90%
Ace of fire again.

00:19:31.965 --> 00:19:32.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Again.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:32.890 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Again.

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:34.120 align:middle line:90%
So isn't that interesting?

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:34.703 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:19:34.703 --> 00:19:36.960 align:middle line:84%
X flare does sound a
little fiery to me.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: It sounds
fiery to me, too.

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:41.200 align:middle line:90%
Sounds fiery to me, too.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So let's talk a
little bit more about that.

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.650 align:middle line:90%
Ace of fire.

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:48.030 align:middle line:90%
So to me, that's pretty big.

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:48.990 align:middle line:90%
That's important.

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:50.310 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: That's important.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:51.754 align:middle line:90%
And Awakening again.

00:19:51.754 --> 00:19:52.920 align:middle line:90%
And you saw that I shuffled.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's another one.

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:54.236 align:middle line:90%
You did shuffle.

00:19:54.236 --> 00:19:55.290 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: I shuffled.

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These are the
first two cards we just had.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Well, it was
the first and last card.

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:00.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Awakening.

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:01.490 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yes.

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:04.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So this one, how do
you tie in Awakening with ace

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:08.020 align:middle line:84%
of fire with the question, are
we going to have an X flare?

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Well,
here's the moon.

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:12.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: OK.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.400 align:middle line:90%
The last card.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.130 align:middle line:90%
So here's my hit.

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Whenever something
like this happens,

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.704 align:middle line:84%
where the cards from
the last question--

00:20:21.704 --> 00:20:22.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pop up.

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Pop up
in the next question,

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:25.910 align:middle line:84%
they're connected
to one another.

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:26.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: So
as much as I don't

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:31.550 align:middle line:84%
want to scare
people or anything,

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:33.600 align:middle line:84%
because that's not
my thing in tarot,

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:38.470 align:middle line:84%
I think there could be some
sort of event that creates.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That the moon maybe
shields us and helps us.

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Exactly.

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:44.870 align:middle line:84%
But it's also part of
the Awakening, George.

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:47.080 align:middle line:84%
If something like
that happened, and we

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.220 align:middle line:84%
had to reinvent the way we
look at our economy-- maybe

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:53.970 align:middle line:84%
we had a great leader at the
moment who could do that,

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:56.390 align:middle line:84%
could help us do
it-- it would change

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:58.774 align:middle line:84%
our perception of
the world profoundly.

00:20:58.774 --> 00:20:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dramatically.

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE:
Profoundly and forever.

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And the moon, like you
said, being shielded.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:12.110 align:middle line:84%
To me, being the novice that
I am-- and hold all three

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:15.280 align:middle line:84%
of those up if you would--
to me being the novice

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.940 align:middle line:84%
is that, yes, an X
flare is going to come.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:23.250 align:middle line:90%
It could change the way we live.

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:25.059 align:middle line:84%
But somehow the moon
is tied into it.

00:21:25.059 --> 00:21:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Right.

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And maybe we're going
to be shielded by the moon.

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:32.819 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we end up
moving to the moon.

00:21:32.819 --> 00:21:34.444 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: That
would be interesting.

00:21:34.444 --> 00:21:34.921 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't know.

00:21:34.921 --> 00:21:35.421 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:35.421 --> 00:21:37.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's add the
angels to the mix.

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:38.814 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yes, of course.

00:21:38.814 --> 00:21:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
work with you on that?

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Were they the ones telling
you, Noory's right.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.550 align:middle line:84%
There is going to be
an X flare, but this

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:47.750 align:middle line:90%
is going to be the result.

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:48.200 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yes.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that what happens?

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yes.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.805 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm always talking.

00:21:50.805 --> 00:21:53.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I'm
doing this work,

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:54.470 align:middle line:90%
I am talking to my angels.

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, I do not keep my
antennas up all the time.

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:01.530 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the things I
learned from my mentor, Doreen

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Virtue, very early on
was how to turn it off.

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't like
walking through the airport

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.210 align:middle line:84%
and going, oh,
cheating on his wife.

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It killed Edgar Cayce.

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:11.960 align:middle line:90%
You know that?

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:12.710 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yeah.

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Too much.

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yeah.

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:14.230 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:14.960 align:middle line:90%
It's too much.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:18.430 align:middle line:84%
So I keep my antennas
down unless I'm working.

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:21.607 align:middle line:84%
But when my antennas are up,
I'm working with my angels.

00:22:21.607 --> 00:22:22.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But have you done that?

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Have you walked through
airports and you were getting

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.730 align:middle line:90%
bombarded with all this stuff?

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:27.480 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yeah.

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.806 align:middle line:84%
When I first started
really learning.

00:22:30.806 --> 00:22:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It must have
driven you crazy.

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: It was distressing.

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:38.380 align:middle line:90%
It scared me actually.

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's why lesson
two, Radleigh, shielding.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.980 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER] You know?

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:44.540 align:middle line:84%
We're going to learn
how to do that.

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And you cut your
cords to people.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Because there are these
etheric cords, C-O-R-D,

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:53.580 align:middle line:84%
not musical but cords
that we connect.

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:56.110 align:middle line:84%
I've got a cord connected
to you right now because I'm

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:57.111 align:middle line:90%
doing readings with you.

00:22:57.111 --> 00:22:57.735 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:22:57.735 --> 00:23:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: When I leave
you, I'm going to say, George,

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:01.240 align:middle line:90%
you're fantastic.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.862 align:middle line:90%
And I'm cutting my cords to you.

00:23:02.862 --> 00:23:03.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There it goes.

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:04.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Right.

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:04.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bingo.

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: I'm done now.

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:06.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then you
leave me to myself.

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.381 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: I leave
you to yourself.

00:23:08.381 --> 00:23:09.500 align:middle line:90%
And I leave me to myself.

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:10.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People want to
know three major things

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:12.860 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:13.735 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: They do.

00:23:13.735 --> 00:23:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Health issues,
financial issues,

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:19.060 align:middle line:84%
and relationship
issues, whether they're

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:20.570 align:middle line:90%
in relationships or not.

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:20.930 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: They do.

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They just want
to know about that, too.

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:23.451 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Right.

00:23:23.451 --> 00:23:24.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
help them with that?

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yeah.

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:29.699 align:middle line:84%
Relationship readings are
actually my favorite readings.

00:23:29.699 --> 00:23:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are these
people in relationships?

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:33.580 align:middle line:90%
Or people who want to be in one?

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: It's a mix.

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:35.380 align:middle line:90%
It's a mix.

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like there's a
lot of unhappiness out there,

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.320 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately, I'm sad
to say, in relationships.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: I have this
kind of belief system

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:47.660 align:middle line:84%
that we're not meant to
be in these relationships

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.610 align:middle line:90%
that last 45 years anymore.

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:51.980 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.880 align:middle line:90%
We've evolved as a people.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.040 align:middle line:90%
We're coming to Earth.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.940 align:middle line:90%
And we want five careers.

00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And we want to create all of
these things in our lives.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And one of those
things is experiences.

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And those are experiences
with different people.

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:07.650 align:middle line:84%
So I think that that's why
people are being in shorter

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:09.920 align:middle line:84%
relationships or they're
being in relationships

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:13.050 align:middle line:84%
that are very fulfilling
for a short term

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:14.442 align:middle line:90%
but then they don't go on.

00:24:14.442 --> 00:24:15.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For long term.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: And why the divorce
rate-- all of those things.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:18.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what
do you tell them?

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:20.000 align:middle line:90%
Get out of the relationship?

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.350 align:middle line:90%
Fix the relationship?

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:22.740 align:middle line:90%
What's the advice?

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Well, I do what the
cards say, what my angels say.

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:31.850 align:middle line:84%
There are cards in tarot that
say, stay, you can fix this.

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And there are cards in
tarot that say, pack.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:35.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:39.810 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: And so I'm very
careful with the latter,

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:42.630 align:middle line:84%
especially if
children are involved.

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:44.950 align:middle line:84%
You have to be really,
really careful with that.

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you say
it the way you see it?

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.200 align:middle line:90%
Or do you embellish it?

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Or do you hide it and
withhold information?

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.750 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: I
don't hide anything.

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:52.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:55.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you see something,
you'll tell the client.

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: But
I'm going to say it

00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:59.420 align:middle line:84%
as softly-- if
I've got bad news,

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:02.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say that as
softly and as compassionately

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:03.499 align:middle line:90%
as I possibly can.

00:25:03.499 --> 00:25:04.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:04.660 align:middle line:90%
Some people are pretty blunt.

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:07.852 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: And I don't think
that those people are helping.

00:25:07.852 --> 00:25:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're going to
get a divorce and it's over.

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:10.370 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Right.

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:11.270 align:middle line:90%
I don't think that's helpful.

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:11.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't do that.

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: I don't
think that's helpful.

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:14.920 align:middle line:84%
I think what's helpful
is, it's looking

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.530 align:middle line:84%
to me like this relationship
may have run its course,

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:19.340 align:middle line:84%
and there's something
more joyful for you

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:21.995 align:middle line:84%
that could come in the future
if you were not tied down

00:25:21.995 --> 00:25:23.620 align:middle line:84%
to something that no
longer serves you.

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:25.745 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wouldn't it be
better if couples go to you

00:25:25.745 --> 00:25:27.724 align:middle line:90%
before they get together?

00:25:27.724 --> 00:25:28.265 align:middle line:90%
For readings.

00:25:28.265 --> 00:25:30.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: [LAUGHTER]
I think that'd be great.

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:32.240 align:middle line:84%
I think that going
to an astrologer

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.551 align:middle line:84%
before you get married is
also an excellent ides.

00:25:34.551 --> 00:25:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've turned you
into a dating service.

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:39.047 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE:
[LAUGHTER] I love that.

00:25:39.047 --> 00:25:39.880 align:middle line:90%
That's an excellent.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:40.430 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It might work.

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.300 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: It might.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.740 align:middle line:90%
It might.

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:46.972 align:middle line:84%
Because I love people,
I love that experience

00:25:46.972 --> 00:25:48.680 align:middle line:84%
of working with people
and helping people

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:49.471 align:middle line:90%
have a better life.

00:25:49.471 --> 00:25:52.910 align:middle line:84%
So relationships are where
that happens a lot of times.

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've had
psychics come on our show,

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Radleigh, who will tell people,
tomorrow is not the good day

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.740 align:middle line:90%
for you to have your operation.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Postpone it as long as
it's not life threatening.

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And so if somebody's going to
have a new titanium knee put

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:11.390 align:middle line:84%
in, they'll go to their
doctor and they say,

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:13.040 align:middle line:84%
numerologists on
"Coast to Coast"

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.570 align:middle line:84%
told me not to have
my operation today.

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:17.670 align:middle line:90%
But I can have it on Wednesday.

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:21.257 align:middle line:84%
Now the doctor thinks, hey,
these people are whacked out.

00:26:21.257 --> 00:26:22.340 align:middle line:90%
But what's he going to do?

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:22.950 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Right.

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She thinks this
is the day to do it.

00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:26.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they do.

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:28.927 align:middle line:90%
Are you a little like that?

00:26:28.927 --> 00:26:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Well, first
of all, I'm not a doctor.

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:34.170 align:middle line:84%
So that would be the first
thing I would tell somebody.

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:36.620 align:middle line:84%
I would not say
that I'm a doctor.

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:39.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm more interested
in that person who's

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:42.930 align:middle line:84%
getting a new knee to understand
what is going on in their life

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:46.000 align:middle line:84%
spiritually, what is going on
in their life energetically,

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.040 align:middle line:84%
that they needed
to have a new knee.

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.855 align:middle line:90%
Where were they not supported?

00:26:49.855 --> 00:26:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Where did they feel like
they couldn't move forward

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:52.550 align:middle line:90%
in their life?

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:52.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened to them?

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:54.570 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: What
happened to them

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:56.170 align:middle line:90%
that made that knee go bad?

00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:59.010 align:middle line:84%
That's more interesting
to me than the date

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:02.426 align:middle line:84%
that they're going to go
have the knee replaced.

00:27:02.426 --> 00:27:04.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to tell them to
not have the knee replaced.

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.258 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My knee
went bad because I

00:27:06.258 --> 00:27:08.347 align:middle line:84%
kicked the last
tarot card reader who

00:27:08.347 --> 00:27:10.134 align:middle line:90%
told me I had the Death card.

00:27:10.134 --> 00:27:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE:
[LAUGHTER] Oh, right.

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:13.620 align:middle line:90%
Something like that.

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:16.370 align:middle line:90%
Knees are support and movement.

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:19.320 align:middle line:84%
So to me, I would be
looking for do you not

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.620 align:middle line:90%
feel supported in your life?

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:22.970 align:middle line:90%
Is your life not moving forward?

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:24.980 align:middle line:90%
What's going on in your life?

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:26.210 align:middle line:90%
How do we fix that?

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:28.085 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been
for you-- since you've

00:27:28.085 --> 00:27:30.350 align:middle line:84%
been doing this over
the past several years--

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:34.720 align:middle line:84%
the most enlightening
aspect of what you do?

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Is that there are
surprisingly few evil people.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:45.960 align:middle line:84%
There's a surprisingly large
number of unenlightened people.

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.870 align:middle line:84%
There's a surprisingly
large number of people

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:52.750 align:middle line:84%
walking around in a fog who
don't understand why they're

00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:56.000 align:middle line:84%
here, that are not living the
life that they could lead.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.470 align:middle line:90%


00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:02.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm part Cherokee.

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:07.170 align:middle line:84%
So we have a saying, walk a mile
in someone else's moccasins.

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's like once
you really drill down,

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:14.210 align:middle line:84%
once you really figure out
what someone's motivation is,

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:18.390 align:middle line:84%
somewhere down there in
there is a wounded person.

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
interesting to me

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:25.240 align:middle line:84%
is helping find that
and make them wake up.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:30.500 align:middle line:84%
People, wake up to how
beautiful your life could be!

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:34.050 align:middle line:84%
That's what I like to do
is give them those answers.

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:35.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You've had two careers.

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:36.281 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: I did.

00:28:36.281 --> 00:28:38.837 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One as a CPA,
one as a tarot reader.

00:28:38.837 --> 00:28:39.670 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Uh-huh.

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:41.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would assume
this one, for you,

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:43.912 align:middle line:90%
is the most fulfilling.

00:28:43.912 --> 00:28:46.610 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: You know, I
had fun, believe it or not.

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:47.600 align:middle line:90%
Because I got lucky.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.690 align:middle line:84%
My first job as a
CPA was in a pub--

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:51.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You had fun as a CPA?

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:51.600 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: I really did.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You will owe taxes!

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:53.215 align:middle line:90%
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:28:53.215 --> 00:28:53.794 align:middle line:90%
That's fun?

00:28:53.794 --> 00:28:54.460 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: No.

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:56.630 align:middle line:90%
I went to the corporate side.

00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:58.030 align:middle line:90%
I went the corporate side.

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And I worked for a
publishing company

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:04.460 align:middle line:84%
that drew all its talent
from New York City.

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I was there
with these people

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:09.610 align:middle line:84%
wearing one red shoe and one
green shoe and real fruit

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:10.605 align:middle line:90%
hanging from her ears.

00:29:10.605 --> 00:29:11.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But you like it?

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:14.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: That part was fun
because the people were fun.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:15.520 align:middle line:90%
The people were fun.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:16.260 align:middle line:90%
And that made it.

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:16.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But this is different.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: This is my passion.

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:20.830 align:middle line:90%
This is my passion.

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:24.530 align:middle line:84%
What I want people to say
when they pick up Angel Tarot

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:27.340 align:middle line:84%
cards, or Archangel Power Tarot
cards, or Guardian Angel Tarot

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:29.650 align:middle line:84%
cards, or whichever
deck that we've created,

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:32.910 align:middle line:84%
is I want them to come and
write to me or say to me,

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:34.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm no longer scared.

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have any doubt
that we have guardian angels

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:39.240 align:middle line:90%
all around us?

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:39.906 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: No.

00:29:39.906 --> 00:29:41.140 align:middle line:90%
None whatsoever.

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.230 align:middle line:90%
There is no doubt for me.

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Because I experience
it too much.

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:46.890 align:middle line:90%
I mean, Josh is always there.

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And ours are
always there, too?

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.440 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Yours
are always there, too.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.080 align:middle line:90%
Yours are always there, too.

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:55.035 align:middle line:84%
But it's like whether or
not we're listening to them

00:29:55.035 --> 00:29:57.160 align:middle line:84%
or not, whether or not
we're going to get guidance.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.670 align:middle line:90%
And they give us signs.

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:04.209 align:middle line:84%
It's like I, not too
long ago, started

00:30:04.209 --> 00:30:05.500 align:middle line:90%
looking into getting a new car.

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:06.930 align:middle line:90%
I really didn't want a new car.

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:08.800 align:middle line:84%
I really wasn't
interested in a new car.

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.910 align:middle line:84%
It's just someone pointed
out this car to me.

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:12.076 align:middle line:90%
And I just couldn't help it.

00:30:12.076 --> 00:30:13.120 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to look at it.

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.360 align:middle line:10%
And while I was
googling that car,

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.740 align:middle line:10%
I looked down in my living room.

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:20.260 align:middle line:10%
And there was a white
feather in my living room.

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Now how does a white feather
get in your living room?

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
does it represent?

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: That
angels are with you.

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And when I added
up the VIN number,

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.182 align:middle line:84%
I got 444, which is,
angels are with you.

00:30:29.182 --> 00:30:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you get the car?

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: I bought the car.

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:32.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You bought the car.

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:33.665 align:middle line:90%
How do people get a hold of you?

00:30:33.665 --> 00:30:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: [LAUGHTER]
They can get a hold of me

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:36.440 align:middle line:90%
at radleighvalentine.com.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:41.220 align:middle line:10%

>>NOORY: Radleigh,
thank you so much.

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Thank you, George.

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:46.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Very
enlightened person.

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:47.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Thank
you very much.

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:48.395 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tarot cards.

00:30:48.395 --> 00:30:52.720 align:middle line:10%
You know, tarot cards, depending
on how you look at them,

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.640 align:middle line:10%
have always been perceived
to be a little scary, to me.

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.850 align:middle line:10%
These aren't.

00:30:57.850 --> 00:30:59.190 align:middle line:10%
Angel tarot.

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:00.530 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:03.533 align:middle line:10%
