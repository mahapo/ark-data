welcome to Beyond Belief

00:00:23.724 --> 00:00:26.660 align:middle line:84%
and there is nothing that
excites us more than talking

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.632 align:middle line:84%
about the supernatural,
the paranormal, the unusual

00:00:31.632 --> 00:00:32.900 align:middle line:90%
and we've got that with one

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.137 align:middle line:84%
of the world's foremost
investigators, Jeff Belanger,

00:00:36.137 --> 00:00:38.305 align:middle line:90%

real job, George, for sure.

>> Noory: You know, and you
just said something; who knew?

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:48.415 align:middle line:84%
When Jeff was a little boy were
you interested in this stuff?

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:49.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: Absolutely.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.852 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in an old New England
town with a lot of history

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:53.821 align:middle line:84%
and I had friends who said
their houses were haunted,

00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:57.158 align:middle line:84%
so we'd have sleepovers and
at age ten I remember asking,

00:00:57.158 --> 00:00:59.994 align:middle line:84%
you know, the parents and
stuff, so there's a ghost here?

00:00:59.994 --> 00:01:02.496 align:middle line:84%
And back then we weren't so out
of the closet like we are now

00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:04.031 align:middle line:84%
so people would say
you know yeah,

00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:05.065 align:middle line:90%
don't tell your parents though

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.367 align:middle line:84%
but someone else
lives here with us.

00:01:06.367 --> 00:01:08.769 align:middle line:84%
We're not afraid of it but
something's going on here,

00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:10.037 align:middle line:84%
so I was intrigued
my whole life.

would that be?

00:01:15.743 --> 00:01:17.077 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: Folklore
and history.

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:19.380 align:middle line:84%
If you want to say
there's no such thing

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.282 align:middle line:84%
as ghosts, that's fine. I
don't personally believe that,

00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:25.986 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time, the
stories are real, the history's

00:01:25.986 --> 00:01:27.621 align:middle line:84%
real. In a lot of respects,
George,

00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:29.957 align:middle line:84%
ghosts are history
demanding to be remembered.

00:01:29.957 --> 00:01:31.892 align:middle line:84%
To talk about ghosts,
to talk about hauntings,

00:01:31.892 --> 00:01:34.295 align:middle line:84%
is to talk about our past,
to connect with our past,

00:01:34.295 --> 00:01:37.398 align:middle line:84%
with our ancestors, with our
history, all of that stuff goes

00:01:37.398 --> 00:01:39.900 align:middle line:84%
into making us who we are
today, and what better way

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.502 align:middle line:84%

It's so much fun.

00:01:45.873 --> 00:01:48.642 align:middle line:84%
You know, when I travel, I
want to see haunted places;

00:01:48.642 --> 00:01:50.744 align:middle line:84%
I want to become part
of those stories.

00:01:50.744 --> 00:01:52.580 align:middle line:84%
You know you hear these things,
you see them on television,

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.715 align:middle line:84%
you hear them on Coast
to Coast and you want to,

00:01:54.715 --> 00:01:57.017 align:middle line:84%
you want to see them for
yourselves because maybe,

00:01:57.017 --> 00:01:59.119 align:middle line:84%
just maybe you're going
to have that experience,

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.823 align:middle line:84%
that once in a lifetime event
that makes you say whoa,

00:02:02.823 --> 00:02:04.525 align:middle line:84%
there's more to this
than meets the eye.

00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Why are these
places, Jeff, haunted?

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean what is creating
this kind of energy?

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.098 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: Right.

00:02:11.098 --> 00:02:12.099 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Where these
spirits, entities,

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.435 align:middle line:84%
whatever they may
be, hang around.

00:02:14.435 --> 00:02:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: That's the
million dollar question.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.206 align:middle line:84%
If I knew, you know, for sure
I think there's as many reasons

00:02:19.206 --> 00:02:21.108 align:middle line:90%
for ghosts as there are ghosts.

00:02:21.108 --> 00:02:23.844 align:middle line:84%
In some respects, there's
a tragedy that took place

00:02:23.844 --> 00:02:25.779 align:middle line:84%
and people talk about
that tragedy,

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:27.448 align:middle line:84%
we relive it, we
give energy to it.

00:02:27.448 --> 00:02:29.183 align:middle line:84%
The more we say oh, this
is where there was a murder

00:02:29.183 --> 00:02:32.018 align:middle line:84%
or a suicide or an
unfortunate death, and so,

00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:35.389 align:middle line:84%
so that's often the back story
of a haunting but not always.

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:36.924 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's just like a movie
that replays

00:02:36.924 --> 00:02:38.292 align:middle line:90%
over and over again.

00:02:38.292 --> 00:02:41.762 align:middle line:84%
It's just the past that almost
gets imprinted on a location,

00:02:41.762 --> 00:02:43.931 align:middle line:84%
might call it the stone tape
theory, but there are

00:02:43.931 --> 00:02:47.468 align:middle line:84%
so many different theories
to what's the reasons.

00:02:47.468 --> 00:02:50.703 align:middle line:84%
To me it's simply
a place is haunted

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:53.541 align:middle line:84%
when people have experiences,
when they talk about it

00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:55.075 align:middle line:90%
and it gets a reputation.

00:02:55.075 --> 00:02:57.845 align:middle line:84%
Now if things happen often,
it's an active haunting.

00:02:57.845 --> 00:03:00.047 align:middle line:84%
If it's years in
between, not so much.

00:03:00.047 --> 00:03:01.982 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Always remember
a story, true story.

00:03:01.982 --> 00:03:05.386 align:middle line:84%
A little girl would talk to
her parents every day and talk

00:03:05.386 --> 00:03:07.988 align:middle line:84%
about another little
girl in the house

00:03:07.988 --> 00:03:11.258 align:middle line:84%
and the parents figured ah,
you know it's our little girl,

00:03:11.258 --> 00:03:14.395 align:middle line:84%
she's having a, you
know, a little, you know,

00:03:14.395 --> 00:03:18.632 align:middle line:84%
type of imagination, let's
just let her do her thing,

00:03:18.632 --> 00:03:21.635 align:middle line:84%
but then the conversations
got a little darker

00:03:21.635 --> 00:03:25.839 align:middle line:84%
and the little girl would tell
her parents yes, she died here,

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:27.808 align:middle line:84%
and the parents didn't
want to hear that.

00:03:27.808 --> 00:03:29.009 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: Sure.

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:30.377 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So it was okay
when it was fun and games,

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:34.081 align:middle line:84%
but when she started
hearing from them, you now,

00:03:34.081 --> 00:03:36.283 align:middle line:84%
she died here, they
got a little upset.

00:03:36.283 --> 00:03:41.322 align:middle line:84%
And then one day the girl
said, and she's still here.

00:03:41.322 --> 00:03:43.023 align:middle line:84%
And they said, what do
you mean she's still here?

00:03:43.023 --> 00:03:47.127 align:middle line:84%
And she said well yes, her
bones are under the floor.

00:03:47.127 --> 00:03:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And they said where
did you hear this

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.400 align:middle line:84%
and she said well she told me
that something happened to her

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.369 align:middle line:84%
and her bones are
under the floor.

00:03:55.369 --> 00:04:00.007 align:middle line:84%
And I'll find out where,
and she did, and she kind

00:04:00.007 --> 00:04:02.810 align:middle line:84%
of like made a circle
around a certain area

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.449 align:middle line:84%
and the parents were really
mortified and they had it dug up

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:10.751 align:middle line:84%
and sure enough there were
bones of a little girl there,

00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:11.785 align:middle line:90%
a little six year old.

00:04:11.785 --> 00:04:13.052 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: Isn't that amazing?

00:04:13.052 --> 00:04:15.556 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Who had been
killed and buried down there.

00:04:15.556 --> 00:04:18.058 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: So to me,
that's incredible, right?

00:04:18.058 --> 00:04:19.493 align:middle line:84%
I mean when you have
compelling evidence.

00:04:19.493 --> 00:04:20.961 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing to say
oh, people see the

00:04:20.961 --> 00:04:21.895 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It's beyond belief.

00:04:21.895 --> 00:04:22.796 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: It's beyond belief.

00:04:22.796 --> 00:04:23.364 align:middle line:90%
Nice plug.

00:04:23.364 --> 00:04:24.665 align:middle line:90%
That was good.

00:04:24.665 --> 00:04:26.333 align:middle line:84%
So it's one thing when we
have something very tangible

00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:29.036 align:middle line:84%
like that where we can say the
spirits are telling me this

00:04:29.036 --> 00:04:30.537 align:middle line:90%
and then you find that thing,

00:04:30.537 --> 00:04:33.574 align:middle line:84%
suddenly you know you've got
some pretty hard evidence,

00:04:33.574 --> 00:04:35.809 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we're always
looking for, isn't it, evidence.

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:37.478 align:middle line:90%
I wish I could call it proof,

00:04:37.478 --> 00:04:39.847 align:middle line:84%
I really do because then
we could put it in a jar

00:04:39.847 --> 00:04:42.750 align:middle line:84%
and let everyone see it, but
this stuff is so elusive.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.819 align:middle line:84%
It's always changing and
every situation's different

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:48.422 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time to me
the evidence is overwhelming

00:04:48.422 --> 00:04:49.790 align:middle line:90%
when you add it all up.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.293 align:middle line:84%
Stories like that, some of the
photographs and audio clips

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:54.928 align:middle line:84%
that we get, the video
clips that we get,

00:04:54.928 --> 00:04:58.165 align:middle line:84%
but beyond anything else,
the personal experiences.

00:04:58.165 --> 00:04:59.433 align:middle line:84%
You know it doesn't
matter what I say

00:04:59.433 --> 00:05:01.301 align:middle line:84%
or how many photos I
show you, when you walk

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:03.971 align:middle line:84%
in to Eastern State Penitentiary
where we were a few years ago

00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:06.006 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Oh yeah, where
you could feel something.

00:05:06.006 --> 00:05:07.508 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: Yeah we're in
this creepy dark corridor,

00:05:07.508 --> 00:05:09.476 align:middle line:84%
when you see something
step out of the shadows

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:12.079 align:middle line:84%
and then disappear,
game, set, match, right?

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:12.780 align:middle line:90%
It's over.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:13.814 align:middle line:90%
You're now a believer.

00:05:13.814 --> 00:05:15.049 align:middle line:90%
I had an experience.

00:05:15.049 --> 00:05:18.519 align:middle line:84%
You can think I was mistaken
or jetlagged or whatever

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:19.620 align:middle line:90%
but I know what I saw.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.555 align:middle line:84%
I trust my senses just
like everyone else.

00:05:21.555 --> 00:05:23.524 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: It's all
about energy isn't it

00:05:23.524 --> 00:05:25.626 align:middle line:84%
and the spirit world
is out there.

00:05:25.626 --> 00:05:28.062 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: I think you
know the energy, right,

00:05:28.062 --> 00:05:29.730 align:middle line:90%
we feel that with living people.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.199 align:middle line:84%
You meet a person and sometimes
you just connect with them

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.802 align:middle line:84%
or you pull back for
whatever reason, right,

00:05:34.802 --> 00:05:37.371 align:middle line:84%
because we're feeling that
interaction with people.

00:05:37.371 --> 00:05:39.540 align:middle line:84%
There is this collective
consciousness experience

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.841 align:middle line:90%
that we're all a part of.

00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:42.910 align:middle line:84%
We share ideas, we
share concepts,

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.144 align:middle line:90%
we share these stories.

00:05:44.144 --> 00:05:46.280 align:middle line:84%
These stories don't
just bind us to the past

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.482 align:middle line:84%
and to our ancestors, they
bind us to each other.

00:05:48.482 --> 00:05:51.752 align:middle line:84%
If I tell you George, I had this
ghost experience what I'm saying

00:05:51.752 --> 00:05:55.055 align:middle line:84%
is I trust you, I trust that
you're not going to mock me,

00:05:55.055 --> 00:05:57.491 align:middle line:84%
we're bonding here, you
know, this is real stuff,

00:05:57.491 --> 00:05:58.625 align:middle line:90%
this isn't not just, you know,

00:05:58.625 --> 00:06:00.260 align:middle line:84%
what's the weather
like you know?

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.464 align:middle line:84%
And so, so I love
every aspect of it.

00:06:03.464 --> 00:06:04.765 align:middle line:90%
The connection with each other

00:06:04.765 --> 00:06:07.201 align:middle line:84%
and we're also exploring
our own inevitable future

00:06:07.201 --> 00:06:09.169 align:middle line:84%
because we're all going
to die one day and we have

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:10.304 align:middle line:90%
to come to grips with that.

00:06:10.304 --> 00:06:11.238 align:middle line:90%
What comes next?

00:06:11.238 --> 00:06:12.606 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well a
lot of people are

00:06:12.606 --> 00:06:15.342 align:middle line:84%
at their crossroads
right now, Jeff.

00:06:15.342 --> 00:06:18.745 align:middle line:84%
They don't know if
there's life after death

00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:20.814 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's
starting to affect them

00:06:20.814 --> 00:06:25.452 align:middle line:84%
in the way they live, because
when they think this is it,

00:06:25.452 --> 00:06:27.020 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of a weird feeling.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.355 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: Right.

00:06:28.355 --> 00:06:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I mean I think we
all want to know and believe

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.026 align:middle line:84%
that this is going to exist,
it's going to keep going

00:06:33.026 --> 00:06:38.198 align:middle line:84%
and it may change somewhat and
we may morph into something else

00:06:38.198 --> 00:06:40.567 align:middle line:84%
but I don't think anybody
really likes that feeling

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:43.604 align:middle line:90%
of it's done, folks, it's over.

00:06:43.604 --> 00:06:47.007 align:middle line:84%
Now I take the posture
there is life after death.

00:06:47.007 --> 00:06:48.342 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy this life.

00:06:48.342 --> 00:06:52.146 align:middle line:84%
I'm in no hurry to join the
other side and I'm going

00:06:52.146 --> 00:06:54.581 align:middle line:84%
to have as
best arun here as I can,

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:58.418 align:middle line:84%
but when it's done, there's
another evolution to that.

00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:01.255 align:middle line:84%
Do you find that to be the
case with a lot of people?

00:07:01.255 --> 00:07:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: I do and I
love the debates, right,

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.026 align:middle line:84%
the discussions even when I'm
talking to a devout atheist

00:07:06.026 --> 00:07:08.128 align:middle line:84%
and I use the word devout
because it's a belief system,

00:07:08.128 --> 00:07:10.264 align:middle line:84%
it requires as much
work as any other,

00:07:10.264 --> 00:07:12.766 align:middle line:84%
and I say alright let's
pretend this is it.

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:14.301 align:middle line:90%
Don't you want to be remembered?

00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:17.004 align:middle line:84%
Right? We still talk about
Shakespeare, we still talk

00:07:17.004 --> 00:07:20.174 align:middle line:84%
about Aristotle, we talk about
some great thinkers and writers

00:07:20.174 --> 00:07:23.377 align:middle line:84%
and artists centuries and even
millennia after their death

00:07:23.377 --> 00:07:26.113 align:middle line:84%
because they did great
things and we remember them.

00:07:26.113 --> 00:07:29.316 align:middle line:84%
So that memory, right, in
some sense you will live

00:07:29.316 --> 00:07:32.252 align:middle line:84%
on in the memories of
your works, of your deeds,

00:07:32.252 --> 00:07:34.488 align:middle line:84%
of your family, of
the stories and so on.

00:07:34.488 --> 00:07:38.659 align:middle line:84%
So if you even take it at that
very basic level there's an

00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:40.727 align:middle line:90%
eternal aspect to life here.

00:07:40.727 --> 00:07:41.762 align:middle line:90%
I agree with you.

00:07:41.762 --> 00:07:42.863 align:middle line:84%
I believe there's
something more to it

00:07:42.863 --> 00:07:45.032 align:middle line:84%
because I've had
experiences I can't explain

00:07:45.032 --> 00:07:47.935 align:middle line:84%
with any other word other
than ghost or spirit you know?

00:07:47.935 --> 00:07:50.904 align:middle line:84%
I've had gut feelings that tell
me you know there's something

00:07:50.904 --> 00:07:54.208 align:middle line:84%
significant going on here
and there is more to it

00:07:54.208 --> 00:07:56.977 align:middle line:90%
and like you I'm in no rush but

00:07:56.977 --> 00:07:58.845 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Let's enjoy
it while we can.

00:07:58.845 --> 00:07:59.913 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: But finding

00:07:59.913 --> 00:08:02.182 align:middle line:84%
out would be a great
adventure in itself.

00:08:02.182 --> 00:08:05.219 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Tell me about your
travels and where they take you.

00:08:05.219 --> 00:08:06.453 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: I love to travel.

00:08:06.453 --> 00:08:08.689 align:middle line:84%
I think you grow as a
person when you travel

00:08:08.689 --> 00:08:10.791 align:middle line:84%
and when I travel
I don't want to go

00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:12.960 align:middle line:84%
to the traditional gift
shops or anything like that.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.628 align:middle line:84%
I want to go where
there's great stories.

00:08:14.628 --> 00:08:15.329 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: [Laughing]

00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: You know?

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:17.731 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So we don't find
you in those tour buses.

00:08:17.731 --> 00:08:19.132 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: No not so much.

00:08:19.132 --> 00:08:22.502 align:middle line:84%
I might take a ride on one to
get somewhere but then I want

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:23.937 align:middle line:90%
to look under the rocks.

00:08:23.937 --> 00:08:27.406 align:middle line:84%
I want to see the,
the nitty gritty past

00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:30.110 align:middle line:84%
that maybe not everyone
knows about because in doing

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.978 align:middle line:90%
so you become part of the story.

00:08:31.978 --> 00:08:35.214 align:middle line:84%
You know if you go to visit, if
you go to the Louvre in Paris,

00:08:35.214 --> 00:08:37.651 align:middle line:84%
right, and you go and you stand
in front of the Mona Lisa,

00:08:37.651 --> 00:08:40.520 align:middle line:84%
there's so many other
paintings in that amazing place

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.556 align:middle line:84%
that to me, I mean I'm
not art critic but I look

00:08:42.556 --> 00:08:45.626 align:middle line:84%
and I see these magnificent-but
I had to see the Mona Lisa

00:08:45.626 --> 00:08:46.927 align:middle line:84%
because now I'm part
of the story.

00:08:46.927 --> 00:08:47.828 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Did she wink at you?

00:08:47.828 --> 00:08:48.996 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: She didn't.

00:08:48.996 --> 00:08:50.230 align:middle line:90%
She didn't.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.732 align:middle line:84%
I winked at her though just
to get it out of the way.

00:08:51.732 --> 00:08:53.533 align:middle line:90%
But I became part of the story

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:55.435 align:middle line:84%
of the Mona Lisa just
by standing there.

00:08:55.435 --> 00:08:58.071 align:middle line:84%
So when I go to these
haunted places I want to talk

00:08:58.071 --> 00:08:59.873 align:middle line:84%
to the people that
had the experiences.

00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:03.443 align:middle line:84%
I want to go and get into it
because I found this -- I was

00:09:03.443 --> 00:09:08.248 align:middle line:84%
in Juneau, Alaska years ago and
I was at the Alaskan Hotel

00:09:08.248 --> 00:09:10.484 align:middle line:84%
and I came in on a cruise
ship with all the tourists

00:09:10.484 --> 00:09:12.953 align:middle line:84%
but I went there and I said
I'm really interested in ghosts

00:09:12.953 --> 00:09:14.054 align:middle line:84%
and I hear this place
is haunted.

00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:15.722 align:middle line:84%
And they sized me
up for a minute

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:17.858 align:middle line:90%
and they said, Joe come here.

00:09:17.858 --> 00:09:19.693 align:middle line:84%
Tell him what you saw
coming down the stairs,

00:09:19.693 --> 00:09:22.095 align:middle line:84%
and in a few minutes I was
surrounded by locals talking

00:09:22.095 --> 00:09:23.130 align:middle line:84%
about something unique to
Juneau.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.264 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And they're
forthright.

00:09:24.264 --> 00:09:25.465 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: Absolutely.

00:09:25.465 --> 00:09:26.767 align:middle line:84%
If I stayed another hour
I would have been invited

00:09:26.767 --> 00:09:29.569 align:middle line:84%
to Sunday dinner, and
that's just -- I was ingrained.

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:30.671 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Just hope
you weren't the dinner.

00:09:30.671 --> 00:09:31.438 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: That's right.

00:09:31.438 --> 00:09:32.706 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: You never know.

00:09:32.706 --> 00:09:35.275 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: No, there's
roads or rail into Alaska so,

00:09:35.275 --> 00:09:37.377 align:middle line:90%
but no, into Juneau, rather.

00:09:37.377 --> 00:09:39.680 align:middle line:84%
So it was just, it
was this bonding thing

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.649 align:middle line:84%
that instantly made me not
a cheesy tourist but someone

00:09:42.649 --> 00:09:44.751 align:middle line:84%
who wanted to know
about something special

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:47.020 align:middle line:84%
that exists only there
and nowhere else.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.523 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What has been your
favorite place to visit?

00:09:49.523 --> 00:09:51.358 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: Probably the
Catacombs of Paris, France.

00:09:51.358 --> 00:09:52.592 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Tell me about that.

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:54.828 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: The Catacombs
is an amazing story.

00:09:54.828 --> 00:09:56.897 align:middle line:84%
Paris wouldn't exist
without them.

00:09:56.897 --> 00:10:00.067 align:middle line:84%
All this great limestone
material that they had to build

00:10:00.067 --> 00:10:01.368 align:middle line:90%
that goes back 2,000 years.

00:10:01.368 --> 00:10:03.537 align:middle line:84%
The Romans quarried it and
eventually they built a city

00:10:03.537 --> 00:10:05.272 align:middle line:84%
and eventually they had
to tunnel to get more

00:10:05.272 --> 00:10:06.707 align:middle line:90%
of that great limestone.

00:10:06.707 --> 00:10:08.875 align:middle line:84%
So there's 300 kilometers
of tunnels.

00:10:08.875 --> 00:10:11.578 align:middle line:84%
They emptied the cemeteries
in Paris in the mid-1700's

00:10:11.578 --> 00:10:13.980 align:middle line:84%
to 1800's and stacked
up these bones

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.283 align:middle line:84%
and at first it's very macabre
and it takes your breath away

00:10:16.283 --> 00:10:19.119 align:middle line:84%
when you see all these bones
and skeletons all around you,

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:21.989 align:middle line:84%
but then you realize, you
know, disturbing a place

00:10:21.989 --> 00:10:23.924 align:middle line:84%
of the dead is a
universal taboo.

00:10:23.924 --> 00:10:26.827 align:middle line:84%
They had to because the
living always take precedent.

00:10:26.827 --> 00:10:28.527 align:middle line:84%
So I'm down there
alone, you know,

00:10:28.527 --> 00:10:29.596 align:middle line:90%
walking through these tunnels

00:10:29.596 --> 00:10:30.731 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: With all
these bones everywhere.

00:10:30.731 --> 00:10:32.366 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: All these
bones and as I'm walking

00:10:32.366 --> 00:10:35.168 align:middle line:84%
down a hallway I could
reach my arms out

00:10:35.168 --> 00:10:37.404 align:middle line:84%
and be touching skulls
with each fingertip.

00:10:37.404 --> 00:10:38.472 align:middle line:90%
It was that narrow.

00:10:38.472 --> 00:10:39.606 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Was there
a certain odor to it

00:10:39.606 --> 00:10:40.941 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that?

00:10:40.941 --> 00:10:42.676 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: No, after a few
centuries bones don't really

00:10:42.676 --> 00:10:43.377 align:middle line:90%
have a smell.

00:10:43.377 --> 00:10:44.378 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It goes away.

00:10:44.378 --> 00:10:45.779 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: Yeah,
it's just a musty,

00:10:45.779 --> 00:10:47.547 align:middle line:84%
damp smell because there's water
seeping through the limestone

00:10:47.547 --> 00:10:49.316 align:middle line:84%
and you hear the drips
and the crunch of gravel

00:10:49.316 --> 00:10:52.185 align:middle line:84%
under your feet, and as I'm
walking I see a shadow the size

00:10:52.185 --> 00:10:53.954 align:middle line:84%
of a man move from the
right side to the left

00:10:53.954 --> 00:10:56.289 align:middle line:90%
and go back again, and I froze.

00:10:56.289 --> 00:10:58.658 align:middle line:84%
I really hadn't had a ghost
experience up to that point,

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:00.961 align:middle line:84%
even though I'd been
writing about them for years

00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:04.030 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly your brain goes
through all this processing,

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.366 align:middle line:84%
what am I seeing, what is going
on right now, and I'm trying

00:11:06.366 --> 00:11:08.969 align:middle line:84%
to rule out everything
and all I was left

00:11:08.969 --> 00:11:10.871 align:middle line:90%
with was the word ghost, spirit.

00:11:10.871 --> 00:11:15.242 align:middle line:84%
I was connecting with whatever
was down there and the thing was

00:11:15.242 --> 00:11:17.077 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And there's probably a
lot down there.

00:11:17.077 --> 00:11:18.445 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: Six
million skeletons

00:11:18.445 --> 00:11:20.480 align:middle line:84%
and so this is the kind
of experience, George,

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:25.452 align:middle line:84%
that sinks in over the span
of days and weeks and months

00:11:25.452 --> 00:11:28.588 align:middle line:84%
and years even, where you
just start saying I just had

00:11:28.588 --> 00:11:29.556 align:middle line:90%
this experience.

00:11:29.556 --> 00:11:31.124 align:middle line:84%
And I've interviewed
thousands now

00:11:31.124 --> 00:11:32.926 align:middle line:84%
about their paranormal
encounters

00:11:32.926 --> 00:11:34.995 align:middle line:84%
and when you have
the one, right,

00:11:34.995 --> 00:11:36.863 align:middle line:84%
suddenly those other stories
have a lot more gravity.

00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:38.165 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Did it scare you?

00:11:38.165 --> 00:11:38.732 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: It didn't.

00:11:38.732 --> 00:11:39.433 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't scared.

00:11:39.433 --> 00:11:40.634 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't afraid.

00:11:40.634 --> 00:11:43.570 align:middle line:84%
I think I got more afraid
maybe even the next day

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:44.638 align:middle line:90%
where I just went

00:11:44.638 --> 00:11:45.672 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: When you
begin to think about it.

00:11:45.672 --> 00:11:46.773 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: Right,
when it sinks in.

00:11:46.773 --> 00:11:47.741 align:middle line:84%
At the time I just went,
I didn't feel I was

00:11:47.741 --> 00:11:50.410 align:middle line:90%
in danger I just felt this is

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.179 align:middle line:84%
out of place, this
is a curiosity.

00:11:52.179 --> 00:11:54.414 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well these bones,
is there any order to them

00:11:54.414 --> 00:11:56.183 align:middle line:84%
or are they just all
tossed down there?

00:11:56.183 --> 00:11:58.285 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: There are
various signs that mark

00:11:58.285 --> 00:12:00.620 align:middle line:84%
which cemeteries the bones
came from, but there's no way

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.056 align:middle line:84%
to know who's who, but you
can see this macabre pattern.

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:06.126 align:middle line:84%
There are Valentine hearts,
there's crosses made of bones,

00:12:06.126 --> 00:12:09.029 align:middle line:84%
there are arcs and
all kinds of thing and

00:12:09.029 --> 00:12:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Look at them all.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:11.865 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: Yeah and you
realize this is the only way

00:12:11.865 --> 00:12:14.301 align:middle line:84%
they could show respect, right,
was to not just throw them

00:12:14.301 --> 00:12:16.303 align:middle line:84%
in a pile but to
actually put some

00:12:16.303 --> 00:12:19.239 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And these people
died, Jeffrey, under all kinds

00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:20.440 align:middle line:90%
of circumstances right?

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.442 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: Sixty
generations of Parisians, so.

00:12:22.442 --> 00:12:24.945 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Disease, natural, wars

00:12:24.945 --> 00:12:25.779 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: All of it's there.

00:12:25.779 --> 00:12:27.047 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Battles, you name it.

00:12:27.047 --> 00:12:29.249 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: All of it's
there and what's great

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:31.151 align:middle line:84%
to me is you know
this is the foundation

00:12:31.151 --> 00:12:33.253 align:middle line:90%
of this beautiful city of Paris.

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:35.255 align:middle line:84%
People don't even know
about this place sometimes.

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:37.057 align:middle line:84%
They go there and they're
looking at the beautiful museums

00:12:37.057 --> 00:12:38.325 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Can anybody tour this?

00:12:38.325 --> 00:12:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: There are
sections anybody can tour yes,

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.063 align:middle line:84%
and there are sections
that you need to probably

00:12:43.063 --> 00:12:44.097 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Sneak in?

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:45.532 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: Bend a
few laws to get in

00:12:45.532 --> 00:12:48.368 align:middle line:84%
and know what you're doing
because it can be dangerous.

00:12:48.368 --> 00:12:50.136 align:middle line:84%
Cataphiles, they're
called, people who go

00:12:50.136 --> 00:12:52.539 align:middle line:84%
down into these Catacombs,
300 kilometers you know.

00:12:52.539 --> 00:12:54.274 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Are there
people living down there?

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:55.809 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: I wouldn't
be surprised,

00:12:55.809 --> 00:12:57.310 align:middle line:90%
you know, in certain sections.

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:58.912 align:middle line:90%
In certain sections.

00:12:58.912 --> 00:13:01.481 align:middle line:84%
And it's not bones
throughout the 300 kilometers,

00:13:01.481 --> 00:13:04.251 align:middle line:84%
there's just sections with
bones, but it's an amazing place

00:13:04.251 --> 00:13:06.453 align:middle line:84%
and I wonder, you know,
you're walking on top level

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:07.721 align:middle line:84%
and you're looking at
all these people taking

00:13:07.721 --> 00:13:08.989 align:middle line:90%
in this gorgeous city,

00:13:08.989 --> 00:13:11.258 align:middle line:84%
do you realize the
bones under your feet?

00:13:11.258 --> 00:13:12.459 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: What's underneath you.

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:14.094 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: You know it's
built on 60 generations

00:13:14.094 --> 00:13:16.296 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Are they still
tossing bones down there?

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:17.964 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: No, no, that
stopped in the mid-1800's.

00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:19.065 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Oh good.

00:13:19.065 --> 00:13:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: But it's
one of these things

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.902 align:middle line:90%
that takes your breath away.

00:13:21.902 --> 00:13:25.972 align:middle line:84%
Not only is it macabre, but
it's beautiful in a way.

00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:27.774 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning
it's just shocking

00:13:27.774 --> 00:13:30.177 align:middle line:84%
but by the end you realize
there's a beauty to it;

00:13:30.177 --> 00:13:32.846 align:middle line:84%
that these people are forced
into one collective voice.

00:13:32.846 --> 00:13:34.881 align:middle line:84%
You know you go to a cemetery
and there's a headstone

00:13:34.881 --> 00:13:37.951 align:middle line:84%
and each one represents a person
usually, but this is just,

00:13:37.951 --> 00:13:40.152 align:middle line:84%
you know, six million
in one, one

00:13:40.152 --> 00:13:42.188 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What time period
do you think this was?

00:13:42.188 --> 00:13:44.057 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: It was
the beginning

00:13:44.057 --> 00:13:45.492 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Of the skeletons?

00:13:45.492 --> 00:13:46.726 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: That
was the mid-1700's

00:13:46.726 --> 00:13:47.994 align:middle line:90%
to the mid-1800's roughly,

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:51.498 align:middle line:84%
when they emptied the various
cemeteries around Paris

00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:52.799 align:middle line:90%
and moved the bones underneath.

00:13:52.799 --> 00:13:54.768 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: That many people
died during that time period?

00:13:54.768 --> 00:13:55.569 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: Well
you're talking about

00:13:55.569 --> 00:13:56.937 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Maybe more

00:13:56.937 --> 00:13:59.072 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: 15, 16, 1700
years of history, of people.

00:13:59.072 --> 00:14:02.108 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: In the process
of living you keep dying.

00:14:02.108 --> 00:14:03.209 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: That's
it, that's it.

00:14:03.209 --> 00:14:05.145 align:middle line:84%
You know someone told
me once they said,

00:14:05.145 --> 00:14:07.981 align:middle line:84%
boy with all these stories you
must have some job security

00:14:07.981 --> 00:14:09.082 align:middle line:90%
and I said, you know me

00:14:09.082 --> 00:14:10.650 align:middle line:84%
and undertakers will
never be out of work.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:12.819 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: No, not, not at all.

00:14:12.819 --> 00:14:13.753 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: Yeah.

00:14:13.753 --> 00:14:15.055 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: When you
left the place

00:14:15.055 --> 00:14:17.524 align:middle line:84%
and like you said you
started to think about it,

00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:20.994 align:middle line:84%
what had happened and stuff
like that, would you go back?

00:14:20.994 --> 00:14:22.395 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: I have been back.

00:14:22.395 --> 00:14:26.299 align:middle line:84%
I did. I did go back a few years
later and I would go back again

00:14:26.299 --> 00:14:28.301 align:middle line:84%
because I want that
experience again.

00:14:28.301 --> 00:14:29.502 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing, you know,

00:14:29.502 --> 00:14:31.805 align:middle line:84%
there's an addictive
nature to it.

00:14:31.805 --> 00:14:34.074 align:middle line:84%
There's this rush of adrenaline
when you have the experience

00:14:34.074 --> 00:14:36.142 align:middle line:84%
and the second time I went
back nothing happened,

00:14:36.142 --> 00:14:38.411 align:middle line:84%
which, to me, further validates
the first time.

00:14:38.411 --> 00:14:40.146 align:middle line:84%
You know it's not like
it's always there.

00:14:40.146 --> 00:14:40.914 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: You're married?

00:14:40.914 --> 00:14:42.148 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: I am married.

00:14:42.148 --> 00:14:45.085 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: How does your
wife feel about what you do?

00:14:45.085 --> 00:14:47.253 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: You know she
gets asked that a lot.

00:14:47.253 --> 00:14:50.490 align:middle line:84%
This isn't her passion but at
the same time we've been able

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:52.292 align:middle line:84%
to go to some very
interesting places

00:14:52.292 --> 00:14:54.260 align:middle line:84%
because of my connections
to this stuff.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.395 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Was she there too?

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:56.596 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: She went
the second time with me

00:14:56.596 --> 00:14:57.797 align:middle line:90%
and she was ready to see.

00:14:57.797 --> 00:15:00.700 align:middle line:84%
We went to London once and
we got to go after hours

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.503 align:middle line:84%
to the Tower of London as a
guest of the Yeomen Warders.

00:15:03.503 --> 00:15:04.804 align:middle line:90%
We saw the changing of the keys.

00:15:04.804 --> 00:15:06.873 align:middle line:84%
He took us into some of the
haunted nooks and crannies

00:15:06.873 --> 00:15:09.409 align:middle line:84%
because I'd interviewed
him for one of my books,

00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:12.579 align:middle line:84%
and so on the one hand
we've had the privilege

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:15.515 align:middle line:84%
to meet some incredible people
and see some incredible things

00:15:15.515 --> 00:15:16.950 align:middle line:90%
that we wouldn't have otherwise.

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:17.917 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Fascinating isn't it?

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:18.451 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: It's great.

00:15:18.451 --> 00:15:19.152 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:15:19.152 --> 00:15:20.353 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Do you find

00:15:20.353 --> 00:15:22.622 align:middle line:84%
that Europe has more
stories than North America?

00:15:22.622 --> 00:15:24.557 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: I think because
there's more history there,

00:15:24.557 --> 00:15:26.826 align:middle line:84%
not more human history,
there were people

00:15:26.826 --> 00:15:28.428 align:middle line:84%
in North America
10,000 years ago

00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:31.264 align:middle line:84%
but more preserved
modern history there.

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:34.134 align:middle line:84%
People talk about ghosts more
matter of fact in Europe.

00:15:34.134 --> 00:15:37.070 align:middle line:84%
You know I was talking to
someone near Manchester

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:38.705 align:middle line:84%
about this 700 year
old manor house

00:15:38.705 --> 00:15:40.306 align:middle line:90%
and I said oh, is it haunted?

00:15:40.306 --> 00:15:41.708 align:middle line:90%
He was incredulous.

00:15:41.708 --> 00:15:43.677 align:middle line:84%
He said of course it's haunted;
it's a 700 year old manor house.

00:15:43.677 --> 00:15:44.511 align:middle line:90%
What

00:15:44.511 --> 00:15:45.345 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: What do you expect?

00:15:45.345 --> 00:15:46.379 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: What
self-resepecting

00:15:46.379 --> 00:15:47.714 align:middle line:84%
English manor wouldn't have a
ghost

00:15:47.714 --> 00:15:48.748 align:middle line:90%
or two?

00:15:48.748 --> 00:15:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And in North America
I think, you know,

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:53.053 align:middle line:84%
in New England anyway there's
some of that sensibility

00:15:53.053 --> 00:15:54.721 align:middle line:90%
that yeah, it's haunted so what?

00:15:54.721 --> 00:15:56.656 align:middle line:84%
And then you move to
different parts of the country

00:15:56.656 --> 00:15:58.458 align:middle line:84%
and people interpret it
differently, you know?

00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:01.795 align:middle line:84%
In the south they say well
this is demonic or angelic,

00:16:01.795 --> 00:16:03.163 align:middle line:90%
there's no middle ground.

00:16:03.163 --> 00:16:05.465 align:middle line:84%
Then someone else might be
more about just communicating

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:07.367 align:middle line:84%
with the energies
of it, and that's,

00:16:07.367 --> 00:16:08.702 align:middle line:90%
that's the thing isn't it?

00:16:08.702 --> 00:16:12.038 align:middle line:84%
This great big human gumbo
that we're living in every day,

00:16:12.038 --> 00:16:15.075 align:middle line:84%
we all add to these stories;
we all take something from them

00:16:15.075 --> 00:16:17.110 align:middle line:84%
and leave part of ourselves
when we talk about them.

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:19.145 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Now tell me about
your work at Stonehenge.

00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:20.413 align:middle line:90%
What'd you do there?

00:16:20.413 --> 00:16:22.248 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: So Stonehenge
in England is very famous,

00:16:22.248 --> 00:16:25.151 align:middle line:84%
everybody knows it, but
there's a Stonehenge in America,

00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:26.720 align:middle line:84%
in New Hampshire,
Salem, New Hampshire,

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.854 align:middle line:84%
which is in the southern
part of the state.

00:16:27.854 --> 00:16:28.621 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Smaller, right?

00:16:28.621 --> 00:16:29.989 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: Much smaller.

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:31.391 align:middle line:84%
When you go to Stonehenge in
England you look and you say,

00:16:31.391 --> 00:16:32.892 align:middle line:90%
how did people do this?

00:16:32.892 --> 00:16:33.593 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: How'd they do this?

00:16:33.593 --> 00:16:34.260 align:middle line:90%
How'd they move this?

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.027 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: Right.

00:16:35.027 --> 00:16:36.296 align:middle line:90%
When you go to Stonehenge

00:16:36.296 --> 00:16:38.231 align:middle line:84%
in New Hampshire you would
say why did they do this?

00:16:38.231 --> 00:16:41.501 align:middle line:84%
There'll these alignment
stones that point

00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:43.837 align:middle line:90%
at various point. That's one

00:16:43.837 --> 00:16:45.872 align:middle line:90%
of the alignment stones.

00:16:45.872 --> 00:16:49.709 align:middle line:84%
So when sunrises or sunsets
hit then from two points,

00:16:49.709 --> 00:16:53.046 align:middle line:84%
from a central point and so
on, that would mark equinoxes;

00:16:53.046 --> 00:16:55.415 align:middle line:84%
summer, fall, winter,
spring and things like that,

00:16:55.415 --> 00:16:57.984 align:middle line:84%
but it also has these
other alignment stones

00:16:57.984 --> 00:16:59.619 align:middle line:90%
that mark the half holidays.

00:16:59.619 --> 00:17:01.421 align:middle line:84%
And the people who did
that, the people who cared

00:17:01.421 --> 00:17:03.489 align:middle line:84%
about those half
holidays, we the Celts.

00:17:03.489 --> 00:17:06.993 align:middle line:84%
Samhain, right, Beltane,
you know the May 1st,

00:17:06.993 --> 00:17:10.430 align:middle line:84%
the October 31st and so it
seems to be Celtic in origin.

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:13.833 align:middle line:84%
Now Harvard came in, Harvard's
not too far from there, came in

00:17:13.833 --> 00:17:16.902 align:middle line:84%
and did a study and said the
last time these stones would

00:17:16.902 --> 00:17:20.206 align:middle line:84%
have all lined up perfectly
was about 4,000 years ago,

00:17:20.206 --> 00:17:21.374 align:middle line:90%
because the earth wobbles.

00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:23.343 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't, it's not
a perfect rotation,

00:17:23.343 --> 00:17:26.179 align:middle line:84%
so the last time they would
have aligned perfectly was 4,000

00:17:26.179 --> 00:17:26.846 align:middle line:90%
years ago.

00:17:26.846 --> 00:17:27.914 align:middle line:90%
What were the Celts?

00:17:27.914 --> 00:17:28.915 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Which means...

00:17:28.915 --> 00:17:29.749 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: Right.

00:17:29.749 --> 00:17:30.884 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Why were they here?

00:17:30.884 --> 00:17:32.652 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: 4,000 years
ago what were they doing

00:17:32.652 --> 00:17:33.586 align:middle line:90%
in New England?

00:17:33.586 --> 00:17:35.054 align:middle line:84%
And there's other
alignment stones

00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:38.725 align:middle line:84%
and the local Native Americans
didn't tend to work in stone

00:17:38.725 --> 00:17:40.760 align:middle line:84%
like this, they didn't
leave stone structures,

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:44.764 align:middle line:84%
so the consensus seems to be
that this is likely Celtic

00:17:44.764 --> 00:17:47.000 align:middle line:84%
in origin, but it's
more than a calendar.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.236 align:middle line:84%
There are chambers and there's
a feature called the Sacrificial

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:52.038 align:middle line:90%
Table, which we have a photo of.

00:17:52.038 --> 00:17:55.074 align:middle line:84%
It's this plateau that looks
almost like a cutting board

00:17:55.074 --> 00:17:57.877 align:middle line:84%
with a groove around it, like
when you're cutting your meat

00:17:57.877 --> 00:18:01.281 align:middle line:84%
in your kitchen except it's the
size of a person as you can see.

00:18:01.281 --> 00:18:04.284 align:middle line:84%
And so not only was it a
calendar it was a place

00:18:04.284 --> 00:18:05.785 align:middle line:90%
for sacrifice.

00:18:05.785 --> 00:18:08.154 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to remember
George years ago, you know,

00:18:08.154 --> 00:18:10.023 align:middle line:84%
what's the significance
of a calendar?

00:18:10.023 --> 00:18:11.591 align:middle line:84%
Well today we take
it for granted;

00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:13.426 align:middle line:84%
we put our doctor's
appointments or whatever.

00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:14.327 align:middle line:90%
Back then

00:18:14.327 --> 00:18:14.961 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Everything.

00:18:14.961 --> 00:18:16.162 align:middle line:90%
Seasons, you name it.

00:18:16.162 --> 00:18:17.797 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: If you messed
up your calendar, you die.

00:18:17.797 --> 00:18:21.067 align:middle line:84%
If you don't plant at the right
time, harvest at the right time,

00:18:21.067 --> 00:18:23.636 align:middle line:84%
hunt, migrate and
so on, you die.

00:18:23.636 --> 00:18:27.273 align:middle line:84%
And so if things aren't going
well with your, you know,

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:29.309 align:middle line:84%
with your calendar, if you're
doing everything right,

00:18:29.309 --> 00:18:29.876 align:middle line:90%
what do you do?

00:18:29.876 --> 00:18:30.810 align:middle line:90%
You sacrifice.

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:31.945 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well in
those days too,

00:18:31.945 --> 00:18:34.681 align:middle line:84%
if you didn't have some
kind of calendar system,

00:18:34.681 --> 00:18:37.484 align:middle line:84%
you'd have no idea when the
seasons were going to change.

00:18:37.484 --> 00:18:38.685 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: Sure.

00:18:38.685 --> 00:18:40.186 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You'd go, I
think we're getting closer

00:18:40.186 --> 00:18:42.522 align:middle line:90%
to winter but I'm not sure.

00:18:42.522 --> 00:18:43.656 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: Right, right.

00:18:43.656 --> 00:18:45.291 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You could be
off by 30 days right?

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:46.526 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: Well especially
in New England, you know,

00:18:46.526 --> 00:18:48.428 align:middle line:84%
we get some wacky
weather that can

00:18:48.428 --> 00:18:49.762 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: We sure do.

00:18:49.762 --> 00:18:50.997 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: That can look,
look like the wrong season.

00:18:50.997 --> 00:18:52.866 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Now this
isn't haunted though.

00:18:52.866 --> 00:18:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: Well
here's the thing.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.802 align:middle line:84%
There have been stories,
there have been stories

00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:57.770 align:middle line:84%
about people seeing
glowing balls of light

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:00.240 align:middle line:84%
with their naked eye, not
just captured on camera

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.674 align:middle line:90%
but moving throughout.

00:19:01.674 --> 00:19:03.710 align:middle line:90%
This is a sacred place.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:06.112 align:middle line:84%
You know it went from
being a functional place

00:19:06.112 --> 00:19:07.247 align:middle line:90%
to even today sacred.

00:19:07.247 --> 00:19:08.581 align:middle line:84%
Pagans go there and perform
riturals.

00:19:08.581 --> 00:19:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Is it hallowed
ground, as they say?

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.386 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: I think after
someone-if you pay attention

00:19:13.386 --> 00:19:16.122 align:middle line:84%
to a piece of land for so
many years and if people come

00:19:16.122 --> 00:19:18.258 align:middle line:84%
and consider it sacred
and they perform rituals

00:19:18.258 --> 00:19:21.661 align:middle line:84%
as pagans still do to this
very day, it becomes sacred,

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:24.264 align:middle line:84%
it becomes hallowed, it
becomes something more

00:19:24.264 --> 00:19:26.266 align:middle line:84%
than just a hilltop in
southern New Hampshire

00:19:26.266 --> 00:19:29.035 align:middle line:84%
with a few rocks pointing
in various directions.

00:19:29.035 --> 00:19:31.738 align:middle line:84%
It becomes something, again,
the connection to the past,

00:19:31.738 --> 00:19:34.741 align:middle line:84%
but it also becomes this sacred
site where people go and take

00:19:34.741 --> 00:19:36.109 align:middle line:90%
from it what they will.

00:19:36.109 --> 00:19:38.645 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not pagan so when I
went there it was just this

00:19:38.645 --> 00:19:43.283 align:middle line:84%
amazing curiosity, incredible
structures, but to a pagan,

00:19:43.283 --> 00:19:46.352 align:middle line:84%
and I've interviewed pagans
there, it's a very special place

00:19:46.352 --> 00:19:49.989 align:middle line:84%
where they come to connect with
Mother Earth and it's beautiful,

00:19:49.989 --> 00:19:52.191 align:middle line:84%
it's beautiful that we all
get what we get out of it.

00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:53.359 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Why does it seem

00:19:53.359 --> 00:19:57.497 align:middle line:84%
that all these structures
are tied into death?

00:19:57.497 --> 00:19:59.666 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: Well death
is the big one isn't it?

00:19:59.666 --> 00:20:00.600 align:middle line:90%
It's the great

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:01.968 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: It's the
great unknown.

00:20:01.968 --> 00:20:03.202 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: It's
the great unknown

00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:05.838 align:middle line:84%
but it also levels the
playing field for all of us.

00:20:05.838 --> 00:20:09.008 align:middle line:84%
It's one of our guarantees
in life; we're going to die.

00:20:09.008 --> 00:20:11.711 align:middle line:84%
From the moment you're
born you're going to die

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:13.680 align:middle line:84%
and we all have to come
to grips with that,

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.482 align:middle line:84%
whether it's how we're going to
be remembered, what do we want

00:20:16.482 --> 00:20:19.819 align:middle line:84%
to be remember for,
what cause do we want

00:20:19.819 --> 00:20:21.487 align:middle line:84%
to maybe even take
on in the afterlife.

00:20:21.487 --> 00:20:23.723 align:middle line:84%
Do we want to stick around
and see our families grow up?

00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:26.092 align:middle line:84%
Do we want to see the land
that we loved or the building

00:20:26.092 --> 00:20:27.760 align:middle line:90%
that we loved taken care of?

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:28.962 align:middle line:90%
All of these things.

00:20:28.962 --> 00:20:31.331 align:middle line:84%
So we have a pre-occupation
with death and have

00:20:31.331 --> 00:20:33.900 align:middle line:84%
since humans started
burial rituals.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:34.534 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Since the
beginning of time.

00:20:34.534 --> 00:20:35.702 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: Yeah,

00:20:35.702 --> 00:20:37.537 align:middle line:84%
I mean since-40,000 years
ago there was ritual

00:20:37.537 --> 00:20:39.572 align:middle line:90%
to the burial process, you know?

00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:41.774 align:middle line:84%
Laying the body in a certain
direction east or west

00:20:41.774 --> 00:20:44.010 align:middle line:84%
and flowers were abundant
and things like that.

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:46.612 align:middle line:84%
Why? Because we thought
it mattered.

00:20:46.612 --> 00:20:51.017 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Would you want to know
the day you die and how you die?

00:20:51.017 --> 00:20:52.051 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: No.

00:20:52.051 --> 00:20:52.719 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You don't
want to know that?

00:20:52.719 --> 00:20:53.853 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: No, no.

00:20:53.853 --> 00:20:55.755 align:middle line:84%
I mean because it could
be getting hit by a bus

00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:56.823 align:middle line:90%
after I leave here today.

00:20:56.823 --> 00:20:58.291 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well yeah
but if you knew that

00:20:58.291 --> 00:20:59.325 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: I wouldn't be here.

00:20:59.325 --> 00:21:00.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: You'd avoid the bus.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.262 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: Yeah I suppose
but I kind of feel like, George,

00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:06.065 align:middle line:84%
that everything is
part of a plan

00:21:06.065 --> 00:21:07.800 align:middle line:84%
and we're all playing
our role in it

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.503 align:middle line:84%
and there are certain things
we're just not supposed to know.

00:21:10.503 --> 00:21:14.107 align:middle line:84%
We can get gut feelings
about it, what comes after,

00:21:14.107 --> 00:21:17.043 align:middle line:84%
that's the thing we can
work on inside, but the time

00:21:17.043 --> 00:21:18.411 align:middle line:90%
and place that's just not

00:21:18.411 --> 00:21:21.147 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: The reason I bring
that up, Tom and I, my producer,

00:21:21.147 --> 00:21:25.718 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about all
the Coast to Coast guests

00:21:25.718 --> 00:21:28.087 align:middle line:84%
that have passed
on in the 11 years

00:21:28.087 --> 00:21:29.288 align:middle line:84%
that I've been doing
the program.

00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:30.656 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: Sure.

00:21:30.656 --> 00:21:35.161 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: It's uncanny Jeff
and I wonder how many of them

00:21:35.161 --> 00:21:40.233 align:middle line:84%
if I would had said to them,
Glenn Kimball being one of them,

00:21:40.233 --> 00:21:44.170 align:middle line:84%
great historian, Glenn you're
going to be dead in ten years.

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:47.140 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if people would
have been shocked, you know?

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.777 align:middle line:84%
What? I'm going to be dead
in-Lloyd Pye who was just

00:21:50.777 --> 00:21:52.045 align:middle line:90%
on Beyond Belief. He's gone.

00:21:52.045 --> 00:21:57.650 align:middle line:84%
I just wonder how many
people would like to know

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:01.788 align:middle line:84%
so they could take
precautions or be prepared.

00:22:01.788 --> 00:22:03.156 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: How about
you don't get to know

00:22:03.156 --> 00:22:05.591 align:middle line:84%
and you live every day like
this could be the last and you

00:22:05.591 --> 00:22:06.659 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I do that too.

00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:07.794 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: And you
seize these moments

00:22:07.794 --> 00:22:09.695 align:middle line:84%
and you say what great
things can I do today?

00:22:09.695 --> 00:22:11.631 align:middle line:84%
What connections can I
make with other people?

00:22:11.631 --> 00:22:12.899 align:middle line:90%
How can I help?

00:22:12.899 --> 00:22:14.734 align:middle line:84%
How can I make the world
around me a little bit better

00:22:14.734 --> 00:22:17.036 align:middle line:90%
because you don't know?

00:22:17.036 --> 00:22:18.671 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Interesting
things these days.

00:22:18.671 --> 00:22:19.972 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: Yeah,
yeah, and you know

00:22:19.972 --> 00:22:22.375 align:middle line:84%
and when you explore the
paranormal I think what's

00:22:22.375 --> 00:22:25.411 align:middle line:84%
so wonderful about this subject,
and you know you do it nightly

00:22:25.411 --> 00:22:28.581 align:middle line:84%
on your talk show, you're
asking the really big questions

00:22:28.581 --> 00:22:29.615 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:22:29.615 --> 00:22:31.017 align:middle line:84%
You're asking about
life after death.

00:22:31.017 --> 00:22:32.485 align:middle line:84%
You're asking are we
alone in the universe.

00:22:32.485 --> 00:22:33.953 align:middle line:84%
You're asking do we
know every creature

00:22:33.953 --> 00:22:35.054 align:middle line:90%
that walks the earth with us.

00:22:35.054 --> 00:22:36.556 align:middle line:90%
What's the nature of time?

00:22:36.556 --> 00:22:37.957 align:middle line:90%
What's the nature of physics?

00:22:37.957 --> 00:22:39.425 align:middle line:90%
These are the big ones.

00:22:39.425 --> 00:22:43.496 align:middle line:84%
This is-- our human experience
exists to ask these questions.

00:22:43.496 --> 00:22:44.831 align:middle line:90%
You may not get the answer

00:22:44.831 --> 00:22:47.600 align:middle line:84%
or you might get an individual
answer but we have to ask.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.203 align:middle line:84%
If we stop asking the
question, we stop growing,

00:22:50.203 --> 00:22:52.171 align:middle line:84%
we stop living and
we start dying.

00:22:52.171 --> 00:22:54.674 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What have you
concluded about all of this

00:22:54.674 --> 00:22:56.075 align:middle line:90%
and what it all means?

00:22:56.075 --> 00:22:58.277 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: It's
indisputably real.

00:22:58.277 --> 00:23:02.215 align:middle line:84%
What it is, I'm still working on
that, but it's real in the sense

00:23:02.215 --> 00:23:04.817 align:middle line:84%
that when I say Bigfoot
an image is conjured

00:23:04.817 --> 00:23:06.452 align:middle line:90%
in your mind instantly.

00:23:06.452 --> 00:23:09.455 align:middle line:84%
Now can I go find one in the
woods for you, I hope so, maybe

00:23:09.455 --> 00:23:10.256 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: One day.

00:23:10.256 --> 00:23:10.957 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: Maybe one day.

00:23:10.957 --> 00:23:12.158 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: You've tried.

00:23:12.158 --> 00:23:13.593 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: I've been out
traipsing in the woods,

00:23:13.593 --> 00:23:15.094 align:middle line:90%
haven't found one yet,

00:23:15.094 --> 00:23:19.632 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time you
know these things are real

00:23:19.632 --> 00:23:21.400 align:middle line:90%
because there's names for them,

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.768 align:middle line:84%
because there's stories
behind them,

00:23:22.768 --> 00:23:25.404 align:middle line:84%
because there's credible people
that have seen these things

00:23:25.404 --> 00:23:27.874 align:middle line:84%
and we all want, I think
deep down we all want

00:23:27.874 --> 00:23:31.310 align:middle line:84%
that experience, we want to see
it and have the case settled.

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's just for me I
want to be able to say yeah,

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:35.915 align:middle line:84%
it's real, there's
something to it,

00:23:35.915 --> 00:23:37.817 align:middle line:90%
but how do you define reality?

00:23:37.817 --> 00:23:39.785 align:middle line:84%
That becomes an even
bigger question right?

00:23:39.785 --> 00:23:42.155 align:middle line:84%
Perception I think is
the simplest definition.

00:23:42.155 --> 00:23:45.992 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Do you ever ask
yourself why is this real?

00:23:45.992 --> 00:23:46.826 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: Oh yeah.

00:23:46.826 --> 00:23:48.828 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Not just how but why?

00:23:48.828 --> 00:23:50.196 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: Yeah,
of course, of course.

00:23:50.196 --> 00:23:53.032 align:middle line:84%
You know why is this happening
to some people but not all?

00:23:53.032 --> 00:23:56.702 align:middle line:84%
Why do some people have an
encounter and an experience

00:23:56.702 --> 00:23:58.905 align:middle line:84%
and again, I think
sometimes you have to throw it

00:23:58.905 --> 00:24:01.407 align:middle line:84%
up to it's some greater
plan of the universe

00:24:01.407 --> 00:24:02.942 align:middle line:84%
that maybe you're
not supposed to know.

00:24:02.942 --> 00:24:04.277 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What about
your belief system?

00:24:04.277 --> 00:24:06.679 align:middle line:84%
What about people
who don't believe?

00:24:06.679 --> 00:24:09.649 align:middle line:84%
Will they ever experience
anything unusual or paranormal?

00:24:09.649 --> 00:24:11.083 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: It happens all the
time.

00:24:11.083 --> 00:24:14.954 align:middle line:84%
I think, I respect anyone
who says look, I don't know

00:24:14.954 --> 00:24:16.722 align:middle line:84%
if it's real or not; I
haven't had the experience.

00:24:16.722 --> 00:24:18.124 align:middle line:90%
That's a fair position.

00:24:18.124 --> 00:24:19.859 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What about the person
who says, I don't believe it.

00:24:19.859 --> 00:24:20.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: Right.

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:21.794 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And I never will.

00:24:21.794 --> 00:24:23.763 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: That to me,
that's a belief system.

00:24:23.763 --> 00:24:24.864 align:middle line:90%
That's me saying, that's

00:24:24.864 --> 00:24:26.666 align:middle line:84%
like saying the Indian
Ocean can't exist

00:24:26.666 --> 00:24:29.235 align:middle line:84%
because I've never seen it even
though a billion plus people

00:24:29.235 --> 00:24:33.472 align:middle line:84%
live around it and see it every
day and it's their reality,

00:24:33.472 --> 00:24:35.541 align:middle line:84%
you say it can't be
because I don't believe it,

00:24:35.541 --> 00:24:39.078 align:middle line:84%
which is not a very evolved
way of thinking you know?

00:24:39.078 --> 00:24:41.247 align:middle line:90%
And so to me you never know.

00:24:41.247 --> 00:24:44.183 align:middle line:84%
I've had skeptics pull be
aside and say this is all bunk,

00:24:44.183 --> 00:24:45.918 align:middle line:84%
you're making it up and then
a minute later they say,

00:24:45.918 --> 00:24:48.521 align:middle line:84%
let me tell you about this
one time, and I go, go ahead.

00:24:48.521 --> 00:24:49.355 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Or maybe.

00:24:49.355 --> 00:24:50.456 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: Maybe.

00:24:50.456 --> 00:24:51.257 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, maybe.

00:24:51.257 --> 00:24:52.291 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about your one time.

00:24:52.291 --> 00:24:53.626 align:middle line:90%
I think we all have that.

00:24:53.626 --> 00:24:55.862 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You don't generally
need to have an experience

00:24:55.862 --> 00:24:56.829 align:middle line:90%
to be a believer do you?

00:24:56.829 --> 00:24:58.831 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: No of course not.

00:24:58.831 --> 00:25:02.802 align:middle line:84%
If someone you love or care
about or trust says I just went

00:25:02.802 --> 00:25:05.972 align:middle line:84%
through this thing and you can
see how shaken up they are,

00:25:05.972 --> 00:25:08.140 align:middle line:84%
to me that's very
compelling you know?

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:11.143 align:middle line:84%
I've seen that where
I walked into a room,

00:25:11.143 --> 00:25:13.879 align:middle line:84%
we were doing an investigation,
I walk into a room

00:25:13.879 --> 00:25:15.181 align:middle line:90%
and someone is completely shaken

00:25:15.181 --> 00:25:16.949 align:middle line:84%
up by something they
just experienced.

00:25:16.949 --> 00:25:18.818 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't there, I didn't see it,

00:25:18.818 --> 00:25:21.520 align:middle line:84%
but I think a good analogy
I've used before is it's kind

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.755 align:middle line:90%
of like the wind.

00:25:22.755 --> 00:25:25.124 align:middle line:84%
No one has ever seen the
wind, it's invisible,

00:25:25.124 --> 00:25:26.192 align:middle line:90%
but we see its effects.

00:25:26.192 --> 00:25:26.859 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:25:26.859 --> 00:25:28.261 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: Right?

00:25:28.261 --> 00:25:30.396 align:middle line:84%
So at that point I didn't see
the wind but I saw what it did.

00:25:30.396 --> 00:25:33.099 align:middle line:84%
I saw someone shaken up by
something that just walked

00:25:33.099 --> 00:25:34.934 align:middle line:84%
through the room and
this is someone I trust

00:25:34.934 --> 00:25:37.803 align:middle line:84%
and who I know doesn't have
this happen all the time,

00:25:37.803 --> 00:25:40.840 align:middle line:84%
and to me that's almost just
slightly less compelling

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.041 align:middle line:90%
than me seeing it for myself.

00:25:42.041 --> 00:25:44.076 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: How many people
go on a ghost hunt Jeff

00:25:44.076 --> 00:25:47.546 align:middle line:84%
and they're disappointed because
they don't find the ghost?

00:25:47.546 --> 00:25:49.115 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: That I think
is almost a nature more

00:25:49.115 --> 00:25:51.817 align:middle line:84%
of so many television shows,
you know, you watch the TV shows

00:25:51.817 --> 00:25:54.720 align:middle line:84%
and every six minutes before
commercial something happens

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.989 align:middle line:84%
and then they get into these
haunted places and say okay,

00:25:56.989 --> 00:25:59.525 align:middle line:84%
it's been almost
seven minutes now.

00:25:59.525 --> 00:26:00.626 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And they
have to show something.

00:26:00.626 --> 00:26:01.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: They
have to show something

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.362 align:middle line:90%
and I think it's disappointing

00:26:03.362 --> 00:26:05.331 align:middle line:84%
because they're ready
for that experience.

00:26:05.331 --> 00:26:07.333 align:middle line:84%
We want to have it, we
want to have it there,

00:26:07.333 --> 00:26:09.135 align:middle line:84%
not where we live
I think in general,

00:26:09.135 --> 00:26:12.905 align:middle line:84%
and then we can come home with
story to tell, but I think even

00:26:12.905 --> 00:26:15.441 align:middle line:84%
if you look at it as simply
getting into these locations

00:26:15.441 --> 00:26:18.411 align:middle line:84%
after hours when it's dark, you
know, breathing in the place,

00:26:18.411 --> 00:26:21.714 align:middle line:84%
even if nothing happens you're
still part of that story

00:26:21.714 --> 00:26:23.082 align:middle line:84%
and you still have
that takeaway.

00:26:23.082 --> 00:26:26.085 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What has been
your famous for you

00:26:26.085 --> 00:26:28.521 align:middle line:90%
and most favorite haunted story?

00:26:28.521 --> 00:26:30.189 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: The White
House in Washington DC.

00:26:30.189 --> 00:26:32.291 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Tell me about that,
and we'll talk a little bit more

00:26:32.291 --> 00:26:33.759 align:middle line:90%
about that next program.

00:26:33.759 --> 00:26:35.127 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: Yeah, but it's,

00:26:35.127 --> 00:26:37.930 align:middle line:84%
what I love about it is the
credibility of the witnesses.

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:39.165 align:middle line:90%
Everyone knows the building.

00:26:39.165 --> 00:26:41.267 align:middle line:84%
When you say the White
House everyone understands.

00:26:41.267 --> 00:26:42.335 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Everyone knows it.

00:26:42.335 --> 00:26:43.669 align:middle line:90%
You know people have died there.

00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:45.504 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: That's right
people have died there but think

00:26:45.504 --> 00:26:48.574 align:middle line:84%
of all the American history
that building has seen.

00:26:48.574 --> 00:26:49.942 align:middle line:90%
Almost all of it you know?

00:26:49.942 --> 00:26:52.878 align:middle line:84%
It was built in the last
few years of the 1700s,

00:26:52.878 --> 00:26:56.115 align:middle line:84%
but it has seen every U.S.
President including Washington

00:26:56.115 --> 00:26:58.117 align:middle line:84%
who died before it was
completed but, you know,

00:26:58.117 --> 00:27:01.787 align:middle line:84%
was on the grounds, and every
U.S. President has stood there

00:27:01.787 --> 00:27:03.956 align:middle line:84%
and left some mark,
and I think some

00:27:03.956 --> 00:27:07.026 align:middle line:84%
of those marks can
still be experienced.

00:27:07.026 --> 00:27:09.662 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You know those
Presidents who have passed on,

00:27:09.662 --> 00:27:12.631 align:middle line:84%
some of whom may be still
roaming the hallways there,

00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:16.702 align:middle line:84%
there were a lot of people,
First Ladies for example,

00:27:16.702 --> 00:27:20.206 align:middle line:84%
that said, you know, I
saw this or I saw that.

00:27:20.206 --> 00:27:21.040 align:middle line:90%
I mean it's there.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.441 align:middle line:90%
There's a presence.

00:27:22.441 --> 00:27:24.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: It's an
amazing place, it really is.

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:26.011 align:middle line:90%
I've been there.

00:27:26.011 --> 00:27:28.447 align:middle line:84%
I've had the honor of going and
interviewing some of the staff

00:27:28.447 --> 00:27:30.549 align:middle line:84%
and what I love-I
love history too.

00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:34.887 align:middle line:84%
I'm a history buff and we'll
never know every detail.

00:27:34.887 --> 00:27:38.290 align:middle line:84%
We'll never know the minutia
but we know the big stuff

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:39.558 align:middle line:90%
and when you talk about some

00:27:39.558 --> 00:27:41.527 align:middle line:84%
of these ghost stories
I believe we're kind

00:27:41.527 --> 00:27:43.195 align:middle line:90%
of filling in the gray area.

00:27:43.195 --> 00:27:46.165 align:middle line:84%
Where all the hard facts
might be missing, these legends

00:27:46.165 --> 00:27:50.236 align:middle line:84%
and lore are still legitimate
forms of history you know?

00:27:50.236 --> 00:27:53.205 align:middle line:84%
A story gets passed and retold
and retold and sure it's going

00:27:53.205 --> 00:27:55.708 align:middle line:84%
to change and evolve but at
the same time there's something

00:27:55.708 --> 00:27:58.644 align:middle line:84%
in there and what's in there
is truth; it's called truth.

00:27:58.644 --> 00:28:01.947 align:middle line:84%
We only share stories that
ring true to us and that's

00:28:01.947 --> 00:28:03.582 align:middle line:90%
with anything you know?

00:28:03.582 --> 00:28:04.784 align:middle line:90%
So if it rings true to us,

00:28:04.784 --> 00:28:06.585 align:middle line:84%
if it sounds compelling
we share it with others.

00:28:06.585 --> 00:28:07.653 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Jeff, who's
the President

00:28:07.653 --> 00:28:09.188 align:middle line:90%
who hangs around the most?

00:28:09.188 --> 00:28:10.122 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: Abe Lincoln.

00:28:10.122 --> 00:28:11.323 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: He won't leave huh?

00:28:11.323 --> 00:28:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: No, no and I
wonder will he not leave

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:18.364 align:middle line:84%
because he's just
bound by duty and honor

00:28:18.364 --> 00:28:20.933 align:middle line:84%
or do the current
Presidents need him

00:28:20.933 --> 00:28:24.470 align:middle line:84%
because of every U.S. President,
his was the hardest hands down.

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:28.507 align:middle line:84%
He, his nation's at war with
itself and being torn apart,

00:28:28.507 --> 00:28:31.277 align:middle line:84%
he ended slavery, his son
died in the White House

00:28:31.277 --> 00:28:33.712 align:middle line:84%
and he paid the ultimate
price; he was assassinated,

00:28:33.712 --> 00:28:35.047 align:middle line:90%
so that's the benchmark.

00:28:35.047 --> 00:28:37.216 align:middle line:84%
There's no tougher presidency
than Lincoln and I wonder

00:28:37.216 --> 00:28:39.852 align:middle line:84%
if the modern day Presidents who
are struggling with their day

00:28:39.852 --> 00:28:41.120 align:middle line:90%
to day decisions that they have

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:45.057 align:middle line:84%
to make -- I remember
seeing George H. W. Bush

00:28:45.057 --> 00:28:47.760 align:middle line:84%
in an interview saying the first
time he had to send some troops

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.329 align:middle line:84%
into harm's way he
sat there saying,

00:28:50.329 --> 00:28:51.797 align:middle line:84%
I thought about what
Lincoln went through

00:28:51.797 --> 00:28:53.899 align:middle line:90%
and I went okay, I can do this.

00:28:53.899 --> 00:28:56.669 align:middle line:84%
So there's this invoking, you
know, of this sacred name,

00:28:56.669 --> 00:28:58.237 align:middle line:84%
Lincoln you know,
in the White House.

00:28:58.237 --> 00:29:00.773 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And you wonder if
Lincoln is giving then advice.

00:29:00.773 --> 00:29:02.274 align:middle line:90%
You just never know.

00:29:02.274 --> 00:29:04.944 align:middle line:84%
>> Belanger: If nothing
else his spirit's there.

00:29:04.944 --> 00:29:07.413 align:middle line:84%
And however you want to
define the word spirit is fine

00:29:07.413 --> 00:29:11.450 align:middle line:84%
and the strength and what he
represents is there, you know,

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:13.552 align:middle line:90%
beyond just the portraits.

00:29:13.552 --> 00:29:19.258 align:middle line:84%
This guy is amazing and the
influence that's still felt,

00:29:19.258 --> 00:29:20.493 align:middle line:90%
that's really something.

00:29:20.493 --> 00:29:21.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean we should
all be so lucky.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.562 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Jeffrey thanks
for being on Beyond Belief.

00:29:23.562 --> 00:29:24.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Belanger: Thank you George.

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:26.265 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well there
is another side.

00:29:26.265 --> 00:29:28.367 align:middle line:90%
You may not be a believer in it

00:29:28.367 --> 00:29:31.737 align:middle line:84%
but one day I'm convinced
you probably will be.

00:29:31.737 --> 00:29:35.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory and thanks
for watching Beyond Belief.
