00:00:02.964 --> 00:00:19.592 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.592 --> 00:00:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.090 align:middle line:10%
It's called remote
viewing, the ability

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.380 align:middle line:10%
to see things past and
present with your mind.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.210 align:middle line:84%
Major Ed Dames,
of course, is one

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.640 align:middle line:84%
of the foremost remote
viewers in the world.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And he was part of our
government's military program

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.170 align:middle line:84%
investigating remote
viewing many years ago.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Ed, always a
pleasure to see you.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ED DAMES: Oh,
the please is mine.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.393 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for inviting me.

00:00:42.393 --> 00:00:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This program that
you were in a long time

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.760 align:middle line:84%
ago with the military,
how did they recruit you?

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.050 align:middle line:90%
How did they find you?

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.767 align:middle line:84%
And were you a remote
viewer before that?

00:00:50.767 --> 00:00:53.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Well I wasn't a
remote viewer or a psychic guy.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.330 align:middle line:90%
And I found them.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.050 align:middle line:84%
I was at work at the Office
of the Secretary of Defense,

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.450 align:middle line:84%
very high level, celestial
level of the government.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.200 align:middle line:10%
My job was to select the US
targets, intelligence targets

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.370 align:middle line:10%
for penetration.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Most of those targets were
erstwhile Soviet biological

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.250 align:middle line:84%
warfare facilities,
chemical warfare facilities,

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.610 align:middle line:84%
nuclear weapons facilities,
and directed energy weapons

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.630 align:middle line:90%
facilities.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And to locate hostages
and terrorists.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.330 align:middle line:84%
But I had at my
disposal all the tools

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.430 align:middle line:90%
that a top spy would have.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.979 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Satellites,
agents on the ground,

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.980 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of stuff that
we can't talk about.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.390 align:middle line:10%
But one of my tools was this
nascent remote viewing unit

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.890 align:middle line:10%
that the army had.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.130 align:middle line:10%
And I was fascinated with it.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.760 align:middle line:10%
Because some of
these cases that I

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.470 align:middle line:10%
was dealing with,
by hook or by crook

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.950 align:middle line:10%
we could not penetrate
these very, very thick walls

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.000 align:middle line:10%
of Russian secrecy.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.800 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.425 align:middle line:10%
>>DAMES: So but the
remote viewing unit

00:01:45.425 --> 00:01:46.300 align:middle line:10%
was able to do that.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.740 align:middle line:10%
And I became fascinated
with it, and stepped down

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.200 align:middle line:10%
to take over as operations
and training officer.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.120 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Ed, did we
as the United States

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.780 align:middle line:10%
get involved in this because
the Soviets were doing it too?

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.180 align:middle line:90%
I mean, who was the leader?

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Well, we call it
the 10 foot tall syndrome.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.510 align:middle line:90%
And you're partially right.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.400 align:middle line:84%
Word came down that
the Sovs and the Czechs

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.190 align:middle line:84%
and to a certain degree the
Hungarian intelligence were

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.980 align:middle line:84%
fiddling around with this,
so we had to do it too.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.550 align:middle line:84%
That was actually one of the
key reasons behind the beginning

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.510 align:middle line:90%
of the program.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.176 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
were in the government

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:24.750 align:middle line:90%
program, what was the mission?

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.500 align:middle line:90%
What did they want you to do?

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: In the
psychic spying unit?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.799 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Predominantly
two things.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.610 align:middle line:10%
One was to locate hostages and
terrorists, which we did that.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Terry Waite, Terry Anderson,
and Colonel Higgins, those cases

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.620 align:middle line:90%
specifically, and their captors.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.350 align:middle line:84%
But for the most
part, most of our time

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.650 align:middle line:84%
was attempting to penetrate
very, very secret facilities

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.610 align:middle line:90%
in Russia.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.180 align:middle line:84%
Again, predominantly
biological warfare facilities,

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.490 align:middle line:90%
nuclear storage facilities.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.910 align:middle line:84%
One of our missions-- and we
worked for all the intelligence

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:00.720 align:middle line:90%
agencies.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.530 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the CIA asked
us on behalf of the Navy

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.440 align:middle line:84%
to locate some Silkworm
missiles that the Iranians had

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.190 align:middle line:90%
purchased from the Chinese.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.560 align:middle line:90%
These were anti-ship missiles.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.840 align:middle line:84%
They based them on the Strait
of Hormuz in warehouses.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.630 align:middle line:10%
So we had to locate
which warehouse

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.270 align:middle line:10%
and then count the
missiles inside.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How accurate
was the group?

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: The group was--

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.710 align:middle line:84%
a lot of other documents have
been released now to the public

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.410 align:middle line:84%
except the stuff that was
really, really accurate.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And what was classified
about the program

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.580 align:middle line:84%
was the existence
of the program,

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.327 align:middle line:84%
not the existence
of the protocols

00:03:35.327 --> 00:03:36.660 align:middle line:90%
that were developed at Stanford.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.460 align:middle line:90%
That was not.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.510 align:middle line:84%
That was why I was
able to take those out

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.640 align:middle line:84%
from the deep dark
world of intelligence

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.740 align:middle line:90%
and teach them to civilians.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.240 align:middle line:84%
The people who were involved
and our accuracy rates, those

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.110 align:middle line:84%
were the things that
were classified.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.550 align:middle line:84%
Some of the targets that
I just talked about,

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.490 align:middle line:84%
for instance, the CIA requested
targets and other things

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.862 align:middle line:84%
that were highly classified,
those were never released.

00:03:58.862 --> 00:04:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In a moment, Ed, we'll
get into some of the things

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.350 align:middle line:84%
you're targeting nowadays
and who some of the clients

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.470 align:middle line:84%
are for this incredible
service of remote viewing.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.870 align:middle line:90%
But generally, how does it work?

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean how do you
non-physically find something

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:15.830 align:middle line:90%
with remote viewing?

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.029 align:middle line:84%
What are you tapping
into out there?

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: The brain
is an oscillator.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's connected to
a mind, a global mind

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.430 align:middle line:90%
that we're all immersed in.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.091 align:middle line:90%
Like a matrix?

00:04:26.091 --> 00:04:27.881 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: That's what
it's called, a matrix.

00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:29.730 align:middle line:84%
So everything exists
in the universe

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.610 align:middle line:84%
as a pattern of information,
everything, even ideas.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.180 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, there are no
words out there, no colors.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.030 align:middle line:84%
If you're a remote viewer and
you've never seen the color red

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.300 align:middle line:84%
before and I give to
you a training target

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.870 align:middle line:84%
of a performance of the Bolshoi
Ballet and the curtain is red,

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.050 align:middle line:84%
you can perceive the
pattern, but you can't--

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.510 align:middle line:84%
you have nothing
in your memories--

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's no reference.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: That's right.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.170 align:middle line:84%
You have to say well maybe
perhaps you'd seen pink

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.270 align:middle line:90%
before, it's like pink.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.740 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the problems
with teaching children.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.027 align:middle line:84%
It isn't-- children
are fun to teach.

00:05:02.027 --> 00:05:04.110 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to ask them
to open their minds up,

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.890 align:middle line:84%
because it hasn't closed yet
like us staid, stoic adults.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.690 align:middle line:84%
But they have problems
with a thesaurus.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.810 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, if a target is
a man who has just lost a loved

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.130 align:middle line:84%
one, then a child would only
be able to say there's somebody

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.730 align:middle line:90%
who's crying and feels hurt.

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Where an eclectic adult
may say, the target

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.110 align:middle line:84%
is an adult male who's
grieving and experiencing

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.990 align:middle line:90%
bathos, pathos, and whatever.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.440 align:middle line:90%
Because our thesaurus is larger.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.210 align:middle line:84%
So we turn our
attention to a pattern,

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.080 align:middle line:90%
let's say Osama bin Laden.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.880 align:middle line:90%
That's a target.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.950 align:middle line:90%
Osama bin Laden's location.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.630 align:middle line:90%
Location is another target.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.450 align:middle line:10%
These are separate targets.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness, we have
a set of protocols,

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.990 align:middle line:90%
it's a three part process.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.980 align:middle line:84%
First part is setting
up the problem.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.279 align:middle line:84%
The second part is
remote viewing itself,

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:55.570 align:middle line:90%
which I'll go into in a moment.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And the third part data
analysis, which is difficult.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And these take a
long time to learn.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
had told me once too,

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.004 align:middle line:84%
because I had kept pressing
you about times and dates.

00:06:07.004 --> 00:06:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And you said that's one of
the most difficult things

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:13.680 align:middle line:84%
of remote viewing, picking the
time and the date of the event.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.240 align:middle line:84%
You may see something, but
you need a reference point

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.500 align:middle line:90%
for what it's going to be.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you remote view and
see a calendar or something.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.894 align:middle line:84%
But is that still
tough and difficult?

00:06:24.894 --> 00:06:27.560 align:middle line:10%
>>DAMES: Well, it was the search
problem, what Ingo Swann called

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.480 align:middle line:10%
the search problem, it took
me 20 years to crack that.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.290 align:middle line:90%
And now we have.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And I thought well,
the time problem is not

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:36.800 align:middle line:90%
going to be solved on my watch.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.040 align:middle line:84%
But it looks like we've done
some recent experiments,

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.900 align:middle line:84%
looks like we may
be wrong about that.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.350 align:middle line:84%
The basic problem is that
mind is outside of time.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:45.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.108 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: For the linear
time that we experience

00:06:47.108 --> 00:06:50.970 align:middle line:84%
or even our linear speech, the
concatenation of subject, verb,

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.240 align:middle line:84%
object, and trying
to communicate

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.370 align:middle line:90%
an idea, all linear.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.490 align:middle line:84%
But time is not linear,
we've found out.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.676 align:middle line:90%
And mind is outside of time.

00:07:00.676 --> 00:07:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Think about it as
the fifth dimension--

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: --instead
of the fourth.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.870 align:middle line:90%
So that's where it gets shaky.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.050 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have to use what
we call temporal qualifiers

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.920 align:middle line:90%
on our work.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.320 align:middle line:84%
It's very easy to
remote view the next

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.340 align:middle line:90%
or a future or the past.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.560 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes down
to calendrical dates,

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.360 align:middle line:90%
that's a problem.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Because calendrical
time as a construct.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:23.610 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't exist in
the global mind the way

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.470 align:middle line:84%
it exists down here where
the rubber meets the road.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.160 align:middle line:84%
A psychic, and
we're not psychics,

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.440 align:middle line:84%
can sometimes, in
moments of revelation,

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.110 align:middle line:84%
see a newspaper
date in the future.

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:34.310 align:middle line:90%
But we cannot do that.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:34.910 align:middle line:90%
It's one of our limitations.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:35.993 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:07:35.993 --> 00:07:37.520 align:middle line:90%
Interesting, indeed.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.404 align:middle line:84%
You are very deliberate
when you train people too.

00:07:41.404 --> 00:07:43.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: Remote
viewing was initially

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.830 align:middle line:84%
developed by physicists
like Hal Puthoff,

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.860 align:middle line:84%
working close with government
research programs entirely

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.180 align:middle line:90%
in secret for over 20 years.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.810 align:middle line:84%
This is a skill that
uses the unconscious mind

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.640 align:middle line:90%
and requires real training.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.340 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there are only a
handful of people in the world

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.770 align:middle line:84%
qualified to teach this skill
from the declassified CIA

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.360 align:middle line:90%
and Army program.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, at the
peak of the program,

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.780 align:middle line:84%
military intelligence
officer Major Ed Dames

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.730 align:middle line:84%
was the only training
and operations

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:15.290 align:middle line:84%
officer tasked with using the RV
team for real world situations.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:18.950 align:middle line:84%
Today, many of the program's
missions are still classified.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:22.280 align:middle line:84%
But Ed Dames himself received
three medals during this time,

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.980 align:middle line:84%
stating "his insightful
threat analysis

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.980 align:middle line:84%
has contributed significantly
to this country's ability

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:30.790 align:middle line:84%
to maintain its
military superiority."

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:33.200 align:middle line:84%
and "Dames identified
and confirmed

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.200 align:middle line:84%
the existence of an entirely
new Soviet offensive

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.659 align:middle line:84%
weapon" all using nothing
but remote viewing.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:42.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Ed, when
you remote view,

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.550 align:middle line:84%
you must see things that
are millions of years ahead

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:48.380 align:middle line:90%
of where we are today.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Only-- that's
true only if we're

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:53.670 align:middle line:84%
looking at something that is
millions of years ahead of us

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:54.470 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:55.660 align:middle line:90%
And that's very rare.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Because most of our
time is spent on day

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:03.887 align:middle line:84%
to day mundane things, murders,
locating gold or fugitives,

00:09:03.887 --> 00:09:04.720 align:middle line:90%
something like that.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:04.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Yeah.

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But occasionally,
and during the military unit

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.370 align:middle line:84%
times when I was
training officer,

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:12.580 align:middle line:84%
we spent a lot of time,
taxpayers' dollars looking

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.700 align:middle line:90%
at lots of things out there.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like UFOs?

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Yes, like UFOs.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why UFOs?

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:20.170 align:middle line:90%
Why did you pick them?

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Because I was
interested in UFOs.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And here was a
capability, a vehicle

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:26.957 align:middle line:84%
called the skill
of remote viewing

00:09:26.957 --> 00:09:28.540 align:middle line:84%
that could be used
for the first time.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.010 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't the only one.

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:33.490 align:middle line:84%
The US CIA and
other intel agencies

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.280 align:middle line:84%
has no charter to
spend tax dollars--

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On UFOs.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.246 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: --on locating UFOs.

00:09:37.246 --> 00:09:38.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: But I had
the license, because I

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:41.590 align:middle line:90%
was a training officer.

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And I could pick any
training target I wanted to.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.559 align:middle line:84%
Your last dog, stolen
nuclear weapon, or a UFO.

00:09:47.559 --> 00:09:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what did Major
Ed Dames and his group

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.460 align:middle line:90%
find out about UFOs?

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Oh, a ton of
things, a ton of things.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.740 align:middle line:84%
I think my favorite project
was done just after I

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.260 align:middle line:90%
retired from the military.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.000 align:middle line:10%
General Stubblebine,
Albert Stubblebine

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.510 align:middle line:10%
was my chief executive
officer from my company.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And he was approached as a
middleman by the Russians.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:09.850 align:middle line:84%
By the Russians who
had lost a spacecraft,

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:11.602 align:middle line:84%
that Phobos 2 spacecraft
that was a probe.

00:10:11.602 --> 00:10:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was going
to Mars, wasn't it?

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: It was going to
Mars, it was called Phobos 2.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.450 align:middle line:90%
And it was lost above Mars.

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:21.790 align:middle line:84%
But it had a very
enigmatic last photograph

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:25.280 align:middle line:84%
of a big light, white
thing before it vanished.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Coming at it.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Yes.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:26.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:27.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Coming at it.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I remember that.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.560 align:middle line:90%
What was that?

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Well, the
Russians asked us for help.

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:33.580 align:middle line:84%
I had hired at that time all
the best and the brightest

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.180 align:middle line:84%
military remote viewers
and formed a company.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.460 align:middle line:10%
So Paul Smith and I were
the principals on this.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And we both came up with
the same information.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:46.240 align:middle line:84%
What happened was the cause of
the spacecraft shutting down,

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:51.310 align:middle line:84%
a sand dollar looking thing,
a big machine sitting down

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:54.430 align:middle line:84%
nestled in the sands
of Mars rose up

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:57.100 align:middle line:84%
at an oblique angle,
changed its geometry,

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.460 align:middle line:84%
started looked like the
Sydney Opera House, and gone.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:05.010 align:middle line:84%
At relativistic speeds in a snap
of an eye, it was just gone.

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.180 align:middle line:84%
At relativistic
speed, speed of light.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And bam, pops up right next
to the Phobos 2 spacecraft.

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:12.560 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't hit it.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.510 align:middle line:84%
It's right there,
and it touches it.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:16.010 align:middle line:84%
It just comes in
mechanical contact.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:16.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nudges it.

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:18.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Yeah, it
actually thought

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.610 align:middle line:84%
it was somebody else,
its makers coming back.

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was setting
up as an escort

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.469 align:middle line:90%
to bring down another machine.

00:11:26.469 --> 00:11:27.510 align:middle line:90%
So what we're trying to--

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:30.340 align:middle line:84%
this thing was what we
call a sentient machine.

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:34.240 align:middle line:84%
It was like the AI system,
the robots of our future,

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.720 align:middle line:90%
our near term future.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.290 align:middle line:84%
By the way, while on the
subject, one of my sayings

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:40.300 align:middle line:84%
has been robots
will stand in awe,

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.000 align:middle line:84%
because they'll never
be able to replace me.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.470 align:middle line:90%
But that's not true.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.771 align:middle line:84%
Because if a robot
watched me teach enough--

00:11:47.771 --> 00:11:48.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It could learn.

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:49.570 align:middle line:90%
They could learn.

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:51.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: It could
learn how to teach

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.980 align:middle line:84%
and I would be out of a
job, not as a remote viewer,

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:54.940 align:middle line:90%
but as a teacher.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.210 align:middle line:84%
They would not ever be
able to do what they're

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.010 align:middle line:90%
teaching their student to do.

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:01.640 align:middle line:84%
But they would be
excellent teachers.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.720 align:middle line:84%
When you were
remote viewing UFOs,

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.290 align:middle line:84%
did you also remote
view the occupants

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.150 align:middle line:90%
of some of these craft?

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Most of the time
there were no occupants.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And we don't use the
word "craft" or "vehicle"

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:15.850 align:middle line:90%
or "mother ship."

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Those are for
verboten in our work.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.600 align:middle line:84%
We're just trying to
describe a target.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.500 align:middle line:90%
And so we never try to name it.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.060 align:middle line:84%
If we have a photo,
that's great,

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.470 align:middle line:84%
because there's no name
that we just describe.

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:30.145 align:middle line:84%
The only time we
really found occupants

00:12:30.145 --> 00:12:34.480 align:middle line:84%
that were very, very bizarre
is in the Travis Walton

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.600 align:middle line:90%
case, Fire in the Sky.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: That was a real case.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:41.350 align:middle line:10%
And I hate to say it,
but my former training

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.990 align:middle line:10%
officer killed one of our--

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:45.910 align:middle line:10%
using altered states.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:48.650 align:middle line:84%
This is what we use before
coordinate remote viewing.

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:51.700 align:middle line:84%
We're in a darkened room
in an altered state,

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:55.670 align:middle line:84%
you need somebody to
train you to do this.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:58.940 align:middle line:84%
That operations
officer put this guy,

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:02.600 align:middle line:84%
who was supposed to be inside
a Soviet secret facility

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.600 align:middle line:90%
inside that Travis Walton thing.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Craft.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: No.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't
call it a craft.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: The object, right.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And he had a heart
attack and died.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:10.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Yeah.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.456 align:middle line:84%
And I personally, I've
been inside that thing.

00:13:13.456 --> 00:13:14.705 align:middle line:90%
There are four entities there.

00:13:14.705 --> 00:13:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: While he
was remote viewing

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.190 align:middle line:90%
the guy had a heart attack?

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:18.392 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Died, yeah.

00:13:18.392 --> 00:13:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Because he was so frightened,
because all of a sudden

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.220 align:middle line:90%
he's trapped.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:23.900 align:middle line:90%
You cross this boundary.

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:24.700 align:middle line:90%
You're bilocated.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:25.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's like he's there.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.240 align:middle line:90%
He is there.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: You're
bilocating in your mind.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.188 align:middle line:90%
You're in two places at once.

00:13:29.188 --> 00:13:32.395 align:middle line:84%
You're on the bed or your lying
down, but you're also there.

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:34.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've had
this experience before.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:36.320 align:middle line:90%
And it can be frightening.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.930 align:middle line:84%
I have found myself
inside the Council

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:40.190 align:middle line:84%
of Ministers building
in Russia and I didn't

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:41.420 align:middle line:90%
speak Russian at that time.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Had no badge and the
guards were looking at me.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Or inside the gate
at [INAUDIBLE],, when

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.800 align:middle line:84%
we're supposed to be looking at
the beam director at a particle

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.370 align:middle line:90%
beam facility.

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:51.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm inside the fence.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:52.770 align:middle line:90%
How do I get out?

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying wait a
minute, I'm not really here.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.770 align:middle line:84%
You were in both
places in your mind.

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And so that was a real
event where there were four

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:02.690 align:middle line:84%
very, very interesting--
and these were not

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:04.470 align:middle line:90%
robots or machines.

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:06.290 align:middle line:90%
These were humanoid entities.

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:08.330 align:middle line:90%
They're very hard to describe.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:11.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever been
channeled or your group ever

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.460 align:middle line:84%
been channeled by government
when you were doing it

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.980 align:middle line:84%
specifically for
government to go

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:21.590 align:middle line:84%
into someone's life via
remote viewing and kill them?

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:22.390 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: No.

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:23.598 align:middle line:90%
No, because we can't do that.

00:14:23.598 --> 00:14:27.920 align:middle line:84%
Remote viewing, for all intents
and purposes, is a passive act.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.070 align:middle line:84%
You can't stop me from remote
viewing you if I wanted to.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:31.965 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:14:31.965 --> 00:14:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Because when
I remote view you

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:35.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm remote viewing
the way you exist

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:39.030 align:middle line:84%
as a pattern of information in
another dimension somewhere.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:40.840 align:middle line:84%
So no Navajo thought
ball or anything

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.590 align:middle line:84%
like that can stop
me from knowing.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Nor could I stop you from
doing the same thing.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.050 align:middle line:90%
Telepathy is different.

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:50.960 align:middle line:10%
When you get telepathic contact
with another human being,

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.930 align:middle line:10%
that is an energetic contact.

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:55.820 align:middle line:10%
And our sister science
is even more different.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.400 align:middle line:10%
Cytokinesis, telekinesis,
the Uri Geller effect,

00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.690 align:middle line:10%
that's our sister science.

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.287 align:middle line:10%
That's very dynamic,
mind over matter.

00:15:02.287 --> 00:15:03.620 align:middle line:90%
We've investigated that as well.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So with remote
viewing primarily,

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:10.280 align:middle line:84%
Ed, it's as a witness,
right, as opposed to someone

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.400 align:middle line:84%
that is literally
involved in something?

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Most of our work is
descriptive words rather than

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:17.780 align:middle line:90%
visuals.

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:23.030 align:middle line:84%
If we're seeing a target,
if it's clear and static

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:25.760 align:middle line:84%
in our mind's eye and we can
return to it again and again,

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.960 align:middle line:90%
it's always imagination, always.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And we have ways that we teach
our students to deal with that,

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.360 align:middle line:90%
to deal with.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.510 align:middle line:84%
If the target is fleeting
and blurry, it was there

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:38.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's gone, that's
usually target related data.

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:41.630 align:middle line:84%
So they're very,
very, very little

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:44.090 align:middle line:84%
of our work that
deals with visuals.

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.490 align:middle line:90%
Most of it is descriptive terms.

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:49.280 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I remember when
millionaire Steve Fossett was

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:55.340 align:middle line:10%
flying in one of his little
planes and he disappeared.

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:58.460 align:middle line:10%
And nobody knew where
he was except you.

00:15:58.460 --> 00:15:59.930 align:middle line:10%
You were on Coast to Coast.

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:03.780 align:middle line:10%
And you said, he crashed
in the Sierra Nevadas.

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:07.200 align:middle line:10%
We even tried to get that
information to his staff

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.110 align:middle line:10%
so they could go look for him.

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:10.490 align:middle line:10%
And nobody accepted it.

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:12.830 align:middle line:90%
Nobody, nobody ran with it.

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough,
about a week later

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:20.510 align:middle line:84%
they found Steven Fossett dead
in that craft, in his plane,

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:21.427 align:middle line:90%
in the Sierra Nevadas.

00:16:21.427 --> 00:16:23.635 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: I was working
directly with the search crew.

00:16:23.635 --> 00:16:26.000 align:middle line:84%
That was the most expensive
search in US history, even

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:26.480 align:middle line:90%
the Air Force.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it frustrating for
you that they wouldn't listen?

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Well, I'm used to it.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:33.920 align:middle line:84%
Because we're still-- remote
viewing hasn't come of age yet.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, you said
it on Coast to Coast,

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.550 align:middle line:90%
days before he was found.

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:40.160 align:middle line:90%
That's where he would be.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:40.994 align:middle line:90%
And nobody listened.

00:16:40.994 --> 00:16:43.409 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Well, we were going
to go look for him ourselves.

00:16:43.409 --> 00:16:44.780 align:middle line:90%
Because yes, I was frustrated.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:48.440 align:middle line:90%
But I am used to that.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Meeting the promise
of remote viewing

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:51.540 align:middle line:90%
is right around the corner.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:52.800 align:middle line:90%
But we're not there yet.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.955 align:middle line:84%
So I understand why
people won't accept it.

00:16:54.955 --> 00:16:57.080 align:middle line:84%
But I was dealing with the
head of the search team.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.720 align:middle line:90%
I said, the guy is here.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And no, he couldn't
have done that.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.390 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have enough fuel,
only 65 horsepower engine

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:04.190 align:middle line:90%
blah, blah, blah.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And I said, he's in
the Sierra Nevadas,

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:06.750 align:middle line:90%
and we're going after him.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:07.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:09.460 align:middle line:84%
You sent my producer
Tom Danheiser

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.660 align:middle line:90%
a map of where he was.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.200 align:middle line:84%
That's how much you
pinpointed that.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Well, it
wasn't a pinpoint,

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:15.369 align:middle line:90%
it was a general area.

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:18.440 align:middle line:84%
But now we've evolved
and streamlined

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.500 align:middle line:84%
what we call Geofix, remote
viewing Geofix technique.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:22.940 align:middle line:84%
We can get down
to 60 to 100 feet.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:23.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: That's how I find
children, missing children

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:28.880 align:middle line:90%
and fugitives.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The late Ingo
Swann in his book,

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:36.060 align:middle line:84%
"Penetration," remote viewed
the far side of the moon.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:42.040 align:middle line:84%
He saw structures,
very strange things.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.140 align:middle line:90%
He was pretty accurate.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.224 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:17:45.224 --> 00:17:46.515 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: I don't have to think.

00:17:46.515 --> 00:17:48.190 align:middle line:90%
We've looked at ourselves too.

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:50.110 align:middle line:84%
My favorite-- there's a lot of
ancient structures on the moon.

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:51.568 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
see the same thing?

00:17:51.568 --> 00:17:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: These were mining
operations by androids,

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, half a
million, million years ago.

00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:59.490 align:middle line:84%
The androids are gone,
the mining has stopped.

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:00.989 align:middle line:84%
But on the back of
the moon, there's

00:18:00.989 --> 00:18:02.380 align:middle line:90%
something that's working.

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:03.580 align:middle line:90%
We call it a layer cake.

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:07.420 align:middle line:84%
It's sitting in a crater exposed
on the dark side of the moon.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.460 align:middle line:84%
It's layer cake because it's
got light and dark layers.

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.679 align:middle line:84%
And it's a
rectilinear structure.

00:18:12.679 --> 00:18:13.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it a machine?

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.261 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: It's doing
something, and we

00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:16.910 align:middle line:90%
can't fathom what it's doing.

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:17.960 align:middle line:90%
It's operating.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.195 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who put it there?

00:18:19.195 --> 00:18:21.156 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Don't know.

00:18:21.156 --> 00:18:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is amazing
what is going on

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:26.350 align:middle line:84%
in the history of this universe
that we have only pinpricked.

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:29.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: The adventure of going
out there and rubbing my hands

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:33.260 align:middle line:84%
together and saying today I'm
with the remote view, you know,

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.350 align:middle line:84%
the tomb of Genghis
Khan, because nobody

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:36.430 align:middle line:90%
knows where it is.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And know that I can
find it if I wanted to.

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:41.610 align:middle line:84%
So the question
becomes, if you can--

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:43.240 align:middle line:84%
remote viewing
changes your life.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Because you know that
you can know anything

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:48.920 align:middle line:84%
within the limits
of our capabilities.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.000 align:middle line:84%
So the question then becomes,
since life is limited,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.010 align:middle line:90%
choose wisely.

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:53.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Because you
only have so much time.

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A couple of years
ago at a secret space

00:18:56.730 --> 00:19:03.240 align:middle line:84%
program, Jim Marrs had a chance
to talk at that conference.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:07.200 align:middle line:10%
>>JIM MARRS: And space, they
can also go out into space.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.240 align:middle line:10%
This was proven back
in the '70s when

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.270 align:middle line:10%
Ingo Swann and another
fella did a remote viewing

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:middle line:10%
session of Jupiter.

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.110 align:middle line:10%
And they came back
and said, well

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:17.850 align:middle line:10%
there's these mountains,
high mountains.

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:19.087 align:middle line:10%
And there's this and that.

00:19:19.087 --> 00:19:20.670 align:middle line:10%
And they were sketching
this stuff up.

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:23.550 align:middle line:10%
And they said, by the way,
Jupiter has a little ring

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:24.660 align:middle line:10%
around it, you know.

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:27.720 align:middle line:90%


00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.320 align:middle line:10%
I mean like Jupiter.

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.020 align:middle line:10%
And I think I got confused here.

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:33.630 align:middle line:10%
They were remote
viewing Saturn, OK.

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:36.250 align:middle line:10%
And they said, they got a
ring around it like Jupiter.

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:39.474 align:middle line:10%
And they said, it's got high
mountains and they got clouds

00:19:39.474 --> 00:19:40.390 align:middle line:10%
and they got all this.

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:43.740 align:middle line:10%
And they were giving all these
details, and a magnetic field.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:46.290 align:middle line:10%
And of course the scientists
at the time, they didn't know.

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.210 align:middle line:10%
They said, that's just
somebody speculating.

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:49.530 align:middle line:10%
We don't know about that.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:52.920 align:middle line:10%
But then about 10 years later
they sent Voyager out there.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:57.060 align:middle line:10%
And Voyager went to Jupiter
and photographed, studied,

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:57.970 align:middle line:10%
sent back data.

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:00.850 align:middle line:10%
And lo and behold, everything
that Ingo Swann and this fella

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:04.934 align:middle line:10%
had said turned out
to be 100% true.

00:20:04.934 --> 00:20:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So I guess
what Jim Marrs

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:09.590 align:middle line:84%
is telling us is, of course,
that you remote viewers

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:10.695 align:middle line:90%
are pretty darn accurate.

00:20:10.695 --> 00:20:12.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Well, this
was the early days.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.560 align:middle line:10%
Harold Sherman-- what
Jim was referring to

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.330 align:middle line:10%
was Harold Sherman
and Ingo Swann

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:18.860 align:middle line:10%
detected a ring
around the planet

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:21.020 align:middle line:10%
Jupiter, which was
later verified.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Way before
science talked about it.

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:23.243 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Way before, way before.

00:20:23.243 --> 00:20:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And these were the
progenitors of the program.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Those of us in the
military said hey,

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.940 align:middle line:84%
we've got some big problems
over here that we can't solve.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.830 align:middle line:90%
We cannot answer the mail.

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:37.156 align:middle line:84%
So let's, as a tactic
of desperation,

00:20:37.156 --> 00:20:38.530 align:middle line:84%
let's see what
these guys can do.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And that was the beginning of
the remote viewing training

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:42.020 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We had some and still
do, some good remote viewers

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:45.500 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:49.850 align:middle line:10%
We have you, Hal
Puthoff, Russell Targ.

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:53.420 align:middle line:10%
But you know, everybody
is getting up in age.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Do we have great remote
viewers waiting in the wings?

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Oh yes.

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:05.010 align:middle line:84%
My legacy, the legacy that
I want to leave behind,

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:07.980 align:middle line:84%
number one is a cadre of
professional remote viewers.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:08.780 align:middle line:90%
I did that.

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:10.000 align:middle line:90%
I trained great teams.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You've trained a lot.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.978 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: And I've helped them
set up their own corporations

00:21:12.978 --> 00:21:14.420 align:middle line:90%
and training centers.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:15.410 align:middle line:90%
And I've got that.

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:19.070 align:middle line:84%
The second one is to
show people using what

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:21.380 align:middle line:90%
Ingo Swann knew had to be done.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:23.216 align:middle line:84%
You have to show people
that down here where

00:21:23.216 --> 00:21:24.590 align:middle line:84%
the rubber meets
the road, you've

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:26.630 align:middle line:90%
got to do something practical.

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:28.250 align:middle line:84%
Find this, find
that, or whatever.

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to repeat
it over and over again.

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm about to go on
the road and do that.

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:34.130 align:middle line:90%
So then I can retire.

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You'll
never retire, Ed.

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:36.330 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:37.730 align:middle line:90%
You'll never retire.

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:39.500 align:middle line:90%
It keeps us young.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Well, other
things can keep us young.

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:45.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With remote
viewing, the government

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:49.530 align:middle line:84%
apparently ended the program
with you great remote viewers.

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:51.120 align:middle line:90%
Why did they stop?

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.259 align:middle line:84%
And are they doing
it secretly now?

00:21:53.259 --> 00:21:55.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: They're not
doing it secretly now,

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:57.090 align:middle line:84%
but they know where
I am, and that I'm

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:58.090 align:middle line:90%
the keeper of the keys.

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:02.590 align:middle line:84%
So if they need me, if something
happens, then I'm around.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:04.440 align:middle line:84%
Than they can use
me as a cut out.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.940 align:middle line:84%
But the reason this
program stopped,

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:08.310 align:middle line:90%
it was a white elephant.

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:11.070 align:middle line:84%
Nobody wanted it
under their control.

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:12.090 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to use it.

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:13.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did it work?

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:13.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Oh, yes.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:14.940 align:middle line:90%
It was highly effective.

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:17.745 align:middle line:84%
But it was so scary
to so many people.

00:22:17.745 --> 00:22:21.790 align:middle line:84%
I could tell your
story after story.

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:25.230 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of the heads
of various agencies,

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:27.510 align:middle line:84%
when they found out
that they had this--

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:28.530 align:middle line:90%
they were spooky units.

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.690 align:middle line:84%
I was a member of
many, many black units.

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:34.410 align:middle line:84%
But this was a black unit that
was very spooky, because they

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:35.597 align:middle line:90%
didn't know how it worked.

00:22:35.597 --> 00:22:36.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They didn't understand.

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:40.994 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: They didn't
understand, and still don't.

00:22:40.994 --> 00:22:44.040 align:middle line:84%
To have a program
at your disposal,

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:47.610 align:middle line:84%
the Western scientific
method has to be met.

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:50.200 align:middle line:84%
You've got to have a
theory and replicability.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.560 align:middle line:84%
We had replicability,
but no theory.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And this scared a lot of people,
science advisers at the DOD.

00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's an amazing tool.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:02.980 align:middle line:84%
You get hired now by
companies and governments.

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.140 align:middle line:90%
What do they want to know?

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Oh in the past,
for instance, Bechtel.

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:11.447 align:middle line:90%
Bechtel built the whole Mideast.

00:23:11.447 --> 00:23:13.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people were
living in mud huts

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:16.990 align:middle line:84%
until they discovered oil and
Bechtel built their countries.

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Wanted to build a moon base
to use a Mars launch point.

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:24.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:25.510 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Yeah.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:28.990 align:middle line:84%
So we were looking at
certain aspects there.

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:33.620 align:middle line:84%
General Motors, hydrogen based
[INAUDIBLE] power plants.

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:38.080 align:middle line:10%
Laurance Rockefeller,
atmospheric ozone depletion

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:41.300 align:middle line:10%
projected consequences
and remedial technologies.

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.570 align:middle line:84%
So we're hired for
all kinds of stuff.

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:45.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you looked
into the future, Ed?

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And if so, what does
this planet look like?

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.389 align:middle line:90%
And how far in advance?

00:23:52.389 --> 00:23:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: We don't know how far.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:58.380 align:middle line:84%
But the key problem
that we see--

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:01.870 align:middle line:84%
I've talked about the sun
and kill shots before.

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:05.050 align:middle line:84%
But the key problem
in the out years

00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:08.400 align:middle line:90%
is the loss of the ozone layer.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.170 align:middle line:84%
The ozone layer, prior
to two billion years

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:13.000 align:middle line:90%
ago, there was no life on Earth.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Then things started popping
up in the ocean, green algae.

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: The ozone
layer had the form

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:22.210 align:middle line:84%
to keep that ionizing
radiation, that short UV away

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:23.140 align:middle line:90%
from the surface.

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Before that, there
couldn't be any life

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:26.800 align:middle line:90%
as we know it on Earth.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.644 align:middle line:84%
So the ozone layer
is critical to help.

00:24:28.644 --> 00:24:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you see
that deteriorating?

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: We see
it deteriorating.

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:35.410 align:middle line:84%
We told Laurance Rockefeller,
it isn't just the poles.

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:38.920 align:middle line:84%
This thing is thinning, like
it's metastasizing and looks

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:42.010 align:middle line:84%
like Swiss cheese, which
scientists can't detect right.

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is a huge, huge
problem in the out years.

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:48.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can it be replaced?

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: To be very
honest with you,

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:53.830 align:middle line:84%
we provided Laurance
Rockefeller withi an addendum.

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And it looked like it was
being replaced by others

00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:00.780 align:middle line:90%
that were here to help us.

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:02.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Have they stopped?

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:03.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: No.

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:06.467 align:middle line:84%
They come later to
help us and regenerate.

00:25:06.467 --> 00:25:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, based on
remote viewing you saw them.

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Yes.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:09.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: So actually
reestablish the ozone layer

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.880 align:middle line:84%
so life can once again
exist on this planet.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.522 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So there's hope.

00:25:17.522 --> 00:25:19.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: It springs eternal.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How accurate, Ed, is
remote viewing in the future?

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Is it things that will
be or it could be?

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: No, no, it's
things that will be.

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:30.120 align:middle line:84%
We would not be able to download
the information if the event

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.590 align:middle line:90%
did not already exist.

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:34.110 align:middle line:84%
For instance, you
know, a moment,

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:37.050 align:middle line:84%
a moment for a human being
is about three seconds.

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:39.730 align:middle line:84%
A moment ago we were talking
about Ingo Swann and Harold

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:40.530 align:middle line:90%
Sherman.

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:41.670 align:middle line:90%
Where's that moment?

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:43.110 align:middle line:90%
It's just as real as this one.

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:45.640 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the now
doesn't even exist.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:49.440 align:middle line:84%
So these events that we
can foresee and describe,

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.020 align:middle line:84%
they already exist in
time, or we would not,

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:54.580 align:middle line:84%
as remote viewers, be able
to discern them and download.

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:55.380 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:55.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
a whistleblower,

00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:57.390 align:middle line:90%
his name is Bill Tompkins.

00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:01.190 align:middle line:84%
He talked on Cosmic Disclosure,
part of the Gaia programs.

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:04.120 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about him.

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BILL TOMPKINS: What you see
there is the different classes

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:12.910 align:middle line:84%
of attack and fighter aircraft
returning to the mother

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:15.770 align:middle line:90%
ship or the spacecraft carrier.

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And with a vacuum
controlled entry sections,

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:25.760 align:middle line:84%
actually they were
designed to fall down.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.310 align:middle line:84%
So that you're
already in support

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:31.130 align:middle line:90%
of making inside landing.

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:37.010 align:middle line:84%
Nobody actually flies
in these squadrons

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:39.680 align:middle line:84%
and controlling any
of the vehicles.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.420 align:middle line:90%
It's all automatic.

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:44.450 align:middle line:84%
So you're not going to be
hitting the walls or any

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:45.960 align:middle line:90%
of this kind of thing.

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.965 align:middle line:84%
But very quickly, you can open
these hatches on the side.

00:26:49.965 --> 00:26:55.970 align:middle line:84%
The hatch then becomes sort of
a platform to possibly land on

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:57.850 align:middle line:90%
if it's too low.

00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And this answers
the question of how

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:05.600 align:middle line:84%
do we handle the large
spaces aboard the ships that

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:09.004 align:middle line:84%
are going to be operating
out on the missions.

00:27:09.004 --> 00:27:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you able to
remote view something like that?

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.395 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: I don't know
anything about this example.

00:27:13.395 --> 00:27:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This program.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Nothing.

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:15.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:16.894 align:middle line:90%
How do you start a project?

00:27:16.894 --> 00:27:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Well, if it
were a project like this,

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:20.710 align:middle line:84%
for instance, that I
know nothing about,

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:23.960 align:middle line:84%
I could go into that
individual's mind

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.690 align:middle line:84%
and see what he was perceiving
in order to produce that idea.

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:28.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:30.114 align:middle line:10%
>>DAMES: Or I could
take those drawings

00:27:30.114 --> 00:27:34.100 align:middle line:10%
and use that as target
reference material, conduct

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:36.330 align:middle line:10%
what we call a topical search.

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:39.080 align:middle line:84%
A topical search is six
remote probes, probably about

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.750 align:middle line:90%
two hours each with a team.

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And see if there's any
consistency in there.

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:46.730 align:middle line:84%
If there is, we use that as
an anchor hold, and then do

00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:48.410 align:middle line:90%
a full length study.

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When someone
commissions you for a project,

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:55.850 align:middle line:84%
generally are they
looking for a lost person?

00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:57.900 align:middle line:90%
What do they want, Ed.

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:00.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Oh, it
depends, it depends.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:04.490 align:middle line:84%
I just finished a project
for a police department

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:08.060 align:middle line:90%
nearby yesterday.

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Missing children, but that's
a hobby of mine as well.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.780 align:middle line:84%
For a corporation, they're
interest in a product line.

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:17.305 align:middle line:84%
For instance, is this product
line going to be a dead end?

00:28:17.305 --> 00:28:19.805 align:middle line:84%
Should we spend any more money
on it or something like that.

00:28:19.805 --> 00:28:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is anybody else
working on it, right?

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:24.226 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: And believe it or
not, many, many of the people--

00:28:24.226 --> 00:28:27.590 align:middle line:84%
I work with VPs
in big companies.

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Many of the VPs are interested
in their own advancement.

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: What can
you do for me, Ed?

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:36.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:38.062 align:middle line:84%
Even though they hired
you for the company.

00:28:38.062 --> 00:28:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Rather than my company.

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:39.780 align:middle line:90%
Right, yeah.

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.380 align:middle line:84%
But this was difficult
for me to come to grips

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:46.310 align:middle line:84%
with as a military officer,
dedicated, loyal officer

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:49.010 align:middle line:84%
who was just dedicated to
my country and my service,

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:51.990 align:middle line:84%
to come out and see individuals
dedicated to themselves.

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And I had to learn that
civilian life was different.

00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:58.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
remote viewed an ET agenda?

00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And if you have, what
are they trying to do?

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:02.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Yes.

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:03.010 align:middle line:90%
The answer is yes.

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:06.680 align:middle line:84%
It's a long answer,
I'll try to condense it.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:10.130 align:middle line:84%
There's one agenda that
I will call tactical.

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:12.560 align:middle line:10%
And that is, we
found out long ago

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.750 align:middle line:10%
that there's a system
out there that's

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:17.420 align:middle line:10%
monitoring this planet
that knows where

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:21.440 align:middle line:10%
every single nuclear warhead
is, whether it's in storage,

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.740 align:middle line:10%
on a boomer, a nuclear
submarine, in an aircraft.

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.000 align:middle line:10%
Knows where every one is.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.370 align:middle line:10%
And they're capable of
shutting the navigation

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:33.380 align:middle line:10%
systems on those weapons
down, all of them at once.

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:34.940 align:middle line:90%
They know where every weapon is.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, what that
means essentially

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.920 align:middle line:84%
is there will never
be a nuclear slugfest.

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.740 align:middle line:84%
That system, those monitors,
because of intervention,

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:44.230 align:middle line:90%
will never allow it.

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:46.940 align:middle line:10%
People ask, why did you
allow Nagasaki and Hiroshima

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:49.970 align:middle line:10%
and Fukushima Daiichi, unit six?

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:52.940 align:middle line:84%
Because we have to learn to
be responsible for ourselves

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:58.040 align:middle line:84%
and what the ramifications
of this kind of thing is.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.930 align:middle line:90%
But the slugfest, no.

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:02.780 align:middle line:84%
The other long
term agenda is one

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:04.640 align:middle line:84%
that Project Blue
Book could not solve.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:08.210 align:middle line:84%
All the 10 hypotheses that
they came up with didn't fit.

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:11.090 align:middle line:84%
What that system out there
is actually promoting

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:13.970 align:middle line:90%
are consciousness tools.

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:15.980 align:middle line:84%
The lingua franca
in the universe

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:19.730 align:middle line:84%
is not mathematics and physics,
although those are close.

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:21.440 align:middle line:90%
It's consciousness.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.660 align:middle line:84%
You may look like a squid
or something like that

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:25.310 align:middle line:90%
and be highly advanced.

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And if I come armed with
a shotgun because it's--

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:30.020 align:middle line:90%
you're afraid.

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:32.570 align:middle line:84%
But that thing may have all the
answers to all the questions

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:33.770 align:middle line:90%
in the universe, right.

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:34.870 align:middle line:90%
And that's the way it is.

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:38.480 align:middle line:84%
But using consciousness,
shared consciousness,

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.890 align:middle line:90%
we can communicate that way.

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I think
what they're trying

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:46.160 align:middle line:84%
to do by showing us
all these various-- it

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.780 align:middle line:90%
changes all the time.

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.910 align:middle line:90%
Novelty acts as a stimulus.

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:50.857 align:middle line:90%
Hollywood knows that.

00:30:50.857 --> 00:30:52.190 align:middle line:90%
One day you have flying saucers.

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:54.680 align:middle line:84%
The next day this,
next day that.

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:57.544 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to keep us
looking up and questioning

00:30:57.544 --> 00:30:58.460 align:middle line:90%
what are these things.

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And we're not going
to know unless,

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:03.080 align:middle line:84%
as my former intelligence
agencies knew,

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.970 align:middle line:84%
we used these tools
like remote viewing

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:07.040 align:middle line:90%
to penetrate their system.

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:09.080 align:middle line:84%
They can't hide
from these tools.

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.550 align:middle line:90%
But they don't want to hide.

00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:13.622 align:middle line:84%
They want us to believe or
understand them the right way.

00:31:13.622 --> 00:31:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of people
talk about their own contact

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:17.450 align:middle line:90%
experiences with ET.

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:19.490 align:middle line:84%
Are they remote viewing,
or has something

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:22.460 align:middle line:90%
actually happened to them?

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: We have to take the
individual, just like we would

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:28.490 align:middle line:84%
a medical case, rather than
look at the global holistic cure

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:30.890 align:middle line:90%
for Alzheimer's or leukemia.

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:34.170 align:middle line:84%
We take the individual
in this case

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:36.770 align:middle line:90%
and recreate their experience.

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:40.100 align:middle line:84%
For instance, a good example
would be the famous Betty

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:41.510 align:middle line:90%
in Barney HIll case too.

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:42.343 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great case.

00:31:42.343 --> 00:31:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: If you remote
view, if you recreate that,

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:46.294 align:middle line:84%
they didn't go
anywhere physically.

00:31:46.294 --> 00:31:47.460 align:middle line:90%
They believed that they did.

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:48.980 align:middle line:90%
They were implanted.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:50.720 align:middle line:90%
But not with a physical thing.

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.420 align:middle line:84%
The remote viewers see
two glowing white spheres

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:54.530 align:middle line:90%
outside their car.

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And Betty and Barney are in
a catatonic state inside.

00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:00.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And separately,
they both say the same thing.

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:00.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Right.

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:03.590 align:middle line:84%
But these glowing white spheres
were injecting this storyline

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:06.879 align:middle line:84%
into their head so it becomes
memory, an experience.

00:32:06.879 --> 00:32:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
they went through.

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:10.341 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: It's a
false experience.

00:32:10.341 --> 00:32:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
ever remote viewed

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:14.510 align:middle line:84%
what is called the
Galactic Federation?

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Yes, that was my term.

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:18.970 align:middle line:84%
I used that as an experiment
during the military unit

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:21.540 align:middle line:84%
days, a Galactic
Federation headquarters.

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:25.530 align:middle line:10%
In fact, that session data has
been released to the public.

00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:27.050 align:middle line:90%
You can find it online.

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:28.430 align:middle line:90%
The CIA released it.

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:30.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we part
of that federation?

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Not yet.

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:32.720 align:middle line:90%
Someday.

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:36.080 align:middle line:84%
I hope to get my
grandchildren into the lower

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:39.500 align:middle line:84%
levels of that, the entry
levels of the federation.

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's my
agenda for contact.

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:44.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What will our role
be if we're pulled into it?

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Students.

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:50.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your
nickname is Dr. Doom.

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:53.840 align:middle line:84%
You have talked about the
kill shot from the sun, which

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.670 align:middle line:90%
I assume is an X flare.

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:56.990 align:middle line:90%
Sounds like an X to me.

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:58.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Oh, absolutely.

00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have been
very vocal on Coast

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:04.760 align:middle line:84%
to Coast talking about
protecting the power grid that

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.120 align:middle line:84%
could get hit by an EMP,
that's a nuke detonated

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.020 align:middle line:90%
in the atmosphere.

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Or an X flare from
the son, of which

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:13.640 align:middle line:90%
they have occurred in the past.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, we didn't have
those kind of electronics then.

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:20.880 align:middle line:84%
Knocked out the telegraph
system in the 1800s.

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Is that what you mean
by the kill shot?

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:27.900 align:middle line:84%
That kind of a abrupt
closing to civilization?

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:28.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Yes.

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:30.330 align:middle line:90%
But I'll expand upon that.

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:32.700 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
the April, I think

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:36.400 align:middle line:84%
it was April 23rd, yeah,
April 23rd, 2012 event.

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:37.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 2012.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Two weeks prior
to that on Coast to Coast

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:41.482 align:middle line:84%
I said, the sun's about
to go on a rampage.

00:33:41.482 --> 00:33:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We lucked out there.

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:45.264 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: That-- we really
dodged that bullet.

00:33:45.264 --> 00:33:46.930 align:middle line:84%
Because that would
have-- as scientists,

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:49.290 align:middle line:84%
NASA said they waited two
years to say anything.

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:51.496 align:middle line:84%
But they said, if we would
have got hit by that one,

00:33:51.496 --> 00:33:52.620 align:middle line:90%
and it was three in a row--

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:54.203 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That would
have wiped it out.

00:33:54.203 --> 00:33:56.507 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Wiped half
of life on Earth.

00:33:56.507 --> 00:33:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was a huge--

00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:00.240 align:middle line:84%
so everybody should know,
it was a huge X-flare

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:04.020 align:middle line:84%
from the sun that came
out the side of the sun

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.720 align:middle line:90%
instead of directly at us.

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:09.344 align:middle line:84%
Had it hit us right on, as you
just said, it's toast time.

00:34:09.344 --> 00:34:10.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: That's right.

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:13.989 align:middle line:84%
And not only, not only
was it an X flare,

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:17.880 align:middle line:84%
but it was beyond X. They
had to create a whole- NASA,

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:21.150 align:middle line:84%
NOAA here in Boulder
had to create

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:23.120 align:middle line:90%
a whole new logarithmic band.

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my.

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:26.791 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: To prepare for what
they now call a mega flare.

00:34:26.791 --> 00:34:28.290 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I'm
saying is coming.

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:31.480 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to
qualify this one way.

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:35.310 align:middle line:84%
The massive numbers of
deaths of dead people

00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:39.210 align:middle line:84%
that we're looking at in the
future are starvation victims.

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:40.230 align:middle line:90%
They starve to death.

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:41.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: This is not a
direct hit from radiation.

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:44.639 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It doesn't
kill you directly.

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:44.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Right.

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:46.399 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It kills
you peripherally.

00:34:46.399 --> 00:34:47.481 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Yes, temperature.

00:34:47.481 --> 00:34:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you don't get
water and you don't get food.

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And they are projecting
90% of the population

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.790 align:middle line:90%
would die over the first year.

00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:56.590 align:middle line:90%
That's frightening.

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: I don't know
what the projections are,

00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.970 align:middle line:84%
but I know what we're
looking at and perceiving

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:01.500 align:middle line:90%
in the future is frightening.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:02.874 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There
have been a number

00:35:02.874 --> 00:35:04.950 align:middle line:84%
of people who have
been very prophetic

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:07.900 align:middle line:90%
in the history of this planet.

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:10.770 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: In 1503,
an ordinary man

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:14.160 align:middle line:10%
with an extraordinary destiny
is born in a small town

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.450 align:middle line:10%
in southern France.

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:21.100 align:middle line:10%
Today, more than 500 years
later, the name Nostradamus

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:23.170 align:middle line:10%
is revered by
thousands of people

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:27.080 align:middle line:10%
all over the world as
an unparalleled prophet.

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:31.000 align:middle line:10%
One who predicts the future
with astonishing accuracy.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.220 align:middle line:10%
Even skeptics are
intrigued by the shear

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:35.100 align:middle line:10%
mystery of his powers.

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:38.620 align:middle line:10%
And now, lying quietly
in a library in Rome,

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:43.920 align:middle line:10%
a manuscript with his name
on it has been discovered.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I got to
believe Nostradamus

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:47.234 align:middle line:90%
was a remote viewer.

00:35:47.234 --> 00:35:48.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: No, no,
he was a psychic.

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:49.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell me the difference.

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:51.315 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Well,
the psychics are--

00:35:51.315 --> 00:35:53.400 align:middle line:84%
the Oracle at Delphi
were psychics.

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.960 align:middle line:90%
Nostradamus was a psychic.

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Nostradamus would peer
into a bowl of water

00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.940 align:middle line:84%
and then project
his mind forward,

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:01.140 align:middle line:90%
and something would pop out.

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:03.015 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't that
remotely viewing, though?

00:36:03.015 --> 00:36:04.034 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Well, In a way.

00:36:04.034 --> 00:36:05.700 align:middle line:84%
But what we do,
remember, the first part

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:07.230 align:middle line:90%
is setting up the problem.

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:08.970 align:middle line:84%
He would set up the
problem in his mind.

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:10.830 align:middle line:90%
We're much more systematic.

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:14.500 align:middle line:84%
But I guess you could extend the
term to remote viewing to him.

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:15.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:16.716 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: And as
remote viewers, we

00:36:16.716 --> 00:36:19.382 align:middle line:84%
would take some of his
quatrains and use those

00:36:19.382 --> 00:36:20.590 align:middle line:90%
as target reference material.

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:21.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha, OK.

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:22.138 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:36:22.138 --> 00:36:24.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: What was Nostradamus
looking at when he--

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.430 align:middle line:84%
and we used the French,
the original French--

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:27.520 align:middle line:90%
when he wrote this?

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.580 align:middle line:90%
What was the target?

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:32.220 align:middle line:84%
So that was a lot
of fun to do that.

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:33.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are
current prophets

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:36.990 align:middle line:84%
that have projected
a third World War.

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:40.374 align:middle line:84%
What do the remote
viewers see about that?

00:36:40.374 --> 00:36:42.540 align:middle line:10%
>>DAMES: As I mentioned on
Coast to Coast years ago,

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:44.540 align:middle line:10%
World War III really is started.

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:46.420 align:middle line:10%
It's a slow burn.

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:49.290 align:middle line:10%
It'll start as a slow burn,
which it did years ago.

00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:51.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to be
a nuclear slugfest.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.670 align:middle line:90%
It's just gonna continue.

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:55.290 align:middle line:10%
This fuse is just going to
continue to burn, and burn,

00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:58.530 align:middle line:10%
and burn, and burn until
all warring parties look up

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:01.596 align:middle line:10%
in the sky, disperse,
and go home.

00:37:01.596 --> 00:37:02.830 align:middle line:90%
And that's the kill shot.

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your website
is still learnRV.com?

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:05.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Correct.

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:08.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And of course, you
continue to train people.

00:37:08.350 --> 00:37:13.010 align:middle line:84%
Has this been a blessing or a
curse for you, remote viewing?

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:15.875 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: It changed
my life permanently.

00:37:15.875 --> 00:37:19.520 align:middle line:84%
When you know, as I mentioned,
that you can know anything.

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:21.160 align:middle line:84%
I never looked at
it that way, George,

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:23.840 align:middle line:90%
as a blessing or a curse.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:26.630 align:middle line:84%
I look at life as
a blessing, yeah.

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As you look
into the future,

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:31.710 align:middle line:84%
give us a little
glimpse of what we

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:37.100 align:middle line:84%
can expect over the next
gosh, 20 to 30 years.

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Grim.

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Economic situation, as I said
on Coast to Coast years ago,

00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:43.880 align:middle line:90%
global economic collapse.

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.370 align:middle line:90%
Everybody laughed at me.

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:46.715 align:middle line:90%
They're not laughing anymore.

00:37:46.715 --> 00:37:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nobody's laughing.

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:50.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: We're going to
have a different currency.

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:53.400 align:middle line:84%
The US dollar is good for
probably another two years max.

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it?

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:54.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: That's it, it's gone.

00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Then it will be replaced by
something of a global currency,

00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:59.450 align:middle line:90%
probably.

00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:03.890 align:middle line:84%
But grim in terms of
people's quality of life.

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Unless you really
prepare, and especially

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:12.950 align:middle line:84%
if you're in some of the
big cities, quality of life

00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:14.142 align:middle line:90%
is going to be problematic.

00:38:14.142 --> 00:38:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ed, thanks for
being on Beyond Belief.

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:17.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: The pleasure is mine.

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:18.230 align:middle line:90%
It's always great to be here.

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:19.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're one
of the good guys.

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:20.334 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Thank you.

00:38:20.334 --> 00:38:22.250 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Got a heart of
gold deep down inside,

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:24.050 align:middle line:10%
even though he's
called Dr. Doom.

00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:26.420 align:middle line:84%
But what he does see,
as he just mentioned,

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:28.880 align:middle line:90%
is kind of a grim future.

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:31.040 align:middle line:84%
Take that information
and protect

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:32.740 align:middle line:90%
yourself and your family.

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:36.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching Beyond Belief.
