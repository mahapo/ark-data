>>GEORGE NOORY: Well, welcome
to the "Beyond Belief."

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.740 align:middle line:10%
There are a lot of filmmakers
and artists who do great jobs,

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.650 align:middle line:10%
but none like Ben Stewart.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.800 align:middle line:84%
A pioneer in the
consciousness field of art.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.860 align:middle line:84%
He has produced docuseries
like "Kymatica,"

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.450 align:middle line:84%
"Psychedelica," "Limitless,"
"The Magic Plant" film,

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.960 align:middle line:84%
"DMT Quest" and "Awake in
the Darkness," and he's

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.420 align:middle line:84%
also the host of
Limitless on Gaia.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.612 align:middle line:90%
Ben, welcome back.

>>BEN STEWART:
Thank you so much.

It's good to be back, George.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.130 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE: I had so
much response when

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.020 align:middle line:10%
you were on when we talked about
"Psychedelica" a few years ago.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.820 align:middle line:10%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.140 align:middle line:10%
I think there was a
bigger response when

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.080 align:middle line:10%
we talked about 5G.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.880 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE: Yeah.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.680 align:middle line:10%
They love that.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.500 align:middle line:10%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.760 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE: And it's here.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.080 align:middle line:10%
>>STEWART: It is.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.780 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely here and
Popular Mechanics just

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.120 align:middle line:84%
came out with a
6G article saying

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.739 align:middle line:84%
that humans might
be the antennas

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.070 align:middle line:90%
to suck up the waste energy.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.728 align:middle line:90%
So it's moving fast, this world.

00:01:07.728 --> 00:01:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Tonight,
we're here to talk

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.580 align:middle line:90%
about unlocking codes within.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.930 align:middle line:90%
What are the codes within?

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Do you play
video games or have you?

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I used to
when I was a kid.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.535 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: So in video games--

00:01:18.535 --> 00:01:19.335 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Pong--

00:01:19.335 --> 00:01:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: OK.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.290 align:middle line:84%
A little more
advanced than that.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.710 align:middle line:84%
But you're controlling
this avatar inside

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.000 align:middle line:90%
of the video game.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And there's codes to make
them do what they do.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes,
the coders will put

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.050 align:middle line:90%
like a special code in there.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.660 align:middle line:84%
At the right time, if you
press the right buttons,

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.230 align:middle line:84%
it'll unlock deeper potentials
inside that character.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.970 align:middle line:84%
That's the metaphor
that I'm using when I

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.345 align:middle line:90%
say, unlocking codes within us.

00:01:43.345 --> 00:01:44.145 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Sure.

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: They're not
exactly computer codes,

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.970 align:middle line:90%
but they're not too dissimilar.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's the moments that
we live through that call

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.130 align:middle line:84%
upon what codes
need to come out.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think this
world is heading

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.380 align:middle line:84%
into some types
of crises that are

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.705 align:middle line:84%
going to call upon different
codes from humanity.

00:02:00.705 --> 00:02:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Who has implanted
these codes within us?

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.390 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: That's the
million-dollar question.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Many call it creator,
great spirit.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Some people think
this is a matrix

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.020 align:middle line:84%
and that we or our future selves
have plugged us into the matrix

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.320 align:middle line:84%
to get us to learn lessons
that we need to learn

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.310 align:middle line:90%
for us to mature as a species.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.890 align:middle line:84%
But I can't say that I
have the answer to that.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.920 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that in
the same way that--

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to know how
a smartphone is built,

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.490 align:middle line:84%
I just need to
know how to use it.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And then I can access all
the information there within.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.110 align:middle line:84%
So there are ways that we can
access and unlock these codes

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.910 align:middle line:90%
inside.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.465 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Is it
happening too fast?

00:02:39.465 --> 00:02:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I think when
history seems to speed up,

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.810 align:middle line:90%
it's doing that for a reason.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's here to show us that
the old world or the old order

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.400 align:middle line:84%
is coming to an end,
which it absolutely is.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's calling upon
different gifts within us.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And when a lot of
people, they hear codes,

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.522 align:middle line:84%
unlocking higher
human potential,

00:02:58.522 --> 00:03:00.480 align:middle line:84%
they think we should be
levitating and shooting

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.565 align:middle line:90%
laser beams out of our eyes.

00:03:02.565 --> 00:03:04.440 align:middle line:84%
But that's not what
humanity needs right now.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.130 align:middle line:84%
We actually need the superpowers
of forgiveness, compassion,

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.050 align:middle line:84%
because most people
right now are

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.690 align:middle line:84%
looking at their own brothers
and sisters and neighbors

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.900 align:middle line:84%
as an enemy rather
than somebody that

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.710 align:middle line:84%
is a part of their
community to help us get

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.960 align:middle line:90%
through the hard times coming.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.377 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You're
absolutely right.

00:03:20.377 --> 00:03:22.390 align:middle line:84%
More people should be
thinking the way you do.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.473 align:middle line:90%
We'd have a better planet.

00:03:23.473 --> 00:03:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, I hope that
what's happening on planet

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Earth is going to make
it obvious for everybody.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.320 align:middle line:84%
That we need each other in ways
that we couldn't understand

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.760 align:middle line:90%
over the past 100 years.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And even in the past 70
years since the Bretton Woods

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.110 align:middle line:84%
agreement of World
War II, the US

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.210 align:middle line:84%
started patrolling the
waters to make sure

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.770 align:middle line:90%
that all shipping was safe.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And with that, millions
upon billions of people

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.230 align:middle line:84%
started populating areas that
for every other scenario,

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.460 align:middle line:84%
they would not be able
to sustain themselves.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And so we're living in this
kind of a fragile system.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And what I feel is happening
is when history seems like it's

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.360 align:middle line:84%
moving quick and there's a
lot of humbling that's coming,

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.880 align:middle line:84%
it's because we're
coming to realize

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.250 align:middle line:84%
that this order that
we've been living in,

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.100 align:middle line:84%
this kind of halcyon
era, is coming to an end.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: The genome
sequence, which

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.800 align:middle line:90%
has given us our own DNA codes.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.940 align:middle line:84%
Is that a little different
from what you're talking

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:19.740 align:middle line:90%
about right now?

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:20.505 align:middle line:90%
Or is it the same?

00:04:20.505 --> 00:04:22.140 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: When I'm
talking about codes

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.540 align:middle line:84%
that-- it doesn't have
nothing to do with DNA

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.660 align:middle line:84%
but it is a little bit deeper
into the fabric of who we are.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.370 align:middle line:84%
DNA is still not
even understood.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: No.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Back in the
'90s, Alan and Iona Miller

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.850 align:middle line:84%
discovered that there are
wormholes inside of our DNA.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's drawing
upon information

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.960 align:middle line:90%
from outside spacetime.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And then you hear
people like Eric Dollard

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.850 align:middle line:84%
who's been studying the
sun for quite some time.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And says that the
sun is actually

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.690 align:middle line:90%
doing the very same thing.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.750 align:middle line:84%
It's drawing upon information
from outside spacetime.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.850 align:middle line:84%
So there's some
interesting correlation

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.550 align:middle line:84%
here where the sun can
unlock codes within us,

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.740 align:middle line:84%
the Earth can unlock
codes within us.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.327 align:middle line:84%
But it's mainly when
history demands it.

00:05:01.327 --> 00:05:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
feel like is coming.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.930 align:middle line:84%
History is going to demand
brand new gifts for humanity

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:06.730 align:middle line:90%
to come out.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.105 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How do
you think we got

00:05:08.105 --> 00:05:10.140 align:middle line:90%
the DNA codes, put within us?

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.472 align:middle line:90%
Was that something God-given?

00:05:11.472 --> 00:05:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Again,
this is a part of

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.430 align:middle line:90%
that million-dollar question.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.840 align:middle line:90%
Who and what are we?

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.300 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people would say
that we share so much DNA--

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: We don't know.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: --with a fruit fly.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.930 align:middle line:84%
You know, so we might be the
highest evolutionary peak

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.930 align:middle line:84%
to date of all
creatures that have

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.640 align:middle line:90%
come before us on this planet.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.180 align:middle line:84%
In utero, we were
aquatic for one,

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.550 align:middle line:90%
we show reptilian, mammalian.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.970 align:middle line:84%
We show all these kinds
of evolutionary steps.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And then in nine months, it's
almost like in that bath,

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.240 align:middle line:84%
we are given all the
information that we need

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.070 align:middle line:90%
to carry it forward as a human.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.370 align:middle line:84%
So our DNA does have
codes inside of it.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And that is part of what
I'm talking about when

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm saying unlocking it.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.202 align:middle line:84%
But there are codes
of the Earth that

00:05:57.202 --> 00:05:58.410 align:middle line:90%
are being unlocked right now.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't come from
physical material like DNA.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Can we
unlock these codes?

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: We must.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.880 align:middle line:90%
It's more than just, can we?

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.620 align:middle line:90%
We absolutely can.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Many of them are going to
be unlocked without us even

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:11.460 align:middle line:90%
wishing it.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's actually
what's happening right now.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.810 align:middle line:84%
When we feel history
is speeding up,

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.780 align:middle line:84%
when we feel that there
is a polycrisis that we're

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.220 align:middle line:84%
experiencing not just
in the economic sense,

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.020 align:middle line:84%
but in the existential
sense, then what's happening

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.520 align:middle line:90%
is these codes are unlocking.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And we're coming to realize
on a subconscious level,

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.580 align:middle line:84%
that what brought
us to this point,

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.190 align:middle line:84%
this old story is
coming to an end,

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.600 align:middle line:90%
and something new is coming.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.190 align:middle line:84%
That makes a lot
of people scared.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Because we want to know
what the future has for us.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.590 align:middle line:84%
We don't like to step
into the unknown.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.310 align:middle line:84%
We'd rather live in a
comfortable form of slavery

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.740 align:middle line:84%
than step into the unknown
with all the wonder that

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.615 align:middle line:90%
might come from that.

00:06:51.615 --> 00:06:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Who would
unlock the codes, Ben?

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.180 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: We unlock the code.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:55.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: We do it.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.800 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: And socially,
we unlock these codes.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.570 align:middle line:84%
So we have our own
individual codes.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:04.080 align:middle line:84%
Like for me, if I were to
meditate every day, which I do

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.690 align:middle line:84%
and just go through my
own personal practices,

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.420 align:middle line:84%
I can unlock higher
gifts and abilities.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.150 align:middle line:84%
But there are certain things
that no one individual

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.530 align:middle line:90%
should have this gift.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And the Native Americans
did their dance

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.820 align:middle line:84%
and their ceremonies, they
would ingest certain plants,

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.330 align:middle line:84%
they would do it under
certain astrological signs

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.100 align:middle line:90%
to unlock social codes.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.280 align:middle line:84%
This could change climate,
this could bring in information

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.580 align:middle line:84%
about where the game is, where
to forage, what kind of food

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.010 align:middle line:84%
to have, what the future
is going to bring.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.050 align:middle line:90%
And think of Pink Floyd.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:35.670 align:middle line:90%
Those are all great musicians.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:37.950 align:middle line:84%
But no one of them
could do what they

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.570 align:middle line:90%
could do when they're together.

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:41.775 align:middle line:90%
That's a metaphor.

00:07:41.775 --> 00:07:43.537 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Together,
they made it happen.

00:07:43.537 --> 00:07:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: They did.

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:48.040 align:middle line:90%
And they defined an entire era.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.465 align:middle line:84%
Not just of music, but
people were awakening back

00:07:51.465 --> 00:07:54.120 align:middle line:84%
in those days when they
were still touring together.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.180 align:middle line:84%
There was a magic that
only they could unlock.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And they would do it in a room
with thousands or hundreds

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:01.170 align:middle line:90%
of thousands of people.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And you could argue that Pink
Floyd couldn't unlock that

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:07.950 align:middle line:84%
without the people there
to help that moment happen.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's just
talking about art.

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:11.230 align:middle line:90%
And that's just one example.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:13.620 align:middle line:84%
We have collective
social codes that

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.440 align:middle line:84%
I think in the coming
10 years specifically,

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.890 align:middle line:90%
are going to be unlocked.

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:20.205 align:middle line:84%
It might be scary to
some, but it's inevitable.

00:08:20.205 --> 00:08:22.665 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Is there an
old story of humanity?

00:08:22.665 --> 00:08:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: The old story is one
of thinking that this Earth is

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.107 align:middle line:90%
ours to do with, however we--

00:08:30.107 --> 00:08:31.065 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: As we please.

00:08:31.065 --> 00:08:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: As we please.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:35.760 align:middle line:84%
It's ours to exploit,
it's inexhaustible.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.230 align:middle line:90%
We can do whatever we want.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:38.460 align:middle line:90%
That's the old story.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And it brings us all the way to
this tipping point right now.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:45.030 align:middle line:84%
So these lessons that we're
about to learn in mass

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:48.360 align:middle line:84%
are lessons that our
ancestors authored for us.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.910 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know how it
was going to turn out,

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:55.860 align:middle line:84%
but we really did create this
collective human superorganism

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.540 align:middle line:90%
that became very hungry.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.500 align:middle line:84%
It takes a lot of resources
to keep this economic

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.750 align:middle line:90%
and this big organism growing.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going
to start experiencing

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.248 align:middle line:90%
that it can't grow anymore.

00:09:07.248 --> 00:09:09.540 align:middle line:84%
It's going to have to go into
what's called post-growth

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.680 align:middle line:90%
or de-growth.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.965 align:middle line:84%
And we have no historic
example for this.

00:09:13.965 --> 00:09:16.590 align:middle line:84%
So we don't know what it's going
to look like on the other side

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:17.507 align:middle line:90%
of this event horizon.

00:09:17.507 --> 00:09:18.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Fascinating.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.755 align:middle line:84%
How do we do this
correction to change things?

00:09:21.755 --> 00:09:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: It's being corrected.

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot
of people think

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:27.540 align:middle line:90%
that it's all up to humans.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.460 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of it is.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.250 align:middle line:84%
A lot of this story is
being written by humans,

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:35.790 align:middle line:84%
but how do we correct
what's been happening?

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.620 align:middle line:84%
We need to come
face-to-face with it.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.980 align:middle line:84%
We actually need to see
our impact upon the Earth.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.667 align:middle line:84%
Because as of right now, most
people are sitting at homes.

00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:45.750 align:middle line:84%
They have their smartphone,
they have their chips,

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.042 align:middle line:84%
they have whatever they need,
but they don't understand

00:09:48.042 --> 00:09:51.030 align:middle line:84%
the sacrifices over
the past 12,000 years

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.770 align:middle line:84%
that it took to get
us to this point

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:54.750 align:middle line:84%
where we could go to
any grocery store,

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.940 align:middle line:84%
get any food that
we want, we can get

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.840 align:middle line:90%
all the entertainment we want.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And because we don't
understand the sacrifices that

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.560 align:middle line:84%
went into it, we don't
even have the ability

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.070 align:middle line:90%
to have gratitude for it.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:08.340 align:middle line:84%
So I think what's
coming is there's

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.500 align:middle line:84%
this hard correction coming
where people are going

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.250 align:middle line:84%
to be face-to-face with the fact
that this is not sustainable

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:15.130 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And this doesn't mean
the world is ending.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.380 align:middle line:84%
It's just the world is
ending as we know it.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:20.950 align:middle line:84%
Many people aren't
going to like it,

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.520 align:middle line:84%
but that's because they're
holding on to the old story.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.310 align:middle line:84%
The new story must
come in, but it's not

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.890 align:middle line:84%
going to come in until
this chaotic reset period.

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:31.710 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's the 2020s.

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think this transition
is going to be complete

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.590 align:middle line:84%
and the new story will
have started by 2035.

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:40.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: People are
acting weird these days.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.360 align:middle line:90%
You see it, I see it.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Does that have anything
to do with this?

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.637 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: People
are acting weird

00:10:45.637 --> 00:10:47.790 align:middle line:84%
because nobody
really understands

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.880 align:middle line:90%
the root cause of this.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.090 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it-- we place
blame on the outside world.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:55.320 align:middle line:90%
We're looking for a bad guy.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.330 align:middle line:84%
This is part of
the old story, too.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.220 align:middle line:90%
This us versus them.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.590 align:middle line:84%
If I'm not fully
comfortable with what's

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.260 align:middle line:84%
happening in my life, there's
got to be someone to blame.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.450 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, we go
into self-loathing

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:08.730 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes we look
outside to be like,

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:12.007 align:middle line:84%
well, it's this nation-state
or it's this economic model.

00:11:12.007 --> 00:11:12.945 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Right.

00:11:12.945 --> 00:11:14.200 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: It's this group.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.110 align:middle line:90%
It's the way these people voted.

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.690 align:middle line:84%
When in fact, what
this is, these

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:20.790 align:middle line:84%
are all signs of an
empire in decline.

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:22.390 align:middle line:90%
And we're seeing it right now.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:25.260 align:middle line:84%
So as people are acting
weird in the streets

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.780 align:middle line:84%
towards their fellow men
and brothers and sisters,

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.610 align:middle line:84%
I think what we're
coming to realize

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:33.450 align:middle line:84%
is we're starting to
experience a radical transition

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:34.530 align:middle line:90%
from within us.

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:36.300 align:middle line:90%
We don't know how to explain it.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.160 align:middle line:90%
It's causing us anxiety.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking for
there to be someone

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:42.690 align:middle line:90%
we can blame for all of this.

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Because we want it to go back to
normal, but there's no piecing

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.200 align:middle line:90%
this back together.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Is this going to
create the new story for us?

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:54.240 align:middle line:84%
The new story is going to emerge
out of how we write the ending.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.218 align:middle line:84%
The next 10 to 15
years, we're writing

00:11:56.218 --> 00:11:57.510 align:middle line:90%
the ending of this whole story.

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:59.385 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Which you have
no idea how it'll end?

00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: No.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.143 align:middle line:84%
And our children are going
to write the new story.

00:12:02.143 --> 00:12:05.670 align:middle line:84%
We may inform it, but
it's our job as parents,

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:08.880 align:middle line:84%
not to step into our
child's way and tell them

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.620 align:middle line:90%
how to steer the future.

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:14.790 align:middle line:84%
Our job is to provide backstory
so they can understand

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:18.390 align:middle line:84%
that if we go this route, the
route that we've already gone,

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:21.220 align:middle line:84%
the old story, we're going
to face the same problems.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.173 align:middle line:90%
So we need to evolve.

00:12:22.173 --> 00:12:23.340 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's happening.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:27.210 align:middle line:84%
This is what evolution feels
like when it happens in--

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:28.410 align:middle line:90%
fits and spurts.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:30.690 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't feel
exactly comfortable,

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:34.230 align:middle line:84%
because we need to transition
from our comfort zone, which

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:37.260 align:middle line:84%
isn't something that we'll
do unless there's a crisis.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Which take a look at
the world, there's

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.230 align:middle line:90%
more than just a crisis.

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:41.700 align:middle line:84%
There's a confluence
of problems.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: It's out of control.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: There's many of them
striking all at the same time.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Tell us about
your show, "Limitless."

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:48.235 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: In "Limitless--"

00:12:48.235 --> 00:12:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And it deals
with a lot of this.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.300 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't it?

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.240 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: It does.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, "Limitless" really
deals with human potential.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.502 align:middle line:84%
And what we're
talking about when

00:12:56.502 --> 00:12:57.960 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
human potential

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.930 align:middle line:84%
is this continuum
of codes within us.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:03.240 align:middle line:84%
But in our smaller
mind, if I want

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.460 align:middle line:84%
to be able to run faster,
jump higher, things

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.590 align:middle line:84%
along those lines,
that doesn't help us

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:09.000 align:middle line:90%
in an evolutionary sense.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.890 align:middle line:84%
That may help me stand
out among the rest,

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:13.590 align:middle line:90%
but that's the story of ego.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:15.450 align:middle line:84%
That's not what the
Earth needs, that's not

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:16.930 align:middle line:90%
what evolution needs.

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:20.160 align:middle line:84%
So in the show,
"Limitless," I'm really

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.230 align:middle line:84%
introducing people to
the fact that we have

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:25.230 align:middle line:90%
far more capacity for goodness.

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:29.430 align:middle line:84%
But I think what the Earth needs
now more than a superhero is

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:34.290 align:middle line:84%
community-wide forgiveness for
all of those trespasses, all

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:35.250 align:middle line:90%
of the violation.

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, forgiveness
of ourselves as well.

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:40.530 align:middle line:84%
Of how we violated the
Earth up until now,

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:43.390 align:middle line:84%
and all can and
will be forgiven.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:46.560 align:middle line:84%
But there needs to be
a kind of a gesture

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:50.190 align:middle line:84%
like a ceremonial
community-wide gesture.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's not something
that I'm even calling for.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that
somebody can organize.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:57.645 align:middle line:84%
It has to emerge
naturally, grassroots.

00:13:57.645 --> 00:14:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do we have
people on our side

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:01.800 align:middle line:90%
that can help us get this done?

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:02.640 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:03.335 align:middle line:90%
And I think even--

00:14:03.335 --> 00:14:04.455 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Or they're
going to fight us.

00:14:04.455 --> 00:14:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, I mean,
fighting is already happening.

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:10.080 align:middle line:84%
There's already war, there's
already famine in this world.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.810 align:middle line:84%
There's already a
massive amount of issues.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And this isn't
coming from people

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.040 align:middle line:84%
that are twisting their
mustache thinking how they can

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.600 align:middle line:90%
screw the world a little more.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.310 align:middle line:84%
This is coming
from people trying

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:23.880 align:middle line:84%
to maintain what they have
for their own families.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the day,
people in the military,

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:30.270 align:middle line:84%
people in politics, even people
in secret societies, which

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.670 align:middle line:84%
there are many, these are
also people with families.

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And they don't get off
on mass destruction.

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:40.590 align:middle line:84%
Some of them may, but they're
more the exception to the rule.

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:44.820 align:middle line:84%
I think what we're experiencing
is once this tipping point is

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.000 align:middle line:84%
inevitable in most people's
minds, it's already inevitable,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.100 align:middle line:84%
but once people
surrender to the fact

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:53.350 align:middle line:84%
that this tipping point into
the new story is upon us,

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.350 align:middle line:84%
then people can start
surrendering to it.

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:57.210 align:middle line:84%
Until they start
surrendering to it,

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:59.020 align:middle line:84%
they're going to keep
fighting against it.

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:00.570 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we
actually need to be

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:04.560 align:middle line:84%
hit with an even harder crisis,
which is why I do believe, even

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.950 align:middle line:84%
according to the data but also
a gut feeling that, the next 10

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:11.640 align:middle line:84%
to 15 years, nobody is going
to get out of this unscathed.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: If you
had an opportunity

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:17.210 align:middle line:84%
to talk to a group of
thinkers, think tank experts,

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:18.440 align:middle line:90%
what would you tell them?

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I would say that we
need to look at global supply

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.960 align:middle line:84%
chains, and we need to look
at where people are amassed

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.300 align:middle line:84%
in places where they
cannot grow their own food.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.630 align:middle line:84%
Because we need to prepare
for mass migrations.

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:34.100 align:middle line:84%
In sub-Saharan Africa, in
poorer areas of Latin America,

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.080 align:middle line:84%
in the Middle East,
these are places

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.970 align:middle line:84%
that are going to
get hit the hardest.

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And you could say even in
Sri Lanka and Bangladesh,

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:42.930 align:middle line:84%
the doomsday clock
already hit midnight.

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:45.650 align:middle line:84%
So we're sitting here
in relative affluence.

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:48.170 align:middle line:84%
But elsewhere, they're
already experiencing

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:49.130 align:middle line:90%
what I'm talking about.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:50.362 align:middle line:90%
When it hits a terminal--

00:15:50.362 --> 00:15:52.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And they're
not happy about it.

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:53.105 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: No.

00:15:53.105 --> 00:15:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And most of them look at
America as the cause of it.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:58.820 align:middle line:84%
When in fact, there
is no singular cause.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.170 align:middle line:84%
This is a very complex
issue that we're facing.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:04.910 align:middle line:84%
So America has become the
number one dominant superpower,

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:06.480 align:middle line:90%
but we also abuse that.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And when we say America,
America is not one thing.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.690 align:middle line:84%
It's many siloed factions
of intelligence, agencies,

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:12.500 align:middle line:90%
and people.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.100 align:middle line:84%
Many Americans don't agree
with the credo of America.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.880 align:middle line:84%
But America is in the
best possible spot

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:23.840 align:middle line:84%
to actually help with aid
for the rest of the world.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
going to help everybody,

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:29.240 align:middle line:84%
because we had a huge population
boom after World War II.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And we don't even have the
people in the workforce

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:33.810 align:middle line:90%
to make up for it.

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
these Baby Boomers

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:37.920 align:middle line:84%
are leaving the
workforce right now.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.170 align:middle line:90%
We don't have the population--

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:40.595 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What are
they doing, Ben?

00:16:40.595 --> 00:16:41.455 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: In retirement?

00:16:41.455 --> 00:16:42.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Yeah.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: They're looking for
the pensions that aren't there

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:44.390 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:46.250 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for their
retirement that isn't there

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:47.120 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And I won't go down a conspiracy
rabbit hole right now,

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:54.050 align:middle line:84%
but I think that a lot of
the crises that we're facing

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:58.460 align:middle line:84%
are at least, in part,
manufactured or opportunised

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:02.630 align:middle line:84%
in order to muddy the waters
so future generations don't

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:08.480 align:middle line:84%
know exactly how or why this
crisis hit the world so hard.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Because if we look back
15, 20 years from now,

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.310 align:middle line:84%
we'll just be like,
oh, well, it's COVID.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:15.079 align:middle line:84%
And you remember,
Russia and Ukraine.

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:16.250 align:middle line:90%
And oh, yeah.

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:19.310 align:middle line:84%
All these hackers and
supply chains went offline.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:22.069 align:middle line:84%
And we couldn't have
foreseen this coming.

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:24.560 align:middle line:84%
No, people have been talking
about this for 50 years.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.450 align:middle line:84%
That supply chains are
going to reach this end.

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:30.450 align:middle line:84%
We don't have the fossil fuels
to power the kind of shipping.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:31.250 align:middle line:90%
Now, they're here.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:34.010 align:middle line:84%
So we're also in terminal
demographic decline.

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:36.590 align:middle line:84%
We're also reaching
a tipping point

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:44.330 align:middle line:84%
where 350% of World GDP
or what is GWP is in debt.

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:45.630 align:middle line:90%
350% of that.

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Crazy.

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:48.597 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: We're in a musical
chairs situation where

00:17:48.597 --> 00:17:51.373 align:middle line:84%
there are not enough chairs to
go around for all the people.

00:17:51.373 --> 00:17:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And these people
aren't just going

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:54.770 align:middle line:90%
to magically go away somehow.

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:58.310 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm seeing
mass migrations, famine.

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And I don't say this
to scare anybody.

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:01.077 align:middle line:90%
I do say this--

00:18:01.077 --> 00:18:01.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: It's true.

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: We've stepped into
a world that's unsustainable.

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
to experience both

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:09.530 align:middle line:84%
the ugly and the
beautiful side of that

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:11.540 align:middle line:90%
in the next 10 to 15 years.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:14.030 align:middle line:84%
My job is to help
people understand

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:17.450 align:middle line:84%
that there are things you can
do on this side of this crisis.

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:18.410 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Right now.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Social
capital, community.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Stop worrying about
your bank account.

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:25.100 align:middle line:84%
Really start looking
at how food is

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.110 align:middle line:90%
grown in your local community.

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:30.170 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if supply chains
were cut off tomorrow

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:33.380 align:middle line:84%
and we don't have
imports, what would we

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:36.500 align:middle line:84%
do if the shelves were
not stocked anymore?

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:40.130 align:middle line:84%
If gas is still available
but it's at $15 a gallon,

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:43.640 align:middle line:84%
and there's no way you can
even go to vacation in Florida

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.620 align:middle line:90%
anymore cheaply.

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:47.330 align:middle line:84%
What happens in a
world like that?

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.190 align:middle line:90%
That's just a 30% correction.

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Like Great Depression,
that was a 30% correction

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:54.230 align:middle line:90%
in the economy.

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
Great Depression.

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:58.040 align:middle line:84%
We might experience
an extended version

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:02.570 align:middle line:84%
of that for a while, probably
even greater in its intensity.

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:04.070 align:middle line:90%
What we need is community.

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:07.100 align:middle line:84%
That's the only capital we
need more than any other kind.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What does
ceremony mean to you, Ben?

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Ceremony
is really-- it's

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:14.990 align:middle line:84%
a daily or a weekly
or a monthly ritual

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:18.620 align:middle line:84%
and a habit in which
we can individually

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:22.640 align:middle line:84%
or collectively imprint
our intention via our heart

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.750 align:middle line:90%
upon reality.

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:26.840 align:middle line:84%
So ceremony is, in
many ways, where

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:31.280 align:middle line:84%
it comes from is tribes that
feel grateful that there's

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.510 align:middle line:90%
enough game to hunt.

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:35.510 align:middle line:84%
That there's enough stuff to
gather for them to have food

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:36.530 align:middle line:90%
to survive.

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:39.470 align:middle line:84%
So they would have ceremony
to remember their gratitude

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:40.940 align:middle line:90%
for what they already have.

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.910 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays, we don't have
institutionalized ceremony.

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:45.050 align:middle line:90%
We have the Olympics.

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And we have things like
the Golden Globe Awards.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.580 align:middle line:84%
But these are not
real ceremonies.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:54.170 align:middle line:84%
We need to understand
forgiveness as a ceremony.

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:56.930 align:middle line:84%
We need to understand
how gratitude comes

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.298 align:middle line:90%
about when crisis has emerged.

00:19:59.298 --> 00:20:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And some of the poorest
areas in the world, these

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:02.750 align:middle line:90%
are the most grateful people.

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:07.100 align:middle line:84%
I went to Peru with a soccer
ball and I found this tribe,

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.750 align:middle line:90%
and we played soccer together.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.700 align:middle line:90%
And the entire--

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:12.620 align:middle line:84%
I think, it was 50, 60
people in the tribe,

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.620 align:middle line:84%
they all came out to celebrate
this one soccer ball.

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:16.430 align:middle line:90%
They retired--

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It's like they've
never seen one before.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.480 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right?

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:20.680 align:middle line:84%
Their old soccer
ball was a coconut

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.910 align:middle line:84%
wrapped in 15 t-shirts
with duct tape around it.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:23.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Jeez.

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:26.127 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: They retired it,
but they didn't throw it away.

00:20:26.127 --> 00:20:28.450 align:middle line:84%
There's no such thing as
throwing away in the Amazon.

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:29.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Right.

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: So they retired
it as a sacred item

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.610 align:middle line:84%
that they still
have gratitude for.

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:36.340 align:middle line:84%
What they would do is
they would say, thank you.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.980 align:middle line:84%
You gave us something
to collectively come

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:39.940 align:middle line:90%
and celebrate.

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Sports is a ceremony,
if you will.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:45.460 align:middle line:84%
We've industrialized
it and monetized it,

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:49.240 align:middle line:84%
but ceremony to me is
the way that we're going

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.100 align:middle line:90%
to help write the new story.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's the only
way to correct some

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:55.370 align:middle line:84%
of the injustices that
are institutionalized

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:56.170 align:middle line:90%
in our system.

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:57.337 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Sooner than later?

00:20:57.337 --> 00:20:58.540 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: This decade.

00:20:58.540 --> 00:20:58.945 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:20:58.945 --> 00:20:59.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's soon.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:00.864 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Worldwide.

00:21:00.864 --> 00:21:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Worldwide, this needs
to be institutionalized.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
why I say ceremony

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:08.020 align:middle line:84%
needs to be institutionalized,
it might seem like it's just

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:11.620 align:middle line:84%
like no, what we really need
is more food and more this.

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I agree with all that.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:17.110 align:middle line:10%
But if we don't have gratitude,
the lack of gratitude

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.660 align:middle line:10%
and the absence of
love leads to war.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:22.960 align:middle line:84%
It leads to the conflicts
of, my neighbor has food,

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.430 align:middle line:90%
my kids are starving.

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:26.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to be
the nice guy anymore.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:28.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go
take what I need.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.510 align:middle line:84%
The difference between having
community and not having

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:33.490 align:middle line:90%
community is that decision.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:36.070 align:middle line:84%
That decision that I can go
and take whatever I need.

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:37.900 align:middle line:84%
Because what I don't
want to see happening

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:41.950 align:middle line:84%
is this tipping point
leading America back

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:43.840 align:middle line:84%
into being
isolationist, and then

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.580 align:middle line:84%
an empire that
goes and takes what

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:47.905 align:middle line:84%
we need from elsewhere who
can't defend themselves.

00:21:47.905 --> 00:21:48.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Exactly.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.810 align:middle line:84%
As we move forward,
are we going to get

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:54.735 align:middle line:90%
this done in your opinion?

00:21:54.735 --> 00:21:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I think
it's inevitable.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.110 align:middle line:84%
It's inevitable that we're
already facing the crisis.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:00.670 align:middle line:84%
It's inevitable that
people are going

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:04.030 align:middle line:84%
to wake up to there's
no avoiding the crisis.

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:07.240 align:middle line:90%
And it's going to streamline.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:09.610 align:middle line:84%
We are a highly
resilient people.

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:11.800 align:middle line:84%
We've come through--
what was it?

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.810 align:middle line:90%
300,000 years, we were nomads.

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:16.585 align:middle line:84%
And then 12,000 years
ago, we stopped wandering.

00:22:16.585 --> 00:22:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And look
what happened.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: We
stayed in one place.

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: We exploded.

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:19.870 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:20.920 align:middle line:90%
Civilization started.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Cultural diversity, cities,
urbanization, and also

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.460 align:middle line:84%
living off of the
wealth of surplus.

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:30.380 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors, they
never had surplus before.

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:35.110 align:middle line:84%
So now, we've gotten
to an extreme where

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:38.020 align:middle line:84%
we need to be
resilient again, but we

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.750 align:middle line:84%
have no reference point for
what we're about to experience.

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Because we've seen
Rome collapse,

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:46.210 align:middle line:84%
we have historical examples
of empires collapsing.

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:50.920 align:middle line:84%
But not when it's globalized and
not when we are so dependent.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Half the world's population
is dependent upon imports

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:55.580 align:middle line:90%
to survive.

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:57.710 align:middle line:90%
Let alone just have fun.

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:01.330 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to be humbled,
but we're also exceedingly

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:03.200 align:middle line:90%
resilient as a people.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.750 align:middle line:90%
So we will make it through this.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And our children, they
are the number one reason

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.980 align:middle line:84%
why we in our generation
need to be very resilient.

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.510 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't need us
to come through this highly

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:15.310 align:middle line:90%
traumatized.

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Because then we're just going
to keep passing it down.

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Ben, explain
apoptosis to us.

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:21.490 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Apoptosis
in cellular biology

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.460 align:middle line:84%
is cells that are
programmed to die.

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why our
cells die inside of our body

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:34.510 align:middle line:84%
is to pave way and to liberate
resources for new cells

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:35.950 align:middle line:90%
to come about.

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:37.660 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing
with humanity.

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:39.800 align:middle line:84%
With eight billion
people on this planet,

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.385 align:middle line:84%
especially, as hungry
for resources as we are,

00:23:42.385 --> 00:23:43.880 align:middle line:90%
we can't maintain it.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:47.830 align:middle line:84%
So we may see massive die-offs
due to the famine that I

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:50.560 align:middle line:84%
was talking about,
mass migrations, war.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:53.500 align:middle line:84%
All these things happen
in these crisis periods.

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.350 align:middle line:84%
These things start to
flare up, and there

00:23:56.350 --> 00:24:00.610 align:middle line:84%
may be a point where there are
too many bodies for us to have

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:02.720 align:middle line:90%
individual funerals anymore.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.423 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be exceedingly
difficult for us to watch.

00:24:05.423 --> 00:24:06.715 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: There's no more land.

00:24:06.715 --> 00:24:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: We have a lot of land
and a lot of resources left.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.980 align:middle line:90%
The issue is the distribution.

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:16.870 align:middle line:84%
Like in America, we are the best
geographically located spot.

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:20.530 align:middle line:84%
So we-- let's say, all
supply chains shut down.

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:22.720 align:middle line:84%
We have more than enough
food in this country.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.640 align:middle line:84%
We have more than
enough to keep trading--

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:24.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: We're lucky.

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:25.870 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: --as well.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:27.490 align:middle line:90%
We are very lucky.

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:31.580 align:middle line:84%
The issue is going to be
when we have a surplus here,

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:35.500 align:middle line:84%
but we don't have the cheap
and easy way to ship it to Sri

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.670 align:middle line:84%
Lanka and Bangladesh
and Ecuador,

00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:42.490 align:middle line:84%
so we have surplus and they
don't-- yet we get to watch it

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:45.220 align:middle line:84%
on our smartphones,
streaming live on YouTube.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:48.170 align:middle line:84%
That's something that I
think is going to happen.

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to impress
upon us luckier demographics

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:56.360 align:middle line:84%
that this was for
one, inevitable.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
the wealth gap really

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:00.980 align:middle line:90%
starts to become very evident.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.190 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
see what it means

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:07.330 align:middle line:84%
for us to thrive while
others can barely survive.

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And again, I don't say
this to scare anyone.

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:12.880 align:middle line:84%
But these are the realities
that we must wake up to.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.190 align:middle line:84%
We are not going to get
through this situation

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:17.410 align:middle line:84%
without humility and
without boundaries.

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's mainly
what I'm talking about here.

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:24.030 align:middle line:84%
Mother Earth and reality
is humbling humanity.

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:26.303 align:middle line:84%
And without humility,
we'll just keep

00:25:26.303 --> 00:25:27.720 align:middle line:84%
thinking that we
can take whatever

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.630 align:middle line:84%
we want from the Earth
with no consequence.

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Ben, what
are false awakenings?

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.450 align:middle line:84%
We keep hearing
that all the time.

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: An awakening
implies that we're

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:38.470 align:middle line:90%
asleep to some part of reality.

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And you wake up
to it, therefore,

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:43.450 align:middle line:84%
you have a clarity of
what reality really is.

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:45.240 align:middle line:90%
So we are in an awakening.

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:47.490 align:middle line:84%
As we're leading
towards this awakening,

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:51.640 align:middle line:84%
the old story disguises
itself as the new story.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And it starts popping
up in these ways.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.060 align:middle line:90%
I'll give two examples.

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:56.190 align:middle line:90%
One is flat Earth.

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:59.348 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not actually pushing
against the researchers that

00:25:59.348 --> 00:26:01.140 align:middle line:84%
are researching flat
Earth, because they're

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:04.620 align:middle line:84%
finding anomalies from NASA,
all the way to Antarctica.

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.870 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot to be said
about their research.

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:09.030 align:middle line:84%
The false part of
their awakening

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:13.170 align:middle line:84%
comes in when they supplant
this worldview of around Earth

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:15.900 align:middle line:84%
to, OK, I know what the
world is now, because I've

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.430 align:middle line:90%
researched some stuff online.

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:20.310 align:middle line:84%
I know what's flat, I know
there's a dome up there.

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:22.200 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
false part comes in,

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.750 align:middle line:84%
where we get so
convinced that because we

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:28.140 align:middle line:84%
see some anomalies of
things online, that now we

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.060 align:middle line:90%
know exactly what the world is.

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:32.220 align:middle line:84%
It's that part where
we are convinced

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:34.800 align:middle line:84%
of the conclusion
rather than just diving

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.450 align:middle line:84%
into the black hole
of the question.

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:39.870 align:middle line:84%
So here's the key
about false awakenings.

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:43.560 align:middle line:84%
We're not here to choose a
door of what the new reality is

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.270 align:middle line:84%
going to look like,
because we're still

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:46.930 align:middle line:90%
swimming in the old story.

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:49.770 align:middle line:84%
So we are awakening,
but we're trying

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:52.540 align:middle line:84%
to come to a conclusion
of what it means

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:55.180 align:middle line:84%
so we can hedge our bets
and so we can feel safer

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:55.980 align:middle line:90%
about the future.

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.970 align:middle line:90%
That's the false part of it.

00:26:57.970 --> 00:26:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
inevitably going

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.440 align:middle line:90%
to fail like a house of cards.

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Because none of these
false awakenings

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:07.890 align:middle line:90%
have a truly written story yet.

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:10.390 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, our children are
going to write the new story.

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:11.640 align:middle line:90%
We're just going to help them.

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:14.445 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do you believe
that humanity is an organism?

00:27:14.445 --> 00:27:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Absolutely.

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:19.170 align:middle line:84%
It's an organism,
and every nation

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:21.940 align:middle line:84%
is an organ within
that organism.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Every person is a cell
within that organism.

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think the Earth
itself is waking up.

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And many people think that we
are disconnected from Earth

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:36.970 align:middle line:84%
in a way where we are
not a part of nature.

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:37.770 align:middle line:90%
But we are.

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:39.330 align:middle line:90%
We can't live without nature.

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:41.800 align:middle line:84%
It's obvious that there's
microbes in the soil.

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:42.600 align:middle line:90%
What do you know?

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.190 align:middle line:90%
There's microbes in our gut.

00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:45.815 align:middle line:84%
We can't live without
those microbes.

00:27:45.815 --> 00:27:46.773 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's right.

00:27:46.773 --> 00:27:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: And back to DNA,
most of the DNA in our body

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:51.090 align:middle line:90%
is not human.

00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:54.300 align:middle line:84%
It's actually microbial,
and even the mitochondria

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:58.770 align:middle line:84%
in our brown fat, it's called
brown because it's so densely

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:00.270 align:middle line:90%
packed with mitochondria.

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:03.610 align:middle line:84%
That's foreign or
alien DNA inside of us.

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:06.510 align:middle line:84%
So we, ourselves,
are a superorganism.

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And the Earth itself is
sending us messages and codes.

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:14.168 align:middle line:84%
And they are being unlocked,
even on unconscious levels.

00:28:14.168 --> 00:28:16.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Are there a couple of
groups out there trying to do

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:17.945 align:middle line:90%
better and worse for us?

00:28:17.945 --> 00:28:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I think the
groups that we're looking at

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:22.860 align:middle line:84%
is, it's almost like
cellular mitosis.

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Mitosis in a cell is when a cell
splits and divides into two.

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.660 align:middle line:84%
I think that's happening
with our species.

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:31.410 align:middle line:84%
But we're seeing it on a social
and cultural level first.

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:34.565 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing it in
arguments on social media.

00:28:34.565 --> 00:28:35.925 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: What-- and the hate.

00:28:35.925 --> 00:28:36.960 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's a
byproduct of the fact

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:40.750 align:middle line:84%
that we don't get
what's happening.

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:42.990 align:middle line:84%
We don't understand
in our small mind.

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:46.200 align:middle line:84%
The larger more collective
mind understands what this is.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's a painful
like labor process.

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:51.990 align:middle line:84%
But the two groups
are the tech-infused

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:53.370 align:middle line:90%
or the transhumanists.

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And the other one would be like
the purist or the naturalist.

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:59.490 align:middle line:84%
The ones that want to
stick with biology.

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And their guiding
philosophies is

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.770 align:middle line:84%
for the tech-infused
or the transhumanists,

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:09.630 align:middle line:84%
they believe that we are
better than our bodies,

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:12.000 align:middle line:84%
and we don't need
our biological bodies

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.220 align:middle line:84%
and we're more suited
for technology.

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.950 align:middle line:84%
There's an element
of truth in that.

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:18.810 align:middle line:90%
But it's not completely true.

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And then the other side of
it is, well, consciousness

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.610 align:middle line:90%
was born inside biology.

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:25.590 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, that's
where it should stay.

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:27.690 align:middle line:84%
There's also an element
of truth in that.

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:30.630 align:middle line:84%
But I think the third
way, the middle way

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:34.470 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that those who
are diving into transhumanism

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:36.810 align:middle line:84%
and wanting to live
in the metaverse

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:39.090 align:middle line:84%
and hooking themselves
to Neuralink

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:41.850 align:middle line:84%
and all this technology,
they're simply going to do it.

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And I see so many people pushing
back against transhumanism

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.810 align:middle line:90%
with a lack of love.

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you ask any of
the great avatars--

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:53.700 align:middle line:84%
Christ, Buddha, Avalokitesvara--
they would say there

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.990 align:middle line:84%
is no space where
love does not belong.

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:59.130 align:middle line:84%
We need to love people,
including their choices

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:00.210 align:middle line:90%
and support them.

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Not if they're trying to damage
the Earth, which a lot of this

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:04.500 align:middle line:90%
actually is happening.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:05.300 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:06.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Intentionally?

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: I think, no.

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:10.110 align:middle line:84%
I think it's not
intentional when

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:13.050 align:middle line:90%
it comes to transhuman agenda.

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:16.050 align:middle line:84%
I think the transhuman
agenda is actually a lot more

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:17.790 align:middle line:90%
ancient than we would think.

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:20.490 align:middle line:84%
I think it's as old as
language and mathematics.

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And I can get into
that another time,

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:26.010 align:middle line:84%
but that's when real artificial
intelligence started.

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:27.840 align:middle line:90%
Simulated intelligence started.

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:31.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have supercomputers
that can think faster

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:32.160 align:middle line:90%
than any human.

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.830 align:middle line:84%
So we're living in an
era where a lot of humans

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:37.290 align:middle line:84%
are seeing there's a lot
of benefit to technology.

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And the other side,
the other group

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.910 align:middle line:84%
is seeing that there's also
a lot of downside to it.

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Like I said at the
beginning, Popular Mechanics

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:48.150 align:middle line:84%
said that 6G is going to
make us into antennas.

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Literally, wrapping copper
wire into our clothing

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:55.652 align:middle line:84%
so we can be antennas to suck
up waste energy from the power.

00:30:55.652 --> 00:30:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Which is
better than they would

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.295 align:middle line:90%
do if they install towers.

00:30:59.295 --> 00:31:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Technology
is changing.

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:06.300 align:middle line:84%
It's so infused into our
system that even Bill Gates--

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:10.290 align:middle line:84%
and I should say,
Microsoft has this kind

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:13.740 align:middle line:84%
of like a cryptocurrency
that mines the crypto

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:16.270 align:middle line:90%
from our cellular biology.

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:19.620 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of where technology
is going is, in a sense,

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:22.600 align:middle line:84%
colonizing us down to
the cellular level.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.140 align:middle line:84%
This is why a lot of people
are pushing back against it.

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is that
split in humanity.

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:30.090 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like we're
becoming two species.

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:32.370 align:middle line:84%
The biological and
the transhuman.

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Can we
win this battle?

00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:36.750 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I don't know
if win is even the word.

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:37.695 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Or succeed?

00:31:37.695 --> 00:31:38.970 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yes.

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:44.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, succeed is really by
finding a way for there not

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:48.750 align:middle line:90%
to be a definitive loser here.

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's the old story
where when one group wins,

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.290 align:middle line:84%
it's at the expense
of another group.

00:31:55.290 --> 00:32:00.120 align:middle line:84%
The new story is really one
of the age of the artist.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:03.420 align:middle line:84%
The artist coming alive
inside of all people, meaning,

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:06.930 align:middle line:84%
we find more creative ways
to move through this crisis

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:08.310 align:middle line:90%
than the old ways.

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:09.150 align:middle line:90%
Meaning, oh, well.

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:12.078 align:middle line:84%
Some are going to survive and
some are going to pass on.

00:32:12.078 --> 00:32:14.370 align:middle line:84%
Some are going to have enough
food to eat, some aren't.

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's really
coming from a fear state.

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:21.570 align:middle line:84%
That's coming from a state
of a lack, a scarcity.

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:24.090 align:middle line:84%
But when the artist
truly wakes up,

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:25.322 align:middle line:90%
and that's the deepest code.

00:32:25.322 --> 00:32:27.030 align:middle line:84%
When we're talking
about unlocking codes,

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:30.090 align:middle line:84%
the deepest code inside
of us is the artist.

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Because it's unencumbered
by all of our conditioning

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:33.390 align:middle line:90%
of the past.

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:36.630 align:middle line:84%
It just causes us to open
up to the entire field

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:37.920 align:middle line:90%
of possibility.

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:41.040 align:middle line:84%
This is how we have
a win-win situation.

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.050 align:middle line:90%
And we do make it through this.

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And I won't go into my own
personal visions that I've had.

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:49.890 align:middle line:84%
But having gone down
to the Amazon and--

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You've
seen it all, Ben.

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well,
I've seen what I

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:57.690 align:middle line:84%
need to see for me to pass
on my gifts to others.

00:32:57.690 --> 00:33:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And having done Ayahuasca
in the Amazon that

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:03.360 align:middle line:84%
is thousands of
years old, I kept

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:06.510 align:middle line:84%
getting brought to this almost
like an invisible secret

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:07.560 align:middle line:90%
society meeting.

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a roundtable
with Mother Ayahuasca

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:13.320 align:middle line:84%
beings from other dimensions,
whatever it might be.

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And this doesn't
have to be literal.

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:18.600 align:middle line:84%
But the way that this
vision kept coming to me

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:23.040 align:middle line:84%
is a lot is going to be taken
away from humanity in order

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.090 align:middle line:90%
to humble humanity.

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well, if we
deviate away from that, away

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.605 align:middle line:84%
from the planet,
what becomes of us?

00:33:28.605 --> 00:33:30.277 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: We've
already deviated.

00:33:30.277 --> 00:33:31.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're still
going to be human.

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.820 align:middle line:84%
But we've already
deviated from nature.

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:36.110 align:middle line:90%
Nature is inside us.

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And it is, in a
sense, it's allowing

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:39.890 align:middle line:90%
us to deviate from nature.

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:42.320 align:middle line:84%
I think it's allowing us
to deviate from nature

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.560 align:middle line:84%
and even allowing us to
violate nature in order

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:46.880 align:middle line:90%
for the humbling that's coming.

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:50.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
overstate this, but I

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:51.830 align:middle line:84%
want to make sure
people understand

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:56.900 align:middle line:84%
that 12,000 years of history is
coming to a head this decade.

00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:59.180 align:middle line:84%
There's no way we're
getting out of this decade

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:01.760 align:middle line:84%
without really
humbling ourselves

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:07.040 align:middle line:84%
enough to see what we've
wrought upon this Earth and why.

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:09.739 align:middle line:84%
This is another importance
of false awakenings.

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:12.170 align:middle line:84%
We have to have
false awakening so we

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:17.120 align:middle line:84%
can see how we become
deluded, how we believe

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:19.940 align:middle line:84%
in things that make
us feel comfortable,

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:21.500 align:middle line:90%
but that's not reality.

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:22.639 align:middle line:90%
It's the old story.

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:25.505 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Are we receiving
any help along the way?

00:34:25.505 --> 00:34:26.480 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: By whom?

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: By ourselves
from the future.

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:31.199 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Explain that.

00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:32.699 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Have you
ever experienced

00:34:32.699 --> 00:34:33.902 align:middle line:90%
intuition inside your world?

00:34:33.902 --> 00:34:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: All the time.

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:36.922 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Everything
around you is telling you

00:34:36.922 --> 00:34:38.880 align:middle line:84%
the world is this way,
and something inside you

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:39.750 align:middle line:90%
is saying like, no.

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:41.010 align:middle line:90%
It's actually this.

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:41.909 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Right.

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: That
intuition is us using

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:48.082 align:middle line:90%
this biological supercomputer.

00:34:48.082 --> 00:34:50.040 align:middle line:84%
I almost don't want to
call it a supercomputer.

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:54.030 align:middle line:84%
But it's a beautiful
instrument that aspects of it

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:55.260 align:middle line:90%
live outside of spacetime.

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:59.100 align:middle line:84%
We already talked about DNA
drawing upon information

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:00.600 align:middle line:90%
from outside spacetime.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:04.830 align:middle line:84%
We have this information
hub right here.

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:07.170 align:middle line:90%
And we get help from ourselves.

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:09.570 align:middle line:84%
You can call it the
future, our future selves.

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:11.040 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually
our higher self

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.820 align:middle line:90%
that lives outside spacetime.

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And when you have that
whisper of intuition,

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:20.280 align:middle line:84%
if you disobey it, it's
going to become quieter.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:24.660 align:middle line:84%
But if you listen to it, even
risky listening to it, meaning,

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:27.000 align:middle line:84%
everyone is telling
you, this is dangerous,

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.520 align:middle line:84%
but your intuition is telling
you, it's going to be fine

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:30.900 align:middle line:90%
and it's also necessary.

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:34.890 align:middle line:84%
That's your higher self saying,
this is a code you must unlock

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:37.320 align:middle line:84%
and you are in the best
position to unlock it.

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.695 align:middle line:84%
Everybody else is too afraid
to put the skin in the game.

00:35:39.695 --> 00:35:41.487 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: They don't
want to take a chance.

00:35:41.487 --> 00:35:42.750 align:middle line:90%
What is source code, Ben?

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:44.280 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Source
code is-- a lot

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:47.880 align:middle line:84%
of people would call it like
the original God's blueprint.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.305 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
God's flashlight.

00:35:49.305 --> 00:35:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Explain that.

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: It lights
the way forward for us.

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:57.360 align:middle line:84%
Source code within us, when I
said, art is the deepest code,

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to contradict
myself by saying,

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:02.160 align:middle line:84%
source code is really
the deepest code.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:07.330 align:middle line:84%
The art code, it draws upon
source code and almost only

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:08.130 align:middle line:90%
source code.

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:12.090 align:middle line:84%
But source code is like
the 5-MeO-DMT state,

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:15.570 align:middle line:84%
where all distinction
between different beings--

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:18.660 align:middle line:84%
black, white, all those
differences, they go away.

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:20.160 align:middle line:90%
And you're in pure love.

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.900 align:middle line:90%
Pure unicity.

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:23.280 align:middle line:90%
That's source code.

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And when you access
that state, there

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:30.210 align:middle line:84%
is nothing but clarity about
who you are, what your path is,

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:31.620 align:middle line:90%
and what you're meant to do.

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And then you also get
put into a flow state,

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:35.790 align:middle line:90%
where it becomes effortless.

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Your body seems to take over,
and some higher intelligence

00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:40.500 align:middle line:90%
carries you through.

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And you can see this in
mothers who aren't deadlifting

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:46.290 align:middle line:84%
800 pounds at the
gym, but they'll

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:49.962 align:middle line:84%
lift a car that weighs 3,000
pounds off of their child.

00:36:49.962 --> 00:36:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: If it
falls on their kid.

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:53.472 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: That's
a code inside them.

00:36:53.472 --> 00:36:54.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Adrenaline
kicks in and--

00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:57.060 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: And their
knees aren't snapping.

00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:59.207 align:middle line:84%
But if they were to do
it without source code,

00:36:59.207 --> 00:37:00.540 align:middle line:90%
they would not be able to do it.

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:03.000 align:middle line:84%
But it's source code
that tells them, OK, here

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.270 align:middle line:84%
is a moment where you're
allowed this superpower.

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:07.620 align:middle line:90%
But only in this moment.

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Because when those
mothers go home,

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:14.250 align:middle line:84%
they don't experience like
torn muscles or broken knees,

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:17.158 align:middle line:84%
but they can't access it
again just to be like, hey,

00:37:17.158 --> 00:37:18.075 align:middle line:90%
look friends, here's--

00:37:18.075 --> 00:37:18.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Look what I did.

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: --here's
what I can do.

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do it with
this car just for fun.

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:22.890 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't do it then.

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:25.800 align:middle line:84%
They can only do it
when Mother Earth says,

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.817 align:middle line:84%
this is an allowable
time for that amount of--

00:37:27.817 --> 00:37:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Kicks in their
adrenaline and makes it happen.

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:31.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:34.028 align:middle line:84%
Through all of the
powers of what we are.

00:37:34.028 --> 00:37:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And we don't even know
what our bodies are.

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What do we need
to go through as a society

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:40.990 align:middle line:90%
to get to the end here?

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:43.620 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Humbling
and boundaries.

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:46.250 align:middle line:90%
We need to go through a lesson.

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Like we are children
coming of age.

00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:50.030 align:middle line:90%
We need to be humbled.

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:54.090 align:middle line:84%
We need to see the
impact of our actions.

00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:57.090 align:middle line:84%
We need to see what
it does collectively.

00:37:57.090 --> 00:38:00.380 align:middle line:84%
We need to see what paying
this amount of money

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:02.900 align:middle line:84%
for this product, which comes
from this country, which

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:06.960 align:middle line:84%
destroys that ecosystem is
really doing to the planet.

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.180 align:middle line:90%
We need to be humbled.

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And as we're being humbled
over the next 10 to 15 years,

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:15.350 align:middle line:84%
we are going to learn
real boundaries.

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:16.610 align:middle line:90%
And it's just like children.

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:18.090 align:middle line:90%
Children need boundaries.

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:20.450 align:middle line:84%
They don't
intentionally destroy.

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:22.700 align:middle line:84%
They're just trying
to discover and learn.

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:26.750 align:middle line:84%
So they need their
elders to teach them

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:29.090 align:middle line:90%
proper boundaries and humility.

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:31.062 align:middle line:90%
That's all this is.

00:38:31.062 --> 00:38:34.970 align:middle line:84%
This story of our time, this old
story ending and this new story

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:39.350 align:middle line:84%
beginning is really the story
of a species coming of age

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:42.035 align:middle line:84%
and understanding our
highest human potential.

00:38:42.035 --> 00:38:44.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Pain comes
in various ways.

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:45.980 align:middle line:90%
Physical, emotional.

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:47.405 align:middle line:90%
Do you see it as a difference?

00:38:47.405 --> 00:38:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Pain is a
purification process.

00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:53.270 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a protein
within our body.

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
breathing exercise.

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:56.840 align:middle line:84%
A "Wim Hof Breathing"
actually found out--

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:57.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Good old Wim.

00:38:57.990 --> 00:39:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: He found that you
can do this hyperventilation

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.180 align:middle line:84%
and you decouple
the pain protein.

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:05.150 align:middle line:84%
So when you get in
an ice bath, you're

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:06.317 align:middle line:90%
not experiencing the pain.

00:39:06.317 --> 00:39:07.525 align:middle line:90%
You still feel the cold but--

00:39:07.525 --> 00:39:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You feel the
cold, but it doesn't hurt.

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.502 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: But it
doesn't hurt, which

00:39:10.502 --> 00:39:13.378 align:middle line:84%
is what makes the
edge so painful

00:39:13.378 --> 00:39:14.420 align:middle line:90%
that you want to get out.

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:16.867 align:middle line:84%
I think we don't
need that lesson,

00:39:16.867 --> 00:39:18.950 align:middle line:84%
because we're all going
to be in an ice bath soon.

00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:21.230 align:middle line:84%
We need that lesson,
because we need

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:24.080 align:middle line:84%
to understand that we're about
to experience a lot of pain.

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And not all of it
is physical pain.

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Some of it's going to be
emotional pain, spiritual pain.

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:31.040 align:middle line:84%
But pain is a
purification process.

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense,
karma, it's not just

00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:38.210 align:middle line:84%
this religious dogmatic
word that we use.

00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:40.250 align:middle line:84%
It's actually part
of source code.

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:44.090 align:middle line:90%
Karma is this teaching.

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:47.450 align:middle line:84%
It's a lesson that when
we do something in life,

00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:49.740 align:middle line:90%
it inscribes itself in our body.

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And if we didn't
learn the lesson now,

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:54.590 align:middle line:84%
it will hold onto
it for a later date.

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:56.520 align:middle line:90%
And that pain will come back up.

00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And if we breathe through
it and simply allow it,

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:01.580 align:middle line:84%
then pain will clear
the karmic debt.

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:04.080 align:middle line:84%
If we don't, the
karmic debt gets worse.

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:08.690 align:middle line:84%
So pain is intimately
linked with karma.

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why that's really
good to understand right now

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.480 align:middle line:84%
is because, as I
said, if we're going

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:18.020 align:middle line:84%
to watch as millions,
maybe billions,

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:21.590 align:middle line:84%
go without enough food and
go through mass migrations.

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:25.730 align:middle line:84%
We're going to experience that
pain anthro-ontologically.

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, we feel it
as if it's in living

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:30.650 align:middle line:90%
in truth inside of us.

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Where does
this all end for us, Ben?

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.910 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I don't
believe this ends.

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:37.820 align:middle line:84%
I think the old
story ends, but only

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:40.580 align:middle line:84%
as a catalyst to launch
us into the new story.

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:44.210 align:middle line:84%
I will say that the biggest
thing that's ending right now

00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:50.240 align:middle line:84%
is this false belief that
what we have built this very

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:53.810 align:middle line:84%
fragile system and
machine that we live in

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:55.230 align:middle line:90%
can make it any farther.

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:58.670 align:middle line:10%
The car's broke down, it's
dead on the side of the road,

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:02.360 align:middle line:10%
and the longer we hold on hope
that we can revive the engine,

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.790 align:middle line:10%
the longer we're going to
go without food and water

00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:07.680 align:middle line:10%
on the side of this road,
and it's going to get worse.

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:11.450 align:middle line:10%
The sooner that our future
generations are liberated

00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:14.570 align:middle line:10%
from educational systems
that indoctrinate them

00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:19.160 align:middle line:10%
into a system that grinds the
gears of a growth economy,

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:20.510 align:middle line:10%
the worse it's going to get.

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:24.470 align:middle line:84%
The sooner we make schools
more about meditation,

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:28.940 align:middle line:84%
community, the arts,
truly liberating ourselves

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:31.948 align:middle line:84%
from old confines,
then the ending

00:41:31.948 --> 00:41:33.365 align:middle line:84%
is going to be a
lot more painful.

00:41:33.365 --> 00:41:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief," Ben.

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.438 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: It is a pleasure
to be back, George.

00:41:37.438 --> 00:41:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Ben feels there's
a hope for humanity.

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:41.280 align:middle line:90%
And I believe that too.

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:46.720 align:middle line:90%
