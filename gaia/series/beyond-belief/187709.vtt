00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to another edition

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.500 align:middle line:84%
of "Beyond Belief" with
our guest, Grant Cameron.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.910 align:middle line:10%
He's been researching
UFOs since 1975.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.760 align:middle line:84%
He has studied all of
the US presidents' roles,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.360 align:middle line:84%
the roles of consciousness, and
the relationship between UFOs

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.310 align:middle line:90%
and other paranormal phenomena.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.630 align:middle line:84%
He has written six books, has
five more near completion.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.250 align:middle line:90%
You never stop, Grant.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GRANT CAMERON: I
try to stay busy.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.822 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're writing
five books at one time?

00:00:49.822 --> 00:00:52.280 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMERON: I just sort of let
things happen as they happen.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.810 align:middle line:10%
And for whatever
reason, this came out,

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.660 align:middle line:10%
there were so many things
happening at the same time.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That means five
more shows on our radio

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.550 align:middle line:90%
show "Coast to Coast."

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.342 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMERON: And some
interesting stuff that,

00:01:00.342 --> 00:01:03.800 align:middle line:10%
in terms of contact modalities,
in terms of things you talked

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.395 align:middle line:10%
about on your show that I have--

00:01:05.395 --> 00:01:06.770 align:middle line:10%
one of the books
I have coming up

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.130 align:middle line:10%
is "Contact Modalities" where
I say that, whether you're

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.750 align:middle line:10%
reading crystal
balls or tea leaves,

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.160 align:middle line:10%
or channeling, or doing remote
viewing, or UFO experiences,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.310 align:middle line:10%
it's all the same thing.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.230 align:middle line:84%
It's all this higher,
vibrating, frequency stuff.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.240 align:middle line:90%
And so I did a book on that.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And I was asked to do a
chapter in a book for somebody.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
to get it started,

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.710 align:middle line:84%
I'll just list the
contact modalities.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.577 align:middle line:84%
And I came by with 75
contact modalities.

00:01:32.577 --> 00:01:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might as
well write the book.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah,
that's when I said.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, just let's
put this out there.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And so to me, the
way I do it the books

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.543 align:middle line:84%
is that I have the research,
and it's just to record it.

00:01:40.543 --> 00:01:43.085 align:middle line:84%
Because as with
many researchers,

00:01:43.085 --> 00:01:44.960 align:middle line:84%
my family's not really
that interested in it.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.940 align:middle line:84%
My son has no
interest in at all.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And so what you want to do
is try to record everything

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.770 align:middle line:84%
that you've got so
that if you suddenly,

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.590 align:middle line:84%
like Stanton Friedman, you're in
an airport, and you suddenly--

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --keel over.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: --keel over,
you've got your stuff recorded

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.040 align:middle line:90%
for history.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Because I always
consider this, the UFO

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.920 align:middle line:84%
and the other paranormal
stuff, as the Super Bowl

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.030 align:middle line:90%
of all stories.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And I try to encourage
everybody who has a story

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.139 align:middle line:90%
to record it for your children.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Even if you don't
publish it, record it.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.388 align:middle line:84%
Because 500 years from now,
people are going to say,

00:02:13.388 --> 00:02:15.680 align:middle line:84%
man, those people were so
lucky they lived in that time

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.710 align:middle line:84%
when this was happening, and
they knew what was going on.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.540 align:middle line:84%
If you understand
the significance

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.060 align:middle line:84%
of what's going on, it is the
biggest story of all times.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.410 align:middle line:90%
And everybody, I think--

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.030 align:middle line:84%
whatever your story
is, you should

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.200 align:middle line:90%
be recording it for history.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.533 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would be more
fascinating than the uncover

00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:31.770 align:middle line:84%
the fact that we are not
alone in the universe?

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.070 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing story.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Yeah.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.557 align:middle line:84%
People are so busy in their
daily lives that they--

00:02:36.557 --> 00:02:38.390 align:middle line:84%
they're taking their
kid to soccer practice,

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.130 align:middle line:84%
and they're working,
and they're on freeways,

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.580 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.140 align:middle line:84%
They just don't have
time to think about it.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.790 align:middle line:84%
So because I always
had an opportunity

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.710 align:middle line:84%
to think about
this kind of stuff,

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.330 align:middle line:84%
I consider it to
be extremely lucky.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.668 align:middle line:84%
I try to say thank you
three times every day that I

00:02:50.668 --> 00:02:51.710 align:middle line:90%
got to play in this role.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Because I always
make this analogy

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.728 align:middle line:84%
that you could have been born
an untouchable in the streets

00:02:55.728 --> 00:02:58.430 align:middle line:84%
of Calcutta and spend your
days in a junkyard looking

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.077 align:middle line:84%
for something valuable enough
to sell for food for tomorrow.

00:03:01.077 --> 00:03:01.910 align:middle line:90%
You didn't get that.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.972 align:middle line:84%
You got to play in this
game, in the Super Bowl.

00:03:03.972 --> 00:03:05.180 align:middle line:90%
And you're not in the stands.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.170 align:middle line:90%
You're actually on the field.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.378 align:middle line:84%
You may be the water boy,
you may be the quarterback,

00:03:08.378 --> 00:03:11.030 align:middle line:84%
but you have some role that
you're playing in this thing.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And you should
take it seriously.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And as the Bible says, to much
is given, much is expected.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.320 align:middle line:84%
So because we're
in this game, you

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.030 align:middle line:84%
should take it
seriously and do all

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.978 align:middle line:84%
you can to take the
opportunity you were given

00:03:22.978 --> 00:03:24.020 align:middle line:90%
and do something with it.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.853 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:03:24.853 --> 00:03:27.450 align:middle line:84%
What got you interested in
the field of ufology, Grant?

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Well, and now we're
going to this contact modality

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.050 align:middle line:84%
thing, I was interested
in Edgar Cayce very young.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.850 align:middle line:84%
I was inter-- when
I was at university,

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.860 align:middle line:84%
I did a study on dying
people in hospitals.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.118 align:middle line:84%
So I had all these
bizarre questions about,

00:03:40.118 --> 00:03:41.660 align:middle line:84%
does anybody ever
have someone coming

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.285 align:middle line:84%
to visit them before they die to
lead them over the other side?

00:03:44.285 --> 00:03:45.965 align:middle line:84%
Does anybody ever
predict their death?

00:03:45.965 --> 00:03:47.340 align:middle line:84%
Are there near-death
experiences?

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.173 align:middle line:90%
This is in the '70s.

00:03:48.173 --> 00:03:50.240 align:middle line:84%
So this is when near-death
experiences first

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.545 align:middle line:90%
started coming out.

00:03:51.545 --> 00:03:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And I went to the
hospitals, and I talked not

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.270 align:middle line:84%
to the doctors and nurses;
I talked to the chaplains.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.397 align:middle line:84%
And the chaplains are
there when the people die.

00:03:58.397 --> 00:04:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And I would ask these
questions, does enable

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.798 align:middle line:84%
everybody to
predict their death?

00:04:01.798 --> 00:04:02.840 align:middle line:90%
And they'd say, oh, yeah.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.650 align:middle line:90%
And they would tell you stories.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And I went, wow, all
these stories are true.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.850 align:middle line:90%
So I had done that study.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.120 align:middle line:90%
I had no interest in UFOs.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And basically, what happened is,
there was a small town called

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Carman, Manitoba just north
of the American border that

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.770 align:middle line:84%
was having-- these
objects were being--

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:16.670 align:middle line:84%
they were claiming
they were seeing

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:17.930 align:middle line:90%
these things every night.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.118 align:middle line:84%
And so I just said
to my friend, well,

00:04:20.118 --> 00:04:21.660 align:middle line:84%
let's go see what
they're looking at.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.640 align:middle line:90%
I had no interest in UFOs.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.598 align:middle line:84%
I had never thought about
extraterrestrial life

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:26.120 align:middle line:90%
that I can think of.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And we went out, we
were there for an hour,

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.782 align:middle line:90%
and nothing really happened.

00:04:29.782 --> 00:04:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And my friend said, we'll drive
back into the town one more

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.840 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.010 align:middle line:84%
If nothing happens,
let's go home.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.950 align:middle line:90%
I said, fantastic.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.510 align:middle line:84%
This has been a
total waste of time.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.950 align:middle line:90%
And as we--

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Get me home.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: --drove back in, we
turned the car to go back in,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.077 align:middle line:84%
the thing appeared from
the left to the right.

00:04:42.077 --> 00:04:42.905 align:middle line:90%
It was down low.

00:04:42.905 --> 00:04:44.030 align:middle line:90%
It was in front of the car.

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.830 align:middle line:84%
It was not a light in
the sky it was an object,

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.540 align:middle line:84%
and it was pulsing, and
it was moving up and down.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Clearly not a plane.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, moving
very, very slowly.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.420 align:middle line:90%
And my life just changed.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.210 align:middle line:90%
I went, it's real.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.520 align:middle line:84%
It was my first
paranormal experience.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's fine to
hear somebody who

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.067 align:middle line:90%
has a paranormal experience.

00:04:58.067 --> 00:04:59.978 align:middle line:84%
When it happens to you,
it just sets you off.

00:04:59.978 --> 00:05:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you have that
feeling inside of you, like,

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.870 align:middle line:90%
oh, my god.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Oh, yeah,
I was just floored.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.942 align:middle line:84%
And then I went out
two nights later.

00:05:05.942 --> 00:05:07.850 align:middle line:84%
My friends, they weren't
all that interested.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.350 align:middle line:84%
But I said, come
on, let's go again.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.820 align:middle line:84%
The second night,
it came right at us.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.778 align:middle line:84%
And it was almost, like,
it was almost planned.

00:05:12.778 --> 00:05:13.611 align:middle line:90%
It came right at us.

00:05:13.611 --> 00:05:14.411 align:middle line:90%
And I was looking.

00:05:14.411 --> 00:05:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And then I remember, as
it turned and started

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.900 align:middle line:84%
flying into the
Northeast, I looked at it,

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.167 align:middle line:84%
and I was thinking,
what are they doing?

00:05:21.167 --> 00:05:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Because they were just
sort of flying along.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.390 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't make sense.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.510 align:middle line:90%
And I became obsessed.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:26.753 align:middle line:90%
And I published a book.

00:05:26.753 --> 00:05:28.670 align:middle line:84%
I went and interviewed
all people in the town,

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.090 align:middle line:84%
and nobody wanted
anything to do with it.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And the one woman said, you may
believe in this kind of stuff.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.390 align:middle line:84%
Count me among the unbelievers,
one of the publishers.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: And I went, whoa.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.700 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't believe it.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was mumbo jumbo.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: To me,
it was dramatic.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.735 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that
point that I said, well,

00:05:40.735 --> 00:05:43.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't really know what's going
on, but somebody in this world

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.902 align:middle line:84%
has got to know
what's going on here.

00:05:44.902 --> 00:05:46.548 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I
started this pursuit

00:05:46.548 --> 00:05:48.590 align:middle line:84%
to find the highest level
of people I could find.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.410 align:middle line:84%
So I chased the president
of United States,

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.610 align:middle line:90%
the Canadian government.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.422 align:middle line:84%
I chased the highest
intelligence people.

00:05:53.422 --> 00:05:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't really
interact with them,

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.340 align:middle line:84%
but I'd listen very carefully to
what these people were saying.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.863 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I
got into documents.

00:05:58.863 --> 00:05:59.780 align:middle line:90%
So I said, I started--

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because you're
known for the documents.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:02.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, yeah.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.162 align:middle line:84%
And I started the document thing
with the Canadian government.

00:06:06.162 --> 00:06:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Because most people don't know--
and that's one of the five

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.790 align:middle line:90%
books I've got coming up.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And I've had this stuff on my
website and stuff for years.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And then I said I'd
better put it in a book.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260 align:middle line:84%
My father worked for the
Department of Transport

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.310 align:middle line:90%
in Canada.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.273 align:middle line:84%
And the official flying
saucer investigation

00:06:20.273 --> 00:06:21.940 align:middle line:84%
was done by the
Department of Transport.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.310 align:middle line:90%
So this synchronicity happens.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.240 align:middle line:84%
Somebody in my
father's office comes.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.190 align:middle line:90%
He's got a sighting.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:28.720 align:middle line:84%
He tells me about this
and he says, you know,

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.610 align:middle line:84%
if you really want to know
what's going on with UFOs,

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:31.840 align:middle line:84%
you should study with
the Canadian government

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.380 align:middle line:90%
was studying in the 1950s.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:34.180 align:middle line:90%
And I said--

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.995 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bingo.

00:06:34.995 --> 00:06:37.120 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMERON: And then, he
said-- the guy was-- he was

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.370 align:middle line:10%
the most brilliant engineer.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.995 align:middle line:10%
His name was Wilbert Smith, most
brilliant engineer I ever met.

00:06:40.995 --> 00:06:42.287 align:middle line:10%
But this guy was totally crazy.

00:06:42.287 --> 00:06:43.460 align:middle line:10%
He was talking to aliens.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.260 align:middle line:90%
They were landing.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm going what, what, what?

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:46.570 align:middle line:90%
And I was, like--

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.693 align:middle line:90%
so I was still very young.

00:06:48.693 --> 00:06:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And I actually got
a plane ticket,

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.862 align:middle line:84%
and I flew to Ottawa to
talk to Wilbur Smith's wife.

00:06:52.862 --> 00:06:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, she
started to confirm this.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.107 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we opened a landing
base for UFOs to land.

00:06:57.107 --> 00:06:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And she was telling
me all this stuff.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:06:58.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.918 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And the Prime
Minister was involved.

00:07:00.918 --> 00:07:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, like,
wow, I was just floored.

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.060 align:middle line:90%
So I went after his files.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.917 align:middle line:84%
Those are the first files I
got was Wilbur Smith's files.

00:07:07.917 --> 00:07:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And the late Stanton
Friedman was actually the guy

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.697 align:middle line:90%
that forced them out in 1978.

00:07:11.697 --> 00:07:12.780 align:middle line:90%
So that's when it started.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:13.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was Canadian too.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Yeah.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And he had forced-- they'd
forced these documents out.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.610 align:middle line:84%
The Canadians released
all the documents.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw the
documents, that's

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.920 align:middle line:84%
when we discovered the famous
top-secret memo, which I think

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.260 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
significant documents ever.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is the one where
Wilbur Smith is negotiating

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.307 align:middle line:84%
with the Americans
on FM frequencies

00:07:31.307 --> 00:07:32.890 align:middle line:84%
because he was the
head radio engineer

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.250 align:middle line:90%
for the Canadian government.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.500 align:middle line:90%
He's negotiating.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.290 align:middle line:90%
And he's interested in UFOs.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And so he says to the Americans,
like, so what's going on?

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.400 align:middle line:90%
And he's basically read in.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.940 align:middle line:84%
He's given stuff and material
starts coming to Canada.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.790 align:middle line:10%
And he writes this memo
in November of 1950

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.610 align:middle line:10%
in which he says, I
made discreet inquiries

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.650 align:middle line:10%
to the Canadian
embassy in Washington.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:56.778 align:middle line:10%
And what I was told was, number
one, flying saucers exist.

00:07:56.778 --> 00:07:59.320 align:middle line:10%
It's the most highly classified
subject in the United States.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.535 align:middle line:10%
It's of tremendous
significance to the Americans.

00:08:01.535 --> 00:08:03.160 align:middle line:10%
And there's a small
group headed by Dr.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.460 align:middle line:10%
Vannevar Bush trying to figure
out the modus operandi and were

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.490 align:middle line:10%
also told by American
officials-- this is 1950--

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:10.990 align:middle line:10%
were also told by
American officials

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.850 align:middle line:10%
that other things
might be associated

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:15.640 align:middle line:10%
with the flying saucers,
such as mental phenomena.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And the Americans
aren't doing very well

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.750 align:middle line:84%
because they've said we're
working on this problem.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:22.420 align:middle line:84%
They're willing to exchange
credentials and talk

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:23.470 align:middle line:90%
to us about this.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.390 align:middle line:90%
So I gathered all that material.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And then, in the early
1980s, Wilbur Smith,

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.636 align:middle line:84%
when he was about
to die, he realized

00:08:30.636 --> 00:08:32.344 align:middle line:84%
his files were going
to-- they were going

00:08:32.344 --> 00:08:33.511 align:middle line:90%
to try to recover his files.

00:08:33.511 --> 00:08:35.500 align:middle line:84%
So he told his wife,
he said, they're

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.500 align:middle line:84%
going to come and try to get
my files, his private files.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.120 align:middle line:84%
He said, when they
come, I don't care

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.220 align:middle line:84%
who it is, you do not
give them the files.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.320 align:middle line:84%
She said, the Americans
came, the Russians came,

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.280 align:middle line:90%
and the Canadians came.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And they all asked for the
files for research purposes.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.805 align:middle line:84%
She said she had
destroyed the files.

00:08:49.805 --> 00:08:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Actually, they had moved them
to the oldest son's house--

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:52.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --and hid them

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:53.953 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: --and hid them.

00:08:53.953 --> 00:08:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And in the 1980s, then
those files came out.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And then we discovered
documents like what

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.100 align:middle line:90%
we call the embassy documents.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
actual correspondence

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:03.850 align:middle line:84%
through the Canadian
Embassy in Washington

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:06.070 align:middle line:84%
where Wilbur is talking
to the second secretary

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:07.300 align:middle line:90%
of the Canadian embassy.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And the Canadian embassy is
waiting for the Americans

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:12.530 align:middle line:84%
to make a statement because they
realize there's been a crash.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:13.990 align:middle line:84%
They realize
something's happened.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And they're waiting for the
Americans to make a statement.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And the Smith files were
called Project Magnet.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:20.390 align:middle line:90%
That was the official project.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:20.845 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Magnet?

00:09:20.845 --> 00:09:21.645 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Magnet.

00:09:21.645 --> 00:09:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
documents actually

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.680 align:middle line:84%
said, please do not
destroy these files

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.335 align:middle line:90%
until the subject cools off.

00:09:28.335 --> 00:09:29.710 align:middle line:84%
So you actually
had this document

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:31.270 align:middle line:84%
where they were going
to destroy the files,

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:33.020 align:middle line:84%
and I guess it slipped
through the cracks.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.080 align:middle line:84%
So this top secret
memo leaked out.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I went from
there to trying

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:39.490 align:middle line:84%
to find out who in
the United States

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:42.398 align:middle line:84%
had given Wilbur Smith these
documents or briefed him.

00:09:42.398 --> 00:09:44.440 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to figure
who the American sideways.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.898 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I came across
this former president of Penn

00:09:46.898 --> 00:09:49.450 align:middle line:84%
State University, 14
honorary doctorate degrees,

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:53.260 align:middle line:84%
friends of President Eisenhower,
the co-developer of the homing

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:54.160 align:middle line:90%
torpedo--

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.210 align:middle line:84%
very high level guy
who basically confirms,

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.060 align:middle line:90%
yeah, MJ-12 is for real.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.410 align:middle line:90%
You're up against the windmills.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:00.370 align:middle line:90%
Leave it alone.

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:02.410 align:middle line:90%
I start going after his files.

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And I went to Penn
State University.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.540 align:middle line:84%
I spent a couple of
weeks there looking

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.540 align:middle line:84%
through hundreds of
thousands of pages of files.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:08.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They gave you access?

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:09.190 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Yeah.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.648 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking for it because
we knew he had a file on us.

00:10:11.648 --> 00:10:13.870 align:middle line:84%
He was dealing with various
researchers sending them

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:15.890 align:middle line:84%
little quips and
stuff like that.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.140 align:middle line:90%
We were looking for this file.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.160 align:middle line:90%
I never did find a file.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.250 align:middle line:84%
But he said that his
files from 195o-- and this

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:23.890 align:middle line:84%
is when Wilbur Smith was
dealing with the Canadians, who

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.335 align:middle line:90%
had gone the Truman Library.

00:10:25.335 --> 00:10:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I went
to the Truman Library,

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.580 align:middle line:84%
and I said to them, what
have you got on UFOs?

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they said,
well, we don't have that much.

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.170 align:middle line:90%
We have all the--

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.650 align:middle line:84%
in 1952, there was the
overflight of Washington, DC.

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:38.650 align:middle line:90%
And they were going to--

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It goes
all over the place,

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.858 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And the first week,
there was this shootdown order.

00:10:42.858 --> 00:10:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was across all the
newspapers the United States.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:46.567 align:middle line:84%
And so all these
telegrams started

00:10:46.567 --> 00:10:48.600 align:middle line:84%
coming into the White
House to say, please

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.290 align:middle line:90%
don't shoot them down.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And there was even a story
told by Frank Edwards

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.790 align:middle line:84%
who was the big
broadcaster in the 1950s.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And he had stated that
Einstein had actually

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.510 align:middle line:84%
gone to the president during
that one week, the shootdown

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.880 align:middle line:84%
order, and said Mr.
President, anybody

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.310 align:middle line:84%
who can come across
millions of miles of space

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.160 align:middle line:84%
will know how to take care of
themselves once they get here.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.630 align:middle line:84%
Please don't start
something you--

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:10.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was right,

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:10.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: --you can't finish.

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:12.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was right.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And so
when I got there,

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:16.820 align:middle line:84%
they gave me all
these telegrams.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm thinking,
this is kind of strange.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:21.330 align:middle line:84%
You figure, this is the most
important subject in the world.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:22.680 align:middle line:84%
The president's got to
know what's going on.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.138 align:middle line:84%
And there was really
nothing there.

00:11:24.138 --> 00:11:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And then just down the road,
maybe a couple hours down

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:30.220 align:middle line:84%
the road in Kansas, was
the Abilene, Kansas--

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.670 align:middle line:84%
Kansas was where the
Eisenhower files were.

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.440 align:middle line:84%
So I went to the
Eisenhower Library.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And it was there where
it's very formal.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.238 align:middle line:84%
All have all the archives
have ties and stuff.

00:11:39.238 --> 00:11:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And I went there, and you
have to do an interview

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.090 align:middle line:90%
to do research.

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:44.130 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, I'm
looking for UFO stuff.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:45.690 align:middle line:90%
And they pulled five documents.

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:49.000 align:middle line:84%
One was the famous Robertson
Panel CIA report was in there.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.800 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:50.130 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: --four other
telegrams, just minor stuff.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, how many
pages have you got here?

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.388 align:middle line:90%
And he said 28 million, I think.

00:11:56.388 --> 00:11:57.680 align:middle line:90%
And you've got five documents--

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.315 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 28 million total pages?

00:11:59.315 --> 00:12:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Pages
in the archives.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
suddenly decided,

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:03.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go to all
the presidential libraries

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:05.250 align:middle line:84%
because the president's
got to know.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:06.360 align:middle line:90%
So I made this pursuit.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.257 align:middle line:84%
So then I went, I got
the Roosevelt files,

00:12:08.257 --> 00:12:10.590 align:middle line:84%
everything that was in the
Roosevelt Library, everything

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:11.680 align:middle line:84%
that was in the
Truman Library the--

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, you went wild.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.062 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, I
went to everybody.

00:12:14.062 --> 00:12:15.270 align:middle line:90%
I got them all.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I hit paydirt
with the Clintons.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And so I was filing
with the Clintons

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:21.555 align:middle line:90%
before they left office.

00:12:21.555 --> 00:12:24.840 align:middle line:84%
There is one agency that
has to answer FOIAs.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.820 align:middle line:84%
That's the science
advisor to the president.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, if there's an
obvious cover up going on,

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:32.855 align:middle line:90%
Grant-- let's take a look, yeah.

00:12:32.855 --> 00:12:36.180 align:middle line:10%
>>RICHARD DOLAN: When we start
getting into the upper, highest

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:41.970 align:middle line:10%
level echelon of the cover
up of the UFO phenomenon,

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.620 align:middle line:10%
I still feel that I
need to be careful,

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.060 align:middle line:10%
and researchers
need to be careful.

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.780 align:middle line:10%
Who is the actual
person at the top of it?

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.010 align:middle line:10%
Is it David Rockefeller?

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:52.680 align:middle line:10%
Is it some member of
the Rothschild family?

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.625 align:middle line:10%
Is it some member that
we don't know about

00:12:54.625 --> 00:12:56.250 align:middle line:10%
within the deep black
budget community?

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:59.070 align:middle line:10%
Or is it the aliens themselves
in one form or another?

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.200 align:middle line:10%
I guess we can ask
ourselves, what

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.200 align:middle line:10%
is the likelihood that the
non-human intelligences that

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.740 align:middle line:10%
are behind the UFO phenomenon
are managing the cover up

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:08.673 align:middle line:10%
to some extent?

00:13:08.673 --> 00:13:10.090 align:middle line:10%
I think we could
say a few things.

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:14.630 align:middle line:10%
One, we can say they do not have
an interest in being out there

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:16.110 align:middle line:10%
and being publicly acknowledged.

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:17.940 align:middle line:10%
They do operate by stealth.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.610 align:middle line:10%
I think they've always
operated by stealth.

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:25.920 align:middle line:10%
So they have an interest in
maintaining a cover-up secrecy.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.740 align:middle line:10%
Toward that end,
if I were tasked

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.830 align:middle line:10%
with doing counterintelligence
on the cover up,

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:33.690 align:middle line:10%
I would have to
consider the likelihood

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:38.070 align:middle line:10%
that they, themselves, have some
role to play in the secrecy.

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was Richard
Dolan on the Gaia series "Deep

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.250 align:middle line:90%
Space."

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:42.510 align:middle line:90%
Something's going on.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:43.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Yeah.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:46.527 align:middle line:84%
I believe that both the
government and the intelligence

00:13:46.527 --> 00:13:47.610 align:middle line:90%
are playing the same game.

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:49.627 align:middle line:84%
I say there's not
a direct cover up.

00:13:49.627 --> 00:13:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Because if there is
a direct cover up,

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:52.460 align:middle line:90%
they do what the Canadians do.

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm a Canadian,
I get asked all the time,

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:55.630 align:middle line:84%
so what's the Canadian
government doing?

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, I haven't
got the foggiest notion what

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.068 align:middle line:90%
the Canadian government does.

00:13:59.068 --> 00:14:01.480 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea because the
Canadians don't talk about it.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.560 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going to cover it
up, you stop talking about it.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:04.590 align:middle line:90%
You don't leak documents.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:06.882 align:middle line:84%
You don't have people talking
about this kind of stuff.

00:14:06.882 --> 00:14:07.950 align:middle line:90%
You just be quiet.

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to
disclose, then you

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:12.750 align:middle line:84%
stand the president or
the CIA director up,

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:13.770 align:middle line:84%
and you tell people
what's going on.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.570 align:middle line:84%
So they're not covering up,
and they're not disclosing.

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:17.112 align:middle line:84%
The same thing with
the intelligence.

00:14:17.112 --> 00:14:19.800 align:middle line:84%
If the intelligence-- if
they say it in the abduction

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.250 align:middle line:84%
scenario, if they want to cloak
themselves, nobody sees them.

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:24.450 align:middle line:90%
So they're not covering up.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:26.370 align:middle line:90%
They could not be seen.

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:28.230 align:middle line:84%
But they're allowing
themselves to be seen,

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:31.570 align:middle line:84%
but they're doing the same
thing, not covering up and not

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:32.370 align:middle line:90%
disclosing.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:33.840 align:middle line:84%
But they are giving
little hints.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.340 align:middle line:84%
People are getting
ideas in their heads,

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.620 align:middle line:84%
these experiencers, they're
given messages and stuff.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.030 align:middle line:84%
So I think both sides
are doing the same thing.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.280 align:middle line:84%
They're doing this gradual
disclosure, which goes back

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.700 align:middle line:84%
to this study that was done
in 1960 that said, if we are

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.960 align:middle line:84%
facing this phenomena, we
have to gradually release it

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:47.760 align:middle line:90%
to the people.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.070 align:middle line:84%
You can't just drop it
on the people in one day.

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.320 align:middle line:84%
So I think both are doing
the same sort of thing

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.120 align:middle line:84%
where it's almost like
the breadcrumb thing

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.400 align:middle line:84%
where they're leading us
slowly through this process

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.540 align:middle line:90%
of acclimatized.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On purpose,
or by necessity?

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Well, I think,
in everything in government,

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.123 align:middle line:84%
they will have all
sorts of scenarios.

00:15:03.123 --> 00:15:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And to give you the
idea, a couple of years

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:07.460 align:middle line:84%
back, Paul Hellyer
told the story.

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.260 align:middle line:90%
He was asked--

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Canadian
defense minister.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: --defense
minister who--

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:12.397 align:middle line:84%
my father actually
flew him around

00:15:12.397 --> 00:15:14.030 align:middle line:84%
because he was in
the same department.

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:15.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was he under Trudeau?

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yes, he
was under Trudeau.

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:18.613 align:middle line:84%
He was asked, well, who
in the Canadian government

00:15:18.613 --> 00:15:20.130 align:middle line:90%
is in charge?

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
maybe the privy council.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:23.130 align:middle line:90%
And he started guessing.

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.050 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't really know
because he really didn't know.

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:26.370 align:middle line:84%
He told me, clearly,
he didn't know

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:27.240 align:middle line:90%
when he was defense minister.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:27.810 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't interested.

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:28.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He should have known.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:29.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, but he didn't--

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:31.890 align:middle line:84%
stuff that's come across his
desk, he didn't pay attention.

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And then, when the second
round of questions comes,

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.030 align:middle line:84%
he says, you know, I know
somebody who does know.

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:38.340 align:middle line:84%
He says, I was contacted
by an Air Force guy,

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.520 align:middle line:90%
and he said there's a guy here.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.950 align:middle line:84%
He ran the emergency
measures for Canada.

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:46.665 align:middle line:84%
So if there is a nuclear
attack, or if there's a war,

00:15:46.665 --> 00:15:48.690 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, you have
the emergency-- like,

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:49.720 align:middle line:90%
here, it's FEMA.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.363 align:middle line:84%
So you have this agency that
has to put money in banks,

00:15:52.363 --> 00:15:54.030 align:middle line:84%
and they have to do
all these-- and they

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:55.440 align:middle line:90%
will have all these scenarios.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.690 align:middle line:90%
What do we do if this happens?

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And not that anything
is going to happen.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.485 align:middle line:84%
So he was told that
this guy was dying,

00:16:00.485 --> 00:16:02.735 align:middle line:84%
and he had something that
he had to get off his chest.

00:16:02.735 --> 00:16:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And he had decided Paul Hellyer
was the guy he wanted to tell.

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:07.440 align:middle line:90%
He was dying of ALS.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.910 align:middle line:90%
And so Paul didn't do anything.

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And the guy phoned
him back, and he said,

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:11.505 align:middle line:84%
you know, he's about
to go off the cliff,

00:16:11.505 --> 00:16:12.630 align:middle line:90%
you better talk to him.

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:14.850 align:middle line:84%
So Paul said he phones up
this guy, head of Emergency

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:16.470 align:middle line:90%
Management from Canada.

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And the guy says, I just want to
let you know it's all for real.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:21.450 align:middle line:90%
I was brought to the CIA.

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:22.680 align:middle line:90%
I signed my life away.

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:23.730 align:middle line:90%
I was given a briefing.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:25.125 align:middle line:90%
I was told this is for real.

00:16:25.125 --> 00:16:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And I was actually at
Area 51, and I actually

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.680 align:middle line:90%
sat inside one of the crafts.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sheesh.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:30.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And I just
want you to know this.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.720 align:middle line:90%
And that would make sense that--

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.580 align:middle line:90%
see, I see--

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing, Grant.

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:34.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: --as doing their
job that people in government--

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:36.210 align:middle line:84%
because I was in
government myself--

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:37.260 align:middle line:90%
that, you just do your job.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.420 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what the
next guy's doing, but you--

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're,
like, segments, right?

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.222 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And they
have their thing.

00:16:42.222 --> 00:16:45.623 align:middle line:84%
So in these scenarios of
Emergency Management or FEMA

00:16:45.623 --> 00:16:47.040 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, there
are going to be

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.080 align:middle line:84%
all sorts of people making
policies and trying to figure

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.320 align:middle line:90%
out this sort of stuff.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it's haphazard.

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:53.580 align:middle line:84%
I think they spend a
lot of money on this.

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And that goes back
to the documents

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:59.940 align:middle line:84%
from the 1980s, which have now
been confirmed in this latest

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.010 align:middle line:90%
leak was that MJ-12 is for real.

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:03.650 align:middle line:84%
That, there is a
group called MJ-12

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:06.210 align:middle line:84%
and a group that was put
in charge of this thing

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:07.470 align:middle line:90%
to control the thing.

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:09.202 align:middle line:84%
And that would make
sense in a government

00:17:09.202 --> 00:17:10.619 align:middle line:84%
where everybody's
doing their job,

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:12.494 align:middle line:84%
everybody's trying to
do it constitutionally,

00:17:12.494 --> 00:17:14.500 align:middle line:84%
everybody's trying to
solve the problems.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:15.750 align:middle line:90%
You would organize this stuff.

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:18.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't really believe so
much in rogue government.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.942 align:middle line:84%
I believe a lot of
it is constitutional.

00:17:19.942 --> 00:17:21.900 align:middle line:84%
It's just that people
don't know because you're

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.170 align:middle line:90%
so limited in what you know.

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And that was my experience
in government working

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.869 align:middle line:84%
at a university is that I had
the keys to the president's

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:30.540 align:middle line:84%
office, eight vice president's
office, human resources.

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:31.815 align:middle line:90%
I had keys to everything.

00:17:31.815 --> 00:17:32.940 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know was going on.

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.395 align:middle line:90%
I only knew my little job.

00:17:34.395 --> 00:17:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of all
the documents you

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:38.770 align:middle line:84%
have uncovered, based on
ufology, what are some

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:40.640 align:middle line:90%
of the most significant ones?

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: OK.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.210 align:middle line:10%
The top secret memo
would be the top one,

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:46.790 align:middle line:10%
the Canadian one that basically
says flying saucers are real.

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:47.950 align:middle line:10%
And that was a top secret--

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:48.700 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.100 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMERON: --document that the
Canadian government does not

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:51.900 align:middle line:10%
deny.

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.330 align:middle line:10%
It's in the archives.

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:54.130 align:middle line:90%
There was that one.

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:55.360 align:middle line:84%
There were a couple
of surprises when

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.590 align:middle line:90%
I was at the Reagan Library.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:59.063 align:middle line:84%
I was I was looking to
see, why did Reagan put

00:17:59.063 --> 00:18:00.355 align:middle line:90%
all this stuff in his speeches?

00:18:00.355 --> 00:18:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Because I knew m, like
everything else in government,

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:05.470 align:middle line:90%
everything is done to the max.

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:07.030 align:middle line:84%
Like, a State of
the Union address

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:09.280 align:middle line:90%
will have 30 different drafts.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.930 align:middle line:84%
It'll have 25
different agencies that

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:13.630 align:middle line:84%
have to sign off on every
little every word that is said.

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:14.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everything he says.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And so I
was trying figure out,

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.670 align:middle line:84%
why did Reagan put all this
UFO stuff in his speeches?

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:19.010 align:middle line:90%
He was always talking about it.

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:20.650 align:middle line:90%
And so I was looking.

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's five minutes
before the archives closed.

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:24.650 align:middle line:84%
I said to her, is this
Ronald Reagan's handwriting?

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:25.450 align:middle line:90%
She says no.

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:27.250 align:middle line:84%
She flipped, flipped, flips,
flips through these pages,

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:27.730 align:middle line:90%
and she points.

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:29.170 align:middle line:84%
She says that's
his writing there.

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's him--

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And it
was Ronald Reagan.

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.160 align:middle line:84%
What had happened, when he made
the famous speech at the United

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.912 align:middle line:84%
Nations talking about
the alien invasion.

00:18:34.912 --> 00:18:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
happen if the world--

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:37.537 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: We'd unite.

00:18:37.537 --> 00:18:39.940 align:middle line:84%
It was him talking about
it in his handwriting.

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:42.742 align:middle line:84%
And what had happened is,
he put it in the speech,

00:18:42.742 --> 00:18:43.700 align:middle line:90%
and they pulled it out.

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.010 align:middle line:90%
The speechwriter pulled it out.

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:45.786 align:middle line:90%
And he said, oh.

00:18:45.786 --> 00:18:45.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He put it in.

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:47.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Oh, about my fantasy.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Could you please put it how we
would be united if creatures

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:51.640 align:middle line:90%
from another planet.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.432 align:middle line:84%
Could you please put
it back in the speech?

00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:54.280 align:middle line:90%
I was just floored.

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.407 align:middle line:90%
Here it was, this document.

00:18:56.407 --> 00:18:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And then, I guess the
Rockefeller initiative

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:58.870 align:middle line:90%
documents--

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Bruce Maccabee it
filed for them.

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:01.600 align:middle line:90%
And I heard you got 500 pages.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.095 align:middle line:90%
And I went, oh, so I filed.

00:19:03.095 --> 00:19:03.895 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 500 pages?

00:19:03.895 --> 00:19:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: I got 1,000.

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:05.530 align:middle line:90%
And I got 1,000.

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:06.613 align:middle line:90%
When I filed, I got 1,000.

00:19:06.613 --> 00:19:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All UFOs?

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.313 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: All UFOs.

00:19:08.313 --> 00:19:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And this was this exchange
that Rockefeller had said,

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:12.910 align:middle line:84%
whether Perot wins
or whether Bush wins

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:15.520 align:middle line:84%
or whether Clinton wins,
I'm going in there,

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.130 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to get the
president to disclose.

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And I remember Bud Hopkins
telling me, he said to him,

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:24.583 align:middle line:84%
you know, Lawrence, I don't
think that's how it works.

00:19:24.583 --> 00:19:25.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do it, he said.

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:26.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing it.

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:26.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm going in there.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And the president's
going to disclose.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And so he went in, and because
he was a very powerful guy,

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.542 align:middle line:84%
the White House had
to deal with him.

00:19:32.542 --> 00:19:34.630 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't allow him
to get to the president,

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:36.713 align:middle line:84%
because there's always
this plausible deniability.

00:19:36.713 --> 00:19:38.430 align:middle line:90%
The president doesn't know.

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And some of them don't.

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, well, they
may not because they're not

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.240 align:middle line:90%
interested in it.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:47.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would say Nixon knew,
Reagan knew, Clinton probably

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.880 align:middle line:90%
knew.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure Carter knew.

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:51.640 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:52.685 align:middle line:90%
Or Gerald Ford?

00:19:52.685 --> 00:19:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Well, we looked at
the Holloman Air Force Base

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.378 align:middle line:84%
film, and we determined
that three of them

00:19:57.378 --> 00:19:59.170 align:middle line:84%
had actually seen this
film of this landing

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:00.295 align:middle line:90%
at Holloman Air Force Base.

00:20:00.295 --> 00:20:04.480 align:middle line:10%
And that was Ford, Bush
Sr. and there's a rumor

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:07.690 align:middle line:10%
that Jimmy Carter had been
shown this film as well.

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:09.233 align:middle line:84%
I still think it's
constitutional

00:20:09.233 --> 00:20:11.650 align:middle line:84%
that people are going to-- if
the president wants to know,

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:12.850 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing they
can do to stop him.

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:15.100 align:middle line:84%
If the president wants
documents, and he's interested,

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:16.450 align:middle line:90%
he can he can get the documents.

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:18.130 align:middle line:84%
But what happened with
Rockefeller is he went in.

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:19.670 align:middle line:84%
So they kept him away
from the president.

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:21.700 align:middle line:84%
This is very interesting because
it involves Hillary Clinton.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:23.325 align:middle line:84%
So he went in there,
and he was dealing

00:20:23.325 --> 00:20:24.413 align:middle line:90%
with the science advisor.

00:20:24.413 --> 00:20:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And the science advisor actually
asked for a UFO briefing.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:29.205 align:middle line:84%
And it goes to the CIA to a
guy by the name of Dr. Ronald

00:20:29.205 --> 00:20:30.130 align:middle line:90%
Pandolfi.

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And Pandolfi, the
CIA is not involved.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.320 align:middle line:84%
So he gives it to Bruce
Maccabee to do the briefing.

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.612 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's no longer a briefing.

00:20:36.612 --> 00:20:39.080 align:middle line:84%
It's just a citizen's
opinion of what's going on.

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And so this 1,000
pages is Rockefeller,

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:44.688 align:middle line:84%
back and forth with Rockefeller
and the science advisor.

00:20:44.688 --> 00:20:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying to--
and every time they

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.467 align:middle line:84%
would try to stonewall
him, he'd say,

00:20:48.467 --> 00:20:50.800 align:middle line:84%
OK, I think it's time to send
a letter to the president.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And so in this 1,000
pages of documents,

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.370 align:middle line:84%
you have this letter that
he's always threatening

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:55.412 align:middle line:90%
to send to the president.

00:20:55.412 --> 00:20:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And one of the two most
significant documents

00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:59.740 align:middle line:84%
in the Rockefeller initiative
were two Hillary Clinton

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.420 align:middle line:90%
documents that nobody noticed.

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:03.392 align:middle line:10%
And one was that
he would give it

00:21:03.392 --> 00:21:04.600 align:middle line:10%
to, say, the science advisor.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.580 align:middle line:10%
He would say, I'm
sending this letter

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:09.340 align:middle line:10%
to the president
demanding UFO disclosure.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.692 align:middle line:90%
And people would help him edit--

00:21:10.692 --> 00:21:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Hillary Clinton was
one of the people who

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.510 align:middle line:90%
helped him edit the letter--

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.770 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this was when
she was the First Lady?

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:16.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: For the first lady.

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.190 align:middle line:90%
And that was the one document.

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:20.732 align:middle line:84%
The other document that was very
significant in this exchange

00:21:20.732 --> 00:21:24.010 align:middle line:84%
was that all the material going
from Rockefeller to the science

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:26.230 align:middle line:84%
advisor, from their science
goes back to Rockefeller,

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:27.772 align:middle line:84%
was going to the
First Lady's office.

00:21:27.772 --> 00:21:29.772 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't figure
out, like, why would it be

00:21:29.772 --> 00:21:31.180 align:middle line:90%
going through Hillary's office?

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And then it suddenly
occurred to me.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.507 align:middle line:84%
It was this plausible
deniability to the president.

00:21:34.507 --> 00:21:36.340 align:middle line:84%
So the president doesn't
know, Bill Clinton,

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:37.923 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's
going on whatever.

00:21:37.923 --> 00:21:39.610 align:middle line:84%
So that stuff goes,
it goes to Hillary,

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:41.230 align:middle line:84%
and at night, Hillary
goes to Bill and says,

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:42.100 align:middle line:90%
OK, this is what's happening.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.270 align:middle line:90%
Rockefeller says this.

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And it goes, and you have
this plausible deniability.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.390 align:middle line:90%
It's coming through Hillary.

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:48.430 align:middle line:84%
So that's why all the material
is going through Hillary

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:49.310 align:middle line:90%
Clinton's office.

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:51.610 align:middle line:84%
She was deeply involved
in this initiative.

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Here's a CNN interview
grant with Edgar Mitchell.

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:58.150 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, we talk so much
about the Roswell findings,

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:00.970 align:middle line:10%
what's there, what wasn't there,
the secrecy surrounding that.

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:04.300 align:middle line:10%
But from your studies
of astrophysics,

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.790 align:middle line:10%
from being an astronaut,
from going to the moon,

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:09.310 align:middle line:10%
from studying the
pictures of the galaxy,

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:11.170 align:middle line:10%
tell me something
that you've seen

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:14.080 align:middle line:10%
or that you've studied that
you just feel in your gut,

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.258 align:middle line:10%
there is something
else out there.

00:22:17.258 --> 00:22:19.300 align:middle line:10%
>>EDGAR MITCHELL: Well,
you were saying it right.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.610 align:middle line:10%
It's an intuitive feeling.

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:24.970 align:middle line:10%
Looking at the heavens and the
modern pictures of the Hubble

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:27.220 align:middle line:10%
telescope, from the
Hubble telescope,

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.410 align:middle line:10%
and seeing the
complexities and the beauty

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:33.280 align:middle line:10%
and recognizing the universe
is much more complex

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:37.210 align:middle line:10%
and magnificent than
our earlier pictures,

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:41.800 align:middle line:10%
our earlier understanding
would have ever let us imagine.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:46.010 align:middle line:10%
And so you're right, that's
the intuitive aspect of it.

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:49.750 align:middle line:10%
But the real question here
that we've been addressing

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:50.950 align:middle line:10%
is have we been visited?

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:55.630 align:middle line:10%
Are we, since we are now a
spacefaring civilization,

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.090 align:middle line:10%
having only gone
to our own moon,

00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:02.050 align:middle line:10%
but have our visitors, the
aliens, have they come to us?

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:03.640 align:middle line:10%
And all the evidence says yes.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:07.470 align:middle line:10%
>> So what is it that you want
to see the Obama administration

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:08.270 align:middle line:10%
release?

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:09.730 align:middle line:10%
What is it specifically?

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:12.520 align:middle line:10%
What do you think is
there that we need to see?

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:15.560 align:middle line:10%
>>MITCHELL: Well, was
the other nations--

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.530 align:middle line:10%
and this has been a
global phenomenon.

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:20.350 align:middle line:10%
Other nations and,
just in recent history,

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:25.180 align:middle line:10%
the Belgian nation, the French,
the Brazilians, the Holloman

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:29.223 align:middle line:10%
the Argentines, all of their
files have been opened up.

00:23:29.223 --> 00:23:30.640 align:middle line:10%
And there's no
reason in the world

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.520 align:middle line:10%
why the US files,
the leading nation

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.560 align:middle line:10%
in the world in
this period, should

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.840 align:middle line:10%
have been reticent
to opening theirs too

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.210 align:middle line:10%
except special interest groups.

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:43.330 align:middle line:10%
>> So let me ask you, for all
the stories that have leaked

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:45.000 align:middle line:10%
over all the years--

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.630 align:middle line:10%
and there's always
somebody somewhere

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:47.922 align:middle line:10%
that's going to leak something.

00:23:47.922 --> 00:23:49.780 align:middle line:10%
And if there was
really something there,

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:51.850 align:middle line:10%
don't you think,
by now, somebody

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:53.350 align:middle line:10%
would have said something?

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:54.310 align:middle line:10%
>>MITCHELL: Oh, it has.

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:56.230 align:middle line:10%
People been saying it all along.

00:23:56.230 --> 00:24:01.220 align:middle line:10%
But for example, just the
explanation for the Roswell

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.010 align:middle line:10%
incident has changed
every few years,

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:04.630 align:middle line:10%
and a new story comes out.

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:08.830 align:middle line:10%
If it were really that
simple, if it weren't what

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:11.740 align:middle line:10%
it really was, it wouldn't need
all of these various stories

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:12.700 align:middle line:10%
coming out.

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:17.230 align:middle line:10%
And so the attempt to cover this
up and to disguise the issue

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:20.440 align:middle line:10%
and create misinformation
and disinformation

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.970 align:middle line:10%
is very well recorded.

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:25.150 align:middle line:10%
And the documentation from
very fine researchers,

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:28.690 align:middle line:10%
like Dr. Robert Wood
and his son Ryan

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:32.320 align:middle line:10%
who've investigated all
of the early documents,

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.210 align:middle line:10%
all point to the same story.

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:36.250 align:middle line:10%
Hey, we're not alone here.

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:37.805 align:middle line:10%
We've been visited.

00:24:37.805 --> 00:24:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think one of the
most dramatic cases, the fact

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:42.290 align:middle line:84%
that an astronaut would
go public like this.

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:43.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Yeah.

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And I became involved just
in the last eight months

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:49.480 align:middle line:84%
in the Edgar Mitchell
story in that--

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How so?

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: This is
the idea when I first

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:53.733 align:middle line:84%
started was that there
are people who have better

00:24:53.733 --> 00:24:55.150 align:middle line:84%
access to the
information than you

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:56.560 align:middle line:90%
or I. They were in intelligence.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.490 align:middle line:84%
They worked on UFOs
for a little bit.

00:24:58.490 --> 00:24:59.990 align:middle line:84%
They know a little
bit of the story,

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:01.510 align:middle line:84%
and they're all trying
to figure it out as well.

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And Edgar Mitchell was
one of those people.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.630 align:middle line:84%
The story was that
there was a rumor

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:06.790 align:middle line:84%
that Bush Sr. had told
him what was going on,

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:08.650 align:middle line:84%
that he had gotten
some information,

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:11.500 align:middle line:84%
and that he was one
of the guys who knew

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:12.880 align:middle line:90%
Roswell was real and stuff.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was always, like,
who are his sources?

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And so in Loughlin,
Nevada, I'm about to leave.

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And a guy from
Australia comes up,

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.890 align:middle line:84%
James Rigney comes up to me, and
he says, I need to talk to you.

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:25.300 align:middle line:90%
I want to show you a document.

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I'm
actually going to Tucson.

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:27.867 align:middle line:90%
I'm leaving right now.

00:25:27.867 --> 00:25:30.400 align:middle line:84%
I've got to be there by
suppertime, at dinnertime.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.685 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I need 10
minutes of your time.

00:25:32.685 --> 00:25:34.060 align:middle line:84%
So I said, all
right, 10 minutes.

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, 10
minutes, you got it.

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:37.082 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Pulls out his iPad,
and he shows me this document.

00:25:37.082 --> 00:25:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's now called
the Wilson document.

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.903 align:middle line:84%
I looked at it, and I
saw two names on document

00:25:41.903 --> 00:25:44.320 align:middle line:84%
that nobody else would know,
high-level people that I knew

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.230 align:middle line:90%
were involved.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:48.418 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him, I said,
where'd you get this from?

00:25:48.418 --> 00:25:50.460 align:middle line:84%
It was the most dramatic
document I've ever seen,

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:51.770 align:middle line:84%
and I've seen a
lot of documents.

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:53.187 align:middle line:84%
I said, where'd
you get this from?

00:25:53.187 --> 00:25:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it comes from
Edgar Mitchell's files.

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:57.520 align:middle line:90%
And it suddenly made sense.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.613 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Mitchell was a story
that researchers will--

00:25:59.613 --> 00:26:01.030 align:middle line:84%
somebody would
tell him something.

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.197 align:middle line:84%
They'll put in their file;
they don't talk about it.

00:26:03.197 --> 00:26:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And then, when they die, someone
like me races to their files

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:08.005 align:middle line:90%
to see, what did they--

00:26:08.005 --> 00:26:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who gives you
access to their files?

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Well, their
files will usually be put

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:13.150 align:middle line:84%
in an archives
like Edgar Mitch--

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Public?

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Edgar
Mitchell's was different.

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.248 align:middle line:84%
What happened was
the family wasn't

00:26:17.248 --> 00:26:18.900 align:middle line:90%
interested in this stuff.

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And there was an
aerospace guy who

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:23.395 align:middle line:84%
was friends with the family who
said, well, don't throw it out.

00:26:23.395 --> 00:26:24.195 align:middle line:90%
I'll take it.

00:26:24.195 --> 00:26:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And he took some books and
some files and stuff like that.

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And then James Rigney
was friends of his.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:30.070 align:middle line:90%
He's an aerospace guy as well.

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:31.870 align:middle line:90%
And then he saw these documents.

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And he said, can I
photocopy these documents?

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And so he photocopied a
bunch of these documents.

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:38.800 align:middle line:84%
So when I saw this document,
and when he said Edgar Mitchell,

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:39.800 align:middle line:90%
suddenly, it made sense.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.140 align:middle line:90%
Edgar Mitchell had passed away.

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And he told me the story of
how this document had surfaced

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:44.980 align:middle line:90%
and how he'd gotten it.

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what are
you going to do with it?

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I don't
know what to do with it.

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:49.360 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm
showing it to you.

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, give it to me,
I'll-- and I was going to do

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:54.280 align:middle line:84%
a book called "Beyond
Managing Magic."

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.240 align:middle line:84%
I said I'll just
put it in the book.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.740 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the book, I
won't say anything about us.

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.975 align:middle line:84%
Put it in the book, and
let's see what happens.

00:26:58.975 --> 00:27:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I say there's
controlled disclosure.

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it's like
nonfiction disclosure.

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:04.660 align:middle line:84%
He's put the document out
and let people figure it out

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:05.380 align:middle line:90%
for themselves.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:07.270 align:middle line:84%
So I'd seen about two
pages of the document.

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:10.153 align:middle line:84%
Then it was about a month later
he sends me, and it's 15 pages.

00:27:10.153 --> 00:27:11.320 align:middle line:90%
And then I started to panic.

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:12.430 align:middle line:84%
I go, like, what
am I going to do?

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Because I knew all the
people in the document.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.250 align:middle line:90%
I had dealt with these people.

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, I don't
know if I can leak this thing.

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:18.430 align:middle line:90%
So then I--

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you felt
it was authentic?

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:20.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Oh,
absolutely because I knew

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:21.440 align:middle line:90%
it was coming from.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And he told me
there were others.

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:24.452 align:middle line:90%
There's the Wilson document.

00:27:24.452 --> 00:27:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Then there's this alien
autopsy document people

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:27.335 align:middle line:90%
are talking about it.

00:27:27.335 --> 00:27:28.460 align:middle line:90%
He sent me that when later.

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:30.070 align:middle line:90%
So I had those two documents.

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Then he sent me
a personal letter

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:35.330 align:middle line:84%
that Edgar had sent to somebody
just a travelers coming

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:36.170 align:middle line:90%
from Edgar's files.

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:37.580 align:middle line:90%
He said you can't release that.

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:39.380 align:middle line:84%
The other one he
gave me was a letter

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:42.510 align:middle line:84%
from Bob Bigelow to
Edgar Mitchell talking

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:43.310 align:middle line:90%
about the NIDS.

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Because what happened was Edgar
Mitchell sat on his NIDS board.

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:48.827 align:middle line:84%
And the NIDS board is
the National Institute

00:27:48.827 --> 00:27:49.910 align:middle line:90%
for Discovery of Science--

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Funded by
Bigelow at the time.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And what he
did is what I'm doing.

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:57.118 align:middle line:84%
What he would do is he would
take the highest level people

00:27:57.118 --> 00:27:58.910 align:middle line:84%
and say, these people
know what's going on.

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:02.035 align:middle line:84%
And he would bring them
in on a per diem thing,

00:28:02.035 --> 00:28:04.660 align:middle line:84%
and they would sit there and try
to discuss various cases like,

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.880 align:middle line:84%
is Roswell real, is
Skinwalker Ranch.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And they would have a
discussion on the weekend,

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.790 align:middle line:84%
and these guys go back
to their regular jobs.

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:13.310 align:middle line:84%
So Edgar Mitchell
was on that board.

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:14.870 align:middle line:90%
And these were NIDS documents.

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:17.457 align:middle line:84%
These were conclusions
to various studies.

00:28:17.457 --> 00:28:19.790 align:middle line:84%
So they'd done one on the
Holloman Air Force Base thing.

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:21.080 align:middle line:90%
They'd done alien autopsy.

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.730 align:middle line:84%
They'd done this
thing with Wilson.

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:24.180 align:middle line:90%
They'd investigated things.

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:26.130 align:middle line:84%
So these were just
documents that had come.

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And what some
people don't know is

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.092 align:middle line:90%
that there are other documents.

00:28:29.092 --> 00:28:31.460 align:middle line:84%
I know there are other
documents in the file that James

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:33.350 align:middle line:84%
has that-- the other
guy may have even more.

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:35.933 align:middle line:84%
There was a rumor there were six
boxes of files that came back

00:28:35.933 --> 00:28:36.980 align:middle line:90%
from Edgar Mitchell.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I said to
James, it's up to you.

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:41.728 align:middle line:84%
I know some of the
documents he has.

00:28:41.728 --> 00:28:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And whether he puts these other
documents from Edgar Mitchell

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:44.880 align:middle line:90%
out--

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.190 align:middle line:84%
but basically comes--
that Edgar Mitchell

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:48.607 align:middle line:84%
was sitting on this board where
these high-level guys were

00:28:48.607 --> 00:28:50.120 align:middle line:90%
discussing this kind of stuff.

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And the material
ended up with me,

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:54.650 align:middle line:84%
and then I didn't
know to do with it.

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:57.955 align:middle line:84%
So I just decided,
well, I can't leak it,

00:28:57.955 --> 00:28:59.330 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not going
to cover it up.

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:00.180 align:middle line:90%
Because that's the whole deal.

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:01.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I'm
covering it up, I'm

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:02.690 align:middle line:90%
just as bad as everybody else.

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:03.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:04.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: So anyway, I'd tell
people about the document,

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:06.728 align:middle line:84%
and they'd say, can
I see that document?

00:29:06.728 --> 00:29:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And I showed it to
a bunch of people,

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:09.660 align:middle line:84%
and somebody put
on the internet.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:10.100 align:middle line:90%
And that's how--

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's how it started.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And so I've gotten
a lot of those documents

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:15.830 align:middle line:90%
where stuff has come out.

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:19.040 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the one guy whose name
was on there was Oak Shannon.

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And Oak Shannon is
an aerospace guy.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And he's the guy who set up
the meeting between Dr. Eric

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.797 align:middle line:90%
Davis and this Admiral Wilson.

00:29:26.797 --> 00:29:28.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And these are
all real-deal people.

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, oh, yeah, I've
known a lot of these people.

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:32.447 align:middle line:84%
That was the problem I
had with the documents.

00:29:32.447 --> 00:29:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And so Oak Shannon, I've been
given Oak Shannon's notes

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.990 align:middle line:84%
from what was called the UFO
working group from the 1980s.

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:38.990 align:middle line:90%
I had never released it.

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:40.115 align:middle line:90%
I've still not released it.

00:29:40.115 --> 00:29:41.660 align:middle line:84%
It's in this
upcoming book that I

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:43.520 align:middle line:84%
have called the "Alien
Documents," where

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:46.580 align:middle line:84%
I go through all the documents,
leaked documents, FOIA

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:48.860 align:middle line:84%
documents, and I
basically spell them out.

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:50.660 align:middle line:90%
And this is one from the 1980s.

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's basically almost the
same as the Wilson document

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:54.980 align:middle line:84%
that you have these 20
high-level people who

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.138 align:middle line:84%
are brought into a
skiff on the East Coast.

00:29:57.138 --> 00:29:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying to
figure out what's going on.

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:01.388 align:middle line:84%
So you have these various
subjects-- cow mutilations,

00:30:01.388 --> 00:30:02.707 align:middle line:90%
alien abductions, Roswell--

00:30:02.707 --> 00:30:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All these topics.

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And
they're discussing.

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And these guys, to
get into the meeting,

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:09.080 align:middle line:84%
you have to have top
secret SEI clearance.

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:10.912 align:middle line:84%
So it's these 20
guys, and basically it

00:30:10.912 --> 00:30:12.120 align:middle line:90%
comes down to the same thing.

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.090 align:middle line:84%
UFOs are real, And
other than that,

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:15.490 align:middle line:90%
we don't know what's going on.

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
don't conclude that?

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And they
have this discussion.

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:20.160 align:middle line:84%
There's just two-page discussion
where the one guy says,

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.400 align:middle line:84%
are we to believe
that this stuff's all

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.900 align:middle line:84%
going into some
sort of black hole,

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:25.317 align:middle line:84%
and we don't know
what's going on?

00:30:25.317 --> 00:30:28.502 align:middle line:84%
And then some other person says,
yeah, that would be the idea.

00:30:28.502 --> 00:30:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And in this discussion where
these guys are basically

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:32.345 align:middle line:84%
saying, yeah, it's
real, but we really

00:30:32.345 --> 00:30:33.470 align:middle line:90%
don't know what's going on.

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:35.930 align:middle line:84%
So there were those kind of
documents that I decided,

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:37.670 align:middle line:84%
I need to put these
documents out.

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many
of these documents

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:41.630 align:middle line:84%
have been given to me
because I'm a document guy.

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:44.893 align:middle line:84%
There's the one-- the famous
story that, as I said,

00:30:44.893 --> 00:30:46.310 align:middle line:84%
they've always
been leaking stuff.

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:48.690 align:middle line:84%
So in the 1970s,
Bob Emenegger, who

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:51.770 align:middle line:84%
is a producer for Gray
Advertising and Allan Sandler

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:53.540 align:middle line:90%
do a documentary called "UFOs--

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:54.860 align:middle line:90%
Past, Present and Future."

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:55.820 align:middle line:90%
And the government set them up.

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:57.403 align:middle line:84%
They signed a contract
in the Pentagon

00:30:57.403 --> 00:30:58.880 align:middle line:90%
to do this documentary on UFOs.

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.650 align:middle line:84%
They had access to
anybody they want.

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:02.450 align:middle line:10%
They were approached
by Arthur Lundahl,

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:06.350 align:middle line:10%
who was identified as one of
the top seven spies in the CIA.

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:08.420 align:middle line:10%
He ran the weird desk
at the CIA in charge

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:10.400 align:middle line:10%
of UFOs and paranormal
phenomenon and stuff,

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.525 align:middle line:10%
fascinated with UFOs.

00:31:11.525 --> 00:31:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is he still alive?

00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: No, he's
died many years ago.

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:18.080 align:middle line:84%
So he approached
them with a story

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.953 align:middle line:84%
that, in 1959, the CIA
channeled an alien.

00:31:20.953 --> 00:31:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And the alien that
they channelled

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:24.770 align:middle line:84%
was the same alien that the
Canadians were channeling.

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And this was an alien
by name of Atha.

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And so they put
this into this show.

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And they had Robert Friend who's
just died just a little while

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:32.800 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.217 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
all dying, Grant.

00:31:34.217 --> 00:31:36.592 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, and so Friend
ran the Project Blue Book.

00:31:36.592 --> 00:31:38.092 align:middle line:84%
Lundahl was supposed
to go on camera

00:31:38.092 --> 00:31:40.160 align:middle line:84%
and tell the story about
channeling an alien,

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.300 align:middle line:90%
but he said, I can't do it.

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And Bob says, well, why
can't you go on camera?

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:43.877 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'm on duty.

00:31:43.877 --> 00:31:45.710 align:middle line:84%
So they'd got Robert
Friend to tell a story.

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is a
Navy intelligence guy

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:51.855 align:middle line:84%
is taught to channel an alien
by a woman in Eliot, Maine.

00:31:51.855 --> 00:31:53.480 align:middle line:84%
She says I'll teach
you how to do-- she

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:54.590 align:middle line:90%
puts her hand on his shoulder.

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, this guy's
doing this automatic writing.

00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is real.

00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: This is real.

00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:59.000 align:middle line:90%
He goes to the CIA.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And Arthur Lundahl, who ran
the National Photographic

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:04.250 align:middle line:84%
Interpretation Center where
they analyzed the U2, the SR-71

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:06.230 align:middle line:84%
photographs and stuff,
he's interested.

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:07.910 align:middle line:90%
He said, OK, sit down.

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:09.173 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk to the alien.

00:32:09.173 --> 00:32:11.090 align:middle line:84%
So this guy sits down,
and they do this thing.

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And they're asking him, do
you prefer a religion, and all

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:14.300 align:middle line:90%
these different questions.

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And then Arthur Lundahl says,
we'd like to have some proof.

00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:19.453 align:middle line:84%
And this is Robert Friend
telling this story on camera.

00:32:19.453 --> 00:32:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we'd
like some proof.

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:21.860 align:middle line:90%
What would you like?

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:22.820 align:middle line:90%
We need to see you.

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:23.360 align:middle line:90%
When? .

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:23.900 align:middle line:90%
Now.

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:24.620 align:middle line:90%
Go to the window.

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:25.670 align:middle line:90%
And they go to the window.

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And Robert Friend describes
this flying saucer in the middle

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:28.967 align:middle line:90%
of day flies over the capitol.

00:32:28.967 --> 00:32:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's right there.

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And the thing
is, there's a CIA memo that

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:35.320 align:middle line:90%
is produced by Arthur Lundahl.

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Robert Friend recopies
it, handwritten,

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:40.570 align:middle line:84%
and then [INAUDIBLE] says,
OK, now you've got the story.

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:41.780 align:middle line:90%
Here's the document.

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:44.080 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of the documents
in an 11-page document

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:47.830 align:middle line:84%
of this channeling of an alien
in July of 1959 at the CIA.

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And Arthur Lundahl--
nobody really

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:50.930 align:middle line:90%
denies this story took place.

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And this document, a lot
of people haven't seen.

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:55.930 align:middle line:84%
So these are the documents that
have been given over the years

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:57.930 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to
sort of document it

00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:00.730 align:middle line:84%
where you can see that
it's not a cover up,

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:02.410 align:middle line:90%
and it's not a disclosure.

00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:05.488 align:middle line:84%
It's this sort of leaking things
where you rewrite documents.

00:33:05.488 --> 00:33:07.030 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
plausible deniability.

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:08.740 align:middle line:84%
You can't really prove
it's the document.

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:11.500 align:middle line:84%
But it has all the CIA
people's names on it.

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:14.380 align:middle line:84%
They were in the room when this
happened-- fascinating stuff.

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:17.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These documents are
constantly being discovered.

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:19.690 align:middle line:84%
Do you think there's going to
be some new ones out there?

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: I'm releasing a
number of these documents.

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's seen a lot
of these documents.

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they revealing?

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: I've moved a little
bit on what I think really

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:28.880 align:middle line:90%
is known.

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.430 align:middle line:84%
There's a statement that's
made by Kit Green who

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:36.670 align:middle line:84%
this prominent CIA guy who
says Uncle is clueless.

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And the more I look at it, the
more I come to the conclusion

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:42.250 align:middle line:84%
that that may be true,
that UFOs are real.

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:44.625 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of understanding
the significance,

00:33:44.625 --> 00:33:46.250 align:middle line:84%
they really don't
know what's going on.

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:48.250 align:middle line:84%
If you look at Skinwalker
Ranch as an example,

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:50.110 align:middle line:84%
when their Skin Walker
Ranch, this thing's

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:52.180 align:middle line:84%
walking around them like
they're like a pylon.

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:54.213 align:middle line:84%
They have no control
over the phenomenon.

00:33:54.213 --> 00:33:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
documents that I've

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:58.990 align:middle line:84%
seen leaked that I'm going to
release basically shows, like,

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:03.158 align:middle line:84%
this '85 meeting where these
20 high-level, top-secret guys

00:34:03.158 --> 00:34:05.200 align:middle line:84%
are saying, we don't really
know what's going on.

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.817 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this
full disclosure?

00:34:06.817 --> 00:34:08.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Well, it's
as much as you can do.

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:10.427 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in terms
of them releasing,

00:34:10.427 --> 00:34:12.969 align:middle line:84%
that may be why they don't do
full disclosure is because they

00:34:12.969 --> 00:34:15.120 align:middle line:90%
have to say, we have no idea.

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.699 align:middle line:84%
This thing can do
whatever it wants.

00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:18.282 align:middle line:10%
It can shut down our
nuclear missiles.

00:34:18.282 --> 00:34:20.630 align:middle line:10%
And they may not want to
release that kind of stuff.

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And so if I'm briefing the
president, I go and say,

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:24.790 align:middle line:84%
OK, we've got this much
material, Mr. President.

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:27.130 align:middle line:84%
If you give us five
more years, the world

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:28.300 align:middle line:90%
isn't coming to an end.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.550 align:middle line:84%
We can drill another oil
well, whatever we have to do.

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:32.278 align:middle line:84%
The longer we delay
this thing, the more

00:34:32.278 --> 00:34:33.820 align:middle line:84%
answers we'll have
in case it happens

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:36.460 align:middle line:84%
to be an evil phenomena, and
we can fight back against it.

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:38.210 align:middle line:84%
So they're kicking
the can down the road

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:40.210 align:middle line:84%
because they really are
trying to figure it out.

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:42.250 align:middle line:84%
They haven't got the
answers that a lot of people

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:43.050 align:middle line:90%
think they have.

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:47.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gaia's "Deep Space"
talks about disclosure.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:50.110 align:middle line:10%
>> But some researchers believe
that the government and elite

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:53.860 align:middle line:10%
have been disclosing
information for years.

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:56.380 align:middle line:10%
>>MIKE BARA: I don't believe
in government disclosure.

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.480 align:middle line:10%
When I think of official
government disclosure,

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.570 align:middle line:10%
I think of the president
sitting in the Oval

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:03.070 align:middle line:10%
Office with the paned windows
and the pictures of his family

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:06.760 align:middle line:10%
over his shoulder telling us
that aliens have been here

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.160 align:middle line:10%
for a long time, maybe
millions of years,

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.470 align:middle line:10%
and they've manipulated
our genetics,

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:14.950 align:middle line:10%
and we've been lying to you
about it for at least 70 years.

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:16.690 align:middle line:10%
I'm skeptical that
that's actually

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:19.720 align:middle line:10%
going to happen because I don't
see any political advantage

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:22.040 align:middle line:10%
in the people who are
in power for telling us

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:22.840 align:middle line:10%
that information.

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.090 align:middle line:10%
All it will do is destabilize.

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:26.980 align:middle line:10%
Whenever you introduce
a destabilizing element

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:29.320 align:middle line:10%
into the body politic, the
only thing that can happen

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.300 align:middle line:10%
is the guys at the
top can go down.

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.460 align:middle line:10%
Having said that,
there appears to be

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:36.247 align:middle line:10%
a pattern of
unofficial disclosure

00:35:36.247 --> 00:35:37.705 align:middle line:10%
that's going on
through our movies,

00:35:37.705 --> 00:35:40.210 align:middle line:10%
though our television
shows where they're getting

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:42.610 align:middle line:10%
the information out
letting it leak bit

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:45.610 align:middle line:10%
by bit, a document here, a
document there, a citing here,

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:46.853 align:middle line:10%
a citing there.

00:35:46.853 --> 00:35:48.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that,
of course, was author

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:51.280 align:middle line:84%
and researcher Mike Bara
talking about the possibility

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:52.160 align:middle line:90%
of disclosure too.

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:52.960 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:53.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Yeah.

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.970 align:middle line:90%
I wrote my first book in 1990.

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's been my
theory the whole time.

00:35:57.530 --> 00:36:00.010 align:middle line:84%
It's not full disclosure;
it's this gradual disclosure.

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:00.700 align:middle line:90%
And one of the things--

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was stages.

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Yeah.

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And so what would you see
in this recent document,

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:06.700 align:middle line:84%
this Wilson leaked
document where

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:08.460 align:middle line:90%
it says MJ-12 is for real.

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:10.060 align:middle line:90%
Well, I said that 1989.

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:12.370 align:middle line:90%
The MJ-12 document was altered.

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:13.840 align:middle line:90%
It was not a real document.

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And so what you see
is a confirmation

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:18.582 align:middle line:84%
that, in the 1980s, they
were leaking the MJ-12 story.

00:36:18.582 --> 00:36:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And they just covered it
with a phony document.

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:21.940 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is,
they put it out,

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:22.920 align:middle line:90%
they changed the documents.

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Somebody realized the document
is not a real document.

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Then they yell hoax, and
everybody runs for the door.

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:27.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they panic.

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:30.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: The story gets
out, and nobody confirms it.

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:31.960 align:middle line:84%
So they're doing this
non-confirmable stuff

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:32.990 align:middle line:90%
all the way through.

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's the prime example
is that MJ-12 is real.

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:37.900 align:middle line:84%
There is a control group
and that, in the 1980s,

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:39.700 align:middle line:84%
the government was
leaking this story.

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And now it was confirmed
in this Wilson leak, which

00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:44.380 align:middle line:84%
I believe is a
firm document that

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:47.320 align:middle line:84%
came from Edgar Mitchell's files
that said, yeah MJ-12 is real.

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.340 align:middle line:90%
Roswell is real.

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:50.290 align:middle line:84%
So they'll leak
stories about Roswell,

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:52.000 align:middle line:84%
but you can't confirm it, and
that's what they're doing.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are other governments
doing the same thing, Grant?

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: I have a difference
of opinion with most people.

00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:58.060 align:middle line:84%
Most people say, well,
the British released;

00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:59.020 align:middle line:90%
the Canadians released.

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:00.040 align:middle line:90%
And I don't believe any of that.

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:01.383 align:middle line:90%
I say, yeah, they're releasing.

00:37:01.383 --> 00:37:03.550 align:middle line:84%
But what they're doing is
they're releasing the same

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:04.350 align:middle line:90%
as Blue Book.

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:06.270 align:middle line:84%
The Canadians released
actually in '67,

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:09.160 align:middle line:84%
two years before the Americans,
but what they're releasing

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:10.910 align:middle line:84%
is what I call
the garbage files.

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:13.870 align:middle line:84%
It's letters to the president
of United States, sighting

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:14.690 align:middle line:90%
reports.

00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Where's the actual top-secret
stuff, the secretary defense

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:19.630 align:middle line:84%
having a meeting
with the president?

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:20.940 align:middle line:90%
Where's the briefing notes?

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:22.330 align:middle line:90%
The British is a prime example.

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:25.000 align:middle line:84%
So the British say we're going
to release all our UFO files.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.050 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing to this.

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:27.675 align:middle line:84%
It's not a threat to
national security.

00:37:27.675 --> 00:37:29.082 align:middle line:84%
It's a waste of
government funds.

00:37:29.082 --> 00:37:30.790 align:middle line:84%
We're going to release
all our documents.

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And then you move it from the
white world to the black world.

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:36.362 align:middle line:84%
Because what you have, if you're
going to do this publicly,

00:37:36.362 --> 00:37:37.570 align:middle line:90%
and Blue Book had this thing.

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:40.720 align:middle line:84%
It was a PR nightmare that
every time there was a sighting,

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.628 align:middle line:84%
you had to bring out
a spokesman to explain

00:37:42.628 --> 00:37:44.420 align:middle line:84%
that it was a weather
balloon or something,

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:45.350 align:middle line:84%
and people were
laughing and stuff.

00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:45.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Always a skeptic.

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And they
didn't want that.

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:49.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's better to move
it into the black world,

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:52.220 align:middle line:84%
say it doesn't exist, and then
you can study it all you want,

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:53.800 align:middle line:84%
and you've got to
talk to the people.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.467 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
seen documents, Grant,

00:37:55.467 --> 00:37:56.880 align:middle line:90%
that are blacked out?

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, I've seen it.

00:37:58.130 --> 00:37:58.963 align:middle line:90%
Well, there's a lot.

00:37:58.963 --> 00:38:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I went
after Stanton Friedman

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.200 align:middle line:90%
who just passed away.

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Immediately, I filed
for his FBI file.

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:07.900 align:middle line:84%
Because Stanton and Bill Moore
who was, in the 1980s, the guy

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:12.280 align:middle line:84%
that moved the MJ-12 story,
both had filed for FBI file

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:16.030 align:middle line:84%
in 1988 after the
MJ-12 story broke.

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And both their files,
Moore's I know for sure

00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:22.120 align:middle line:84%
had over 50 pages
in the document

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:24.580 align:middle line:90%
that were withheld in total--

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:26.530 align:middle line:90%
national security, secret.

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:29.290 align:middle line:84%
So the thing was everything
was just a researcher who's

00:38:29.290 --> 00:38:30.770 align:middle line:90%
scamming documents, whatever.

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:32.980 align:middle line:84%
No, not if you've got
50 pages of documents

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:34.605 align:middle line:84%
that are withheld
national security.

00:38:34.605 --> 00:38:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And Stanton's was
the same thing.

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.740 align:middle line:84%
So when I was at Big Bear Lake a
couple months ago with Stanton,

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:41.032 align:middle line:84%
I said Stanton, did you have
all your stuff blacked out

00:38:41.032 --> 00:38:41.832 align:middle line:90%
like Bill Moore?

00:38:41.832 --> 00:38:42.650 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yeah.

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, how
many pages was it?

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:45.492 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I don't
really remember.

00:38:45.492 --> 00:38:47.783 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the documents,
when I go to his files

00:38:47.783 --> 00:38:48.670 align:middle line:90%
that I'm looking for.

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Stanton actually changed the
whole spectrum of this thing

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:52.150 align:middle line:84%
because they used
to black them out.

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And remember Stanton used
to stand there with the--

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hold them up.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: --documents
and embarrass these guys.

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:58.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And say, this is
going in my gray basket.

00:38:58.930 --> 00:38:59.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: There you go.

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:01.540 align:middle line:90%
But now they do white out.

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:03.170 align:middle line:84%
They don't use
black stuff anymore.

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:07.510 align:middle line:84%
So when I got Stanton's
FBI file just a month ago,

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:08.680 align:middle line:90%
it's all whited out.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And that was because of
Stanton because it looks so bad

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:11.180 align:middle line:90%
when it's all black.

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, the
blackout makes it look bad.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: But half of
Stanton's FBI file is missing.

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And Richard Doty, for
whatever he's worth,

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:18.670 align:middle line:84%
told me that Stanton
was given some

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:21.598 align:middle line:84%
very highly classified
documents in the 1980s,

00:39:21.598 --> 00:39:23.390 align:middle line:84%
and the FBI didn't know
what to do with it.

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:24.490 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know
whether to arrest him

00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:26.282 align:middle line:84%
or what they were going
to do with Stanton.

00:39:26.282 --> 00:39:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And so this whole section
of Stanton's FBI file

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:30.490 align:middle line:90%
has been whited out.

00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think Stanton
would be happy.

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:35.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact the one has Stanton
Friedman's name on the top,

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:36.922 align:middle line:84%
and the entire page
is totally whited out.

00:39:36.922 --> 00:39:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think he'd
be glad, then, that you're

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:40.230 align:middle line:90%
going to get his file?

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:41.313 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:39:41.313 --> 00:39:42.520 align:middle line:90%
And Stanton was an open guy.

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:45.530 align:middle line:84%
He wanted it out,
whatever the answer was.

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:48.690 align:middle line:84%
He always like-- he was one
of the guys that inspired me.

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:49.710 align:middle line:90%
He went to 20 archives.

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:51.480 align:middle line:90%
I've been to 35 archives now.

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that most
people will not really

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:57.810 align:middle line:84%
research that kind
of stuff and that I

00:39:57.810 --> 00:39:59.670 align:middle line:84%
respect people who
have done research

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:00.810 align:middle line:90%
that they got some answers.

00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And so when their
files become public,

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:04.650 align:middle line:84%
I go there realizing
that they all

00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:06.810 align:middle line:84%
have pieces that nobody
else has seen before.

00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
you hope to accomplish

00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:09.120 align:middle line:90%
with all this, Grant?

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.230 align:middle line:90%
What's your goal?

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:12.063 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Well, my
goal is always the same.

00:40:12.063 --> 00:40:14.880 align:middle line:84%
It's to get the material out so
that 500 years from now people

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.260 align:middle line:90%
realize what actually happened.

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:19.020 align:middle line:84%
It's the old thing, To whom
much is given, much is expected.

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.790 align:middle line:84%
I've been given
this opportunity.

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:22.823 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to do
this kind of stuff.

00:40:22.823 --> 00:40:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it's
like a chess game.

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And I talked to Richard
Dolan about this.

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:28.140 align:middle line:84%
To Richard and I, it's
like a chess game.

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:29.670 align:middle line:84%
It's, like, you don't
get emotionally involved.

00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:31.440 align:middle line:84%
You sit there, and you
watch the government.

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.180 align:middle line:84%
The government's on the
other side playing the game.

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And you sit there,
and you watch.

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And I used to be very good at
play chess when I was a kid.

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let them make
their move, right?

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:39.178 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: You make the
move, and then you sit there,

00:40:39.178 --> 00:40:41.190 align:middle line:84%
and you do not make a
move until you figure out,

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:42.540 align:middle line:90%
why did they move that piece?

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:43.930 align:middle line:90%
What exactly are they doing?

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:45.420 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to figure
out, what is he doing,

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:46.320 align:middle line:90%
and then you make your move.

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.487 align:middle line:90%
So to me, it's a chess game.

00:40:47.487 --> 00:40:49.950 align:middle line:84%
It's like a game, and
I'm intending to win.

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:52.920 align:middle line:84%
I may not win, but I'm going
to carefully play it, not

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.620 align:middle line:84%
get emotionally involved
in it, and do what

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:57.073 align:middle line:90%
I call non-fiction disclosure.

00:40:57.073 --> 00:40:59.115 align:middle line:84%
If I get a document, I'm
just going to put it on.

00:40:59.115 --> 00:41:00.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to sanitize it.

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.662 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
give you my opinion.

00:41:01.662 --> 00:41:02.610 align:middle line:90%
Here's the document.

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:05.877 align:middle line:84%
You figure it out for yourself
that people need material.

00:41:05.877 --> 00:41:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And if I believe it's
a legitimate document,

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:08.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to put it out.

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:12.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would you
like your epitaph to read?

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Well, that I did the
best I could with what I've got

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:18.150 align:middle line:84%
and then I tried to be an
independent researcher.

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:19.680 align:middle line:90%
I don't really join groups.

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:23.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't get behind anybody's
proposal or whatever.

00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:25.020 align:middle line:84%
I just, as an
independent researcher,

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:27.210 align:middle line:84%
want to be known
for somebody who

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:31.680 align:middle line:84%
did the best he could to
try to unravel the mystery

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:34.830 align:middle line:84%
and get the highest level
people, the people who actually

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:37.930 align:middle line:84%
know, and publish what they're
saying about this phenomena.

00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Because there are people
who know more than you.

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think you have to
listen to those people.

00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does the future
hold for Grant Cameron?

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Well, I have the
five books that are coming out.

00:41:46.930 --> 00:41:48.805 align:middle line:84%
And my main thing is
the consciousness thing.

00:41:48.805 --> 00:41:51.210 align:middle line:84%
I hate this disclosure thing
because it's like a rathole.

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:53.760 align:middle line:84%
It's like people fighting
and stuff like this the time,

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:54.877 align:middle line:90%
very controversial.

00:41:54.877 --> 00:41:56.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm more into the
consciousness thing.

00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:58.410 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's
all consciousness.

00:41:58.410 --> 00:42:00.840 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we are
being given messages

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:03.240 align:middle line:84%
through various
things and that we're

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:04.560 align:middle line:90%
in a process of awakening.

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.450 align:middle line:90%
That to realize that--

00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:09.720 align:middle line:84%
my conclusion would be that,
the phenomena, whatever it is--

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:11.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whatever it is.

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: What it is, it's
going to be a lot less physical

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.040 align:middle line:90%
and people think.

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be
a lot more spiritual

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:18.930 align:middle line:90%
or whatever you want to call it.

00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And people aren't
going to like that.

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:21.478 align:middle line:84%
That's the way it
seems to be going

00:42:21.478 --> 00:42:24.570 align:middle line:84%
to me is that we've made a
lot of false assumptions.

00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:26.235 align:middle line:84%
Is the world
consciousness, or is it

00:42:26.235 --> 00:42:27.360 align:middle line:90%
made out of nuts and bolts?

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And we're making all
these false assumptions.

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:32.007 align:middle line:84%
And we're being told, you've got
this wrong; you got that wrong.

00:42:32.007 --> 00:42:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And once you understand that
it's all consciousness and that

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.675 align:middle line:84%
we're all in this
one field together--

00:42:37.675 --> 00:42:40.050 align:middle line:84%
and the reason they're doing
these things is because they

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:41.300 align:middle line:90%
understand something we don't.

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:43.860 align:middle line:84%
They don't believe the
world is nuts and bolts.

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:45.290 align:middle line:90%
And you can learn from them.

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:48.295 align:middle line:84%
So that's where I want to go is
into this consciousness aspect.

00:42:48.295 --> 00:42:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Just me, that's where
the answers were.

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.690 align:middle line:84%
I had an experience
that led me there.

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:54.220 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that that
will be the final solution.

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:57.255 align:middle line:84%
It's all going to be clearly
tied to consciousness.

00:42:57.255 --> 00:42:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they coming
from other planetary

00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:00.297 align:middle line:90%
systems or other dimensions?

00:43:00.297 --> 00:43:02.713 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Wherever they're
coming from, they're coming in

00:43:02.713 --> 00:43:03.837 align:middle line:90%
through, like, wormholes.

00:43:03.837 --> 00:43:05.170 align:middle line:10%
They're doing this portal thing.

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:06.010 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But they're physical.

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:07.260 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMERON: They're popping in.

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:09.210 align:middle line:10%
They can come into
the physical world.

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:11.760 align:middle line:10%
There's a number of experiences
will tell the story.

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:13.830 align:middle line:10%
There was a ball of light
that came into my room,

00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:14.997 align:middle line:10%
and it turned into an alien.

00:43:14.997 --> 00:43:16.542 align:middle line:10%
Or there was an
alien in my room,

00:43:16.542 --> 00:43:18.000 align:middle line:10%
and it turned into
a ball of light.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.670 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, is it a ball
of light, or is it an alien?

00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And if it's a ball of light,
does it eat bacon, eggs, toast,

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:23.430 align:middle line:90%
and coffee?

00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:25.980 align:middle line:84%
So I say they're in a higher
vibrating, consciousness,

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.240 align:middle line:90%
frequency whatever it is.

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:29.428 align:middle line:84%
They can come in
and become physical,

00:43:29.428 --> 00:43:30.970 align:middle line:84%
and then they go
back into the world.

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:32.310 align:middle line:84%
We just think we're
in the physical world,

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:33.870 align:middle line:84%
and we can move out
of the physical world.

00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:35.640 align:middle line:84%
They just know some
things that we don't know.

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Grant, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:38.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Thank you.

00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:39.625 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Here's
an individual who

00:43:39.625 --> 00:43:42.720 align:middle line:10%
goes out and looks for
documents from real people who

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.850 align:middle line:10%
have had UFO experiences.

00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And they are the
who's who of ufology.

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:50.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
