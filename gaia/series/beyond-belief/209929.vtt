we put a lot of emphasis

And I'm not just talking
about men and women,

Blu, welcome to the program.

>>BLU: Oh, it's such
a pleasure to be here.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.353 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for having me.

00:01:29.353 --> 00:01:31.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: First of all,
you got to tell us

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.250 align:middle line:90%
how you got the name Blu.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.125 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: That's a great
question to start with.

00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:37.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sure is.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: I was originally
born Charlotte,

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.950 align:middle line:84%
and absolutely love my
name, had no intention

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.030 align:middle line:90%
of changing my name.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
I was in a meditation

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.740 align:middle line:84%
and I heard a voice very loud,
very clear, your name is Blu.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.170 align:middle line:84%
It's like, Blu, I'm
not even a big fan

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.275 align:middle line:90%
of the color of Blu personally.

00:01:59.275 --> 00:02:01.400 align:middle line:84%
So it was a little bit
discombobulating at the time

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.040 align:middle line:90%
when I received it.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
thank god the name

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.610 align:middle line:84%
didn't call you purple
or something like that.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Exact-- it
have been green.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.738 align:middle line:10%
It could have been red.

00:02:06.738 --> 00:02:08.720 align:middle line:10%
But it wasn't, it was Blu.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.042 align:middle line:10%
And I went home and I
told my friend about it.

00:02:11.042 --> 00:02:12.750 align:middle line:10%
And she was like, huh,
super interesting.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.980 align:middle line:10%
I love it.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.010 align:middle line:10%
And so I realized--

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.890 align:middle line:10%
I sat with it.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.307 align:middle line:10%
And it was like, no, it's not--
the actual spelling is not

00:02:19.307 --> 00:02:22.040 align:middle line:10%
B-L-U-E. It's B-L-U.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And then I stumbled across
a technology or a teaching

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.290 align:middle line:84%
by Richard Rudd
called the Gene Keys.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.790 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: Are you familiar?

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:29.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, sure am.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: And my life's
work in the Gene Keys

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.680 align:middle line:84%
are based off of my
astrology is beauty.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.290 align:middle line:10%
And it says if you were to sum
up your life's work into three

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.830 align:middle line:10%
words, it's to restore beauty,
love, and unity on the planet.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.660 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Nothing
wrong with that.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.000 align:middle line:10%
>>BLU: And that was when I had a
light bulb that went ding, Blu.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.873 align:middle line:90%
So my birth name is Charlotte.

00:02:54.873 --> 00:02:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So everybody
calls you Blu now.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.957 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: But everybody
calls me Blu.

00:02:57.957 --> 00:03:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's the essence of
restoring beauty, love,

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.110 align:middle line:84%
and unity on this planet
through my mission.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have an
interesting story.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.020 align:middle line:90%
It's the reason you're here.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.820 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about it.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.940 align:middle line:90%
What happened to you?

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: Whoo.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or should I say,
what hasn't happened to you?

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: [LAUGHS] It's
definitely been an adventure,

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.500 align:middle line:84%
I think, just in
general for everybody,

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.080 align:middle line:84%
being on this massive rock
hurtling through space

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.270 align:middle line:84%
at millions of miles an
hour, held into orbit

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.890 align:middle line:90%
by a giant ball of fire.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.030 align:middle line:84%
It's quite interesting
being human in general--

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.280 align:middle line:84%
very magical, mystical,
multidimensional

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.690 align:middle line:90%
experience just being alive.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And my journey has taken me
on many twists and turns.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.040 align:middle line:90%
It's led me into the seat today.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.340 align:middle line:90%
But where to start--

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.680 align:middle line:84%
well, I would say that
about seven years ago, I

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.147 align:middle line:84%
was diagnosed with a
hereditary hearing disorder.

00:03:50.147 --> 00:03:50.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: My brother and I
both were diagnosed with.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.780 align:middle line:90%
We weren't born with it.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it get
progressively worse?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: Yes, so it's--

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.900 align:middle line:84%
what we were left
with was that it's

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.580 align:middle line:90%
getting progressively worse.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.450 align:middle line:90%
It's hereditary.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's passed on
through genetics.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And there is no
known cure for it.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.360 align:middle line:84%
So essentially being
in my mid twenties

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.980 align:middle line:84%
being diagnosed with this
and experiencing the hearing

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.910 align:middle line:84%
getting worse and worse
over time, what it did

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.550 align:middle line:84%
is it actually sent a
lot of my energy inwards.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.310 align:middle line:90%
And I feel like--

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.060 align:middle line:84%
it's also just going
off of the Gene Keys,

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.040 align:middle line:84%
I was a bit of a student
of the Gene Keyes,

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.630 align:middle line:84%
and recognizing that the
ethos within the Gene Keys

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.390 align:middle line:84%
is that our greatest
challenge is also--

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.430 align:middle line:84%
has within it the seed
of our greatest gift.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.460 align:middle line:10%
And I was presented with one
of the greatest challenges

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.200 align:middle line:10%
in my life, which is
realizing that I'm

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.210 align:middle line:10%
starting to become very
disconnected with what's

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.080 align:middle line:10%
going on around me.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Where once I would thrive
in social environments,

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.967 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden I didn't
want to be in social space.

00:04:49.967 --> 00:04:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It kind of
dampered you, didn't it.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Yeah, it was so
discombobulated, confusing.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.840 align:middle line:90%
I felt disorientated.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of my energy
that was sent towards going

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.640 align:middle line:84%
outwards, [INHALES],,
and went inwards, and--

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you depressed?

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: I was definitely
very sad and very confused.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.208 align:middle line:84%
And I was definitely
a victim of it.

00:05:11.208 --> 00:05:13.250 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't understand why
it was happening to me.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.163 align:middle line:84%
Why is this happening
at such a young age?

00:05:15.163 --> 00:05:17.080 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I have so
much of my life to live.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And yet I can't hear music
or I can't hear my voice.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.450 align:middle line:84%
So I spent a lot of time alone
because when I was alone,

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.390 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have to face
off with the reality

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.190 align:middle line:90%
that I wasn't hearing the world.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.853 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
the doctors tell you?

00:05:31.853 --> 00:05:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: The doctors really
were scratching their head

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.350 align:middle line:90%
around it.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.670 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't understand
why it was really happening.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.337 align:middle line:84%
And they also didn't
have a cure for it.

00:05:38.337 --> 00:05:40.620 align:middle line:84%
So basically what they
shared with me was,

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.990 align:middle line:90%
here's your hearing aid options.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.740 align:middle line:84%
That's really all we
can do at this point.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is what
you're wearing now.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.068 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: I'm wearing my--

00:05:47.068 --> 00:05:50.672 align:middle line:84%
I just got them after
seven years of navigating

00:05:50.672 --> 00:05:51.630 align:middle line:90%
the world without them.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't
even see them.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: They're so-- modern
technology is amazing.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:56.660 align:middle line:90%
They just--

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they really small?

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: Tiny.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, if you're
not wearing them,

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.520 align:middle line:90%
can you hear at all?

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: I do hear, but
it's very muffled.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.982 align:middle line:90%
So I'm--

00:06:05.982 --> 00:06:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: (MUFFLED) I would
sound something like this?

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Yeah, you can imagine
when everyone was wearing

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.860 align:middle line:84%
the masks during the pandemic,
for the hard of hearing

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.650 align:middle line:84%
community, my heart
is goes so deeply

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.700 align:middle line:84%
out to hard of hearing
community because we lip read.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.920 align:middle line:84%
When Albert Einstein talks
about how energy is not created

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.930 align:middle line:84%
nor destroyed, it's
only changed in form,

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.170 align:middle line:84%
so if we're hearing
impaired, well our energy

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.850 align:middle line:90%
would have gone towards hearing.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.810 align:middle line:90%
It now has to go somewhere else.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And so for me it went into
the extrasensory perception

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.690 align:middle line:84%
of feeling and recognizing that
people say things all the time.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.170 align:middle line:90%
Words lie all the time.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.200 align:middle line:90%
Energy, energy never lies.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.960 align:middle line:84%
You can feel-- as soon as you're
with someone, you can feel--

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:46.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, instantly.

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: How much they're
loving, or if they're judging--

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or not.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:49.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: Exactly.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:50.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or not.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: If they're judging.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:55.290 align:middle line:84%
If they have division in
that internal narrative

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.020 align:middle line:84%
but they're saying all of the
right things, you can feel it.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Yet because we're distracted
by our five senses,

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.430 align:middle line:84%
we don't give credit to
the extrasensory perception

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:06.270 align:middle line:84%
of our intuition, our feeling,
which actually, I've learnt,

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.360 align:middle line:84%
is the only voice I want to
listen to is my intuition,

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.370 align:middle line:84%
beyond the mind,
beyond the stories,

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.570 align:middle line:84%
and actually into a
deeper level of feeling.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And that is what my
hearing gifted me,

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.540 align:middle line:84%
was recognizing I was
given a truth filter,

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.890 align:middle line:84%
that the vibrational
words holds messages

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.930 align:middle line:84%
that are behind the
actual words themselves.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And so it took me on a
very deep, internal journey

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.940 align:middle line:84%
that I ended up working
with Indigenous medicines

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.060 align:middle line:84%
with ayahuasca in the
Amazon jungle learning

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:42.070 align:middle line:84%
about life beyond the
veil on a vibratory level,

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.278 align:middle line:90%
of what they're operating in.

00:07:43.278 --> 00:07:45.112 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'll get into
some of those things

00:07:45.112 --> 00:07:46.570 align:middle line:90%
too on how they've changed you.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:51.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, your Mystery School
for Women, what is that?

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: So it's
called Fluorescence.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:57.200 align:middle line:90%
And it is multiple parts.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.700 align:middle line:90%
We have in-person immersions.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.450 align:middle line:84%
We have online immersions, and
specifically designed for women

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:11.040 align:middle line:84%
to activate the wise, wild,
oracle, wisdom-keeper, ancient

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.910 align:middle line:84%
mysteries in modern times,
through a curated curriculum

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.580 align:middle line:84%
that allows us to
be able to come

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.490 align:middle line:84%
into our fluorescence, come into
the fullness of our expression,

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:21.330 align:middle line:84%
come into the
fullness of our forms.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To be who
you are, I guess.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Exactly,
at the core of who

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.610 align:middle line:84%
you are, not who
you've been told

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:28.470 align:middle line:84%
you are from the
moment you were born,

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:31.500 align:middle line:84%
but who you actually are
based off of a genetic level.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On Gaia's
Mystery Teachings,

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Theresa Bullard talks about
self mastery and manifestation,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:41.819 align:middle line:84%
many things that you teach the
women in your Mystery School.

00:08:41.819 --> 00:08:45.540 align:middle line:10%
>> True magic happens when we
begin to influence these higher

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.280 align:middle line:10%
planes of causation.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.610 align:middle line:84%
But in order to consciously
influence these higher planes,

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:53.760 align:middle line:84%
we must reach high
states of consciousness.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.970 align:middle line:84%
This is something we can do
by learning to shift our brain

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.820 align:middle line:84%
waves, overcoming
limited thinking,

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.980 align:middle line:84%
and achieving a
state of coherence

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.030 align:middle line:90%
with the quantum field.

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:08.180 align:middle line:84%
As we begin to master how
we perceive and process

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:11.210 align:middle line:84%
information or
energy, such mastery

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.190 align:middle line:84%
doesn't happen through
a single process.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:16.370 align:middle line:84%
We must take a
multidimensional approach.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:19.760 align:middle line:84%
Thankfully, we have many
tools, both modern and ancient,

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.820 align:middle line:84%
to support us in
making this shift.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Some of the tools
include meditation,

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.760 align:middle line:84%
which we use to bring ourselves
into coherence with the zero

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:33.320 align:middle line:84%
point field, activating our DNA
codes which helps us to express

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:37.490 align:middle line:84%
more of our potential
in the physical body,

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:41.420 align:middle line:84%
exercises to expand both our
physical and spiritual senses

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:42.890 align:middle line:90%
and perceptions.

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And these are just a few of
the many tools available to us

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:50.000 align:middle line:84%
to help us become aware of
our multidimensionality.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.660 align:middle line:84%
Daily spiritual practices that
include rituals and energy

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:57.920 align:middle line:84%
exercises are great tools for
harnessing and strengthening

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.030 align:middle line:90%
our will.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Meditation primarily
helps to quiet the mind

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:04.730 align:middle line:90%
and expand consciousness.

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:07.730 align:middle line:84%
Rituals, on the other
hand, are more active way

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:12.380 align:middle line:84%
of directing the flow of energy
and applying our higher will.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And it is our will that directs
our mind, which, in turn,

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.070 align:middle line:90%
influences the quantum field.

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:23.000 align:middle line:84%
If our will is undisciplined,
then our lower mind

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.740 align:middle line:90%
tends to run the show.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And that lower mind
can be a monkey mind

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.660 align:middle line:90%
when it is not well trained.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.520 align:middle line:84%
In the Western Mystery
School tradition,

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.950 align:middle line:84%
we have a daily
affirmation that we use

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.350 align:middle line:90%
to start our ritual practice.

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:42.380 align:middle line:84%
We say, it is by will alone
that I set my mind in motion.

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Just contemplating this one
affirmation on a regular basis

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.460 align:middle line:84%
can reveal many
secrets to self mastery

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.900 align:middle line:90%
and the laws of manifestation.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.890 align:middle line:90%
It is a very important key.

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you practice
some of those techniques?

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.307 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Yeah, the power
of the mind and learning

00:10:59.307 --> 00:11:00.140 align:middle line:90%
how to work with it.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
incredible, isn't it?

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.238 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: As opposed to
it being our master,

00:11:02.238 --> 00:11:05.190 align:middle line:84%
we become the student, and then
also the master of the mind.

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:08.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is incredible.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: It is the
greatest quantum computer

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.990 align:middle line:90%
that no man could ever create.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And when we can
actually understand

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:17.490 align:middle line:84%
the power of the mind,
and how adaptable we are,

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:19.710 align:middle line:84%
and that our external
world is created

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:21.480 align:middle line:84%
from our internal
landscape, and actually

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.960 align:middle line:84%
put more emphasis on refining
our internal narrative,

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.060 align:middle line:84%
our internal relationship
with our mind,

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.920 align:middle line:84%
then we can actually
start to create

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.230 align:middle line:84%
a reality that is a byproduct
of a mastery within.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the
container, the space,

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:37.320 align:middle line:84%
that we hold for women to
fully step into their power,

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.290 align:middle line:84%
to step into their voice, their
expression, their creativity,

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:43.140 align:middle line:84%
and more strengthening
of the feminine principle

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:47.070 align:middle line:84%
because as a society at large,
we put a lot of emphasis

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:48.103 align:middle line:90%
on the masculine energy.

00:11:48.103 --> 00:11:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking
about men and women.

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:51.630 align:middle line:84%
But I'm talking about
the energies, masculine

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:52.440 align:middle line:90%
and feminine.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.400 align:middle line:90%
The masculine--

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, do we.

00:11:55.410 --> 00:12:00.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: --is the hustle,
the do, the make it happen.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.460 align:middle line:84%
However, we override
the feminine principle

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:07.230 align:middle line:84%
of our intuition, our
oracle, our ability

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:11.700 align:middle line:84%
to see beyond the veil, our
magnetism, our receptivity.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.770 align:middle line:84%
There's a very important
essence to activate too.

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And so by empowering women into
their voice, into their truth,

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:21.330 align:middle line:84%
into their expression,
we're restoring the balance

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.670 align:middle line:84%
on the planet of the masculine
and feminine principles

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:27.150 align:middle line:84%
so that we can actually create
a more harmonious reality

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.280 align:middle line:84%
for our children and
our children's children.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.238 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people
do you think have been

00:12:31.238 --> 00:12:33.370 align:middle line:90%
through your Mystery School?

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.443 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Well, we only
birthed it a year ago.

00:12:35.443 --> 00:12:36.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's not old.

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: And we've run three
online programs so far.

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:40.330 align:middle line:84%
I would say about
100 women so far

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:41.290 align:middle line:90%
have gone through the program.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:43.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you've seen
dramatic change in results,

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:44.310 align:middle line:90%
haven't you.

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:48.263 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: It is such a blessing
to witness a woman give birth

00:12:48.263 --> 00:12:49.180 align:middle line:90%
to her own full power.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.388 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I'd love that.

00:12:50.388 --> 00:12:52.090 align:middle line:90%
There is a word called alchemy.

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:54.610 align:middle line:84%
When I was younger,
I thought it was

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:59.210 align:middle line:84%
some guy in a little laboratory
in ancient days pouring things,

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:01.180 align:middle line:84%
trying to make gold
and everything.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.640 align:middle line:90%
What does alchemy mean to you?

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: I like to refer to
alchemy on an emotional level

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.000 align:middle line:90%
in the sense of--

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.150 align:middle line:84%
with being human, we
have the full spectrum

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:14.150 align:middle line:90%
of the human experience.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.317 align:middle line:84%
So we have the dark side
of the moon, the light side

00:13:16.317 --> 00:13:18.280 align:middle line:84%
of the moon, meaning
we have the challenging

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.080 align:middle line:84%
emotions, like the
grief, and the shame,

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.970 align:middle line:84%
and the unworthiness,
as much as we

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:24.400 align:middle line:84%
have the joy, and the
play, and the creativity,

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.750 align:middle line:90%
for the most part.

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:27.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, for me,
emotional alchemy is

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.790 align:middle line:84%
to recognize, OK, I have grief,
or I have been given something

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:33.010 align:middle line:84%
very challenging in
my life, like you

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:35.500 align:middle line:84%
have a hereditary hearing
disorder, for example.

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, it is up to us to recognize
that we are actually not

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.510 align:middle line:90%
a victim of our circumstance.

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:45.020 align:middle line:84%
But we can utilize the
challenge and turn it

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.550 align:middle line:90%
into something beautiful.

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:47.840 align:middle line:90%
And that is alchemy--

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.720 align:middle line:84%
taking something that is lead
and turning it into gold.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.780 align:middle line:84%
So everybody on
this planet has been

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:56.300 align:middle line:84%
dealt something challenging
in their life, something

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.730 align:middle line:90%
that is really stumped them.

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:01.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we do with it
is what will actually

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:03.680 align:middle line:84%
allow us to leave a legacy
of beauty in our wake

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.290 align:middle line:84%
long after we've gone,
depending on our relationship

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:08.690 align:middle line:84%
with turning what is challenging
into something beautiful

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:09.987 align:middle line:90%
and sharing it with the world.

00:14:09.987 --> 00:14:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Blu, on a
Gaia program called

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:15.350 align:middle line:84%
"The Initiation," Matias De
Stefano talks about free will

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:18.200 align:middle line:84%
and alchemy much
like what you have.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:23.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Free will is not exactly
as we have taught it to be.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:27.380 align:middle line:10%
It's not just our ability to
choose our destiny in our life

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.830 align:middle line:10%
and what we are willing to do.

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:33.980 align:middle line:84%
But what really free
will is talking about

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:38.600 align:middle line:84%
is our ability to
create our own life.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:43.940 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that you are someone
that is writing a story

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:45.140 align:middle line:90%
to make a movie.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:48.950 align:middle line:90%
And then you wrote the story.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And you have the
whole idea of what you

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.530 align:middle line:90%
want to tell about this story.

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to
make the costumes.

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
to see who is going

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:02.150 align:middle line:84%
to build all the backstage, who
is going to build everything

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:04.760 align:middle line:90%
so it would seem real.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.550 align:middle line:84%
Then you have to learn
your own character.

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:10.880 align:middle line:84%
You have to build the character,
which is your personality.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And from there you need
to learn how to act.

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And once you are on the play,
once you are being filmed,

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.560 align:middle line:90%
you stop being yourself.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.300 align:middle line:90%
You become the character.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And you can't do
whatever you want

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:28.010 align:middle line:84%
when you are filming it because
otherwise the story won't

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:28.980 align:middle line:90%
make sense.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.970 align:middle line:10%
And that is why you don't have
free will because you already

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:35.750 align:middle line:10%
decided to live what
you have written.

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And that is why from the
fifth dimension, the ones that

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:40.850 align:middle line:84%
are seeing all the
script of the movie,

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:45.140 align:middle line:84%
they can change some words in
order to it make more sense.

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And that is the holograms from
the fifth dimension helping

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:52.850 align:middle line:84%
us to evolve and be
aware of our evolution.

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:55.370 align:middle line:84%
A lot of beings in
the third dimension

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:57.860 align:middle line:84%
are able to understand
how this works.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:01.190 align:middle line:84%
These beings were
humans that were

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:04.010 align:middle line:84%
so in touch with the
mother, with the nature,

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:08.480 align:middle line:84%
that the creators, the
elemental beings, the fairies,

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:13.820 align:middle line:84%
the gnomes, every being that
was coming from the darkness

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:18.470 align:middle line:84%
that we see with colors,
the creators of our nature,

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:21.350 align:middle line:84%
they could speak to them,
so they could understand

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:23.270 align:middle line:90%
how to transform realities.

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:25.040 align:middle line:90%
Those are the alchemists.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:29.120 align:middle line:10%
In history, we call them
the druids, the physicians,

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.630 align:middle line:10%
the architects, the
alchemists of history.

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:36.470 align:middle line:84%
So we have a few of
them in every culture.

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:41.100 align:middle line:84%
The shamans for North America
and Siberia and South America,

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:45.050 align:middle line:84%
they all can understand
how reality works.

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And they can transform
these realities.

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:51.290 align:middle line:84%
They can open these portals
to create new realities

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:54.290 align:middle line:84%
from nothing, from
the sixth dimension,

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:59.510 align:middle line:84%
by using the ether that connects
us all to create patterns

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:01.430 align:middle line:90%
in the outside.

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think Matias might
be a reincarnated old sooth

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:08.390 align:middle line:84%
from way back when because
he's got a lot of knowledge

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:09.619 align:middle line:90%
for a young man, doesn't he?

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:11.869 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: I mean, he's remembering
all of his past lives,

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:14.869 align:middle line:84%
so according to him, we've
lived many, many, many.

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that he has
memory from all of them

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.849 align:middle line:84%
allows him to encompass
a large amount of wisdom

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:21.217 align:middle line:90%
in a very youthful human.

00:17:21.217 --> 00:17:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did you think
of what he was saying?

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.859 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: I resonate very
deeply with his message.

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And when I say resonate, I mean
that my body feels at peace

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.250 align:middle line:84%
and it feels a remembrance
when I hear his words.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:32.880 align:middle line:90%
And I do completely agree.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.080 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we are
playing out a movie.

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.430 align:middle line:90%
And we are the main role.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:38.570 align:middle line:90%
We are also the narrator.

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:41.120 align:middle line:90%
We think 60,000 thoughts a day.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And our thoughts are
creating a projection map out

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:45.960 align:middle line:84%
on our reality in
which we live into.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And so when we
can actually start

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:49.730 align:middle line:84%
to shift the narrative,
our internal conversation,

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:54.230 align:middle line:84%
into an empowered story that we
place on subjectively what is,

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:57.320 align:middle line:84%
then we actually start to
live a very empowered reality.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Blu, why
is it that people

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:02.420 align:middle line:84%
seem to be so
disjointed, and that you

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:06.500 align:middle line:84%
need schools like yours,
people like Matias,

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.190 align:middle line:90%
to put things back together?

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:10.512 align:middle line:90%
Why are people so disjointed?

00:18:10.512 --> 00:18:12.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Well, I believe
that the stories that we

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:14.420 align:middle line:84%
have told ourselves
about this reality

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:17.210 align:middle line:84%
that we find ourselves in didn't
necessarily start with us.

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:19.170 align:middle line:84%
But from the moment
that we're born,

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:22.700 align:middle line:84%
we have been told by our mother,
and our father, and the people

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.550 align:middle line:84%
that we are around the stories
that they have picked up maybe

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:27.560 align:middle line:84%
from their mother
and their father that

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.970 align:middle line:84%
have been projected onto us
around what this reality is

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:30.770 align:middle line:90%
based off of.

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: However, then we
all get to a certain point

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.390 align:middle line:84%
where we're asking, but
they've got to be more to life.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:37.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel fulfilled.

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:38.810 align:middle line:90%
I feel sad.

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:40.490 align:middle line:90%
I feel disconnected.

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And so the invitation, the
spaces that we are creating,

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:45.380 align:middle line:84%
is not to listen to
the story that we

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:47.510 align:middle line:90%
tell about this experience.

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:49.280 align:middle line:84%
It's about empowering
individuals

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.100 align:middle line:84%
to listen so deeply to
actually their own heart,

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:54.800 align:middle line:84%
and their own pulse, and
their own highest excitement

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.660 align:middle line:84%
that they create their
world from the inside out.

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
witnessed miracles, Blu?

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Yeah, I believe in
miracles, my whole heart

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:02.920 align:middle line:90%
and soul.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.140 align:middle line:84%
I start to notice
them on a daily basis.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:05.718 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What creates a miracle?

00:19:05.718 --> 00:19:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: A miracle is
something that the mind can't

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.760 align:middle line:84%
wrap wrap itself around,
that it can't comprehend

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.040 align:middle line:90%
or be analytically understood.

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And yet it happened because you
can see it, or you can feel it.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:18.860 align:middle line:90%
And true healing has happened.

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.450 align:middle line:90%
And I have seen many miracles.

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And I believe in the
miraculous nature

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.930 align:middle line:90%
of what it means to be alive.

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:30.183 align:middle line:84%
Even the fact that women
have the stargate enterprise

00:19:30.183 --> 00:19:31.600 align:middle line:84%
between their legs
where they have

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:35.140 align:middle line:84%
the gift of being able to birth
a child that was a nonphysical

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.972 align:middle line:90%
being into the physical realm--

00:19:36.972 --> 00:19:37.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a wonder.

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:39.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: It's a miracle.

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And yet, what, there's just over
8 billion people on the planet,

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:44.810 align:middle line:84%
or just under 8 billion
people on the planet.

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And every single person, from
the day dot was a miracle.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And yet we become
so disconnected

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:53.020 align:middle line:84%
with the miraculous essence
of what it means to be human.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My granddaughter
who is married

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:57.880 align:middle line:84%
and has two lovely
little kids has

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.160 align:middle line:90%
made me a great grandfather.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.680 align:middle line:90%
And I see their progression--

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.720 align:middle line:90%
they live in St. Louis--

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.990 align:middle line:84%
through Instagram, where
she posts little pictures

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:09.220 align:middle line:90%
and little videos.

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing, for example,
the baby who's one years old

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.100 align:middle line:84%
now has gone from this little
infant that could do nothing

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.320 align:middle line:84%
to now where she's
really developing

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.230 align:middle line:84%
her own little personality,
and she's jumping, around

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:25.960 align:middle line:84%
and she's just starting
to walk a little bit.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.762 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:20:27.762 --> 00:20:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: It is a miracle.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.200 align:middle line:90%
And that always all around us.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.238 align:middle line:84%
However, we get so
blindsighted by feeling

00:20:33.238 --> 00:20:34.780 align:middle line:84%
that we're supposed
to be doing more,

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:36.400 align:middle line:84%
and I'm supposed to
be somewhere else,

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.067 align:middle line:84%
and I'm running a
story of unworthiness,

00:20:38.067 --> 00:20:39.940 align:middle line:84%
that we block ourselves
up from seeing

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.032 align:middle line:90%
the miracles all around us.

00:20:42.032 --> 00:20:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you do
when you are confronted

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:47.380 align:middle line:90%
by somebody who's negative?

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Well, first
and foremost, I

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:51.580 align:middle line:84%
feel like people that
are in a negative spiral,

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.830 align:middle line:84%
in a negative story,
are actually the ones

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:55.150 align:middle line:90%
that need love the most.

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And for the most part, people
are repelled-- or there's a

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.682 align:middle line:84%
Repellence from people that are
running a negative narrative--

00:21:01.682 --> 00:21:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, you can feel it.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:03.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: Exactly.

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And so usually people
distance themselves.

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:08.830 align:middle line:84%
However, that negative
narrative is probably

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:13.480 align:middle line:84%
deeply rooted in unworthiness
or self-loathing.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I call them
psychic vampires.

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: And then
so the energy will

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.640 align:middle line:90%
be sucked out of the space.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You feel exhausted
standing next to them.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Even if they're
not talking to you,

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:26.260 align:middle line:84%
you just don't know
why you're drained.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Mm-hmm, and that is based
off of the nonvisible realms.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.267 align:middle line:84%
This is the
extrasensory perception

00:21:33.267 --> 00:21:34.600 align:middle line:90%
that I was talking about before.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.980 align:middle line:90%
We pick up on these things.

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:39.370 align:middle line:84%
So you can also see, if you
look at somebody's reality,

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:41.980 align:middle line:84%
the external world
is a byproduct

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.430 align:middle line:90%
of their internal narrative.

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:45.190 align:middle line:84%
So if their external
world is full

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:50.470 align:middle line:84%
of fractured relationships,
stress, chaos, drama, gossip,

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.570 align:middle line:84%
that external world
is a reflection

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:54.880 align:middle line:84%
of the internal narrative
they are telling themselves

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.955 align:middle line:84%
and how they are relating
to the world at large.

00:21:56.955 --> 00:21:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: So if you
want to create a life

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:03.220 align:middle line:84%
of true alignment, of miracles,
of beauty, of synchronicities,

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:08.290 align:middle line:84%
of gracefulness, then the best
gift we can ever give ourselves

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:10.900 align:middle line:84%
is to start looking
within, meditation

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.370 align:middle line:84%
practices, different
technologies,

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:15.220 align:middle line:84%
different tools, containers
like Fluorescence, or different.

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.380 align:middle line:84%
There's many, many, many,
many different spaces

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.170 align:middle line:84%
that give us the
permission to actually feel

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:23.050 align:middle line:84%
what is going on internally, as
opposed to distract ourselves

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:26.710 align:middle line:84%
away because when we give
ourselves the courage

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:29.140 align:middle line:84%
to feel what is
actually there, then

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.390 align:middle line:84%
we actually return our
power back to ourselves.

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:33.268 align:middle line:84%
And that is the world
that we will create.

00:22:33.268 --> 00:22:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had
mentioned ayahuasca.

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: Mm-hmm.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:38.357 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a plant
medicine basically, isn't it?

00:22:38.357 --> 00:22:40.135 align:middle line:90%
How valuable are they?

00:22:40.135 --> 00:22:42.094 align:middle line:90%
How powerful are they?

00:22:42.094 --> 00:22:46.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Whoo, even just you
saying the word ayahuasca,

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:49.120 align:middle line:84%
it brings up floods of
emotions and feelings.

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:55.780 align:middle line:84%
She is a female medicine,
originating from Peru

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:59.890 align:middle line:84%
predominantly, and various
places around the world,

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:01.790 align:middle line:84%
working with
Indigenous cultures.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And she is a combination of
a vine and a shakuna leaf.

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And it is brewed
over a long period.

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:13.540 align:middle line:84%
It is a very tedious process
to brew this medicine.

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very, very, very
strong psychedelic tea.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's thick, isn't it?

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Thick, the taste
is really intense.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.247 align:middle line:90%
You know it's medicine.

00:23:26.247 --> 00:23:27.580 align:middle line:90%
When you take a taste, it's ugh.

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:28.455 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it gooey?

00:23:28.455 --> 00:23:29.255 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: Sorry?

00:23:29.255 --> 00:23:30.137 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it gooey?

00:23:30.137 --> 00:23:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's gooey.

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:31.360 align:middle line:90%
It's thick.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.700 align:middle line:84%
It depends who's made
it, where it's come from,

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.200 align:middle line:90%
where was the vine grown.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And it will access very
strong psychedelic visuals

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:46.060 align:middle line:84%
as well as highlight all
of the unresolved parts

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.500 align:middle line:90%
of our subconscious mind.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On the Gaia
program "Psychedelica"

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.640 align:middle line:90%
guess what they talk about?

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.290 align:middle line:90%
Ayahuasca.

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:57.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Ayahuasca was the only
psychedelic session where I had

00:23:57.250 --> 00:24:02.260 align:middle line:10%
a sense of a personal therapist,
kind of like a spiritual guide

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.990 align:middle line:10%
of some sort,
which I didn't see.

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:09.280 align:middle line:84%
But it was a very clear
sense of energetic presence

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:12.970 align:middle line:84%
and telepathic
communication that's

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:16.300 align:middle line:84%
guiding me in a very specific
way through my sessions,

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:19.420 align:middle line:84%
looking what I should look
at, what I should work on.

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And if I didn't
do it, it sort of

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:25.810 align:middle line:84%
returned and was putting
some pressure on me to do it.

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:29.530 align:middle line:84%
It had an intention for
me, what I should do,

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:31.870 align:middle line:84%
what I should become
in that session.

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:34.870 align:middle line:84%
>> The Indigenous of the
Amazon refer to it as Mother

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:39.160 align:middle line:84%
Ayahuasca, known by some to be
the divine feminine principle

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.470 align:middle line:90%
and the first woman of creation.

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:44.900 align:middle line:84%
The Ayahueasceros,
or healers, say

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.060 align:middle line:84%
it is her that we
commune with for guidance

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:51.060 align:middle line:84%
before, during, and
after drinking ayahuasca.

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:54.660 align:middle line:84%
It is that allows us access
to all that we've forgotten

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.330 align:middle line:90%
in this life and all others.

00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:59.640 align:middle line:84%
However, in the
initial ceremonies

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.430 align:middle line:84%
where people are introduced
to this resident spirit, It.

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Can be painful and
quite confrontational

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:07.890 align:middle line:84%
because so much of our
trauma is unknown to us.

00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And therefore we rarely
acknowledge our baggage

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:12.010 align:middle line:90%
as a part of us.

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So what ayahuasca does is
she goes through the physical

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:20.010 align:middle line:84%
and energetic body and emotional
bodies that are totally

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:20.910 align:middle line:90%
interconnected.

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:24.930 align:middle line:10%
And she's going through.

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:29.530 align:middle line:10%
Our traumas are
held in the tissues.

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:34.210 align:middle line:10%
And so she's going and
ripping out that stuff.

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:35.430 align:middle line:10%
And so it hurts--

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:38.310 align:middle line:10%
whether it be physical
through nauseousness, or even

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:43.530 align:middle line:10%
actual pain or sometimes we
have that stuff in our thought

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:45.060 align:middle line:10%
processes, our patterns.

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And so we're holding
on to the stuff,

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:50.100 align:middle line:84%
and ayahuasca is opening,
opening, opening,

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:52.440 align:middle line:90%
and pulling that stuff out.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
tried ayahuasca?

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:55.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: Oh, yeah.

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does it do to you?

00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:00.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Whoo, probably,
again, a better question

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:04.170 align:middle line:90%
is, what does it not do to you?

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, how the setup of
the ceremony is that you have

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:09.990 align:middle line:84%
either a maestro or
maestra-- shaman--

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:12.300 align:middle line:84%
that will facilitate
and serve the medicine.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:15.552 align:middle line:84%
And then you sit in a circle,
depending on where it is,

00:26:15.552 --> 00:26:17.010 align:middle line:84%
but usually it's
called the maloca.

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And you have your
own individual mat.

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:20.655 align:middle line:90%
And you go up.

00:26:20.655 --> 00:26:21.780 align:middle line:90%
And you drink the medicine.

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately it's
not one size fits all.

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:27.180 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be unique
to every single person.

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Just like we have our
own unique fingerprint,

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.210 align:middle line:84%
we have our own
unique traumas, we

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:32.430 align:middle line:84%
have to quickly
experience-- sorry?

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it
hit you quickly?

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:37.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: On average
for me personally

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:40.550 align:middle line:84%
it will hit within
anywhere between 15 minutes

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:43.450 align:middle line:90%
to 45 minutes to an hour.

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And depending on the lineage
that the facilitator,

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:50.550 align:middle line:84%
the shaman, the maestra
or the maestro come from,

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:52.080 align:middle line:90%
they will sing icaros.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And icaros are
incredible technology

00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:58.900 align:middle line:84%
of a chant that speaks
directly to the medicine.

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give us an
example of this chant.

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:01.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: Of an icaro?

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:02.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Well, I don't
personally sing icaros.

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:05.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Come on, give it a try.

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Well, it sounds
a little bit like--

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:09.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.550 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING].

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:17.060 align:middle line:90%


00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a great voice.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.297 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: Thank you.

00:27:19.297 --> 00:27:20.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
what does that do?

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: So it's directly
speaking to the medicine.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And they will-- for example,
in the Shipibo lineage,

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:28.640 align:middle line:90%
they will speak in Shipibo.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And it will say bring me
into the center of my seat.

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:35.270 align:middle line:90%
Connect me with my highest self.

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And clean me, clean
me all that is not

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:38.750 align:middle line:90%
of the frequency of my heart.

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:39.970 align:middle line:90%
But it will be in Shipibo.

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:40.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How exciting.

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: So it speaks
to the medicine.

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And the icaros is
directly linked.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And then the medicine
almost like a snake charmer.

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.410 align:middle line:84%
The snake charmer
will play the music.

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And then the snake will
be charmed by the music.

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:55.400 align:middle line:84%
The icaros is directly
connected with the medicine

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.890 align:middle line:84%
and will go into the
psychic-shamanic field

00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:01.010 align:middle line:84%
to clear away all that is
not serving, whether it's

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:05.810 align:middle line:84%
from sexual abuse, to
addictions, to depression,

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:08.450 align:middle line:90%
to strained relationships.

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:10.970 align:middle line:84%
She will highlight what's
in our subconscious that

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:11.880 align:middle line:90%
needs healing.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And the only way out into
our healing is through.

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:18.890 align:middle line:84%
So she's going to take
you right into the deepest

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:22.520 align:middle line:84%
places of our subconscious
mind and illuminate it

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:26.390 align:middle line:84%
from the inside out, and
then allow us to purge.

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, ayahuasca
is a purgatory medicine.

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:33.080 align:middle line:84%
So there will be
purging experiences.

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.670 align:middle line:90%
And purging, I mean vomiting.

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And what this is doing
on an energetic level,

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:40.220 align:middle line:84%
it's clearing out those stories
because when something--

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That doesn't
sound too fun.

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:44.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: It's definitely not fun.

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:46.920 align:middle line:84%
You don't go to drink
ayahuasca necessarily to--

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:47.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Have fun.

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Get high and
to have a party.

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:53.180 align:middle line:84%
Maybe she'll take you
into states of bliss.

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:54.410 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that's what's needed.

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: However,
for the most part,

00:28:56.670 --> 00:29:01.670 align:middle line:84%
it's really actively
descending into your challenge.

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
dark side of this?

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Yes, just like
there's the dark side

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:07.310 align:middle line:90%
of the human nature.

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:09.890 align:middle line:84%
We have to make peace
with our own darkness

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:13.950 align:middle line:84%
to actually reclaim the
light as our default.

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And so, for example, if
there's a deep-rooted jealousy

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:22.100 align:middle line:84%
or unworthiness,
we must face it.

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And ayahuasca has
an incredible gift

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.965 align:middle line:84%
of actually allowing
ourselves to sit

00:29:27.965 --> 00:29:33.080 align:middle line:84%
in the face of that story, to
actually rewrite the narrative,

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.990 align:middle line:84%
and then the alchemy
of transmuting it

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:39.140 align:middle line:84%
into more space for a new
narrative of beauty, love,

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:40.220 align:middle line:90%
and unity to be born.

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
very spiritual, Blu?

00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Do you think that I'm
spiritual from the questions

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:44.840 align:middle line:90%
that I've answered you?

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:45.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I would say yes.

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: I'd say so.

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:49.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If I were a betting
person, I would say that.

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:51.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: You'd bet on me
to be a spiritual human.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:52.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, I do.

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: I believe we're all
spiritual humans, whether we

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.500 align:middle line:84%
tap into it, whether
we allow ourselves

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:00.080 align:middle line:84%
to strengthen that muscle,
that's a different narrative.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.890 align:middle line:84%
However, by very nature of just
being human and being alive,

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:05.010 align:middle line:90%
we're connected to spirit.

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:05.810 align:middle line:90%
We have our mind.

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:06.570 align:middle line:90%
We have our body.

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:07.528 align:middle line:90%
And we have our spirit.

00:30:07.528 --> 00:30:09.500 align:middle line:90%
So we're all spiritual beings.

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:12.380 align:middle line:84%
It's just, do we strengthen
that muscle in the gym,

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:15.080 align:middle line:90%
or do we sort of skip that part?

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you ever get
assistance from spirit guides?

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: Do I get assistance?

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yes, every day I
sit in front of my altar.

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And my altar is a sacred
place, a place of beauty,

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:26.870 align:middle line:84%
where the four directions
are represented

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:29.480 align:middle line:84%
and where I sit in
silence and I listen.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
greatest teachings

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:33.620 align:middle line:84%
that I have learned
from my hearing loss

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:35.450 align:middle line:90%
is, where am I not listening?

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:37.580 align:middle line:84%
So I spent a lot
of time in silence

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:39.770 align:middle line:90%
listening to the subtleties.

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:44.858 align:middle line:84%
And I have different spirit
guides, my ancestors,

00:30:44.858 --> 00:30:47.150 align:middle line:84%
all of those that have shared
my blood that have walked

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:49.880 align:middle line:90%
before me, different animals.

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:53.355 align:middle line:84%
And I would say Princess
Diana is one of my guides.

00:30:53.355 --> 00:30:54.155 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really.

00:30:54.155 --> 00:30:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Yeah, she comes in
quite often in meditations.

00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How is how
does this occur?

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:02.840 align:middle line:84%
What mode are you in
for this to happen?

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Well, for me to be
able to hear the subtleties,

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:07.100 align:middle line:90%
I have to be silent.

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And so meditation, just sitting
in silence, and just listening.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes just a visual
of her face or her embrace

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:16.820 align:middle line:90%
will come in.

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll just
be listening, OK,

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:21.020 align:middle line:84%
what are you here
to share with me?

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And she was somebody
that used her voice

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:27.830 align:middle line:84%
in a way that encouraged to
be a queen of people's hearts,

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:28.710 align:middle line:90%
to love people.

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:30.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's very special.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: And so she
is an archetype

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:35.000 align:middle line:84%
that supports me to come
and sit on a show like this

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.410 align:middle line:90%
and to speak from my heart.

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is, Blu,
a darkness retreat?

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:41.410 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:42.792 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't sound too fun.

00:31:42.792 --> 00:31:45.125 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Whoo, it's definitely
another one of those things

00:31:45.125 --> 00:31:47.210 align:middle line:84%
where it's like, I don't
think I'm going here

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:48.680 align:middle line:90%
for the intention to have fun.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.017 align:middle line:84%
I think I would go for
an ecstatic dance party

00:31:51.017 --> 00:31:53.100 align:middle line:84%
if I'm going to go with
the intention to have fun.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.560 align:middle line:84%
If I'm going into
a darkness retreat,

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to face off with
all parts of my subconcious.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:57.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are they?

00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:57.980 align:middle line:90%
What Is it?

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: So there is a
darkness tree in Oregon.

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And it is a manmade
tiny little hobbit

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:13.970 align:middle line:84%
home with a door that goes doo,
doo, doo, down into the Earth.

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And it is a room where
there's just a bed, a bathtub,

00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:19.340 align:middle line:90%
a meditation mat, and a toilet.

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:20.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Underground.

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:22.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Underground,
you are in the Earth.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:25.557 align:middle line:84%
And if I was to scream,
no one would hear me

00:32:25.557 --> 00:32:27.140 align:middle line:84%
because I am in the
middle of nowhere.

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are
you in this place?

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:30.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: Why am I in there?

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, I believe that
as humans we are

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:36.180 align:middle line:90%
oversaturated with distraction.

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:38.160 align:middle line:90%
We have our cell phones.

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And the amount of
information, input,

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:44.320 align:middle line:84%
that is happening, from the
moment we wake up to the moment

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.120 align:middle line:90%
we go to sleep.

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you go down there,
no radio, no television,

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:48.320 align:middle line:90%
no phone.

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: You are in
the pitch black.

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.350 align:middle line:90%
You cannot see anything.

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:56.830 align:middle line:84%
I've never been in that
much darkness, no noise,

00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:58.692 align:middle line:90%
there's no Wi-Fi signal.

00:32:58.692 --> 00:33:00.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you see your
hand in front of you?

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: No, you
can't see anything.

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.180 align:middle line:90%
It is pitch black.

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:04.950 align:middle line:84%
There is no difference if
you have your eyes open

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:05.783 align:middle line:90%
or your eyes closed.

00:33:05.783 --> 00:33:08.293 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You just feel
for the bed and lie down.

00:33:08.293 --> 00:33:10.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Acquainting myself
with my environment.

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:11.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long do
you stay in there?

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:13.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: I stayed in that for
four days and four nights.

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:15.295 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Four days
and four nights?

00:33:15.295 --> 00:33:16.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: Yes, George.

00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you find
food and stuff like that?

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: So there's food
that's delivered once a day.

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And there is a box on
the wall from the inside

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.990 align:middle line:90%
and the outside.

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you open it?

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:27.555 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: There are two doors.

00:33:27.555 --> 00:33:28.960 align:middle line:84%
So they open and
put the food in.

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And then they close it so
there's no light leaks.

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And then you open
it from this side--

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:34.545 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And no human
contact, I guess.

00:33:34.545 --> 00:33:35.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: No human contact.

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:36.650 align:middle line:90%
So

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:38.983 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you're done
after these four days and four

00:33:38.983 --> 00:33:43.550 align:middle line:84%
nights, what has
happened to you?

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:46.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: I really believe that
the switch has flipped from the

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:48.640 align:middle line:90%
doing mind to the being mind.

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we are
called human beings,

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:57.370 align:middle line:84%
but actually we have forgotten
as a society of what it truly

00:33:57.370 --> 00:33:58.390 align:middle line:90%
means to be.

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:02.750 align:middle line:84%
There is such a restlessness of
just, must do the next thing,

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:03.550 align:middle line:90%
must accomplish.

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:06.130 align:middle line:84%
When I'm doing, then
I am successful.

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:08.080 align:middle line:84%
When I am not doing,
then I am then

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:10.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm not being a successful
human in society.

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:14.840 align:middle line:84%
There's this deeply ingrained
belief, and it's exhausting.

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:18.010 align:middle line:90%
And I believe that--

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:20.679 align:middle line:84%
it took me a couple of days
to really get over the hump.

00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:23.199 align:middle line:84%
But after-- I would say on
the morning of day three,

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:26.260 align:middle line:84%
there was a deep sense
of internal peace

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:29.679 align:middle line:84%
that I accessed where I
would go into meditation.

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was at complete
peace with the nothingness.

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:36.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I, actually,
I think I'd go nuts.

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Well, I
think that there is

00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:45.125 align:middle line:84%
an element of raaah, that is the
hump to get into the stillness.

00:34:45.125 --> 00:34:46.750 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say that
it's for everybody.

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:48.040 align:middle line:90%
It's super challenging.

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:52.659 align:middle line:84%
And my level of gratitude
on the other side of life,

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:54.100 align:middle line:90%
I felt like a newborn baby.

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:56.739 align:middle line:84%
I was hearing the birds for
the first time, the feeling

00:34:56.739 --> 00:34:59.290 align:middle line:84%
of the sun on my
face, having this able

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:03.460 align:middle line:84%
body and this incredible quantum
computer, which we call a body,

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:07.990 align:middle line:84%
to actually live my life, these
human connections, the feeling

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:11.020 align:middle line:84%
of the leaves crunching
under my feet,

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:13.240 align:middle line:84%
the things that we
are so distracted by

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.152 align:middle line:84%
and we take for granted
every single day.

00:35:15.152 --> 00:35:16.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or never notice.

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:18.705 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Or never notice because
we've got the blinders on.

00:35:18.705 --> 00:35:20.710 align:middle line:90%
I need to be doing more--

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:23.110 align:middle line:84%
actually being a human
being and recognizing

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:25.210 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of magnetism
is born when we

00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:27.100 align:middle line:90%
can be at peace with stillness.

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Matias De Stefano has
words of wisdom once again.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:36.120 align:middle line:10%
>> We in our planet and in
many other planets had not word

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:37.650 align:middle line:10%
for good and bad.

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:40.140 align:middle line:84%
We all the time
called the positive

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:41.730 align:middle line:90%
and the negative forces.

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And the better way to understand
how these two forces work

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:53.430 align:middle line:84%
is if you have in a room a
light and you put yourself

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:54.960 align:middle line:90%
in the center.

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:59.490 align:middle line:84%
As closest you get to the
light, the shadow behind you

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:01.170 align:middle line:90%
will be bigger.

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:04.800 align:middle line:84%
So the darkness is
surrounding you.

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And as close you get
to the main point

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.440 align:middle line:84%
of light, which is
the purpose you had,

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:14.940 align:middle line:84%
the goal, to touch the other
perspective of yourself,

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:18.210 align:middle line:90%
darkness will go all around you.

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:21.450 align:middle line:84%
The light and the darkness
were just projections.

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And the only way you can
see both as a creation

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:26.880 align:middle line:90%
is in the center.

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:33.870 align:middle line:84%
If you go through light or you
go through dark, one of those

00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:35.940 align:middle line:90%
will embrace you.

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And then you will be lost in
one of those perspectives.

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:47.220 align:middle line:84%
So you have all these two
forces to create realities.

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:51.210 align:middle line:84%
But if you move
towards one of them

00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:54.600 align:middle line:84%
and you're lost in one
of them, the universe

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.970 align:middle line:90%
will hit you from behind.

00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's why to
one of those forces,

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:05.280 align:middle line:84%
we call the negative and the
bad energies of the universe.

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:08.070 align:middle line:84%
The bad energies of
the universe are just

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:11.070 align:middle line:84%
your own shadows
trying to remember you,

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:13.710 align:middle line:90%
that you are out of your way.

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:17.160 align:middle line:84%
When everything
is going bad, when

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:20.700 align:middle line:84%
the whole forces of the
universe is telling you,

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:24.240 align:middle line:84%
this is not your way, and
suddenly everything goes down,

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:28.860 align:middle line:84%
it's not because there is a
bad force in the universe.

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:33.210 align:middle line:84%
It's because you were so
far away from yourself

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:35.880 align:middle line:84%
that that energy that
we call the mission

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:41.340 align:middle line:84%
is pulling you back so you
can find your center again.

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:47.040 align:middle line:84%
The only reality is unity that's
why you cannot go towards one

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:50.020 align:middle line:84%
of those perspectives
because they are not true.

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:52.050 align:middle line:84%
They are just a
perspective to see yourself

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:54.270 align:middle line:90%
from another dimension.

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:55.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Words of wisdom, Blu.

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: Once again, he's done it.

00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:58.410 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:37:58.410 --> 00:37:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Much like
what you've said.

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:03.197 align:middle line:84%
How do people hear your
"DeJa Blu" podcast?

00:38:03.197 --> 00:38:04.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: How do they listen to it?

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:05.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: You can go on Spotify and
just type in DeJa Vu podcast,

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:10.710 align:middle line:84%
or even just on Google, a
quick little Google search

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:12.900 align:middle line:84%
and it will brrrrrrpppp,
all different platforms.

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:14.430 align:middle line:90%
It's on all streaming platforms.

00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:15.353 align:middle line:90%
Also it's on YouTube.

00:38:15.353 --> 00:38:16.770 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
the videos of it

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:19.560 align:middle line:84%
and see my face with my
guests, I do solo podcasts.

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:22.980 align:middle line:10%
And I have a whole variety
of incredible masters

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:27.090 align:middle line:10%
of their craft on the podcast
going deep into the unspoken

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:29.310 align:middle line:10%
and into the taboo, while
also keeping it light,

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:30.545 align:middle line:10%
and fun, and relatable.

00:38:30.545 --> 00:38:31.920 align:middle line:10%
So that's the
"DeJa Blu" podcast.

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.360 align:middle line:10%
And you can just find
it online anywhere

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.318 align:middle line:10%
if you just type it in.

00:38:34.318 --> 00:38:36.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, continued
success, and thank you

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:38.130 align:middle line:90%
for helping so many people.

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Oh, well
thank you, George.

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:41.202 align:middle line:84%
I'm so grateful for your
time, and your presence,

00:38:41.202 --> 00:38:42.480 align:middle line:90%
and your brilliant question.

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.190 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: She's got
an incredible energy,

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:47.160 align:middle line:10%
and you can just feel
it because of the people

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.140 align:middle line:10%
she has helped over the years.

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:53.060 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:57.000 align:middle line:90%
