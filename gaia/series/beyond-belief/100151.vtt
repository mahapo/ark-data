00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.210 align:middle line:84%
>>And I think many
people today don't

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.418 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:09.418 --> 00:00:11.502 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:11.502 --> 00:00:13.220 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.230 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.470 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.220 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
we've got Chad Lewis

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.102 align:middle line:10%
with us right now-- paranormal
researcher and noted author.

00:00:30.102 --> 00:00:31.560 align:middle line:84%
How many books out
there now, Chad?

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.959 align:middle line:90%
18?

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:32.759 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAD LEWIS: 18.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:33.675 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:00:33.675 --> 00:00:35.874 align:middle line:84%
You keep pumping
them out, don't you?

00:00:35.874 --> 00:00:37.290 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
the paranormal

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.970 align:middle line:90%
on this portion of the show.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.370 align:middle line:84%
How did you get involved in
the paranormal aspect of this?

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: My background
is in psychology.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.560 align:middle line:10%
And as an undergraduate
student, I

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.890 align:middle line:10%
was really interested
in people who

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.130 align:middle line:10%
had had experiences and
belief, and why they

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.570 align:middle line:10%
believed in the paranormal.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.260 align:middle line:10%
So through college, I
studied the paranormal,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.300 align:middle line:10%
went out actually
researching, investigating.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And I actually did my master's
thesis on students' belief

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.510 align:middle line:90%
in the paranormal.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking at why
people believe in some objects

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.740 align:middle line:90%
or subjects and not others.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking at
gender differences,

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.540 align:middle line:84%
and I was looking at educational
differences, or religion

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.440 align:middle line:84%
differences, trying to explain
why people would believe

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.290 align:middle line:90%
in one subject and not another.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And during that course of
that time, I was lecturing,

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.000 align:middle line:84%
and people would often contact
me for their assistance,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.930 align:middle line:84%
that they needed help,
that they had had something

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:31.600 align:middle line:90%
happen to them.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A ghost, hadn't they?

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah, a ghost.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.430 align:middle line:84%
They woke up and there
was a crop formation

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.666 align:middle line:84%
in their backyard,
things of that nature

00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:38.790 align:middle line:90%
that they couldn't explain.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.410 align:middle line:90%
They had no expertise in it.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.110 align:middle line:84%
So they asked if I
would help them out.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you say
"paranormal," what do you mean?

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: For me, it's anything
out of the known, anything that

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.650 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't be.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And I say it shouldn't
be based on what we know.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.800 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it should be.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.640 align:middle line:84%
But based on our education
and our science and medicine,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.110 align:middle line:84%
it's things that
shouldn't happen,

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.050 align:middle line:84%
but yet they do happen--
the supernatural,

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.800 align:middle line:84%
something outside of the
bounds of our known reality.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My late aunt wrote
a book called "Breakthrough

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.550 align:middle line:90%
to Creativity."

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.720 align:middle line:84%
She was a psychiatrist, and
devoted her entire career

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.370 align:middle line:84%
to extrasensory
perception and research.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.290 align:middle line:90%
She called it paranormal.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.060 align:middle line:90%
And I was much younger.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.870 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Shafica Karagulla
was her name.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And I would say Aunt Shafica,
I don't think it's unusual.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.980 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it's paranormal.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.422 align:middle line:84%
I think we're born
with these gifts.

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:38.380 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about
the ghosts or anything,

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.290 align:middle line:90%
but the intuition, the ESP.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And I've always grown up
believing that it's normal, not

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.540 align:middle line:90%
paranormal.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Many of the psychics
or mediums or intuitives

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.300 align:middle line:84%
that I work with will say that
it is not paranormal, it's

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.230 align:middle line:84%
normal-- as you
said, that we all

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.320 align:middle line:84%
have these abilities,
if you will, or powers,

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.870 align:middle line:84%
or some view them as
curses, that you just have

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.470 align:middle line:90%
to feed it, almost, to grow it.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And I myself have zero psychic
ability that I know of.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But it's in you.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.623 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:14.650 align:middle line:84%
The mediums say I should be
able to teach it and progress

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.296 align:middle line:90%
with that.

00:03:15.296 --> 00:03:16.920 align:middle line:84%
I agree that it's
something that should

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.660 align:middle line:84%
be normal rather than
supernatural or paranormal.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The older I get,
Chad, the more fascinated I

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.810 align:middle line:84%
become with the other
side, with death.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.260 align:middle line:84%
In your research, what
have you concluded

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.150 align:middle line:90%
about what that might be?

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Well, of course,
today we're as far from death

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.000 align:middle line:90%
as we've ever been.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Today, we have it
at a funeral parlor,

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.580 align:middle line:84%
or people die in hospitals
or hospice centers.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.670 align:middle line:84%
It used to be you
die in the home,

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.420 align:middle line:84%
and people were more
connected with death.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.110 align:middle line:84%
You'd have the funeral
there, the wake.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.430 align:middle line:84%
You buried the loved
ones in your backyard.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You'd get drunk.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:57.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: And for me--

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Uncle Sam
was a great guy.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:59.333 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:03:59.333 --> 00:04:00.770 align:middle line:84%
It was a celebration,
if you will.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.280 align:middle line:84%
But today, I think we
fear it more than we once

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.890 align:middle line:84%
did in terms of not knowing
what happens on the other side.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.910 align:middle line:84%
But by all accounts,
people that have

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.260 align:middle line:84%
died and have come back explain
the white light and the tunnel

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.909 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:15.950 align:middle line:90%
But we really don't know.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.784 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
last great mysteries

00:04:17.784 --> 00:04:20.310 align:middle line:84%
out there is what
happens when we die.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're all going to die.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.140 align:middle line:84%
But I'd like us to stay on
this planet as long as we

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.670 align:middle line:84%
can-- a fulfilled
life, a happy life.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.220 align:middle line:84%
But when you get to a
certain age, I think,

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.470 align:middle line:90%
you know what, you've done OK.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.990 align:middle line:90%
My father has passed on.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.450 align:middle line:90%
I miss him.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.500 align:middle line:90%
But he was 88 years old.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.700 align:middle line:90%
A great run.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.340 align:middle line:90%
I should be that lucky.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.020 align:middle line:84%
My sister, on the other hand,
passed away a few months ago

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.190 align:middle line:90%
of brain cancer, 56 years old.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.180 align:middle line:90%
That to me, Chad, that's sad.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Because you're not
finished with your life.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.000 align:middle line:84%
She was on the home
stretch, of course,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.110 align:middle line:90%
3/4 of the way in terms of age.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.250 align:middle line:84%
But I think it
was cut too short.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.470 align:middle line:84%
Do people really understand
what the other side is,

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.827 align:middle line:84%
and how it relates
to our own existence?

00:05:16.827 --> 00:05:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: I think many people,
especially in our country,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.850 align:middle line:84%
hold religious beliefs
or spiritual beliefs

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.100 align:middle line:84%
of the afterlife that they may
believe that the afterlife is

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.240 align:middle line:84%
going to be better than the
life here on Earth right now.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And many people live their lives
according to those beliefs.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And there are some people,
of course, obviously

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.238 align:middle line:84%
who believe that when
you're gone, you're gone.

00:05:37.238 --> 00:05:39.440 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing left to you.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And of course, ghosts
are really spirit

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.530 align:middle line:84%
of people that have passed on
into another realm, dimension,

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.120 align:middle line:84%
something, and
they're still there.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And for a lot of
people that I've

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.390 align:middle line:84%
encountered that have had a
ghost experience where they

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.710 align:middle line:84%
believe a loved
one has come back,

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.990 align:middle line:84%
they take great comfort
and solace in that

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.730 align:middle line:84%
thinking that that loved
one is in a better place,

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.370 align:middle line:84%
and they're coming back
to tell them they're OK.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.440 align:middle line:84%
So many people that have
a ghostly experience,

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.250 align:middle line:84%
for them, it's a
great experience.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.180 align:middle line:84%
It gives them belief
and hope that there's

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.000 align:middle line:90%
something more than this life.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some people
believe that religion

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.800 align:middle line:84%
created the afterlife just
for their own self-serving

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.955 align:middle line:90%
purposes.

00:06:19.955 --> 00:06:21.097 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:06:21.097 --> 00:06:21.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Sure.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.610 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people believe that
the best way to control someone

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:25.800 align:middle line:90%
is through religion.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And death, there's
nothing scarier

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.490 align:middle line:84%
than death-- except, for
some people, public speaking.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.900 align:middle line:90%
But outside of that--

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You give
people the feeling

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.850 align:middle line:90%
that there is something else.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Yes, that there's
something else to aspire to.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.990 align:middle line:84%
Don't just live
your life in chaos,

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.031 align:middle line:84%
because you may have to pay
for it in the other realm.

00:06:43.031 --> 00:06:44.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you
think it's possible?

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:45.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: I certainly
think it's possible.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.720 align:middle line:84%
I've met people
that believe they've

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.320 align:middle line:84%
encountered the other
side and have come back.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.320 align:middle line:84%
They've been clinically
dead for minutes,

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.200 align:middle line:84%
and they come back believing
they've experienced it.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.730 align:middle line:84%
You can go to any
bookstore today

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.120 align:middle line:84%
and buy dozens of books of
people who believe they've

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.840 align:middle line:90%
been to heaven and back.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.810 align:middle line:84%
We don't often hear people claim
they've been to hell and back.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.340 align:middle line:84%
That's not a bestseller
like it is for heaven.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've got a book out
with Rosemary Ellen Guiley

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:14.260 align:middle line:84%
called "Talking to the
Dead" about different ways

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.230 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with
the other side.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:19.000 align:middle line:84%
But have you ever
doubted its possibility?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.610 align:middle line:90%
I have.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:24.760 align:middle line:84%
There have been some times where
I have doubted the possibility

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.450 align:middle line:84%
that there is an existence
beyond this physical plane.

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:29.120 align:middle line:90%
Have you?

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yes, of course.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.190 align:middle line:84%
I think if you are to
formulate any belief,

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.520 align:middle line:90%
you have to look at all sides.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.060 align:middle line:84%
You have to establish
what if there's nothing

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.390 align:middle line:90%
out there afterwards.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And for some people,
the idea of eternity

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.520 align:middle line:84%
and whether it's heaven or
hell-- especially heaven--

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.890 align:middle line:84%
seems not a great thing, that
I have to live on forever

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:50.320 align:middle line:90%
and ever and ever.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.100 align:middle line:90%
It seems tiring for some people.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.169 align:middle line:84%
So some people are hoping that
there's nothing after this.

00:07:56.169 --> 00:07:58.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we'll find
out one way or another.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.080 align:middle line:84%
One person once told me,
George, if it exists,

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.420 align:middle line:90%
you'll know about it.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.700 align:middle line:90%
If it doesn't, who cares?

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:05.640 align:middle line:90%
You won't.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.501 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yes.

00:08:06.501 --> 00:08:07.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.240 align:middle line:84%
I think for us, the living,
that's where it's for.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Funerals and burial rituals,
that's all for the living

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:14.980 align:middle line:90%
more so than the dead.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Because if there is an
afterlife and you pass on,

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.046 align:middle line:90%
you're going to be busy.

00:08:21.046 --> 00:08:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, you're going
to have things to do.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.396 align:middle line:90%
And if there's not, you're gone.

00:08:24.396 --> 00:08:25.020 align:middle line:90%
You don't care.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.910 align:middle line:90%
Like you said, that's it.

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:29.430 align:middle line:84%
So I think religion
and burial rituals,

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.409 align:middle line:84%
funeral procedures are all
for us here in the living.

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:34.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chad, in your research,
you've done a lot of work

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.880 align:middle line:90%
on ghosts.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.679 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:40.654 align:middle line:90%
Why are they pestering us?

00:08:40.654 --> 00:08:42.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Well,
many people believe

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.075 align:middle line:84%
ghosts are somebody
who has once lived,

00:08:44.075 --> 00:08:47.400 align:middle line:84%
a human that has once live,
passed on, and for whatever

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:51.440 align:middle line:90%
reason, hasn't ceased existence.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.600 align:middle line:84%
Whether they're in purgatory,
or they're in heaven, hell,

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.680 align:middle line:90%
what be it, they come back.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.130 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're on a different
dimension, different plane,

00:08:59.130 --> 00:08:59.780 align:middle line:90%
different time.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe they don't
even know they're dead.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Exactly.

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And of course, some people
believe in residual hauntings.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.180 align:middle line:84%
It's not so much that it's
somebody who has come back,

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.880 align:middle line:84%
but it's that the
environment has the ability

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.340 align:middle line:90%
to record things.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And whether it's a tragic
suicide, or untimely death,

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.900 align:middle line:84%
that that curses the
area, and somebody who

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.790 align:middle line:84%
comes by on the right
frequency, if you will,

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.420 align:middle line:84%
it's almost as though
it's played back

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.780 align:middle line:84%
on a loop like a
DVD, that people

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.710 align:middle line:84%
see this ghost
doing the same thing

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:29.370 align:middle line:90%
night after night after night.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:32.472 align:middle line:84%
There's no interaction between
the ghost and the witness.

00:09:32.472 --> 00:09:34.430 align:middle line:84%
So many people believe
that you might have just

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.420 align:middle line:84%
been seeing something
that has already happened.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we confuse
demons with ghosts?

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.510 align:middle line:90%
Two different things.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: A lot of people,
believe it or not,

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:47.210 align:middle line:84%
that are very religious will
tell me that they believe that

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:52.564 align:middle line:84%
ghosts are demons coming back
in the guise of a loved one,

00:09:52.564 --> 00:09:53.480 align:middle line:90%
trying to get access--

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:53.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To trick you.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Yeah, the trickster
trying to come back

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:57.970 align:middle line:90%
and to haunt you and get in--

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:58.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Get you soul.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: And no better way to do
than the parted father, mother.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.080 align:middle line:90%
You're going to trust them.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And that belief
usually centers more

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:09.640 align:middle line:84%
on people who are very
religious, whereas others

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.300 align:middle line:84%
believe it's somebody who has
come back that is their flesh

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.900 align:middle line:84%
and blood, that it's really
grandmother coming back.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.916 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think of exorcisms?

00:10:16.916 --> 00:10:18.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: They seem to work.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.990 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not there's
a demon in there

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:24.210 align:middle line:84%
or it's a psychological problem,
they seem to get results.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:27.020 align:middle line:84%
Again, the power of
the mind we don't know.

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.990 align:middle line:84%
So I'm all for people
using exorcisms

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:32.040 align:middle line:90%
or having an exorcist come.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And many people have taken
that step, just not that far.

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:38.740 align:middle line:84%
They've had a priest or a
religious figure in their life

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.420 align:middle line:90%
come and bless their home.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.050 align:middle line:84%
It was very common when you
bought a new house years ago

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.410 align:middle line:84%
to have a religious
person come and bless it,

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:47.160 align:middle line:84%
not because you thought
there were demons,

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.290 align:middle line:84%
but because it
would be good luck,

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.640 align:middle line:84%
and that it would set
you on the right path.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think those beliefs are
kind of waning over the years.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happens,
Chad, if it doesn't work,

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:00.400 align:middle line:84%
if you can't get that
demon out of the body?

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Sometimes in
these exorcisms gone wrong,

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.910 align:middle line:90%
people will die.

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:08.030 align:middle line:84%
Often, they need
medical attention along

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.420 align:middle line:84%
with maybe this
spiritual attention.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.890 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, in
very devout families,

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:16.000 align:middle line:84%
they refuse the medical
attention to go along with it.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.180 align:middle line:84%
So these people
will malnourished.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think you should
combine both of them.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:26.400 align:middle line:84%
If your belief is that a loved
one is possessed by a demon,

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:26.910 align:middle line:90%
great.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:27.960 align:middle line:90%
Have the exorcism.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Have everything you can do
to possibly deal with that.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.310 align:middle line:84%
But also, don't rule out the
other stuff that we have,

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:36.480 align:middle line:90%
the known science and medicine.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And people often ask, when you
go looking for the paranormal,

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.670 align:middle line:84%
do you use Ouija
boards or psychics.

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:44.712 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, not
the Ouija board.

00:11:44.712 --> 00:11:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: And I
always say that when

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.850 align:middle line:84%
you're dealing with the
weird, what's too weird?

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:50.450 align:middle line:90%
Where do you call the line?

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:53.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't personally use it,
but people I work with will.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And some of them have
had great experience.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.980 align:middle line:84%
I have had great
experience using psychics,

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.270 align:middle line:84%
but I've also had
times where you'd

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:02.260 align:middle line:84%
better off bringing
a piece of toast

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.810 align:middle line:84%
and asking that a question,
because the psychics seem

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:06.540 align:middle line:90%
to be so off.

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.690 align:middle line:84%
But again, my point
is that when we're

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:12.050 align:middle line:84%
dealing with these topics
that are a little out there,

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:13.440 align:middle line:90%
what is too weird?

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Is a Ouija board too weird, but
is an infrared camera to weird?

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.650 align:middle line:90%
Where do you draw the line?

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I try to open
myself up to all of it,

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.630 align:middle line:84%
because I don't
know the answers.

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:24.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm left with more questions.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:29.210 align:middle line:84%
So I'm looking for any tool
that might help me solve a case

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:30.690 align:middle line:90%
or get closer to the truth.

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:33.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever been
visited by a dearly departed

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.790 align:middle line:90%
or a friend who has passed on?

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:39.116 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: I haven't had an
encounter with a loved one.

00:12:39.116 --> 00:12:41.480 align:middle line:10%
One of the first
experiences I ever had,

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:45.280 align:middle line:10%
in college, I was visited
by the old hag, the old hag

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.600 align:middle line:10%
syndrome of this hideous
woman that was straddling

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.971 align:middle line:10%
my chest when I was sleeping.

00:12:49.971 --> 00:12:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Paralyzing you.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: I was at a haunted
house of a colleague of mine,

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.990 align:middle line:84%
and we were both
sleeping, and I woke up

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:59.120 align:middle line:90%
to this hideous beast on me.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.100 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't move, sleep paralysis.

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And saw it just disappear
right out the front door

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:05.200 align:middle line:90%
without opening it.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's the closest I've
ever come to a spirit or ghost

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:10.630 align:middle line:90%
sighting is that old hag.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chad, you've
also looked at curses.

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:14.280 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Well, I
love areas where

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:17.630 align:middle line:90%
there are dares and curses.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.970 align:middle line:84%
If you go to this area
and sit on the mausoleum,

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:23.115 align:middle line:84%
you'll be cursed with bad
luck to the day you die.

00:13:23.115 --> 00:13:27.130 align:middle line:84%
If you jump over a witch's
grave, a misfortune, mishap,

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:28.870 align:middle line:90%
death will follow you.

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And again, I don't know if these
are self-fulfilling prophecies,

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:33.950 align:middle line:84%
that when you go to
these cursed areas,

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:35.720 align:middle line:90%
you expect something to happen.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.220 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite
curses is that of Robert

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.900 align:middle line:90%
the Doll down in Key West.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And we've talked about this
on your "Coast to Coast" show.

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:47.370 align:middle line:10%
And Robert is this creepy
looking old sailor doll.

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.530 align:middle line:10%
But people go there,
and dozens upon dozens

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:52.580 align:middle line:10%
report that they've
been cursed afterwards--

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:56.270 align:middle line:10%
a speeding ticket, an
accident, their computer

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.140 align:middle line:10%
crashes, and things like that.

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And you wonder, is it just
the coincidence of visiting,

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.640 align:middle line:84%
or is there
something more to it?

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And with the Robert
story, you actually

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:08.460 align:middle line:84%
have to ask for his
forgiveness in order

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.130 align:middle line:90%
for the curse to be lifted.

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:12.760 align:middle line:84%
So surrounding Robert
on all the walls

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.020 align:middle line:84%
are hand-written letters
from people saying,

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry, Robert.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.510 align:middle line:90%
Please break the curse.

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if
there's something

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:21.890 align:middle line:84%
paranormal to these curses,
but they seem to work.

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:24.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of people
report that Robert's eyes

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.800 align:middle line:84%
seem to follow them
around over the place.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And the original story,
Chad, as you know,

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:33.810 align:middle line:84%
and as we've talked
about, is it was

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:37.330 align:middle line:84%
a worker at the
home of the family

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:41.840 align:middle line:84%
back 100-plus years ago
who didn't like the family.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.800 align:middle line:84%
Maybe she was
fired or something.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.080 align:middle line:84%
So she gave them
this cursed doll.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And once the doll was
there in the house,

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:50.850 align:middle line:90%
all hell broke loose.

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:53.920 align:middle line:84%
People could report
hearing the pitter patter.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.260 align:middle line:84%
The child used to say
I'm afraid of the doll.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And then when they
left, they left the doll

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.430 align:middle line:84%
in the attic of the house,
and the new owners took it.

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And the little boy hated
it, hated the doll.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.670 align:middle line:10%
But the fascinating
story was people

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:10.860 align:middle line:10%
who would go by
the house at night

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:14.016 align:middle line:10%
would see Robert
looking out the window.

00:15:14.016 --> 00:15:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: And it
doesn't even have

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:17.460 align:middle line:90%
to be going there visiting now.

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:20.530 align:middle line:84%
The last time I did the Robert
the doll story on your "Coast

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:22.950 align:middle line:84%
to Coast," after
the program, you

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:25.040 align:middle line:84%
had a link to Robert's
photo on there.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.020 align:middle line:84%
One of your listeners
contacted me

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.020 align:middle line:84%
saying that he merely went
to the photo of Robert

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.290 align:middle line:90%
and his computer crashed.

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:33.360 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't there.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.170 align:middle line:84%
He had no interaction
with Robert.

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:36.870 align:middle line:90%
But the mere idea of looking--

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:37.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It just got him.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.501 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yes, it got him.

00:15:38.501 --> 00:15:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And I was actually down in Key
West, Florida with a TV crew,

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:43.967 align:middle line:90%
and they were skeptics.

00:15:43.967 --> 00:15:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And before I got there,
they were setting up

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:49.499 align:middle line:84%
all their equipment, and they
were out in a swampy area,

00:15:49.499 --> 00:15:51.540 align:middle line:84%
and they were just joking
how they didn't believe

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:53.370 align:middle line:90%
in curses or Robert the doll.

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And they started backing
up in their rental truck,

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.724 align:middle line:84%
and they smashed out the back
of the window in a tree branch.

00:15:59.724 --> 00:16:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:01.480 align:middle line:90%
Bad luck.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:02.063 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:16:02.063 --> 00:16:05.630 align:middle line:84%
Was it coincidence, or
something more sinister?

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Back to curses.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Can you fight a curse
that's been placed on you

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.890 align:middle line:90%
by a very powerful person?

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Yes, although the
means seem to be out of reach

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.190 align:middle line:90%
for most of us.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.200 align:middle line:90%
We've lost the ability to do.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.550 align:middle line:84%
We have to go to a
specialist, whether it's

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:26.030 align:middle line:84%
voodoo or hoodoo practitioner,
or a shaman, or a psychic.

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:27.260 align:middle line:90%
But there are many things.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.100 align:middle line:84%
You can look around
in your neighborhood.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.360 align:middle line:84%
You'll see people taking
matters into their own hands.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.650 align:middle line:84%
They'll have gargoyles on
their steps to ward off evil.

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:39.990 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite is hanging
a horseshoe above your door.

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:41.710 align:middle line:84%
Not only will it
bring in good luck

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.800 align:middle line:84%
if you have it right side up
so the luck doesn't fall out,

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.834 align:middle line:84%
but also, it's said
to ward off witches.

00:16:47.834 --> 00:16:49.750 align:middle line:84%
People will still-- if
you go to a restaurant,

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:52.480 align:middle line:84%
watch for people throwing
salt over their left shoulder

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.480 align:middle line:90%
to keep spirits away.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.865 align:middle line:90%
People will put iron on caskets.

00:16:55.865 --> 00:16:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I got hit
in the eye with salt

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:00.007 align:middle line:84%
once from somebody who did
that on a different table.

00:17:00.007 --> 00:17:00.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:03.202 align:middle line:84%
And it's thought that the devil
would be on your left side.

00:17:03.202 --> 00:17:04.410 align:middle line:90%
That's where the spirits are.

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:07.810 align:middle line:84%
So by throwing purifying salt,
you would keep these spirits

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:08.920 align:middle line:90%
at bay.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:12.099 align:middle line:84%
And there are so many
legends that if you followed

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:15.130 align:middle line:84%
all these things to keep
away evil and curses,

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:16.710 align:middle line:90%
you'd be busy all day long.

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:18.040 align:middle line:90%
You can't walk on cracks.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.060 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be
facing a certain area.

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.900 align:middle line:84%
Put your shoes on your
bed in a certain manner.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.319 align:middle line:84%
It would be exhausting to
take all these precautions.

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:28.770 align:middle line:84%
So many of us just take some
of the better precautions,

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:29.630 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:32.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A person can be
cursed and not even know it.

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yes.

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:39.300 align:middle line:84%
Many people who have become sick
or ill or just fall on bad luck

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.300 align:middle line:84%
don't realize they've
been cursed until later

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.350 align:middle line:84%
when they discover that someone
has placed the curse on them.

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, it's
too late for them.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:49.820 align:middle line:84%
They can't take preventative
measures to avoid this

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.380 align:middle line:90%
or to have the curve lifted.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are
candles used in curses?

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Well, you think
light, the purity of light.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.138 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And
different colors, too.

00:17:59.138 --> 00:18:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Yeah, different
colors, different aspects.

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to set
in the mood, too.

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:07.760 align:middle line:84%
People have used candles
for years along with mirrors

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:08.600 align:middle line:90%
and their seances.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And during the
spiritualist movement,

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:14.560 align:middle line:84%
all they had during their
seances were candles.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.210 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
just continued on.

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:20.270 align:middle line:84%
That's one of those beliefs that
we've had in the early days,

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:22.330 align:middle line:90%
and it's moved on with it.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Candles were always in rituals,
because that's all they had,

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.040 align:middle line:84%
so you have to use
them still today.

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I remember back in
my days in Catholic classes,

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:36.650 align:middle line:84%
catechism, you'd
go into the church,

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:40.180 align:middle line:84%
and people would be there
lighting candles for prayer,

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:42.410 align:middle line:84%
or people they cared
about, or people

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:47.370 align:middle line:84%
who died-- hundreds and
hundreds of candles.

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:50.107 align:middle line:84%
So it goes way back, doesn't
it, the use of candles?

00:18:50.107 --> 00:18:50.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:54.160 align:middle line:84%
Prior to candles, people
would use lanterns, candles

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.690 align:middle line:84%
in a lantern, and
they would release it

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:59.690 align:middle line:84%
into the sky for a loved one,
taking them to the heavens.

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:03.780 align:middle line:84%
So these beliefs are
very historic, very old,

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.020 align:middle line:90%
and they've continued on.

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.820 align:middle line:84%
They've survived
decades of people

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.390 align:middle line:90%
telling and retelling them.

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:13.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What fascinates you
about investigating curses?

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: I love the dares
that you have to take.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.187 align:middle line:84%
If you do this dare,
something will happen.

00:19:18.187 --> 00:19:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain the dare.

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.853 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:19:19.853 --> 00:19:21.500 align:middle line:84%
The dare is, for
instance, there's

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.160 align:middle line:84%
a mausoleum in
Wisconsin that it's said

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.320 align:middle line:84%
if you're foolish enough or
brave enough to sit or stand

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.800 align:middle line:84%
on that mausoleum, you'll
be pushed to the ground

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.100 align:middle line:84%
by the angry spirits
of those inside.

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.430 align:middle line:90%
So you take the dare.

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And really, these dares have
become rites of passage.

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:42.970 align:middle line:84%
Usually, younger people will
do these as a test of bravery.

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:45.460 align:middle line:84%
If I can run around the
mausoleum three times

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:48.730 align:middle line:84%
to release the spirit,
that's proving that I'm

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.730 align:middle line:90%
brave to my fellow teenagers.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have rites
of passage anymore.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:58.570 align:middle line:84%
We don't have tribes where
you become officially an adult

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:00.700 align:middle line:90%
or an elder in the tribe.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.410 align:middle line:90%
Now we have to create our own.

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.910 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
are doing these dares

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:08.910 align:middle line:84%
as a matter of a rite of
passage to convince themselves

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:11.810 align:middle line:84%
that they've moved to a
different aspect of their life.

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:17.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important is
understanding the curse

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:22.520 align:middle line:84%
and being a positive as
opposed to a negative?

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Many of
the curses and dares

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:27.050 align:middle line:84%
I've encountered-- I've
researched thousands of them

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:31.180 align:middle line:84%
around the world-- about 99%
of them are always negative.

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:33.430 align:middle line:90%
It's rarely anything positive.

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're not happy.

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Are they called curses
if they're happy?

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:38.930 align:middle line:90%
No, they're spells, right?

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:39.649 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yes.

00:20:39.649 --> 00:20:40.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Spells are good.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:41.817 align:middle line:90%
Curses are bad.

00:20:41.817 --> 00:20:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think more people are
taking that negative aspect.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.120 align:middle line:84%
They look at spells as
being negative or curses.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.690 align:middle line:84%
They don't realize that it could
be something positive as well.

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:56.240 align:middle line:84%
But the overwhelming
majority of curses and dares

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.580 align:middle line:84%
have something bad that
will happen to you.

00:20:58.580 --> 00:20:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:02.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Which is scarier for
me than winning the lottery

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:05.040 align:middle line:84%
or finding true love
after doing these dears.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.192 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you know if
somebody put a curse on you?

00:21:08.192 --> 00:21:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: I don't.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:09.430 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't.

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:10.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And I've had colleagues-- I've
taken thousands of these dares.

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:15.200 align:middle line:90%
A knock on wood, I'm still here.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:15.986 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give me
a lock of hairs.

00:21:15.986 --> 00:21:16.569 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:21:16.569 --> 00:21:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And I've had colleagues who
say, I'm not taking that dare.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And not because I'm afraid
of it, but because what

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.500 align:middle line:90%
if one out of 1,000 is real?

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.240 align:middle line:90%
Why would you tempt fate?

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think for a lot of
people, they would rather not

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:31.610 align:middle line:90%
take these dares as well.

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you've got a core
of people who would do that.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.490 align:middle line:84%
They're just obsessed
with the paranormal.

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And they would probably love
to take a dare like that

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:44.270 align:middle line:84%
and go to a mausoleum
like you just suggested,

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:46.410 align:middle line:90%
or some other hideous place.

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:47.450 align:middle line:90%
They would do that.

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:49.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: You're right
on target, George.

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:51.300 align:middle line:90%
It's now legend tripping.

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:52.660 align:middle line:90%
People go to these places.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.190 align:middle line:84%
They're taking
trips to the legend.

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:55.148 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They enjoy it.

00:21:55.148 --> 00:21:55.817 align:middle line:90%
It's a party.

00:21:55.817 --> 00:21:56.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.850 align:middle line:84%
They're not looking to dig
up research or interview

00:21:58.850 --> 00:21:59.580 align:middle line:90%
witnesses.

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:02.539 align:middle line:84%
They're looking to
experience the activity.

00:22:02.539 --> 00:22:03.705 align:middle line:90%
They're looking for the UFO.

00:22:03.705 --> 00:22:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And if that doesn't
happen, they're

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:09.220 align:middle line:84%
going to drive five miles
past this grave per hour,

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:11.390 align:middle line:84%
and that will release
the witch, or touch

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:13.640 align:middle line:84%
the witch's tree in
Chesterville, Illinois,

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.580 align:middle line:90%
and she'll make herself known.

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And if that doesn't
happen, they're

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.400 align:middle line:90%
out looking for werewolves.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And it really is almost a
paranormal tourism, in a way.

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:25.670 align:middle line:84%
This legend tripping
is so popular now.

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:27.930 align:middle line:84%
People want to go out and
experience these things.

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's growing.

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:30.360 align:middle line:84%
I remember I was going
to do a Ouija board

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.530 align:middle line:90%
experience on "Coast to Coast."

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:36.140 align:middle line:90%
And I had three guests.

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:39.350 align:middle line:84%
One was opposed to
it, one didn't care,

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:41.340 align:middle line:90%
and one said go for it.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I was ready to
do this experiment.

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And it dawned on me-- nah, you
might be opening up a portal.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.870 align:middle line:84%
You might be affecting
people who are listening.

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:54.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to do it.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.890 align:middle line:84%
It was a lot of hype
leading up to it.

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:58.350 align:middle line:90%
I'll grant you that.

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:01.420 align:middle line:84%
But I decided, I'm
not going to do it.

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:06.800 align:middle line:84%
My emails were flooded from
people who said, thank god.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.760 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for not doing it.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.650 align:middle line:84%
But I still had a
handful of emails

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:14.340 align:middle line:84%
from people who were
really ticked off at me.

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:16.700 align:middle line:84%
They wanted that Ouija
board experiment.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:20.700 align:middle line:84%
One-- I'll always remember--
said, how could you?

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:23.890 align:middle line:84%
We had 20 people
around the radio.

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:26.770 align:middle line:84%
We had ordered
pizzas, and we were

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:30.750 align:middle line:84%
ready to have a party
based on this show.

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:32.990 align:middle line:90%
You have ruined it for us.

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:36.080 align:middle line:90%
And I went, whoa.

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: And that's how beliefs
have changed over the years.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:42.210 align:middle line:84%
Back in the late
1800s, early 1900s,

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:44.540 align:middle line:84%
it would be a social
event to get invited

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:46.920 align:middle line:90%
to a seance at someone's home.

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:48.147 align:middle line:90%
That would be great fun.

00:23:48.147 --> 00:23:49.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was a party.

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:49.813 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:23:49.813 --> 00:23:52.300 align:middle line:84%
You'd gather around and
hope that some spirit would

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:53.910 align:middle line:90%
make themselves known.

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And nowadays, of course,
people take precautions

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:59.500 align:middle line:84%
to avoid being cursed or
opening up, as you said,

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:04.060 align:middle line:84%
a portal, or opening yourself
up to these mysterious beings,

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:06.652 align:middle line:84%
whether they're flesh and
blood or something else.

00:24:06.652 --> 00:24:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the old
days, the living room

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.150 align:middle line:90%
was called the parlor.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And my grandmother in
Boston would have parties

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.990 align:middle line:84%
for her friends
and for my family

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:21.590 align:middle line:84%
where a lady came in and
would read tea leaves that

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:22.750 align:middle line:90%
would be in the coffee.

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:26.690 align:middle line:84%
They'd have actual leaves in
the coffee and in the tea.

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And when you drank it,
wherever the leaf stuck

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:33.180 align:middle line:84%
to the inside of
the cup, she was

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:35.430 align:middle line:90%
able to determine your future.

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:37.810 align:middle line:90%
And it was a big thing.

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:41.360 align:middle line:84%
Chad, I remember-- and I'm
a little boy at that time--

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.420 align:middle line:84%
I remember the whole
family in there.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.360 align:middle line:84%
There must have been
25 people in there.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And this lady reading these
tea leaves and stuff like that.

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:51.240 align:middle line:90%
That was their entertainment.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.990 align:middle line:90%
Television was at its infancy.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:55.466 align:middle line:90%
This was their thing.

00:24:55.466 --> 00:24:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: And it really was.

00:24:56.590 --> 00:25:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And as you said, the
burial, the whole funeral

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:01.560 align:middle line:90%
would be in the parlor.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.720 align:middle line:84%
You'd wash the body,
and you'd keep it there

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.330 align:middle line:84%
for several days to make
sure that that person was

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:07.466 align:middle line:90%
truly dead.

00:25:07.466 --> 00:25:09.840 align:middle line:84%
Because back then, whether
you were in a diabetic shock--

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I went in there
one day, and he was gone.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:11.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:14.020 align:middle line:84%
People would pop up
just in the nick of time

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:16.044 align:middle line:84%
to be saved from
being buried alive.

00:25:16.044 --> 00:25:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, remember the
old saying, dead ringer?

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:23.270 align:middle line:84%
They would bury people but put
bells where he had a string.

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:26.940 align:middle line:84%
In case he was alive,
he'd be able to ring it,

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.145 align:middle line:90%
and they'd come and get him.

00:25:28.145 --> 00:25:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: And most
people don't remember

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:32.320 align:middle line:84%
that it used to be
caretakers of cemeteries

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.200 align:middle line:90%
lived at the cemetery.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.920 align:middle line:84%
So they would watch for
these bells at night.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And family would
gather-- some say

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.000 align:middle line:84%
working the graveyard shift,
listening for that bell

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:42.530 align:middle line:90%
to go off.

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How frightening
if you could hear that?

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:44.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yes.

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:45.137 align:middle line:90%
Saved by the bell.

00:25:45.137 --> 00:25:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would
you like to wake up

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:51.270 align:middle line:84%
in the inside of a
casket, and you're alive,

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:53.400 align:middle line:90%
and you can't get out.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: I'd much rather
have that bell there to ring.

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What a
horrible way to die.

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: And we know thousands
of people were buried alive.

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:03.310 align:middle line:84%
Over in Europe, when the
plagues went through,

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:06.130 align:middle line:84%
they would dig up your relatives
and throw you in with them

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:07.450 align:middle line:90%
to save room, of course.

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And there are tales of
them finding scratch marks

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.860 align:middle line:84%
on the top of the
coffin or the casket

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:15.130 align:middle line:84%
as though somebody had
tried to claw their way out.

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:17.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's
anything worse.

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And I've taken tours
of funeral homes.

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And the new trend in
caskets is to have

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:25.260 align:middle line:90%
a built-in communication system.

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Isn't that amazing?

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:29.550 align:middle line:84%
How could they not
know that you're dead?

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:31.090 align:middle line:90%
How do they make this mistake?

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:32.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: But every
year, we hear people

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:35.240 align:middle line:84%
that they claimed were
dead were waking up.

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:38.330 align:middle line:84%
There was a woman that
woke up in a freezer.

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:40.010 align:middle line:90%
They thought she was gone.

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And these aren't
happening in the 1800s.

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:44.740 align:middle line:84%
These are modern-day
stories of people

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.865 align:middle line:84%
that have been saved
from being buried alive.

00:26:46.865 --> 00:26:48.717 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you believe
in reincarnation?

00:26:48.717 --> 00:26:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: I do.

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That you keep coming
back until you're perfect?

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:52.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Uh-huh.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:53.490 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to so
many people who

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:56.370 align:middle line:84%
have undergone past
life regression

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.160 align:middle line:84%
and believe that
they have stories.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And contrary to what most people
hear, most of the people that

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:05.550 align:middle line:84%
had a past life were not some
famous or important person,

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:08.480 align:middle line:84%
but just a regular person
that had lived long before.

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's next for you?

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: I'm going to be
searching for a sea serpent,

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.480 align:middle line:90%
one in my neck of the wood.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm doing a book
on local sea serpents.

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:21.080 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't hear from me,
you have to avenge my death.

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mean you could
actually be swallowed up

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:24.517 align:middle line:90%
by a sea serpent?

00:27:24.517 --> 00:27:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Many claim that people
have been drowned by these sea

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:28.540 align:middle line:90%
serpents and attacked.

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, it's
just a drowning.

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:32.960 align:middle line:90%
There's no sea serpent to it.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:36.140 align:middle line:84%
But many people fear these sea
serpents, that you shouldn't

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:37.690 align:middle line:90%
go looking for them lightly.

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:41.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One theory about Loch
Ness is that it's a large eel.

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:44.830 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't sound
very romantic to me.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:47.950 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be a
plesiosaur dinosaur.

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:49.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: I do as well.

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of stories
tell of lake sturgeon,

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:55.390 align:middle line:84%
that they're the
culprit of these things.

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And I don't care if
you're in the water

00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:59.480 align:middle line:84%
and a 12-foot lake
sturgeon passes

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.070 align:middle line:90%
against you or a plesiosaur.

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:04.980 align:middle line:10%
It's a monster to you when a
12-foot, giant 300-pound fish

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:06.240 align:middle line:10%
comes up against you.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:09.310 align:middle line:84%
For all purposes,
that is a sea monster.

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:12.300 align:middle line:10%
But most of the descriptions
I get are of a large hump

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:15.270 align:middle line:10%
being with a long neck,
like the plesiosaur.

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And most witnesses say
that they're convinced

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:18.886 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't a known animal.

00:28:18.886 --> 00:28:21.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chad, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Keep an
eye out, George.

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exciting, isn't it?

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:26.510 align:middle line:90%
Ghosts, the other side, curses.

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:27.980 align:middle line:90%
Just be careful out there.

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:30.340 align:middle line:10%
Somebody may have
a curse on you,

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:32.080 align:middle line:10%
and you might not even know it.

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.560 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.420 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:52.032 align:middle line:90%
