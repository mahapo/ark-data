00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>>And I think many
people today don't

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.282 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:09.282 --> 00:00:10.907 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.907 --> 00:00:13.480 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.245 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.245 --> 00:00:26.640 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.640 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to another edition

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.140 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief," where
our very special guest is

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.220 align:middle line:10%
one of the world's foremost
remote viewers and author

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.450 align:middle line:10%
of "Reading the Enemy's
Mind," Paul Smith.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.920 align:middle line:10%
Paul, welcome to the program.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.200 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL SMITH: Thank you.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.720 align:middle line:84%
It's always a joy to
be with you, George.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.469 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now a lot of
people will say, OK,

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:44.320 align:middle line:90%
what is remote viewing?

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.400 align:middle line:84%
So give us the Paul
Smith definition.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.000 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Remote
viewing is the ability

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.170 align:middle line:10%
to essentially project
your consciousness

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.100 align:middle line:10%
to another part of the
universe, usually somewhere

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.820 align:middle line:10%
on Planet Earth, to perceive
people, places, things,

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.970 align:middle line:10%
events that you have no
other connection to other

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.520 align:middle line:10%
than the power of your own mind.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So this is literally
concentrating, letting

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.660 align:middle line:84%
your mind wander,
picking up things,

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.327 align:middle line:84%
maybe targeted objects,
things you're looking for.

00:01:14.327 --> 00:01:16.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, although there's
a little bit more control

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.176 align:middle line:90%
over it.

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:18.800 align:middle line:84%
It's a little more
than just wandering.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.950 align:middle line:84%
What you do is you focus
on perceiving the intended

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.100 align:middle line:90%
target of your conscious mind.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting that we
can pick up all kinds of things.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.780 align:middle line:84%
We can pick up
sensory experiences,

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.630 align:middle line:84%
such as colors,
tastes, sounds, smells.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.080 align:middle line:84%
We can pick up more intangible
information-- purposes,

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.810 align:middle line:84%
actions, intentions,
things like that.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.030 align:middle line:90%
We can pick up shapes.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.150 align:middle line:84%
We can pick up some
motion, movement.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.670 align:middle line:90%
You can pick up whole scenes.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.200 align:middle line:84%
It all depends where
you are in the process.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.200 align:middle line:84%
But it is-- it can be-- I
wouldn't say it's like being

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.705 align:middle line:90%
there physically, but it's--

00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:02.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pretty darn close.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:03.746 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Pretty close.

00:02:03.746 --> 00:02:05.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes, pretty close.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you depict
time with remote viewing?

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And by that I mean, if
you're looking at something

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:20.020 align:middle line:84%
and see an explosion,
can you say May, 2018.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.520 align:middle line:90%
I know that's the date.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.630 align:middle line:90%
Can you do that?

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Unfortunately,
you can't.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Remote viewing is
a descriptive kind

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.360 align:middle line:84%
of approach to this
projected consciousness.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is you
could describe what happens.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.180 align:middle line:84%
You could say, I perceive
this big ball of rolling fire,

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.520 align:middle line:90%
whatever, a loud explosion.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.810 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me of
some kind of, well,

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.040 align:middle line:90%
explosion in a certain location.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.820 align:middle line:84%
But if you say, well,
when did it happen?

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.475 align:middle line:84%
You'll say, well, I
know it's in the past.

00:02:51.475 --> 00:02:52.670 align:middle line:90%
Say OK, well, that's good.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.670 align:middle line:90%
When?

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And you say, well,
I don't know when.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.940 align:middle line:84%
But this happened before,
and this other thing

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.640 align:middle line:90%
happened afterwards.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And so using that, you may be
able to kind of triangulate

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.264 align:middle line:84%
when approximately
that happened.

00:03:08.264 --> 00:03:09.680 align:middle line:84%
But the thing about
remote viewing

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.310 align:middle line:90%
is that it's very right brain.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And so-- and things
like measuring

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.610 align:middle line:84%
time and language and
mathematics and all that kind

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.580 align:middle line:84%
of stuff is fairly
right-- or left brain.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.556 align:middle line:84%
And the two don't really
cooperate very well

00:03:22.556 --> 00:03:23.860 align:middle line:90%
in a remote viewing scenario.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why it's more
descriptive rather than

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.140 align:middle line:90%
labeling.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So remote
viewing is real time,

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.040 align:middle line:90%
but it's also future time.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.560 align:middle line:90%
Is it also past time?

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Remote viewing seems
to be somewhat time independent.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.790 align:middle line:90%
You can remote view the present.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.380 align:middle line:84%
You can remote view
the past essentially

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.380 align:middle line:84%
as accurately as you can
remote view the present.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.740 align:middle line:84%
You can remote view the future,
but there are some caveats.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.670 align:middle line:84%
You can't remote
view it as well.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And my own opinion is that's
because the future hasn't

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.252 align:middle line:90%
happened yet.

00:03:56.252 --> 00:03:57.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's changeable.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And it's changeable.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.990 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's
probably infinitely

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.500 align:middle line:84%
changeable within
certain parameters.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And so oftentimes when people
remote view the future,

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.130 align:middle line:84%
if it's what I call
the open future, which

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.090 align:middle line:84%
is the future of all
the possibilities,

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.660 align:middle line:84%
they'll often get it wrong and
only occasionally get it right.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Now there is a form
of remote viewing

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.055 align:middle line:84%
which allows you to
be more accurate.

00:04:20.055 --> 00:04:21.680 align:middle line:84%
It's called associative
remote viewing.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.110 align:middle line:84%
So that's a specialized
application of it.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How'd you get involved
in remote viewing, Paul?

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, it was an
interesting experience.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.390 align:middle line:90%
I didn't even know it existed.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.387 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea--

00:04:33.387 --> 00:04:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not a lot of people do.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.190 align:middle line:90%
And especially back then.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.691 align:middle line:90%
This was 1983.

00:04:38.691 --> 00:04:39.440 align:middle line:90%
I was in the Army.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.898 align:middle line:84%
I was an Army
Intelligence Officer.

00:04:40.898 --> 00:04:43.490 align:middle line:84%
My specialty was Middle
Eastern intelligence.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And I was assigned to
Fort Meade, Maryland

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.090 align:middle line:84%
in a position where I was doing
some administrative things

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.250 align:middle line:84%
with intelligence that had been
collected from the Middle East.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, I happened to move in
next door to a guy named-- now

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.190 align:middle line:84%
he goes by Skip Atwater,
then it was Fred Atwater--

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.910 align:middle line:84%
across the street from
another guy named Tom McNair.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.740 align:middle line:90%
And they did some weird things.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.587 align:middle line:84%
They wore civilian
clothes all the time

00:05:07.587 --> 00:05:09.670 align:middle line:84%
even though they lived on
a military installation.

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And they had rank,
they were officers.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.530 align:middle line:90%
Tom had a beard.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And they went off to
this, almost a shack out

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.970 align:middle line:90%
in the woods.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:17.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All the time, right.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:18.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: All the time.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And when I asked
them what they did,

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.410 align:middle line:84%
they said, I can't tell you,
which in the intelligence

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:23.720 align:middle line:90%
field, that's not so unusual.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.344 align:middle line:84%
What was unusual was
they couldn't even

00:05:25.344 --> 00:05:27.637 align:middle line:84%
tell me what kind of
intelligence they did.

00:05:27.637 --> 00:05:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Now normally, you
know, they're either

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.079 align:middle line:84%
into human intelligence,
which is spies and informants.

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Or they're into
signals intelligence,

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.997 align:middle line:90%
which is what NSA does--

00:05:34.997 --> 00:05:35.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Technology.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Intercepting.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Or they're into
imagery intelligence,

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.832 align:middle line:84%
which is the spy satellites
and U2s and stuff.

00:05:41.832 --> 00:05:43.790 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, which one
of those are you doing?

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Because that's all
there is, right?

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.230 align:middle line:84%
They said, we don't
do any of those.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:49.080 align:middle line:90%
I said, what?

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.080 align:middle line:90%
But you're intelligence?

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:51.465 align:middle line:90%
Well, what do you do?

00:05:51.465 --> 00:05:53.155 align:middle line:90%
They said, we can't tell you.

00:05:53.155 --> 00:05:54.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So you're baffled.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.613 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I'm completely baffled.

00:05:55.613 --> 00:05:57.880 align:middle line:84%
So one day they came over
to my house and they said,

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.820 align:middle line:84%
we know you're interested
in what we're doing.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.242 align:middle line:84%
We think you might
be good at it,

00:06:01.242 --> 00:06:03.700 align:middle line:84%
but we can't tell you what it
is until you take some tests.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.570 align:middle line:84%
So I took these tests,
scored apparently

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.570 align:middle line:90%
where they wanted me to.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.530 align:middle line:84%
They invited me over
to the shack where

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.710 align:middle line:84%
they were working
out of and said,

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.740 align:middle line:84%
OK, what we do is
collect intelligence

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.240 align:middle line:84%
against foreign threats using
a parapsychological phenomenon

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.845 align:middle line:90%
known as remote viewing.

00:06:17.845 --> 00:06:20.220 align:middle line:84%
We essentially want you to
volunteer to be a psychic spy.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we think
you've got what it takes.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And they were
expecting me to be shocked.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:26.710 align:middle line:90%
And I was, sort of.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.793 align:middle line:84%
They said, you can come
back tomorrow and tell us.

00:06:28.793 --> 00:06:30.800 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, I already
know the answer here.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.029 align:middle line:90%
I want to do it.

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And had you,
over the years, Paul,

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:38.306 align:middle line:84%
without knowing what it was,
had you dabbled in this?

00:06:38.306 --> 00:06:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I had always
been interested in ESP,

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.090 align:middle line:84%
extrasensory perception,
read a lot of science fiction

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.680 align:middle line:90%
that that was the focus of.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.450 align:middle line:84%
But I had been involved
in a junior high science

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:53.540 align:middle line:84%
project, which they used the
zener cards, the ESP cards,

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:54.830 align:middle line:90%
and had been a total failure.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.586 align:middle line:84%
I had absolutely no
evidence of being psychic.

00:06:57.586 --> 00:06:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And so I'd kind
of said, oh, it's

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.835 align:middle line:84%
probably just fantasy,
probably doesn't work.

00:07:00.835 --> 00:07:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I was kind
of a mild skeptic.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.870 align:middle line:84%
When they sat me down and
said, this is what we do,

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.220 align:middle line:84%
I did this calculation--
took me about 15 seconds.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.230 align:middle line:84%
I used to be really
interested in ESP.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.060 align:middle line:90%
I really wish it worked.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.340 align:middle line:90%
But I've become a skeptic.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.450 align:middle line:84%
But here they're telling
me the government

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:15.450 align:middle line:90%
is paying for a program.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.480 align:middle line:84%
They're recruiting
people to train.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.920 align:middle line:90%
It must mean it really works.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.003 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is exciting.

00:07:20.003 --> 00:07:22.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There's no way
I'm not going to do this.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:23.830 align:middle line:90%
So it was great.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
you went full time.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:25.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In the military.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:26.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Full time.

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:27.590 align:middle line:90%
Seven years.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
people were in there?

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.685 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, that varied.

00:07:30.685 --> 00:07:33.510 align:middle line:84%
At the height of the program
there were 11 people assigned.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.890 align:middle line:84%
But it could go
down as low as four.

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.020 align:middle line:84%
That's the lowest it got
to, is about four or five.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.520 align:middle line:84%
It all depended on how it was
faring within the government.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there were people in the
government that believed in it.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.290 align:middle line:84%
There were people in
the government who--

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.000 align:middle line:84%
some who believed in it but
didn't want to have anything

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.630 align:middle line:84%
to do with it, others who just
didn't believe in it at all

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.213 align:middle line:84%
and didn't even want
to hear about it.

00:07:51.213 --> 00:07:53.995 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there were
CIA directors who

00:07:53.995 --> 00:07:56.120 align:middle line:84%
were famous for throwing
people out of their office

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.620 align:middle line:84%
if they even brought
up the subject.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.870 align:middle line:84%
There were just some people
that didn't want to do it.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.121 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes it was in
favor, sometimes it wasn't.

00:08:02.121 --> 00:08:03.911 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of varied
throughout that time.

00:08:03.911 --> 00:08:05.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind of
projects did you do?

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.080 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about them?

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Now we can.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.620 align:middle line:84%
Back then, obviously,
I couldn't.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.860 align:middle line:84%
We actually-- the gamut
of intelligence questions.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.940 align:middle line:84%
The thing about remote viewing
is, what they used us for,

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.960 align:middle line:84%
was the last ditch, no other
hope kind of collection.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.095 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We need something.

00:08:21.095 --> 00:08:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And we're
not getting it

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:23.886 align:middle line:84%
from any of our
other disciplines.

00:08:23.886 --> 00:08:26.250 align:middle line:90%
So they'd use us on those.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.840 align:middle line:84%
So we worked the
hostages in Lebanon,

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.675 align:middle line:84%
trying to track down
western hostages

00:08:30.675 --> 00:08:33.010 align:middle line:90%
that Hezbollah had captured.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:37.870 align:middle line:84%
We worked Chinese nuclear tests,
Soviet weapons developments,

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.793 align:middle line:90%
narco trafficking.

00:08:39.793 --> 00:08:41.209 align:middle line:84%
The latter years
of the program we

00:08:41.209 --> 00:08:45.660 align:middle line:84%
did a lot of attempting to
interdict narcotics shipments,

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:49.190 align:middle line:84%
find out meetings of drug
traffickers, things like that.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.805 align:middle line:84%
Almost anything that could
be an intelligence problem,

00:08:51.805 --> 00:08:52.430 align:middle line:90%
they had us on.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:53.471 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it accurate?

00:08:53.471 --> 00:08:55.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, were you
solving problems?

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The thing I always tell
people about remote viewing--

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.020 align:middle line:84%
you get really wild stories
about how good it is.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.460 align:middle line:84%
You get wild stories about
how it doesn't work at all.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.920 align:middle line:90%
The truth is in between.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Remote viewing
doesn't always work.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And because it's kind
of a frontier science,

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.840 align:middle line:84%
we don't always know
why it doesn't work.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.800 align:middle line:90%
But it does work other times.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And when it works,
it's very obvious

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.010 align:middle line:84%
that that's how we collected
the intelligence that

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:18.840 align:middle line:90%
actually did work.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And we had some really amazing
successes and some unfortunate

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:22.690 align:middle line:90%
failures.

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did the
successes surprise people

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.480 align:middle line:90%
in the military?

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The people who
had not been involved

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:30.550 align:middle line:84%
the program would
often be surprised.

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:32.020 align:middle line:84%
We had this great
briefing book, we

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.470 align:middle line:84%
called it the Red Book, that
would go around and show

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:36.160 align:middle line:84%
all these great stellar
examples of when it had worked.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:40.000 align:middle line:84%
But what was funny, when you
were in the program itself,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.990 align:middle line:84%
it got to be kind of like
just another job, you know?

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:46.320 align:middle line:84%
You go, oh man, do I have
to do another remote viewing

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.310 align:middle line:90%
session today?

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:51.590 align:middle line:84%
My good friend and
then boss Bill Ray,

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.670 align:middle line:84%
one time we were
walking, passing

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.357 align:middle line:84%
each other in the office there,
and he stopped me for a second.

00:09:56.357 --> 00:09:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And that was back
when you could still

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.080 align:middle line:90%
smoke in an Army facility.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.413 align:middle line:84%
He had his pipe, you know,
he was puffing out his smoke,

00:10:01.413 --> 00:10:03.840 align:middle line:84%
looking very
professorial for a Major.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.740 align:middle line:84%
He said, Paul, you know what
amazes me about this stuff?

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:07.470 align:middle line:90%
I said, no, what?

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:10.545 align:middle line:84%
He said, it doesn't
amaze me anymore.

00:10:10.545 --> 00:10:11.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Commonplace.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:12.294 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Commonplace.

00:10:12.294 --> 00:10:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Although, to some degree, that's
not quite true, because even

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.360 align:middle line:84%
then, occasionally we could
have a success that would even

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.500 align:middle line:84%
blow our minds, as
used as we were to it.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Have you figured
out how it works,

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:27.320 align:middle line:84%
what you're tapping
into out there?

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.960 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if-- I've always
called it the wireless Internet

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.530 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, where
we all are intermixed

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:36.120 align:middle line:90%
and we tie ourselves in.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.540 align:middle line:90%
But what is it, Paul?

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to think
of remote viewing

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.670 align:middle line:84%
when your physical
eyes aren't there,

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:46.970 align:middle line:84%
and yet you can see things,
is absolutely mind-boggling.

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:48.150 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:51.607 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I'll give you
the unscientific answer here,

00:10:51.607 --> 00:10:53.190 align:middle line:84%
the one that scientists
wouldn't like.

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:56.180 align:middle line:84%
I think that it
shows that there are,

00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:00.190 align:middle line:84%
for want of a better term,
forces or connections

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:04.750 align:middle line:84%
of some kind in the universe
that are not physical,

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:05.850 align:middle line:90%
that we as humans--

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:06.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And never were.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And
probably never were.

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:12.420 align:middle line:84%
It's called dualism, I
actually have become convinced

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.820 align:middle line:84%
that we have the physical
part of the universe,

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.420 align:middle line:84%
but of equal standing to
that is a non-physical part

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:18.650 align:middle line:90%
of the universe as well.

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
philosophical complication

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.820 align:middle line:84%
to that which I
won't get into here.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:25.700 align:middle line:84%
But you do get folks who
want to try and reconcile

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.220 align:middle line:84%
all science together
in one place.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And I do consider parapsychology
and remote viewing as science,

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.340 align:middle line:90%
for very good reasons.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:37.570 align:middle line:84%
But those folks that want to--
who believe in remote viewing,

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:40.140 align:middle line:84%
but still want to
reconcile it with science,

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:43.400 align:middle line:84%
try to explain it from
quantum entanglement, quantum

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:47.780 align:middle line:84%
non-locality, which is the
fact that, to some degree,

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.030 align:middle line:84%
all physical objects
are connected

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:53.626 align:middle line:84%
in some way at the
subatomic level.

00:11:53.626 --> 00:11:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know, I
could end up being wrong,

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:56.916 align:middle line:84%
and that's indeed
the explanation.

00:11:56.916 --> 00:12:00.320 align:middle line:84%
But there are many reasons to
think that it isn't the reason.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.920 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons is
that quantum entanglement

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.470 align:middle line:84%
isn't an information
transmitting kind of a thing.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And yet the information that
you get from remote viewing

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.010 align:middle line:84%
is such a high order
and a high level

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:14.840 align:middle line:84%
that quantum entanglement
can't explain it.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Quantum entanglement
can't explain the ability

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:19.220 align:middle line:90%
to go back and forward in time.

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:21.350 align:middle line:84%
That just is beyond
its ability to manage.

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:25.080 align:middle line:84%
So there's attempt at
scientific explanation,

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.370 align:middle line:84%
but I think ultimately--
I hate to say it,

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:30.105 align:middle line:84%
it's that old joke about
Einstein, you know,

00:12:30.105 --> 00:12:33.660 align:middle line:84%
where all this stuff and then
a miracle happens, right?

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.530 align:middle line:84%
So it just got written
in as the final line.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is
remarkable, how it works.

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And you are 100%
convinced it works.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:41.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, yeah.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.185 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's no
doubt in my mind.

00:12:43.185 --> 00:12:43.685 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:12:43.685 --> 00:12:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
still use it now?

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Both seen
it and done it.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:49.227 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your non-military
life, do you use it?

00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: In my
non-military life, yes.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:52.670 align:middle line:84%
First of all, of course,
I teach people to do it.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:52.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, you do.

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there's
a lot of folks who--

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:55.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Get into that, too.

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: OK.

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they're very excited
about that part of it.

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:01.022 align:middle line:84%
I have been asked to do
some stuff for industry,

00:13:01.022 --> 00:13:02.730 align:middle line:84%
do some remote viewing
work for industry.

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:05.420 align:middle line:84%
I've been asked
sometimes by police,

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.510 align:middle line:84%
sometimes just by
interested people,

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:13.980 align:middle line:84%
to do forensic remote viewing
or looking for missing people.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.240 align:middle line:90%
So, yes.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.790 align:middle line:84%
In my everyday
life, I mostly use

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:19.930 align:middle line:84%
it to find parking
spots in the mall

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:22.110 align:middle line:90%
so I don't have to walk so far.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:24.972 align:middle line:84%
You know, I use it when
there's a call for it.

00:13:24.972 --> 00:13:26.430 align:middle line:84%
But in my own
personal life I don't

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.610 align:middle line:84%
have a huge amount
of need for it.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.080 align:middle line:90%
Occasionally yes.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:35.190 align:middle line:84%
If I can't find my keys, I
may use it then, and so forth.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is remarkable,
whatever this may be.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.720 align:middle line:90%
Now you said you teach it.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.080 align:middle line:90%
Is it easy to teach?

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:45.590 align:middle line:90%
Can everybody grasp this?

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:48.920 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Everybody can grasp
it to a certain degree.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.632 align:middle line:84%
But you're talking
about a skill.

00:13:51.632 --> 00:13:53.090 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
riding a bicycle.

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:55.540 align:middle line:84%
You can tell people the
principles of balance.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:56.800 align:middle line:84%
You can teach them about
inertia and all that stuff.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they gotta
do it on their own.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:59.254 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They gotta
do it on their own.

00:13:59.254 --> 00:14:01.257 align:middle line:84%
And the secret to
teaching remote viewing

00:14:01.257 --> 00:14:03.090 align:middle line:84%
is, first of all, explain
as much as you can

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:04.001 align:middle line:90%
about how to do it.

00:14:04.001 --> 00:14:05.625 align:middle line:84%
And then you put them
in an environment

00:14:05.625 --> 00:14:08.519 align:middle line:84%
to where if they're going to be
successful, they have to do it.

00:14:08.519 --> 00:14:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And there's a bit
of trial and error,

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.650 align:middle line:90%
in addition to the instruction.

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:14.540 align:middle line:84%
But that's normal for any
kind of complex skill.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:18.770 align:middle line:10%
And generally I find-- I've
only found one or two people who

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.430 align:middle line:10%
just didn't really
get anywhere with it.

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:24.440 align:middle line:84%
Most people have at
least some success,

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.910 align:middle line:84%
and it's a really
gratifying thing

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:31.072 align:middle line:84%
to watch them have these
epiphanies and say, wow,

00:14:31.072 --> 00:14:32.780 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know anything
about that target.

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:34.264 align:middle line:84%
Because you have
to do this blind.

00:14:34.264 --> 00:14:35.680 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know
anything about that.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.590 align:middle line:84%
But look at this drawing,
look at this model,

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:38.480 align:middle line:90%
it's just amazing.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.810 align:middle line:84%
It really does have some
resemblance to the target.

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:43.980 align:middle line:90%
So that's a lot of fun.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have found
that when you think,

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:48.790 align:middle line:84%
when you try to think when
you're remote viewing,

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:50.790 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't work.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.810 align:middle line:84%
You just gotta, like, let
your head-- clear yourself

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.460 align:middle line:84%
out and grab these
thoughts that come in.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:58.620 align:middle line:84%
But if you really
start concentrating,

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.740 align:middle line:84%
your mind starts to put
these pictures in your head

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:02.770 align:middle line:90%
when they're not there.

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:04.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's exactly right.

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.000 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this is one
of the biggest issues

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.850 align:middle line:84%
to overcome when you're
training someone,

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:10.391 align:middle line:84%
is to help them understand the
difference between that, which

00:15:10.391 --> 00:15:13.020 align:middle line:84%
we call mental noise,
and the actual signal,

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.422 align:middle line:84%
and learn how to limit
the mental noise as

00:15:15.422 --> 00:15:16.130 align:middle line:90%
much as possible.

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:19.540 align:middle line:84%
It never totally goes away,
but you learn how to limit it.

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:24.149 align:middle line:84%
And then you also learn how
to sort it out from the signal

00:15:24.149 --> 00:15:25.190 align:middle line:90%
that you want to come in.

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:28.420 align:middle line:84%
There's this old story about
the Army Air Defense Artillery.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.239 align:middle line:84%
Those are the guys that defend
you against enemy aircraft.

00:15:31.239 --> 00:15:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Somebody asked,
well, how do you tell

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.364 align:middle line:84%
the difference between friendly
airplanes and enemy airplanes,

00:15:35.364 --> 00:15:36.988 align:middle line:84%
where they're all
mixing up in the sky?

00:15:36.988 --> 00:15:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And the Air Defense Artillery
answer is, we don't bother.

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:41.910 align:middle line:84%
We just shoot them all down and
sort them out on the ground.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:44.160 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of what you're
doing in remote viewing, Is

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.510 align:middle line:84%
you're getting all
the information,

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:46.460 align:middle line:90%
you're putting it down.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:47.880 align:middle line:84%
But as you're putting
it down, you're

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.130 align:middle line:84%
separating it out to what's
signal and what's noise.

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Take me on a
remote viewing course.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.800 align:middle line:90%
How do we start?

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.400 align:middle line:90%
Let's assume I'm a total novice.

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: OK.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:00.150 align:middle line:84%
I'll talk about my
fully-leaded courses.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:02.080 align:middle line:84%
I teach controlled
remote viewing.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.350 align:middle line:84%
It lasts for five days
and change, a little bit

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:05.980 align:middle line:90%
into the sixth day.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:07.990 align:middle line:90%
Very intense course.

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:10.390 align:middle line:84%
I only allow a few people
to take it at a time,

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:14.720 align:middle line:84%
so you've got a really intimate
relation with the teacher

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.400 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.980 align:middle line:84%
First thing I do is I
start off with lectures

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:21.670 align:middle line:90%
to explain the background.

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And then actually my students
have to write essays,

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.640 align:middle line:84%
because it's been discovered
that learning process,

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.870 align:middle line:84%
the feeding back
from the student

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.610 align:middle line:84%
actually is where most
of the learning occurs.

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:34.790 align:middle line:84%
I can tell them stuff,
but it doesn't sink in

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:36.560 align:middle line:84%
until they have to
tell it back to me,

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:36.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They tell it to you.

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:37.937 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's right.

00:16:37.937 --> 00:16:38.520 align:middle line:90%
So we do that.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.930 align:middle line:90%
We have practical exercises.

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:42.170 align:middle line:84%
I even have one where
we go out and hug trees,

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:44.040 align:middle line:84%
trying to understand
human perception.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Because normally--
and perception

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:48.450 align:middle line:84%
is a very key element
in remote viewing.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And normally we take our
perceptual experience

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:51.340 align:middle line:90%
for granted.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.189 align:middle line:84%
We use it as a tool
to tell us if we're

00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:54.480 align:middle line:90%
going to get hit by a taxi cab.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.336 align:middle line:84%
That big yellow thing
coming, well, we

00:16:56.336 --> 00:16:57.960 align:middle line:84%
don't think about
the quality of yellow

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.084 align:middle line:84%
and the experience of the
sound and all that stuff.

00:17:00.084 --> 00:17:01.100 align:middle line:90%
Normally we just jump.

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We just jump.

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:04.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But in order to
really remote view well,

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:05.800 align:middle line:84%
you have to
recognize when you're

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.319 align:middle line:84%
having sensory
experiences, what they're

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:09.300 align:middle line:84%
like, what their quality is
like, and get those down.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.883 align:middle line:84%
So I take them out
and they hug a tree

00:17:10.883 --> 00:17:13.619 align:middle line:84%
and describe what that
was like, for an example.

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:15.569 align:middle line:84%
Then we do remote
viewing sessions,

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:18.339 align:middle line:84%
and we do a lot of
them, because again,

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:20.810 align:middle line:84%
that's how you actually
learn to do the process,

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:24.430 align:middle line:84%
by discovering what the
inner process is like

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:25.839 align:middle line:90%
that no one can explain to you.

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:26.810 align:middle line:84%
No one can tell you
what that's like.

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:27.700 align:middle line:84%
You have to experience
it yourself.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:28.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have to
experience it yourself.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:30.908 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And after you've
done enough of those,

00:17:30.908 --> 00:17:33.320 align:middle line:84%
by the time the end
of the fifth day

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.710 align:middle line:84%
and the morning of the
sixth day come along,

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:37.647 align:middle line:84%
you've got a really
good introduction to it.

00:17:37.647 --> 00:17:39.480 align:middle line:84%
You really have got a
lot of practice at it.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And you should be showing
some pretty good results

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:42.800 align:middle line:90%
by that point.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you find that by
practicing remote viewing,

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:50.350 align:middle line:84%
it makes people more intuitive
in their day-to-day living?

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:51.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: As a matter
of fact, that's

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:54.830 align:middle line:84%
probably one of the biggest
benefits people get.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:57.250 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people take
remote viewing just

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:59.690 align:middle line:84%
to validate themselves, to
see that it really does work.

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:03.240 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of them do it because
they want to do things with it.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.360 align:middle line:84%
But frankly, you don't
remote view all the time

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.230 align:middle line:84%
even if you're involved in
operational remote viewing.

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:12.150 align:middle line:84%
But you do use your
intuition all the time.

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:14.577 align:middle line:84%
And there's the garden
variety of intuition,

00:18:14.577 --> 00:18:16.410 align:middle line:84%
which is what modern
psychology believes in,

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:19.450 align:middle line:84%
which is just subliminal
perceptual information comes in

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:20.940 align:middle line:84%
coupled with what
you already know.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.790 align:middle line:84%
But I really do believe
there's this ESP

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:25.890 align:middle line:84%
component to true
intuition as well.

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And having this experience
with remote viewing--

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.424 align:middle line:84%
understanding more about how you
work, practicing how you work,

00:18:31.424 --> 00:18:33.090 align:middle line:84%
how your subconscious
and conscious mind

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:36.590 align:middle line:84%
work together to get these
non-local ESP kind of signals

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:38.890 align:middle line:84%
in-- really does
enhance your ability

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:41.170 align:middle line:84%
to use your normal intuition,
pay attention to it,

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:44.820 align:middle line:84%
and learn how to get it
as purely as possible,

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.560 align:middle line:84%
because you know
about mental noise,

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.010 align:middle line:90%
and you know how to avoid it.

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:49.670 align:middle line:90%
And you know how to sort it out.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:52.170 align:middle line:84%
You actually have a much better
experience with it that way.

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Every once in
awhile on "Coast to Coast"

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:55.390 align:middle line:84%
when I'm interviewing
somebody, I

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:58.210 align:middle line:84%
will go into a remote
viewing session with them,

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:00.750 align:middle line:84%
even if we're not talking
about remote viewing.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's strange, Paul,
but nine out of 10 times,

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:07.750 align:middle line:84%
I'll describe to him
what his room looks like,

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.460 align:middle line:90%
what he's doing.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.200 align:middle line:84%
I even told a guy that
he had his feet up

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.070 align:middle line:84%
on the desk with
his socks on and had

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:18.649 align:middle line:84%
a hole in his sock, which
all happened, all happened.

00:19:18.649 --> 00:19:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So how many of them do
you catch in their bathrobes?

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I try not
to look at those.

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Now that's an interesting
question, too.

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:28.707 align:middle line:84%
Can you blot yourself
out on purpose

00:19:28.707 --> 00:19:30.165 align:middle line:84%
if you don't want
to see something?

00:19:30.165 --> 00:19:32.991 align:middle line:90%


00:19:32.991 --> 00:19:34.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: If you don't
want to observe something,

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:36.520 align:middle line:84%
you can make it so
you don't observe it.

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:37.103 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:19:37.103 --> 00:19:39.020 align:middle line:90%
Just to block it out.

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Or does it come
in automatically?

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:43.717 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I know people who-- for
example, in the remote viewing

00:19:43.717 --> 00:19:46.050 align:middle line:84%
program, oftentimes we would
be targeting against people

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:47.680 align:middle line:90%
who are probably dead.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.152 align:middle line:84%
But the viewer, having to be
blind to the circumstances,

00:19:50.152 --> 00:19:51.610 align:middle line:84%
they don't know
what the target is.

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:53.568 align:middle line:84%
They don't even necessarily
know it's a person.

00:19:53.568 --> 00:19:56.519 align:middle line:90%
They have to find that out.

00:19:56.519 --> 00:19:58.310 align:middle line:84%
There are some folks
who absolutely refused

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:00.550 align:middle line:84%
to recognize if
somebody was dead.

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:03.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean just acknowledge
they were dead, but recognize

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.176 align:middle line:84%
there was even a person
there, if they were dead.

00:20:05.176 --> 00:20:07.050 align:middle line:84%
It's like they would
look the other direction

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:09.991 align:middle line:84%
in the psychic domain, you
know, and they'd say, oh yeah,

00:20:09.991 --> 00:20:11.740 align:middle line:84%
there's trees and
flowers, all this stuff.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.072 align:middle line:90%
Well, what about the person?

00:20:13.072 --> 00:20:15.280 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you wouldn't
actually ask the viewer that.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.940 align:middle line:84%
But they would never report
there being a person there.

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.589 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to be,
oftentimes, it's

00:20:19.589 --> 00:20:22.130 align:middle line:84%
because that person was dead
and they were very uncomfortable

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:23.170 align:middle line:90%
with that state.

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If a person
is being remote viewed,

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:29.932 align:middle line:90%
does he or she know that?

00:20:29.932 --> 00:20:31.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The standard
answer is no.

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't
see an eye floating--

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:33.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:35.550 align:middle line:90%
The standard answer is no.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:38.470 align:middle line:84%
But I would like to
see some research done.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:40.540 align:middle line:84%
So there's this
research protocol

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:44.080 align:middle line:84%
in parapsychology
called Direct Mental

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Influence in Living
Systems, DMILS.

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And what they do is determine if
someone in an isolation chamber

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:54.120 align:middle line:84%
can tell when they're
being thought about.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:57.164 align:middle line:84%
And there's some pretty
good evidence that they can.

00:20:57.164 --> 00:20:58.330 align:middle line:90%
They can't tell consciously.

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:01.140 align:middle line:84%
If you ask them consciously
whether they've heard something

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:03.200 align:middle line:84%
or whether they've experienced
something, they say no, I mean,

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.741 align:middle line:84%
I've been sitting there for half
an hour, nothing's happened.

00:21:05.741 --> 00:21:11.230 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at the EG
traces or the skin conductivity

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:12.710 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, you
see spikes where

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:14.660 align:middle line:90%
they've actually been accessed.

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:18.180 align:middle line:84%
I suspect that in-- at
the subconscious level,

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:23.180 align:middle line:84%
the autonomic level,
that probably there

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:26.550 align:middle line:84%
is a recognition, a systemic
recognition that you're

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:27.610 align:middle line:90%
being accessed.

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:30.030 align:middle line:84%
But consciously, I've never
seen any evidence of anybody

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:31.930 align:middle line:84%
who has consciously been aware
they've been remote viewed.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:33.596 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Person is
thinking of somebody.

00:21:33.596 --> 00:21:35.080 align:middle line:90%
That person calls.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.890 align:middle line:84%
I think the two of them
are connected somehow.

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.700 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.150 align:middle line:90%
It's not exactly remote viewing.

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:45.342 align:middle line:84%
It's more like a
non-local connection.

00:21:45.342 --> 00:21:46.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pre-cognitive thing.

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, it
could be pre-cognition.

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.700 align:middle line:84%
Could also be a connection
between the two people, almost

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.940 align:middle line:84%
telepathic, but
at a lesser level

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:57.110 align:middle line:90%
than mental consciousness.

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:59.720 align:middle line:84%
They just become aware that
somebody's going to call them,

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.850 align:middle line:90%
and they do.

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And of course a
scientist would say,

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.504 align:middle line:84%
a skeptical scientist
would say, well, you know,

00:22:06.504 --> 00:22:07.420 align:middle line:90%
it's just coincidence.

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.878 align:middle line:84%
You remember the times when
that happens and you don't when

00:22:09.878 --> 00:22:12.165 align:middle line:84%
there's-- but frankly, I
generally pay attention.

00:22:12.165 --> 00:22:14.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I don't
believe in coincidences.

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:14.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, yeah.

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:16.864 align:middle line:84%
That's a whole nother
show we could talk about.

00:22:16.864 --> 00:22:18.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe the next one.

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:18.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:22.500 align:middle line:84%
I pay attention, because I
know that I'm in this field.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:26.281 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say it happens
more times to me than can

00:22:26.281 --> 00:22:28.030 align:middle line:84%
be explained by the
so-called coincidence.

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:30.917 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it uncanny with
the amount of times it happens?

00:22:30.917 --> 00:22:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Not for me.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:33.369 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of fun.

00:22:33.369 --> 00:22:34.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're used to it now.

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, and that's
the interesting thing

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.354 align:middle line:90%
about remote viewing.

00:22:37.354 --> 00:22:40.140 align:middle line:84%
You start to realize that
this is a normal human thing.

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it ever bother
you that you can remote view?

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:44.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:46.580 align:middle line:84%
Actually, in a way, it's
very enabling and empowering.

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.887 align:middle line:84%
And I think most people
find it that way as well.

00:22:48.887 --> 00:22:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you ever
use it personally

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:53.660 align:middle line:84%
to see that missing Malaysian
plane or anything like that?

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Actually I avoid
those kind of targets.

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:56.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do.

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:56.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:57.299 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How come?

00:22:57.299 --> 00:22:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Because I think that
the psychic signal line, if you

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:04.250 align:middle line:84%
will, is very polluted,
contaminated, in those kind

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:04.750 align:middle line:90%
of settings.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's probably very
hard to get ground truth

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.270 align:middle line:84%
in a remote viewing
setting from that.

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:12.530 align:middle line:84%
You have all of the standard
everyday speculations about it.

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:14.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think of the
thousands, perhaps millions

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:16.140 align:middle line:84%
of articles that
have been-- media

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:17.890 align:middle line:84%
reports on this
thing now, right?

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And everybody has
their own theory,

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:20.725 align:middle line:84%
and they're all
talking about it.

00:23:20.725 --> 00:23:22.959 align:middle line:84%
So that alone can percolate
into the ESP realm.

00:23:22.959 --> 00:23:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think so, too.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.416 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But there's
been probably

00:23:25.416 --> 00:23:27.740 align:middle line:84%
thousands of remote
viewers, or wannabe remote--

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.050 align:middle line:84%
some remote viewers, some
wannabe remote viewers-- who

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:32.060 align:middle line:84%
tried to remote view
it, and they come up

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.601 align:middle line:84%
with all these
different things, too.

00:23:33.601 --> 00:23:36.550 align:middle line:84%
So those kind of high-profile
public kind of things--

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:38.840 align:middle line:84%
this Malaysian flight, the
other Malaysian flight.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.610 align:middle line:10%
JonBenet Ramsey,
whatever-- all of those

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:44.160 align:middle line:10%
have been such a target
of all this speculation

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:47.307 align:middle line:10%
that I think that it's been
hopelessly contaminated.

00:23:47.307 --> 00:23:49.390 align:middle line:84%
So I don't even bother
with those kind of targets.

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:51.181 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Super. "Reading
the Enemy's Mind."

00:23:51.181 --> 00:23:52.412 align:middle line:10%
Where do people get the book?

00:23:52.412 --> 00:23:54.370 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well, you can
get it online at Amazon.

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:57.110 align:middle line:84%
It's actually not in print
anymore except on Kindle.

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We've sold out?

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:01.145 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's sold out,
I guess you could say.

00:24:01.145 --> 00:24:02.770 align:middle line:84%
I do have a new one
coming out, though.

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:03.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's that?

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:03.907 align:middle line:90%
What's the name?

00:24:03.907 --> 00:24:05.364 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: It's called
"The Essential

00:24:05.364 --> 00:24:06.410 align:middle line:10%
Guide to Remote Viewing."

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:07.110 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Excellent.

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:08.560 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: And the
goal is to actually

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.601 align:middle line:10%
to answer these kind of
questions, and many more,

00:24:10.601 --> 00:24:12.600 align:middle line:10%
for people who are
interested in it

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.710 align:middle line:10%
or have friends that
are interested in it,

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:16.510 align:middle line:10%
