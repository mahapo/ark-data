>>BEN FUCHS: When you are
spiritually disconnected

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.900 align:middle line:84%
or mentally not thinking
the right thought,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.520 align:middle line:90%
it shows up physically.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.200 align:middle line:84%
Throughout evolution,
the human body

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.320 align:middle line:84%
has evolved a system for
destroying the enemy.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Our lifestyles are such that
it leads the immune system

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.140 align:middle line:90%
to sometimes act like a rogue.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.810 align:middle line:84%
One of the best
medications is meditation,

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.670 align:middle line:84%
and they call it
mindfulness sometimes.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Meditation's a type
of mindfulness.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.780 align:middle line:84%
When your skin gets
exposed to the sun,

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.000 align:middle line:84%
the photons get
turned into electrons,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.670 align:middle line:84%
which get turned into
biochemistry to run your body.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.980 align:middle line:84%
The sun doesn't just
contact our skin.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:44.940 align:middle line:90%
It contacts our eyes.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.345 align:middle line:84%
And by its relationship
to the eyes,

00:00:47.345 --> 00:00:48.720 align:middle line:84%
by its interaction
with the eyes,

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.790 align:middle line:84%
it communicates to our
brain to make us happy.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.860 align:middle line:84%
Everything just wants
to be appreciated,

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.840 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
mindfulness is, and that's

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.060 align:middle line:84%
what meditation is,
appreciating you.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.463 align:middle line:10%
Pharmacist Ben,
thanks for joining us.

00:01:10.463 --> 00:01:11.713 align:middle line:10%
>>FUCHS: Thanks for having me.

00:01:11.713 --> 00:01:12.960 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You are a legend.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.710 align:middle line:10%
>>FUCHS: [LAUGHS]
You're a legend, George.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:15.340 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You know it?

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.720 align:middle line:10%
>>FUCHS: I'm just a pharmacist.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
get into pharmacy?

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.750 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: I love chemistry.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.970 align:middle line:10%
When I was a kid, I was
one of those guys that

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.217 align:middle line:10%
had a little chemistry set.

00:01:23.217 --> 00:01:24.925 align:middle line:10%
And I was always
fascinated by chemistry.

00:01:24.925 --> 00:01:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I had one too.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Wasn't that cool?

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, mixing and matching.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.280 align:middle line:90%
But then I got into nutrition.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was always blown
away by how nutrients

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.800 align:middle line:84%
could change the body and
how our bodies are made up

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.600 align:middle line:90%
of what we eat.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.990 align:middle line:84%
You know, how does the
lunch we had yesterday

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.260 align:middle line:90%
turn into our hand?

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.430 align:middle line:84%
There's this miracle
that occurs between what

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.568 align:middle line:84%
we put inside our body and
what shows up on our bodies.

00:01:48.568 --> 00:01:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And I was completely
floored by that.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.980 align:middle line:90%
It blew me away.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.420 align:middle line:90%
So I started studying nutrition.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.340 align:middle line:84%
I went to pharmacy
school because I thought,

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.270 align:middle line:84%
believe it or not,
that pharmacists

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.000 align:middle line:84%
would be the go-to people
for understanding how

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.393 align:middle line:90%
to use nutrients as medicines.

00:02:02.393 --> 00:02:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And then when I went
to pharmacy school,

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.240 align:middle line:90%
I found out that's not at all--

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They didn't teach that.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: That's not at
all what they do, no.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They did.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.822 align:middle line:90%
But was it a rude awakening?

00:02:09.822 --> 00:02:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: It was a
totally rude awakening,

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.590 align:middle line:84%
because believe it or not, most
of my time in pharmacy school

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.190 align:middle line:90%
was spent studying toxicity.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.948 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: It was spent
studying poisons, and how

00:02:18.948 --> 00:02:20.860 align:middle line:84%
to control poisons, how
to mitigate poisons,

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.500 align:middle line:84%
how to soften the
blow of side effects,

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.690 align:middle line:84%
how to increase what
they call compliance.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.550 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest
problems in medicine

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.620 align:middle line:84%
is patients don't like
taking their drugs.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.920 align:middle line:84%
They inherently know inside
that there's something

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.893 align:middle line:84%
up with medications,
and so you've

00:02:34.893 --> 00:02:36.310 align:middle line:84%
got to come up
with different ways

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.860 align:middle line:84%
to assure that
patients take drugs.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.030 align:middle line:84%
So I was really troubled by
the idea that when we're sick,

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.458 align:middle line:84%
we actually get
poisoned to get better.

00:02:45.458 --> 00:02:46.750 align:middle line:90%
It just never made sense to me.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.208 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was there
a point that you

00:02:48.208 --> 00:02:49.630 align:middle line:84%
were giving somebody
prescriptions

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.650 align:middle line:90%
and you didn't want to do it?

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.233 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: That's
exactly what happened.

00:02:52.233 --> 00:02:54.258 align:middle line:84%
When I graduated pharmacy
school, I noticed--

00:02:54.258 --> 00:02:56.800 align:middle line:84%
you know, when I was in pharmacy
school, I worked in the lab.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.910 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really
work in drugstores.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And when I got out into
the drugstore world

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.548 align:middle line:84%
and started working in
pharmacies, it dawned on me--

00:03:02.548 --> 00:03:04.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why it
didn't dawn on me

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.785 align:middle line:84%
before-- but it dawned on
me that I was the guy who

00:03:05.785 --> 00:03:06.790 align:middle line:90%
was giving the poison.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was mostly
to young people--

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.047 align:middle line:90%
to babies and older people.

00:03:11.047 --> 00:03:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Those are the people who
get most of the medicine.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.490 align:middle line:84%
So I started suggesting
people to use

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.710 align:middle line:90%
nutrition instead of drugs.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.287 align:middle line:84%
And then pretty soon, as
the effects of the nutrients

00:03:20.287 --> 00:03:22.120 align:middle line:84%
kicked in and people
started getting better,

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.940 align:middle line:84%
I started suggesting that people
use nutrients instead of drugs.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.380 align:middle line:90%
And that did not--

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.420 align:middle line:84%
that did not win me any
friends at the pharmacy

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.532 align:middle line:90%
that I was working at.

00:03:29.532 --> 00:03:30.490 align:middle line:90%
So you know what I did?

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:31.573 align:middle line:90%
I started my own pharmacy.

00:03:31.573 --> 00:03:32.680 align:middle line:90%
I started my own pharmacy.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did your own stuff.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.570 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Yeah, I
did my own stuff.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:35.987 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
our immune system?

00:03:35.987 --> 00:03:37.975 align:middle line:84%
What has the body done
for an immune system?

00:03:37.975 --> 00:03:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: That's
a great question.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.920 align:middle line:84%
It's a relevant question with
all the stuff that's going on

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.950 align:middle line:90%
with diseases, with infections.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.590 align:middle line:84%
The immune system is our
body's evolutionarily

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.652 align:middle line:84%
selected for system
for fighting the enemy.

00:03:50.652 --> 00:03:52.360 align:middle line:84%
You know it's a jungle
out there, George.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Everything is trying to
eat everything else, right?

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.070 align:middle line:84%
So the human body
is a rich source

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.710 align:middle line:84%
of nutrients for
bacteria and viruses

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.660 align:middle line:90%
and microbes of all kinds.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And so throughout
evolution, the human body

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.520 align:middle line:84%
has evolved a system for
destroying the enemy.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And this system, George, is
so unbelievably orchestrated.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.120 align:middle line:90%
It's so complex.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.560 align:middle line:90%
It's almost space age.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.390 align:middle line:84%
You've got little
heat-seeking missiles.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, they talk
about antibodies.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.370 align:middle line:84%
You hear all the talk
about antibodies?

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, sure.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: They're heat-seeking
missiles, George.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.472 align:middle line:84%
And they're not just
heat-seeking missiles.

00:04:22.472 --> 00:04:25.930 align:middle line:84%
They're heat-seeking missiles
that are intelligently designed

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.005 align:middle line:90%
to attack specific enemies.

00:04:28.005 --> 00:04:29.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
group up on it.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: They group up on
it, and they munch it down,

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:32.770 align:middle line:90%
and they shoot it down.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.480 align:middle line:90%
And it's so unbelievable.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.820 align:middle line:84%
If you zoom into it,
it is-- science fiction

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.510 align:middle line:84%
couldn't be any more
dramatic and profound.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Since the immune system
is inherent in our bodies,

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.260 align:middle line:84%
why doesn't it
work all the time?

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: It works pretty
much most of the time.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:55.060 align:middle line:84%
It can get overwhelmed, and
it can also turn in on itself.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the enemy gets
confused with the body.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.120 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the enemy
can change the body

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.833 align:middle line:84%
so that the immune system sees
the body itself as an enemy.

00:05:04.833 --> 00:05:05.875 align:middle line:90%
It's called autoimmunity.

00:05:05.875 --> 00:05:07.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And attacks the body.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.238 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: It attacks the body.

00:05:08.238 --> 00:05:10.150 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't do
it in a wrong way.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.160 align:middle line:84%
It's not crazy and
it's not mistaken.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.933 align:middle line:84%
But something has been
distorted in the body.

00:05:14.933 --> 00:05:17.350 align:middle line:84%
When a distortion occurs in a
body-- when we say the body,

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.850 align:middle line:90%
I mean a cell of the body.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.920 align:middle line:84%
When a cellular
system gets distorted,

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.637 align:middle line:90%
it looks foreign to the body.

00:05:22.637 --> 00:05:24.220 align:middle line:84%
So the real question
with autoimmunity

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.820 align:middle line:84%
is, what is causing
this distortion?

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:26.620 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.980 align:middle line:84%
It almost always
involves our lifestyle.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the
bottom line, George.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.270 align:middle line:84%
The immune system is close to
perfect, as close to perfect

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.120 align:middle line:90%
as you can get.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.350 align:middle line:84%
But our lifestyles are such
that it leads the immune system

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.530 align:middle line:90%
to sometimes act like a rogue.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want you
to react to this, Ben.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.210 align:middle line:84%
On one of the Gaia's
programs, "Healing Matrix,"

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.650 align:middle line:84%
David Wolfe talks about
activated charcoal in a world

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.540 align:middle line:90%
filled with all kinds of toxins.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.543 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:05:53.543 --> 00:05:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID WOLFE: We
live in a toxic world.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.880 align:middle line:10%
Our food, air, and water
is loaded with toxins.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just driving down
the highway here to get here,

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.270 align:middle line:90%
we've got all this exhaust.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.853 align:middle line:84%
We're breathing in
all this brake dust

00:06:02.853 --> 00:06:04.933 align:middle line:84%
and exhaust from
all these engines.

00:06:04.933 --> 00:06:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Some of the worst
carcinogens are right there.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.640 align:middle line:90%
We're breathing it in.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.860 align:middle line:84%
We're relying on our liver,
our kidneys, and our spleen

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.470 align:middle line:84%
and other filtration organs
to filter that stuff off.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.390 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
we're overloaded?

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say the answer
is very likely yes.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.180 align:middle line:84%
So carbon is an
excellent detoxifier.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.020 align:middle line:90%
It's the best.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.960 align:middle line:90%
It cleans your water.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.760 align:middle line:90%
Charcoal filters.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.450 align:middle line:90%
It cleans your air.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:26.320 align:middle line:90%
Charcoal filters.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.700 align:middle line:84%
It's what's used, for
example, in dialysis.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.250 align:middle line:84%
What do they use to
clean your blood?

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:31.360 align:middle line:90%
Charcoal filters.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.670 align:middle line:84%
What is the best filtration
mechanism there is?

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:34.720 align:middle line:90%
It's charcoal.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's adsorptive,
interestingly.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.790 align:middle line:90%
Not absorptive like a sponge.

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.640 align:middle line:84%
Adsorptive, like
electromagnetically

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.510 align:middle line:84%
attracts the wrong charge
materials like heavy metals,

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:47.860 align:middle line:90%
for example, or glyphosate.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.487 align:middle line:84%
It's attracted to the
charcoal, so it's not a sponge.

00:06:50.487 --> 00:06:51.820 align:middle line:90%
People think, oh, it's a sponge.

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:52.840 align:middle line:90%
It isn't.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE MORTER: So it's
more like electroplating.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:54.700 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Uh-huh.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:55.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.552 align:middle line:90%
It's like a refrigerator.

00:06:56.552 --> 00:06:58.843 align:middle line:84%
You know, the charcoal comes
in like your refrigerator,

00:06:58.843 --> 00:07:00.833 align:middle line:84%
and it attracts all
those magnets to it.

00:07:00.833 --> 00:07:02.500 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, there's
too many magnets

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.292 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't stick
to the fridge anymore,

00:07:04.292 --> 00:07:06.040 align:middle line:84%
and then that
charcoal's been used up.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.440 align:middle line:84%
But that takes a
while to use it up.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've seen people
take charcoal supplements.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.390 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Well, not
necessarily supplements,

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.105 align:middle line:90%
but on a daily basis.

00:07:15.105 --> 00:07:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Dave Wolfe's
awesome, by the way.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And charcoal's the
universal antidote.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.980 align:middle line:84%
In pharmacy school, we used it
as an antidote for poisoning.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:21.780 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Because as David
says, it adsorbs--

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:24.610 align:middle line:90%
A-D-- adsorbs--

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:25.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just like a sponge.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:26.395 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Not like a sponge.

00:07:26.395 --> 00:07:29.230 align:middle line:84%
A sponge is when the stuff
goes inside the sponge.

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:30.850 align:middle line:90%
Adsorption is on the surface.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.290 align:middle line:84%
It's an electromagnetic
phenomena.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:33.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It doesn't take it in.

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: It doesn't
take it in, no.

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:35.080 align:middle line:90%
It sits on the surface.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:35.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But it collects it.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: It collects
it electromagnetically.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:38.958 align:middle line:84%
It's got a very
large surface area,

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.500 align:middle line:84%
and it's very electromagnet--
has electromagnetic properties.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.282 align:middle line:84%
There's a substance
called fullerenes.

00:07:43.282 --> 00:07:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Have you heard of this,
this C60 or fullerenes?

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:45.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, tell me about that.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: It's a
derivative of carbon,

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.110 align:middle line:84%
and it comes from charcoal,
and it's actually used now

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:53.140 align:middle line:90%
medicinally to deliver things.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.550 align:middle line:90%
Acts like a delivery system.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.550 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazing molecule, also
known as C60 or buckyballs.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.590 align:middle line:84%
Remember, Buckminster
Fuller came up with it.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:00.760 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.500 align:middle line:90%
It looks like a soccer ball.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a molecular soccer
ball with a hollow center.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:08.470 align:middle line:84%
It's the most gorgeous,
beautiful, symmetrical molecule

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.990 align:middle line:84%
that has 60 carbons,
all arranged

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.270 align:middle line:84%
in this symmetrical fashion
that forms a soccer ball.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And the soccer ball's
hollow in the middle,

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:18.640 align:middle line:84%
and that allows fullerenes to
be used as a delivery system, as

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.125 align:middle line:90%
well as a detoxifying system.

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:21.250 align:middle line:90%
And it comes from charcoal.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:22.585 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who designed all this?

00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:22.930 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: [LAUGHS]

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:23.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Come on.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:24.410 align:middle line:90%
Who designed this?

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Don't you love it?

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This isn't just random.

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:27.210 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yeah.

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:29.590 align:middle line:84%
We should be in awe
of this, George.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.409 align:middle line:84%
And I know you are, because
I listen to your show.

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:33.970 align:middle line:84%
Everything-- just
look around us.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:35.559 align:middle line:90%
Just the world itself--

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:36.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:37.900 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Amazing, George.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.549 align:middle line:84%
This is what we
want to be honoring.

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:40.600 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
health-- you know,

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.559 align:middle line:90%
I'm a health care professional.

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:42.976 align:middle line:84%
But I'm a health
care professional

00:08:42.976 --> 00:08:45.850 align:middle line:84%
because I'm in awe of
the biochemical system

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:47.650 align:middle line:90%
of biochemistry and biology.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Like you said, who
puts it together?

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:50.350 align:middle line:90%
We talked about a cell.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:51.150 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what?

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.950 align:middle line:84%
A cell is one 100th the
size of a head of a pin.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.003 align:middle line:84%
And when you think about
high school biology,

00:08:56.003 --> 00:08:57.670 align:middle line:84%
you remember a cell
was a circle, right?

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:58.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hmm.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Not a circle.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a blob.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And within that blob, you
have hundreds of thousands

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:06.820 align:middle line:84%
of chemicals changing
every second.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:07.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And reacting.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.050 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Every second, George.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:09.850 align:middle line:90%
Imagine.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.410 align:middle line:84%
How big would a
factory have to be

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.592 align:middle line:84%
to make 100,000 different
molecules at all,

00:09:14.592 --> 00:09:15.550 align:middle line:90%
let alone every second?

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's all occurring
with an intelligence that

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.370 align:middle line:90%
is beyond our comprehension.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:21.935 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then why do
people get cancer, Ben?

00:09:21.935 --> 00:09:24.310 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Well, you know, we've
mucked up our environment.

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:26.815 align:middle line:84%
Cancer is a sign of a
body that's under duress.

00:09:26.815 --> 00:09:28.690 align:middle line:84%
You know, a cancer cell
is a very smart cell.

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:29.523 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, wait.

00:09:29.523 --> 00:09:30.550 align:middle line:90%
Was there cancer 2,000--

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:31.540 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yes, absolutely.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.457 align:middle line:84%
There's cancer that
happened in ancient Egypt.

00:09:33.457 --> 00:09:34.450 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.460 align:middle line:90%
A cell-- this is so cool.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.230 align:middle line:84%
A cell that we have,
that we talk about--

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:40.540 align:middle line:84%
I just talked about
the cell in the body--

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:41.920 align:middle line:90%
that's an advanced cell.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.900 align:middle line:84%
But there's also a
primitive type of cell.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:45.025 align:middle line:90%
There's two types of cells.

00:09:45.025 --> 00:09:48.220 align:middle line:84%
They call them prokaryotes and
eukaryotes, primitive cells

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.360 align:middle line:90%
and advanced cells.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.240 align:middle line:84%
A cancer cell is a
cell that has gone back

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.520 align:middle line:84%
from being an
advanced cell in time

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.380 align:middle line:84%
to becoming a primitive
cell, because it

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:57.730 align:middle line:90%
doesn't know what else to do.

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.005 align:middle line:90%
It's at its wit's end.

00:09:59.005 --> 00:10:00.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But it replicates.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:01.960 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Well, here's the thing.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.040 align:middle line:84%
In order for a cell to
become a liver cell,

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.050 align:middle line:84%
it has to give up
something of itself.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.890 align:middle line:84%
It has to sacrifice its
independence so it can become

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:10.460 align:middle line:90%
a liver cell or a bone cell.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.930 align:middle line:84%
But if it's been abused,
malnourished, suffocated,

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:15.350 align:middle line:90%
toxic, you know what it says?

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:16.855 align:middle line:90%
It says, forget you.

00:10:16.855 --> 00:10:18.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
be a liver cell.

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm out of here.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: I'm out of here.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:20.430 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:22.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
divide on my own.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And a cancer cell is a cell that
is not cooperating any longer.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a sociopathic cell, and
it only becomes sociopathic

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.510 align:middle line:84%
when it's at its
wit's end and it

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:32.897 align:middle line:90%
doesn't know what else to do.

00:10:32.897 --> 00:10:33.730 align:middle line:90%
And that's the idea.

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:36.260 align:middle line:84%
We have this war on cancer and
we're going to fight cancer.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.390 align:middle line:90%
Cancer's us.

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:38.990 align:middle line:90%
It's our cells.

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And when you fight cancer,
you're fighting yourself.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost emblematic--
our idea of how we treat cancer

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.350 align:middle line:84%
is almost a paragon of
this idea of the enemy

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:49.060 align:middle line:90%
being outside of us.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:50.290 align:middle line:90%
Remember Pogo?

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:50.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.435 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: I have seen
the enemy, and he is us.

00:10:52.435 --> 00:10:53.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He is us.

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Right.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:55.120 align:middle line:90%
The enemy is us.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And what we want to be
doing is loving our body,

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:58.540 align:middle line:90%
not killing our body.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Cancer is a sign that the
body needs to be nourished,

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.100 align:middle line:84%
a sign that the body needs to
be breathed and oxygenated,

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.710 align:middle line:84%
a sign that the body needs
to be cleaned and detoxified.

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:11.000 align:middle line:84%
In short, a sign that the body
needs to be loved, not killed.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.490 align:middle line:84%
This whole medical
strategy of killing cancer

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:15.650 align:middle line:84%
is emblematic of how
we treat all diseases.

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:16.640 align:middle line:90%
We fight them.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.480 align:middle line:90%
We kill them.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.360 align:middle line:84%
We create a war on them when
in reality, all they need,

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.760 align:middle line:90%
George, is a little bit of love.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do some people
get diseases and others simply

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:27.290 align:middle line:90%
don't?

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:29.373 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: You just said it
right there in the word.

00:11:29.373 --> 00:11:30.560 align:middle line:90%
Dis-ease.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.050 align:middle line:90%
Dis-ease means out of ease.

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:35.930 align:middle line:84%
When we are out of ease, whether
it's spiritually-- you know,

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:37.370 align:middle line:90%
I talk about this all the time--

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:40.710 align:middle line:84%
spiritually,
mentally-- mentally,

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:43.228 align:middle line:84%
emotionally or physically,
when we are out of ease on one

00:11:43.228 --> 00:11:45.020 align:middle line:84%
of those levels or on
all of those levels--

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:45.980 align:middle line:90%
I call it SMEP--

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.490 align:middle line:84%
what ends up happening is the
body's stress response system

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:50.300 align:middle line:90%
kicks in.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And the stress
response system, which

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:54.950 align:middle line:84%
is a manifestation
of this dis-ease,

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:58.250 align:middle line:84%
it's like running your house
on an emergency generator

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.680 align:middle line:84%
or running your
computer on safe mode.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.270 align:middle line:84%
It allows you to do a
certain amount of things,

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:05.503 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't allow you
to be fully functional.

00:12:05.503 --> 00:12:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that happens

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.450 align:middle line:84%
when we're under large
amounts of duress

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:09.908 align:middle line:84%
and we're secreting
stress hormones

00:12:09.908 --> 00:12:12.380 align:middle line:90%
is our defenses go down.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Our immune system
becomes suppressed.

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.130 align:middle line:84%
That's why you use
cortisol creams.

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:19.280 align:middle line:84%
When you have an immune
reaction on your skin,

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.565 align:middle line:90%
they give you cortisol creams.

00:12:20.565 --> 00:12:22.940 align:middle line:84%
They give you a cream that
suppresses your immune system.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Cortisol and stress
suppress the immune system.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:25.940 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:30.230 align:middle line:84%
Because stress management
is a long-term endeavor.

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:33.140 align:middle line:84%
To manage stress doesn't have
to do with the short term.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you're
also an expert in skin.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:36.560 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yes.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're not
a dermatologist.

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:38.360 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: No.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're a pharmacist.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: I'm a
dermatological pharmacist.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But how did you
get involved in that?

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:42.750 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Ah, long story.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:44.930 align:middle line:84%
But I went to the University
of Colorado in Boulder

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.722 align:middle line:84%
and I had this
incredible opportunity.

00:12:46.722 --> 00:12:48.180 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
don't realize this,

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.763 align:middle line:84%
but you know the lip
medicine Blistex?

00:12:49.763 --> 00:12:52.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out that the
gentleman who invented Blistex

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:54.048 align:middle line:84%
was a professor
at the University

00:12:54.048 --> 00:12:55.340 align:middle line:90%
of Colorado School of Pharmacy.

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you knew him.

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: And he was
a retired professor,

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.900 align:middle line:84%
and I just stumbled
into his lab one day,

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.840 align:middle line:84%
and the next thing I knew, I
was his research assistant.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And for the next four years
I was in the laboratory,

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.350 align:middle line:90%
making skin care products.

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:09.090 align:middle line:84%
Testing skin care products,
learning about the skin,

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:11.480 align:middle line:84%
making formulas
for Dr. Jones, just

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.880 align:middle line:84%
getting a soup to nuts
experience and background

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:17.150 align:middle line:84%
and education in how you
make pharmacy-quality,

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:19.340 align:middle line:84%
medicinal-quality
skin care products.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is melanoma?

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Melanoma is probably
the most aggressive cancer.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:27.650 align:middle line:84%
It's a cancer of what I consider
as a skin care guy, but even

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:29.600 align:middle line:84%
a biochemistry
guy, to be the most

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.930 align:middle line:84%
fascinating cell in the body,
and that is the melanocyte.

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:35.570 align:middle line:90%
Cyte in biology means cell.

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:37.670 align:middle line:84%
Melanocyte is a cell
that makes melanin.

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:39.950 align:middle line:90%
Melanin-- pigment, right--

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:42.050 align:middle line:90%
is so unbelievable, George.

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:43.790 align:middle line:84%
They use it in
computer chips now,

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:46.610 align:middle line:84%
because it has an ability to
transduce electrical energy.

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:47.510 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine this?

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:50.990 align:middle line:84%
It has this incredible ability
to hold onto and transduce

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:54.320 align:middle line:84%
and manipulate electrons,
electronic energy and photons,

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.253 align:middle line:90%
photonic energy.

00:13:55.253 --> 00:13:56.420 align:middle line:90%
It's a fascinating molecule.

00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:00.830 align:middle line:84%
But all of this
electrical energy

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:04.220 align:middle line:84%
makes it very powerful when it
comes to the way cells divide.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:08.848 align:middle line:84%
And melanocytes are famous
for dividing very rapidly

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:09.890 align:middle line:90%
in the case of melanomas.

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:11.570 align:middle line:84%
So rapidly that it's
considered to be

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:12.200 align:middle line:90%
the deadliest form of cancer.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.533 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, you could
have a small little melanoma,

00:14:14.533 --> 00:14:16.007 align:middle line:90%
cancerous, and it'll kill you.

00:14:16.007 --> 00:14:16.840 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Absolutely.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:17.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How does that happen?

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Electricity.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.278 align:middle line:84%
You know, we talk about
chemistry all the time,

00:14:20.278 --> 00:14:21.470 align:middle line:90%
and I love biochemistry.

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:24.830 align:middle line:84%
But really, biochemistry is
secondary to bioelectricity.

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And any time you're
working with electricity,

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.475 align:middle line:90%
it's like any electricity.

00:14:28.475 --> 00:14:30.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a dual-edged sword,
a double-edged sword.

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:32.360 align:middle line:84%
Electricity can
turn on your light.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.680 align:middle line:90%
Electricity can kill you.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And in the body,
bioelectricity can

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:38.520 align:middle line:84%
run your body or bioelectrical
phenomena can cause cancer.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.280 align:middle line:84%
In fact, cancer at
the end of the day

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:44.240 align:middle line:84%
is a biochemical disruption at
the level of the cell membrane.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.280 align:middle line:84%
It's a biochemical
phenomena more

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.180 align:middle line:84%
than it is a
chemistry phenomena.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the entire body is
a biochemical phenomena more

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:51.290 align:middle line:90%
than it is a biochemical.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some
dermatologists recommend

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:55.265 align:middle line:90%
that we stay out of the sun.

00:14:55.265 --> 00:14:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: [LAUGHS]

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Others like
you say, get some sun.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.310 align:middle line:84%
Get that vitamin
D3 in your system,

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:03.900 align:middle line:90%
a natural thing from the sun.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:04.700 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: It's more than vitamin
D. It's a mood stabilizer.

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.700 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the sun doesn't
just contact our skin.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:11.690 align:middle line:90%
It contacts our eyes.

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:14.095 align:middle line:84%
And by its relationship
to the eyes,

00:15:14.095 --> 00:15:15.470 align:middle line:84%
by its interaction
with the eyes,

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:17.660 align:middle line:84%
it communicates to our
brain to make us happy,

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:18.980 align:middle line:90%
to make us eat less food.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.272 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've seen that happen.

00:15:20.272 --> 00:15:22.420 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: To make us
stronger, to build tissue.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.170 align:middle line:84%
Sunglasses are one of
the worst things you

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:25.490 align:middle line:90%
can wear for this, by the way.

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:27.480 align:middle line:90%
I never wear sunglasses.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I have to.

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.150 align:middle line:90%
You squint.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:30.203 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Well, I just--

00:15:30.203 --> 00:15:31.370 align:middle line:90%
I don't squint, necessarily.

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:32.960 align:middle line:84%
By the way, first thing in
the morning if you look right

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.850 align:middle line:84%
into the sun really
quickly when you wake up,

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:36.918 align:middle line:84%
you'll get a big
surge of serotonin,

00:15:36.918 --> 00:15:38.210 align:middle line:90%
and it'll set you off on your--

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Yes, first
thing in the morning.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:41.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't look
at it too long.

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: No, you don't
want to burn your eyes.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:45.690 align:middle line:84%
But just look at it real
quickly for five or 10 seconds.

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:48.530 align:middle line:84%
So the sun, though, like we
were saying about electricity,

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:49.860 align:middle line:90%
is very powerful.

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're not
careful with the sun

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:54.278 align:middle line:84%
and you're not
nutritionally sound,

00:15:54.278 --> 00:15:55.820 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to
be able to handle

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.250 align:middle line:84%
all that photonic energy,
and it can stimulate things

00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:59.820 align:middle line:90%
like, for example, cancers.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:03.270 align:middle line:84%
However, we are solar
beings in the sense

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:06.750 align:middle line:84%
that we derive electrical
energy from exposure to the sun.

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:09.420 align:middle line:84%
When your skin gets
exposed to the sun,

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.640 align:middle line:84%
the photons get
turned into electrons,

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.340 align:middle line:84%
which get turned into
biochemistry to run your body.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:18.293 align:middle line:84%
So we are not fully, but at
least partially, solar beings,

00:16:18.293 --> 00:16:19.710 align:middle line:84%
and we derive
energy from the sun.

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:22.500 align:middle line:84%
In fact, eating
food is really just

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.660 align:middle line:84%
to derive the energy
that's been trapped

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:25.922 align:middle line:90%
in that food from the sun.

00:16:25.922 --> 00:16:27.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think of sunscreens?

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Well,
sunscreens need to be

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.840 align:middle line:84%
distinguished from sunblocks,
which is very important.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's a difference?

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:33.750 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: There's a
difference, absolutely.

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is not something that
a lot of people know about.

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:37.710 align:middle line:84%
So we'll talk about sun
protection in general.

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:40.560 align:middle line:90%
Sunscreens are toxic chemicals.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to
eat a sunscreen,

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.600 align:middle line:90%
octyl methoxycinnamate--

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.517 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, no, you're
not going to eat it.

00:16:45.517 --> 00:16:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Well, it
would be deadly poison.

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:48.570 align:middle line:90%
And you're right.

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:49.290 align:middle line:90%
You're not going to eat it.

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:50.790 align:middle line:84%
But do you really want
to put a deadly poison

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:51.750 align:middle line:90%
on top of your skin?

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Doesn't that
absorb it into your body?

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:53.963 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Absolutely.

00:16:53.963 --> 00:16:56.590 align:middle line:84%
There's measurable amounts
of sunscreen chemicals

00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:59.430 align:middle line:84%
in various tissues of the body
when you put sunscreens on,

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:02.520 align:middle line:84%
particularly the very powerful
ones, which are called benzos.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.160 align:middle line:84%
Sunblocks on the other
hand-- oh, and by the way,

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.260 align:middle line:84%
sunscreens don't
block all sun rays.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.085 align:middle line:90%
They only block UVB rays.

00:17:09.085 --> 00:17:10.710 align:middle line:84%
There's three different
major sun rays.

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:12.085 align:middle line:84%
There's three
different sun rays.

00:17:12.085 --> 00:17:13.588 align:middle line:90%
There's UVA, UVB, and UVC.

00:17:13.588 --> 00:17:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, you could put extra
poison in your sunscreen

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:18.210 align:middle line:84%
to block the UVA, but
most sunscreens will only

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:19.800 align:middle line:90%
block UVB, the burning ray.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.482 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do people
get sick from this?

00:17:21.482 --> 00:17:22.440 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: We don't know.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.099 align:middle line:84%
As a lot of times,
we don't know.

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:26.910 align:middle line:84%
But we do know that
sunscreens are cytotoxic,

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:28.660 align:middle line:90%
meaning they're toxic to cells.

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to put a
sunscreen in a Petri dish

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.598 align:middle line:84%
with a bunch of cells, that
cell would become toxic.

00:17:33.598 --> 00:17:35.265 align:middle line:84%
Now to me, as a health
care professional

00:17:35.265 --> 00:17:36.990 align:middle line:84%
and as a skin care
professional, that

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:38.790 align:middle line:90%
doesn't seem very smart to do.

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:41.202 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in Hawaii-- you
probably know this-- in Hawaii,

00:17:41.202 --> 00:17:43.410 align:middle line:84%
they won't even let you wear
sunscreens in the water,

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:44.618 align:middle line:90%
because it'll kill the coral.

00:17:44.618 --> 00:17:45.418 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:17:45.418 --> 00:17:46.240 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Right?

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:46.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The chemicals.

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:47.807 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: That's right.

00:17:47.807 --> 00:17:49.810 align:middle line:84%
But sunblocks, on
the other hand--

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:51.000 align:middle line:90%
there's two major sunblocks.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.950 align:middle line:90%
One's called titanium dioxide.

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:54.360 align:middle line:90%
The other's called zinc oxide.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.145 align:middle line:84%
Those reflect all
of the sun's rays.

00:17:56.145 --> 00:17:58.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Again they're
all chemicals, though.

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:01.710 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Well, zinc oxide
is a nutritional substance.

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:04.335 align:middle line:84%
So zinc oxide is the
way to go if you're

00:18:04.335 --> 00:18:05.460 align:middle line:90%
going to protect your skin.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I don't think that
you need to worry necessarily

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.270 align:middle line:84%
about protecting your skin
unless you're baking out

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:10.320 align:middle line:90%
in the sun, and then you do.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Or you're playing
golf or playing tennis

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.080 align:middle line:90%
or hanging out at the beach.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.780 align:middle line:84%
But zinc oxide heals
your skin in addition

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.750 align:middle line:84%
to being a sun-protective
chemical or molecule.

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, once again
on Gaia's "Healing Matrix"

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:24.750 align:middle line:84%
television show,
Joshua Onysko who

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:28.320 align:middle line:84%
is an expert in skin, talks
about different chemicals

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.443 align:middle line:90%
as you have been in skincare.

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:32.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: One of
the things you write about

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:36.210 align:middle line:84%
and talk about is the
fact that 95% of products

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:38.070 align:middle line:84%
are not the product
you think you're

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.350 align:middle line:84%
getting that's being advertised
but actually fillers.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.510 align:middle line:84%
So let's just start
launching into what's

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:43.845 align:middle line:90%
in the stuff we put on us.

00:18:43.845 --> 00:18:46.470 align:middle line:10%
>>JOSHUA ONYSKO: So when you go
out and buy a cosmetic product,

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:50.380 align:middle line:10%
it's usually made of 95% filler,
which means it's generally

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.470 align:middle line:10%
a petroleum-based filler.

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:53.760 align:middle line:10%
Fills up the packaging.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.130 align:middle line:10%
And then the company
will put a couple percent

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:58.830 align:middle line:10%
of what's called an active
ingredient, which gives you

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:02.370 align:middle line:10%
this desired effect, whether
it's moisturizing or hydrating,

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:03.750 align:middle line:10%
removing fine
lines and wrinkles.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:05.468 align:middle line:84%
So you're getting
this effect, which

00:19:05.468 --> 00:19:07.260 align:middle line:84%
makes you think, oh,
the product's working.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.640 align:middle line:84%
But then the next
morning you wake up

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.200 align:middle line:84%
and you have to
reapply and reapply.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.210 align:middle line:90%
And it's not feeding the skin.

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:14.470 align:middle line:84%
It's not actually adding
nutrition to the skin.

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:16.200 align:middle line:84%
It's just giving you
this desired effect.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And when we're using
plants, and plants

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.890 align:middle line:84%
are distilled properly
and combined properly

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:23.550 align:middle line:84%
and the product is
being created properly,

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:27.270 align:middle line:84%
plants can actually deliver both
the immediate effects, but also

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.557 align:middle line:84%
long-term nourishment
for the skin.

00:19:29.557 --> 00:19:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And as I was saying
earlier, your skin

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:32.220 align:middle line:90%
is your largest organ.

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.800 align:middle line:84%
We need to be feeding it
the same things that we're

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:35.950 align:middle line:90%
feeding our body.

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And as we were talking
about before the show,

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:41.550 align:middle line:84%
95% of skin care and
skin health is nutrition.

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:43.288 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
agree with that, Ben?

00:19:43.288 --> 00:19:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: A lot of what he said.

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.560 align:middle line:90%
Plants are adaptogenic.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:50.580 align:middle line:90%
Plants act to-- this is so cool.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.282 align:middle line:84%
The maker, whatever
put everything--

00:19:52.282 --> 00:19:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a great design.

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Right?

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:54.720 align:middle line:90%
It's a great design.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.650 align:middle line:84%
Plants have molecules in
them that defend our cells.

00:19:58.650 --> 00:19:59.790 align:middle line:90%
They call them adaptogens.

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:01.123 align:middle line:90%
You may have heard of this term.

00:20:01.123 --> 00:20:03.755 align:middle line:84%
And that is they're stress
management molecules.

00:20:03.755 --> 00:20:05.130 align:middle line:84%
There's some
nutrition in plants,

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:06.690 align:middle line:90%
but their real claim to fame--

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.815 align:middle line:84%
I should say, there's a
lot of nutrition in plants,

00:20:08.815 --> 00:20:11.040 align:middle line:84%
but not all of it's
available through the skin.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Plants' claim to fame, if
you will, on the skin, is it

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:17.760 align:middle line:84%
has an ability to protect
cells from the environment.

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And that is so cool that
there's this interaction,

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:24.210 align:middle line:84%
this cooperative relationship,
this symbiotic relationship

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:27.630 align:middle line:84%
between plants and
animals in the sense

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:29.520 align:middle line:90%
that plants protect animals.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Plant cells protect
animal cells.

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:33.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:35.548 align:middle line:84%
That design is there to
take care of all of us.

00:20:35.548 --> 00:20:36.840 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Isn't it unbelievable?

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.132 align:middle line:84%
I remember there was a fire
in Boulder a few years ago,

00:20:39.132 --> 00:20:45.690 align:middle line:84%
and the very herb that's
needed to heal burns

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:48.720 align:middle line:84%
grew where all of
the trees had--

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.475 align:middle line:90%
St. John's wort, it's called--

00:20:50.475 --> 00:20:52.350 align:middle line:84%
grew where all the trees
had been burnt down.

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:55.560 align:middle line:84%
Nature had somehow in its
wisdom put St. John's wort

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.990 align:middle line:84%
on the area that had been
burnt, the same way you would

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:00.730 align:middle line:84%
put St. John's wort on a burn
if you had a burn on your body.

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you know, you see
some of these classical movies,

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:06.460 align:middle line:84%
and somebody gets
wounded or cut,

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:10.210 align:middle line:84%
and a Native American
comes by and takes

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:13.270 align:middle line:84%
some herbs or something that
patches them up and sticks it.

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:14.978 align:middle line:84%
How did they know how
to do those things?

00:21:14.978 --> 00:21:15.778 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: My god.

00:21:15.778 --> 00:21:17.020 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea how they knew.

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:18.250 align:middle line:84%
You know-- I'll tell
you how they knew.

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:19.360 align:middle line:90%
Did you ever hear of Findhorn?

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:19.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:22.097 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Findhorn was a
place I think in-- somewhere

00:21:22.097 --> 00:21:23.020 align:middle line:90%
in the North Atlantic.

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:24.437 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure exactly
where it was.

00:21:24.437 --> 00:21:27.790 align:middle line:84%
But they discovered that if
they talked to the plants,

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:30.160 align:middle line:84%
not only would the plants
communicate back to them

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.550 align:middle line:84%
what they needed, but
the plants would actually

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:35.710 align:middle line:84%
grow bigger and
stronger and better

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:37.910 align:middle line:84%
if they were communicated
to and talking to.

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And so if you ask a
Native indigenous person,

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:43.120 align:middle line:84%
they will tell you, we learnt
by talking to the plants.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.280 align:middle line:84%
They told us what they
were, and they told us

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.800 align:middle line:84%
how we could use them, and
they told us what they needed.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.382 align:middle line:84%
And when you think about
it, it kind of makes sense

00:21:50.382 --> 00:21:52.590 align:middle line:84%
that everything would have
an ability to communicate.

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:54.100 align:middle line:84%
It's just we don't
speak the language.

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:55.892 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, this is
an interesting study

00:21:55.892 --> 00:21:59.740 align:middle line:84%
that was conducted with
plants, a real experiment where

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:04.060 align:middle line:84%
they hooked up an EEG
device to two plants.

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:07.570 align:middle line:90%
And they darkened the room.

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:11.700 align:middle line:84%
A guy comes in, and they've got
their readings on the plants.

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.810 align:middle line:90%
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:18.400 align:middle line:84%
A guy comes in and rips the
shred out of one of the plants.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.900 align:middle line:84%
Pulls it out of a pot,
breaks it up, throws it away,

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.210 align:middle line:84%
and the other plant
is next to it.

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:26.087 align:middle line:90%
All of a sudden--

00:22:26.087 --> 00:22:26.920 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Freaks out.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --its EEG
is going crazy.

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:29.860 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yeah.

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:32.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, it really is
responding to the stimulus.

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:32.950 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: That's right.

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:34.510 align:middle line:84%
It was a guy named
Cleve Backster.

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:34.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:35.200 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Right?

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.715 align:middle line:90%
He was a lie detector guy.

00:22:36.715 --> 00:22:38.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The late Cleve.

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: The late Cleve.

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:38.860 align:middle line:90%
Did you know him?

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:39.410 align:middle line:90%
Did you have him--

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I
had him on the show.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Isn't that amazing?

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:42.110 align:middle line:90%
"The Secret Life of Plants."

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: What's more, if
you thought about the plant,

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:46.550 align:middle line:84%
if you thought something
bad about the plant--

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:46.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It would pick it up.

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:47.560 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: It would pick it up.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It would register.

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:48.730 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Exactly.

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:50.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And then the guy left.

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:51.282 align:middle line:90%
The plant calmed down.

00:22:51.282 --> 00:22:52.240 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Isn't that a--

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.522 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He comes back in--

00:22:53.522 --> 00:22:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: It freaks out again?

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:55.870 align:middle line:90%
It remembers.

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Oh my god.

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:57.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's unbelievable.

00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Yeah,
it's unbelievable.

00:22:58.690 --> 00:22:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
you explain that?

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:01.752 align:middle line:10%
>>FUCHS: Because we are
so arrogant to think that

00:23:01.752 --> 00:23:03.690 align:middle line:10%
we're the only sentient
beings on the planet,

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:05.440 align:middle line:10%
that we're the only--
not sentient beings,

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.480 align:middle line:10%
but we're the highest
of the sentient beings.

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.950 align:middle line:10%
We don't respect animals either.

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:10.600 align:middle line:10%
Have you ever had Temple
Grandin on the show?

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:10.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Temple Grandin
is an autistic professor.

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.060 align:middle line:84%
She has autism and she's
a professor at CSU.

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And because she's so
in tune with things,

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:20.890 align:middle line:84%
she understands how
to speak to animals,

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:22.360 align:middle line:90%
how to communicate to animals.

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And she designs various
humane slaughtering machines,

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.110 align:middle line:84%
because she understands how
to communicate to animals.

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:33.925 align:middle line:84%
And she says in her books,
animals have just as much

00:23:33.925 --> 00:23:36.680 align:middle line:84%
of a soul, life as
a human being does.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And when you think about
it, why shouldn't they?

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:39.490 align:middle line:90%
Why shouldn't all living things?

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:40.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's alive.

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: It's alive.

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:41.830 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think an ant
has some kind of ability.

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:45.010 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Sentience.

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:46.168 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely believe that.

00:23:46.168 --> 00:23:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
all intelligent.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:48.510 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Exactly.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:50.080 align:middle line:84%
Even the cell itself
is intelligent.

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You ever see a group
of ants build something?

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:53.410 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: How do they
do that, George?

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:54.400 align:middle line:90%
How do termites?

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.713 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever see termites, the
kind of buildings termites do?

00:23:57.713 --> 00:23:59.380 align:middle line:84%
Everything you're
talking about, George,

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:01.690 align:middle line:84%
those are the things that
should make headlines.

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:02.490 align:middle line:90%
Those are the--

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:03.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Those are
wonders of this planet,

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:04.840 align:middle line:90%
to tell you the truth.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:05.640 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yes.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:09.470 align:middle line:84%
But because our brains
are hardwired to survive,

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:10.270 align:middle line:90%
we see negative.

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:11.620 align:middle line:90%
We have a negative bias.

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:12.910 align:middle line:90%
We always see the dark side.

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:14.660 align:middle line:84%
We always see the bad
side, because that's

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:16.240 align:middle line:90%
the part that's threatening.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Spiritual, mental,
emotional, and physical.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.480 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: SMEP.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:21.610 align:middle line:90%
It's a combination.

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:22.430 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yes.

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:24.430 align:middle line:84%
As a healer, somebody in
the healing profession,

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:27.700 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that when
I was dispensing

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:30.490 align:middle line:84%
nutritional strategies or
using nutritional strategies

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:32.810 align:middle line:84%
and recommending supplements,
people would get better,

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:34.090 align:middle line:90%
but they'd plateau.

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:35.350 align:middle line:90%
They would stay the same.

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:36.670 align:middle line:84%
They would get better
at first, and then they

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:37.503 align:middle line:90%
would stay the same.

00:24:37.503 --> 00:24:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that
behind all disease,

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:41.950 align:middle line:84%
there was usually some
kind of emotional crisis,

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:43.698 align:middle line:84%
there was some kind
of mental crisis,

00:24:43.698 --> 00:24:45.490 align:middle line:84%
and there was some kind
of physical crisis.

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Or a spiritual
crisis, I'm sorry.

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that is
we talked about dis-ease

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:51.520 align:middle line:90%
as being the body out of ease.

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:55.900 align:middle line:84%
When you are spiritually
disconnected or mentally not

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.120 align:middle line:84%
thinking the right
thoughts or emotionally

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:01.360 align:middle line:84%
in turmoil or anger,
it shows up physically.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:06.370 align:middle line:84%
So via hormones,
our mental natures

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:09.040 align:middle line:84%
and our emotional natures
turn into our bodies.

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And via our sense of connection
to the universe-- to me,

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.290 align:middle line:90%
spirituality is unified field.

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:17.020 align:middle line:84%
It's this idea that we're all
connected with each other.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.580 align:middle line:90%
And it's not airy fairy, George.

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Because as I'm breathing
out, you're breathing in.

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.980 align:middle line:84%
You have atoms that were in
me a moment ago now in you.

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:25.510 align:middle line:90%
There's really no disconnection.

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:26.890 align:middle line:90%
Our senses deceive us.

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And this sense of deceit
begins when we're born.

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.990 align:middle line:84%
When we come out of the
womb, we see the world

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:34.660 align:middle line:84%
as being outside of us,
and we see this sense

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.210 align:middle line:90%
that it's me against the world.

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:40.180 align:middle line:84%
Spirituality to me is this
idea that it's no longer--

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.280 align:middle line:84%
it's not me against the
world, but the universe

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.660 align:middle line:90%
is here for me.

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:46.840 align:middle line:84%
When we see the world against
us, we secrete cortisol.

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Our body goes into
the stress response.

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:50.410 align:middle line:84%
That's where the immune
system shuts down.

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:52.510 align:middle line:84%
That's where our collagen
becomes deteriorated.

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:53.980 align:middle line:90%
That's when we don't heal.

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:55.555 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately,
that's where we die.

00:25:55.555 --> 00:25:57.430 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the
things that cortisol does

00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:59.013 align:middle line:84%
is it'll keep you
from falling asleep.

00:25:59.013 --> 00:26:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Have you noticed how many
people have insomnia?

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Do you know how many
people have sleep problems?

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.160 align:middle line:90%
Especially as they get older.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's huge.

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:05.540 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: It's huge.

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's a classic
manifestation of a body that's

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:10.490 align:middle line:84%
spiritually
disconnected, mentally

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:13.310 align:middle line:84%
and emotionally
incorrect in the sense

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:14.810 align:middle line:90%
that we don't feel connected.

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:15.980 align:middle line:90%
We live in fear.

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:19.670 align:middle line:84%
We live in the sympathetic
nervous system, this fight

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:22.790 align:middle line:84%
or flight nervous system versus
the parasympathetic nervous

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:24.830 align:middle line:84%
system, which is the
relaxation, rest,

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.450 align:middle line:90%
and digest nervous system.

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've seen
so many studies, Ben,

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:32.210 align:middle line:84%
that has to do with stress
and how it affects the body.

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:34.410 align:middle line:84%
It's absolutely
staggering, isn't it?

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:35.210 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yeah.

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:37.310 align:middle line:84%
It's because this whole
cortisol connection.

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:40.317 align:middle line:84%
One of the best
medications is meditation.

00:26:40.317 --> 00:26:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Right?

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.390 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Right?

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:43.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's not airy fairy.

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:45.290 align:middle line:84%
It's not kind of-- you
don't have to be a Buddhist.

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:47.060 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to sit
cross-legged on a mat.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:49.310 align:middle line:84%
It could be just something
as sitting still and watching

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:50.000 align:middle line:90%
your thoughts.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.980 align:middle line:84%
There's a guy named Herbert
Benson who wrote a book called

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:53.030 align:middle line:90%
"The Relaxation Response."

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:53.550 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard of him?

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:53.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Yeah, he was
a Harvard physician.

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:57.015 align:middle line:84%
And funny story
about Herbert Benson.

00:26:57.015 --> 00:26:58.640 align:middle line:84%
He noticed, by the
way, that meditation

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.098 align:middle line:84%
would lower your
blood pressure, it

00:27:00.098 --> 00:27:02.550 align:middle line:84%
would improve cardiovascular
markers, your immune system,

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:03.350 align:middle line:90%
brain health.

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:05.892 align:middle line:84%
You secrete more Brain-Derived
Neurotrophic Factor, BDNF.

00:27:05.892 --> 00:27:08.100 align:middle line:84%
I was just reading a study
about lowering cholesterol

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:10.760 align:middle line:84%
with meditation a
couple of days ago.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.830 align:middle line:84%
What Herbert Benson
noticed was that all

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:16.250 align:middle line:84%
of the markers of dis-ease
would improve when

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.170 align:middle line:90%
you sat still and meditated.

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:21.052 align:middle line:84%
And first, he tried to
get people to say om.

00:27:21.052 --> 00:27:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: (CHANTING) Om.

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Like that, right?

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:24.822 align:middle line:84%
But he was at Harvard,
so that didn't work.

00:27:24.822 --> 00:27:28.310 align:middle line:84%
So he had-- he says-- he
tells people to say one now.

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:30.578 align:middle line:84%
So he had everybody
going (CHANTING) one.

00:27:30.578 --> 00:27:31.430 align:middle line:90%
One.

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Like that, which is
kind of the same thing.

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:35.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the Dalai
Lama says that all the time.

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:36.050 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: One?

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:37.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's one with
this, one with that.

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:38.480 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yeah, yeah.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's the idea of
disconnection leading

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:41.810 align:middle line:90%
to disease.

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:44.450 align:middle line:90%
Unity is parasympathetic.

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:46.355 align:middle line:90%
Separation is sympathetic.

00:27:46.355 --> 00:27:49.160 align:middle line:84%
In the Bible, Jesus says, you're
either with me or against me.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.010 align:middle line:84%
To me, the parasympathetic
nervous system

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:53.540 align:middle line:90%
is your love nervous system.

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:56.370 align:middle line:84%
It's your Jesus nervous system,
your Christ nervous system.

00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:59.090 align:middle line:84%
The sympathetic nervous system
is your lie nervous system,

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:00.600 align:middle line:90%
your deceitful nervous system.

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:01.975 align:middle line:84%
It's the nervous
system that says

00:28:01.975 --> 00:28:03.530 align:middle line:90%
that the world is against you.

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:04.988 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
nervous system that

00:28:04.988 --> 00:28:07.820 align:middle line:84%
would be associated with
satanic forces, the dark forces.

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:09.770 align:middle line:84%
So to me, Jesus
was teaching about

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:11.390 align:middle line:84%
the parasympathetic
nervous system

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:13.230 align:middle line:84%
and the sympathetic
nervous system.

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And when he says, I am
the light of the world,

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:17.788 align:middle line:84%
he's talking about the
parasympathetic nervous system.

00:28:17.788 --> 00:28:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And when he says, get
thee Satan behind me,

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:22.700 align:middle line:84%
he's talking about the
sympathetic nervous system.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.328 align:middle line:84%
In "A Course in Miracles," they
say there's only two forces.

00:28:25.328 --> 00:28:27.620 align:middle line:84%
There's only two forces in
the world, the force of love

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:28.820 align:middle line:90%
and the force of evil.

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And you could neurologically
say there's only

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:32.480 align:middle line:84%
two forces in the
body, the force

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.370 align:middle line:84%
of the parasympathetic
nervous system

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:37.800 align:middle line:84%
and the force of the
sympathetic nervous system.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now when you were
talking about meditation

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:44.170 align:middle line:84%
and getting into
this mode, again,

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:48.260 align:middle line:84%
the ancients knew
this a long time ago.

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.078 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese know it
better than anybody.

00:28:50.078 --> 00:28:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Chinese
knew a lot of stuff.

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where did
they learn this from?

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:53.530 align:middle line:90%
Who taught them?

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:54.738 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: They didn't have TV.

00:28:54.738 --> 00:28:56.860 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
anybody yelling at them,

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.410 align:middle line:84%
a talking head yelling at
them about the latest news,

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:02.680 align:middle line:84%
about the latest thing that they
have to be afraid-- whatever.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.200 align:middle line:84%
So they probably spent a lot
of time in contemplation.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, it wasn't necessarily the
working people that were doing

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:12.100 align:middle line:84%
it, but there was a
whole section, a whole--

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:15.940 align:middle line:84%
a demographic group of
monks who would sit in--

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:19.000 align:middle line:84%
who would just sit in
the mountains somewhere

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.185 align:middle line:84%
and eat good food and meditate
and concentrate on god,

00:29:22.185 --> 00:29:23.560 align:middle line:84%
and concentrate
on all the things

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:24.685 align:middle line:90%
we just talked about today.

00:29:24.685 --> 00:29:26.290 align:middle line:90%
Nature, the power of nature.

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:28.040 align:middle line:84%
Look, if you're an
ancient person, George,

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.480 align:middle line:90%
what do you think of the sun?

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, it's a god.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:31.010 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Exactly.

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:31.843 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a god.

00:29:31.843 --> 00:29:32.740 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Exactly.

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.240 align:middle line:90%
You would worship the thing.

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.767 align:middle line:84%
You'd say, how is
this happening?

00:29:35.767 --> 00:29:36.850 align:middle line:90%
How is this even possible?

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:39.040 align:middle line:84%
The Sumerians, they
studied the stars.

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.410 align:middle line:84%
They knew about
Sirius, and they knew

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:43.690 align:middle line:84%
about the various
constellations.

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:46.190 align:middle line:84%
They knew about the movements
of the sun and the stars.

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They knew about
things that they're not

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:49.120 align:middle line:90%
supposed to know.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:49.810 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Well, there's some--

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:50.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who told them?

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: There's some
interesting things there

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:52.990 align:middle line:90%
about ancient Sumeria.

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:54.200 align:middle line:90%
Where did that come from?

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.560 align:middle line:84%
How did that pop out in
the world all of a sudden?

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:59.350 align:middle line:84%
You have an empire that
knew about agriculture

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:02.860 align:middle line:84%
and had hierarchies
and had royalty.

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:05.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, once again
on Gaia's "Healing Matrix,"

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Paul Austin, who's
a great researcher,

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.293 align:middle line:90%
talked about microdosing.

00:30:09.293 --> 00:30:10.960 align:middle line:10%
>>MORTER: "Healing
Matrix" is interested

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.350 align:middle line:10%
in a holistic approach,
like, all things considered.

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:16.720 align:middle line:84%
The whole human gets to
become a self-healer,

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:19.360 align:middle line:84%
gets to awaken to
their full potential.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.180 align:middle line:84%
Are there other things that
you recommend for people

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:24.205 align:middle line:84%
to help support them
when they're going

00:30:24.205 --> 00:30:25.330 align:middle line:90%
through a regime like this?

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Are there nutritional
programs that people

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.390 align:middle line:90%
should be focusing on?

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Are there other types
of daily activities

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.550 align:middle line:84%
that they should be doing
around this to stabilize

00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:35.620 align:middle line:84%
this kind of
evolutionary experience

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:36.878 align:middle line:90%
that they're going through?

00:30:36.878 --> 00:30:38.920 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL AUSTIN: So one
thing to bring up right off

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.130 align:middle line:84%
the bat is microdosing
from my perspective

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:44.590 align:middle line:84%
is really just to lead
in to a higher dose.

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:46.660 align:middle line:84%
So although there are
a number of benefits

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.390 align:middle line:84%
that can come from microdosing,
from my perspective,

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:52.720 align:middle line:84%
that true paradigm shift in
how we perceive ourselves

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.340 align:middle line:84%
and our relationship
to the world

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:56.150 align:middle line:90%
can come from higher doses.

00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:57.950 align:middle line:90%
So that's one thing to consider.

00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:00.430 align:middle line:84%
But beyond that, we're
really looking at just

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:01.750 align:middle line:90%
general mindfulness practices.

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:03.610 align:middle line:84%
So one thing we
encourage is, again,

00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:06.160 align:middle line:84%
microdosing used as
a catalyst to start

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:09.610 align:middle line:84%
a practice of meditation,
to start a practice of yoga,

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:11.320 align:middle line:84%
to start being more
mindful about what

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:12.940 align:middle line:90%
we're putting into our bodies.

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:15.580 align:middle line:84%
I won't prescribe any
sort of specific diet,

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:18.250 align:middle line:84%
but generally, eating
things that are fresh,

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:20.860 align:middle line:84%
that are unprocessed,
that come from plants

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:24.040 align:middle line:84%
and maybe some animals is
generally pretty healthy.

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really important
that people perceive

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:29.350 align:middle line:84%
microdosing, again, not as
just this drug that I'll take

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:31.750 align:middle line:84%
and that it'll fix all my
problems-- because this

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:34.090 align:middle line:84%
is sort of our context of
current health care, right?

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:37.720 align:middle line:84%
We take an antidepressant,
take an anti-anxiety pill.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.400 align:middle line:90%
The doctor just says, take this.

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.860 align:middle line:84%
It'll fix what it needs to,
and we just rely on that.

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And we give all our power away
to something outside of us.

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, microdosing
is about-- it's

00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:50.950 align:middle line:84%
about bringing that agency,
bringing that autonomy back

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:53.050 align:middle line:84%
into ourselves and
then leveraging

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:56.710 align:middle line:84%
it to be able to create
a new way of living.

00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And again, when we
look at microdosing,

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.230 align:middle line:84%
it's helping to facilitate
neuroplasticity,

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:05.110 align:middle line:84%
habit change, the same thing
that meditation and yoga do.

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:07.240 align:middle line:84%
So combining it with
those practices,

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:09.643 align:middle line:84%
people have found it
to be very effective.

00:32:09.643 --> 00:32:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what's the
purpose, Ben, of microdosing?

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:14.143 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Well, I assume he's
talking about psychedelics,

00:32:14.143 --> 00:32:17.210 align:middle line:84%
and that's when you take a very,
very, very, very tiny dose.

00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:21.620 align:middle line:84%
Not enough to put you into
a full-blown hallucinogenic,

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:23.300 align:middle line:90%
psychedelic trip, so to speak.

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:27.440 align:middle line:84%
But just enough to adjust
or skew your sense of what's

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.610 align:middle line:90%
real, just very, very slightly.

00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:30.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But why?

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Well, if you're
stuck in a rut, for example,

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:35.277 align:middle line:84%
they use microdosing
for depression.

00:32:35.277 --> 00:32:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
want to overdo it?

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:37.640 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Yeah, they
don't want to overdo it.

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:39.440 align:middle line:84%
They just want to skew
reality a little bit.

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.773 align:middle line:84%
What psychedelics do is they
skew your sense of reality.

00:32:41.773 --> 00:32:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And so a large dose
of psychedelics

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:45.423 align:middle line:84%
will make you realize that,
wait a minute, George.

00:32:45.423 --> 00:32:47.390 align:middle line:84%
This thing that we
consider to be real

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:49.310 align:middle line:90%
is a function of biochemistry.

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:51.080 align:middle line:84%
There's no real
here really, George.

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:54.380 align:middle line:84%
There is a biochemical
representation

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:56.750 align:middle line:84%
of what is out there, which
is really only the matrix.

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:57.630 align:middle line:90%
It's waves.

00:32:57.630 --> 00:32:58.430 align:middle line:90%
It's digits.

00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:59.840 align:middle line:90%
It's 0s and 1s.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And somehow we put
that all together.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.815 align:middle line:84%
And when you do
psychedelics, you

00:33:02.815 --> 00:33:07.190 align:middle line:84%
start to see the arbitrary
nature of this synthesis

00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:08.810 align:middle line:90%
of what we call to be reality.

00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Microdosing doesn't
quite do it like that,

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.978 align:middle line:84%
but it does it just enough
so that if you're in a rut,

00:33:13.978 --> 00:33:16.520 align:middle line:84%
you're depressed, or you're not
as creative as you want to be

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.340 align:middle line:84%
or you don't like your job or
you're dealing with anxiety,

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:21.980 align:middle line:84%
it can modify your sense
of reality just so,

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:23.700 align:middle line:90%
so it can sort of readjust you.

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:25.070 align:middle line:90%
That's the concept behind it.

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:28.280 align:middle line:84%
But as Paul alluded to, you want
to be nutritionally correct.

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.492 align:middle line:90%
You want to be eating right.

00:33:29.492 --> 00:33:31.700 align:middle line:84%
You want to make sure that
your body is strong enough

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:33.533 align:middle line:84%
to be handling things,
because unless you're

00:33:33.533 --> 00:33:35.030 align:middle line:84%
talking about
natural microdosing

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:38.120 align:middle line:84%
with psilocybin, if you're
microdosing with LSD,

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:42.350 align:middle line:84%
for example, or pharmaceutical
kinds of substances,

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:43.880 align:middle line:84%
you're still
dealing with a drug.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the
day, a drug is a toxin

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:47.510 align:middle line:84%
and the body has to
handle it like it

00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:48.920 align:middle line:90%
handles any kind of toxin.

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is dirty blood?

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: [LAUGHS] Dirty
blood is the cause of all--

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:56.300 align:middle line:84%
physiologic cause of
all health challenges.

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:59.600 align:middle line:84%
The circulatory system
moves in a circuit.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:00.590 align:middle line:90%
The circulatory system.

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:01.350 align:middle line:90%
It moves in a circle.

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And as it's moving
in a circle, it's

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:04.610 align:middle line:90%
generating an electrical charge.

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:06.230 align:middle line:84%
This electrical
charge is referred to

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:07.520 align:middle line:90%
as a zeta potential.

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And this electrical charge
is what runs our body.

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.495 align:middle line:90%
We are a hemodynamic system.

00:34:11.495 --> 00:34:12.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The body electric.

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: The body electric.

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:14.650 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:19.610 align:middle line:84%
This hemodynamic movement
of fluid in a circle

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:20.900 align:middle line:90%
generates electrical charges.

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:22.940 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but
oxygen is delivered

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:26.150 align:middle line:84%
to the cells via this
circulatory system,

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:29.659 align:middle line:84%
and toxins are removed through
the circulatory system,

00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:32.030 align:middle line:84%
and the nutrients
are delivered through

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:33.380 align:middle line:90%
this circulatory system.

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:36.949 align:middle line:84%
As we age and as our body
starts to break down,

00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:39.800 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that
happens is substances

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.420 align:middle line:84%
start to leak through the
intestine into the bloodstream.

00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:44.250 align:middle line:84%
This is called
leaky gut syndrome.

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:45.058 align:middle line:90%
And it's not only--

00:34:45.058 --> 00:34:46.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's not good.

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:47.058 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: It's very bad.

00:34:47.058 --> 00:34:50.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not only a sign
of aging, but it's also

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:53.150 align:middle line:84%
accelerated by
foods that we eat,

00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:56.600 align:middle line:84%
processed foods that we eat,
especially gluten, for example,

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:58.790 align:middle line:90%
and fried fats.

00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:02.810 align:middle line:84%
In fact, our health
challenges as a culture,

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:05.270 align:middle line:84%
our chronic disease
crisis, started

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:07.610 align:middle line:84%
to really get going
when we figured out how

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:12.050 align:middle line:84%
to, number one, fry fatty foods
and create artificial fats,

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:17.480 align:middle line:84%
and when our diets started to
contain large concentrations

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.790 align:middle line:90%
of gluten and other carbohy--

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:21.893 align:middle line:84%
other-- what they call
lectins, components--

00:35:21.893 --> 00:35:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We are what we eat.

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:24.200 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: We are what we eat.

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.825 align:middle line:84%
Now, back to your
dirty blood question,

00:35:25.825 --> 00:35:29.030 align:middle line:84%
is the combination of these bad
foods, these processed foods,

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:33.230 align:middle line:84%
fried fats, as well as large
amounts of these lectins

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:35.930 align:middle line:84%
that come from grains
and other substances,

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:38.090 align:middle line:84%
they start to
cause deterioration

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:39.530 align:middle line:90%
at the level of the intestine.

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Once the intestine
starts to deteriorate,

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:44.150 align:middle line:90%
toxins can leak into the blood.

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:45.560 align:middle line:90%
Under ordinary circumstances--

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Through the intestine?

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:47.100 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Through the intestine.

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:48.890 align:middle line:84%
This is called
leaky gut syndrome

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:50.480 align:middle line:84%
or intestinal
permeability syndrome.

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.400 align:middle line:84%
Once those substances
that should not

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.400 align:middle line:84%
be in the bloodstream get into
the blood, an immune system,

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:59.900 align:middle line:84%
a defensive response is
mounted inside the bloodstream,

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:03.140 align:middle line:84%
creating these clogs
and these clots, these--

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:03.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ugh.

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:05.570 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: --fibrotic
balls-- exactly.

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:06.950 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And that impairs the
movement of the circulation,

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:14.540 align:middle line:84%
of the circulatory system,
lowering the zeta potential,

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:18.290 align:middle line:84%
the electrical charge, and
impairing the blood's ability

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:21.890 align:middle line:84%
to deliver nutrients and
oxygen and detoxify the cells.

00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:23.608 align:middle line:90%
That's what I call dirty blood.

00:36:23.608 --> 00:36:24.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's not good.

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:25.450 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Very bad.

00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that like
clogged oil in your car?

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Exactly.

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:30.020 align:middle line:90%
Like clogged oil in your car.

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:31.670 align:middle line:90%
That's a great metaphor.

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:33.830 align:middle line:84%
It's like clogged
oil in your car.

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:35.330 align:middle line:90%
And guess what, George?

00:36:35.330 --> 00:36:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Every single chronic,
long-term, degenerative disease

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:41.600 align:middle line:84%
can be backtracked
to dirty blood.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.178 align:middle line:84%
That is 80% of our
health care challenges.

00:36:44.178 --> 00:36:45.470 align:middle line:90%
And you know what else, George?

00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:47.107 align:middle line:84%
Dirty blood is simple
to take care of.

00:36:47.107 --> 00:36:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do you filter that?

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: How do you
filter the blood?

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's ways that you
can filter it with what's

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:52.460 align:middle line:90%
called chelation therapy.

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:53.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you've ever heard--

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:54.095 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've
heard of chelation.

00:36:54.095 --> 00:36:55.345 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: It's wonderful stuff.

00:36:55.345 --> 00:36:57.680 align:middle line:84%
That's where they actually
inject a chelating agent.

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.270 align:middle line:84%
A chelating agent's
like a magnet

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:00.510 align:middle line:90%
that magnetically pulls out--

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:01.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: EDTA.

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:02.110 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: EDTA.

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:02.990 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:04.070 align:middle line:90%
And you can take it orally.

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:04.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I surprised you.

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:05.690 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: That's pretty good.

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:07.357 align:middle line:84%
Now you know, I'm not
surprised anymore,

00:37:07.357 --> 00:37:08.890 align:middle line:90%
because you know some stuff.

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:10.490 align:middle line:90%
Vitamin C is a chelating agent.

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:11.862 align:middle line:90%
Selenium is a chelating agent.

00:37:11.862 --> 00:37:12.820 align:middle line:90%
Sulfur is a chelating--

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:13.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Zinc?

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Zinc isn't
quite a chelating agent.

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:16.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not for that.

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:17.530 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Zinc's amazing, though.

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:20.140 align:middle line:84%
N-acetylcysteine is
a chelating agent.

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And then also, one of the best
ways to clean the blood out

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:26.468 align:middle line:84%
is to make sure that you're
not putting the toxins

00:37:26.468 --> 00:37:27.760 align:middle line:90%
in the body in the first place.

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.347 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
the herb burdock?

00:37:29.347 --> 00:37:30.430 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Burdock is great.

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:32.440 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful liver stimulant.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:34.543 align:middle line:84%
Wonderful, wonderful
detoxifying substance.

00:37:34.543 --> 00:37:36.460 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't quite clean
the blood out directly,

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:38.020 align:middle line:84%
but it helps the
liver, and the liver

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:40.823 align:middle line:84%
is one of the main organs
for cleaning the blood.

00:37:40.823 --> 00:37:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, it's amazing.

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Now once you do that, do
you start feeling better?

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:45.320 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yes.

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:46.490 align:middle line:90%
Almost immediately.

00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:48.932 align:middle line:84%
Chelation therapy one
session of chelation therapy,

00:37:48.932 --> 00:37:50.390 align:middle line:84%
and you'll feel
better immediately.

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:51.290 align:middle line:90%
Fasting.

00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:52.600 align:middle line:90%
I talk a lot about fasting.

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:54.350 align:middle line:84%
One of the major reasons
for the benefit--

00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:56.600 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of reasons,
but one of the major reasons

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.340 align:middle line:84%
is you stop the entrance of
toxins into the bloodstream.

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is one
of the reasons why

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:04.220 align:middle line:84%
all autoimmune and chronic
degenerative diseases

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:06.480 align:middle line:84%
begin to improve
when people fast.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, autoimmunity
is a major consequence

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:10.490 align:middle line:90%
of dirty blood.

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Our friend Dr. Joe Dispenza
on one of the Gaia programs

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:17.600 align:middle line:84%
called "Rewired" talked
about the ability of the mind

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.910 align:middle line:90%
to affect the physical body.

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE DISPENZA: In
depression studies

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:25.190 align:middle line:84%
where there is a placebo that's
being tested against the drug,

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:29.030 align:middle line:84%
the research shows that
four out of five people

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:32.660 align:middle line:84%
respond as well to
the placebo as they

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:35.420 align:middle line:90%
do to the drug for depression.

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:37.610 align:middle line:10%
They've done brain
scans on people

00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:41.270 align:middle line:10%
before they're given the
placebo or given the drug.

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:42.590 align:middle line:90%
They meet with the doctors.

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:44.057 align:middle line:90%
They take the pill.

00:38:44.057 --> 00:38:45.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, the person doesn't
know whether they're

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:49.580 align:middle line:84%
getting the real substance or
they're getting the placebo.

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And after a period
of time, the person

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:55.250 align:middle line:84%
notices that they
start to feel better.

00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:59.460 align:middle line:10%
When you look at their brain
scans after the end of a study,

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:02.330 align:middle line:10%
you see a significant
change in the way

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:03.890 align:middle line:10%
their brain is functioning.

00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:07.730 align:middle line:84%
That means that they are
making their own pharmacy

00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:10.880 align:middle line:84%
of antidepressants
by thought alone.

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.430 align:middle line:84%
The important point that
I want you to remember

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:16.910 align:middle line:84%
is that every single day
that person took that pill,

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:21.380 align:middle line:84%
it was a reminder of moving
into a new state of being.

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:23.210 align:middle line:90%
Every day they took the pill.

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:25.400 align:middle line:84%
They remembered what the
pill could do for them.

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:26.740 align:middle line:90%
They start to get optimistic.

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:28.490 align:middle line:84%
They start to look
forward to the outcome.

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:29.840 align:middle line:90%
They start to get inspired.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:33.170 align:middle line:84%
They start to feel grateful,
combining that clear intention

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:36.230 align:middle line:84%
with an elevated emotion,
changing their state of being.

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And they do that for
eight weeks in the study.

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:45.110 align:middle line:84%
Now the question is, do
you need the sugar pill,

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:47.960 align:middle line:84%
the saline injection,
or some false surgery

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.030 align:middle line:84%
to move into a new
state of being?

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:52.820 align:middle line:84%
Do you need some
external substance

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:55.700 align:middle line:84%
to convince you to move
into a new state of being?

00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Or can you move into a new state
of being just by thought alone?

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And the answer, of course,
is in the meditative process.

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:06.860 align:middle line:84%
We teach people how to change
their state of being when they

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:10.310 align:middle line:84%
get beyond their analytical mind
where they can begin to program

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:12.470 align:middle line:84%
their autonomic
nervous system to make

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:15.465 align:middle line:90%
their own pharmacy of chemicals.

00:40:15.465 --> 00:40:16.340 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: I love that.

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You just
talked about meditation.

00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:18.777 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: I love how.

00:40:18.777 --> 00:40:19.860 align:middle line:90%
I love everything he said.

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:22.550 align:middle line:84%
You know, when they're
testing drugs like a new drug

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:25.370 align:middle line:84%
and they do a test, they
have to filter out something

00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:27.240 align:middle line:90%
called the placebo effect.

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:28.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:30.590 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: What the heck is
the placebo effect, George?

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:31.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's tricking the mind.

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: It's mind over matter.

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's all it is.

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: It's strictly--
instead of filtering it out,

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:38.010 align:middle line:84%
how about if we take
advantage of it?

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:39.830 align:middle line:84%
How about if we
filter out the drugs

00:40:39.830 --> 00:40:41.720 align:middle line:84%
and start using
the placebo effect?

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Because indeed, not only is
the placebo making you better,

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:47.780 align:middle line:84%
the placebo or the nocebo
is making you sick.

00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:51.150 align:middle line:84%
You're tricking the mind to
believe it's getting a drug

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:51.950 align:middle line:90%
and it's not.

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:53.000 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Exactly right.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.050 align:middle line:90%
How does that even work?

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:56.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously, our mind
is controlling everything.

00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:59.840 align:middle line:84%
George, it's hidden
in plain sight.

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:02.690 align:middle line:84%
The ability, the
magical ability that we

00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:06.050 align:middle line:84%
have to control our realities
and to control our bodies

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:09.410 align:middle line:84%
is so obvious on every level
and has been scientifically

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:13.595 align:middle line:84%
verified so many times
that it staggers the mind

00:41:13.595 --> 00:41:17.180 align:middle line:84%
to think about how we are not
leveraging it and employing it

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:20.390 align:middle line:84%
at every split second
that we're awake.

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:22.753 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How often should
we meditate every day?

00:41:22.753 --> 00:41:23.670 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't take much--

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:24.410 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: You know how often?

00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:25.827 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you
something, George.

00:41:25.827 --> 00:41:27.420 align:middle line:84%
They call it a
meditative practice.

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:28.220 align:middle line:90%
You know why?

00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:31.340 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're meditating,
you're practicing for life.

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:33.560 align:middle line:84%
You want to meditate
in your life.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:36.200 align:middle line:84%
You want your every day,
every second of the day

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.610 align:middle line:90%
to be a meditative practice.

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And by that I mean
being aware of yourself.

00:41:40.570 --> 00:41:42.590 align:middle line:84%
That's what meditation
really is about.

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:44.630 align:middle line:90%
It's being aware that you exist.

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:46.340 align:middle line:84%
It's being aware
that you're thinking.

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:48.650 align:middle line:84%
It's being aware of
how you move your body.

00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And they call it
mindfulness sometimes.

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Meditation's a type
of mindfulness.

00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:55.610 align:middle line:84%
Do you know Johns Hopkins
has a curricula that

00:41:55.610 --> 00:41:57.200 align:middle line:90%
focuses on mindfulness?

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.610 align:middle line:90%
The University-- UCLA Medical--

00:41:58.610 --> 00:41:59.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's about time.

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yes.

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:02.570 align:middle line:84%
UCLA Medical School,
Yale, Harvard,

00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:05.660 align:middle line:84%
they're all using mindfulness
as a way to control the body.

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:07.800 align:middle line:84%
When you start to pay
attention to the body, guess

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:08.600 align:middle line:90%
what happens?

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.517 align:middle line:84%
Just like when you pay
attention to your wife,

00:42:10.517 --> 00:42:12.642 align:middle line:84%
or just like when you pay
attention to your friend,

00:42:12.642 --> 00:42:14.570 align:middle line:84%
or just like when you
pay attention to a dog,

00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:16.820 align:middle line:84%
or just like when you pay
attention to anything,

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:21.650 align:middle line:84%
you begin to imbue that thing
with energy and with love

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:24.260 align:middle line:84%
and with a sort
of connection that

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:27.440 align:middle line:84%
allows you to take advantage
of all of the gifts

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:30.650 align:middle line:84%
that that dog, or your wife,
or your friend, or your body

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:31.550 align:middle line:90%
have to offer.

00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:33.680 align:middle line:84%
Everything just wants
to be appreciated,

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:35.330 align:middle line:90%
and that's what mindfulness is.

00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's what meditation is,
appreciating you, appreciating

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:41.030 align:middle line:84%
your existence, and
appreciating your life,

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:44.090 align:middle line:84%
and appreciating everything that
it takes to run the body, which

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:46.070 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely awe-inspiring.

00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've been involved
with criticalhealthnews.com

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:49.970 align:middle line:90%
for several years right now.

00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:53.450 align:middle line:84%
You have helped countless,
thousands and thousands

00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:57.810 align:middle line:84%
of people you, and Doc Wallach,
since you've been doing this.

00:42:57.810 --> 00:43:01.010 align:middle line:84%
What would be for you one of
the most satisfying things

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:02.015 align:middle line:90%
that you've come across?

00:43:02.015 --> 00:43:03.590 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Oh, every day.

00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:06.440 align:middle line:84%
Just-- matter of fact, this
week I talked to a gal.

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:08.330 align:middle line:84%
When she was young,
she had problems

00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:10.610 align:middle line:84%
with her menstrual cycle,
so they took out her organs

00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:11.443 align:middle line:90%
at the age of 18.

00:43:11.443 --> 00:43:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They took
out her organs?

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Her female
organs, I should say.

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:16.580 align:middle line:84%
She had a hysterectomy, a
full-blown hysterectomy.

00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:19.460 align:middle line:84%
After that, she started
to have digestive issues.

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:22.160 align:middle line:84%
They had to take
out her gallbladder.

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.410 align:middle line:84%
Now they want to do a
liver transplant on her.

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:24.830 align:middle line:90%
Said to her--

00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:25.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She's falling apart.

00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: She's falling apart
because of what they did.

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:30.560 align:middle line:84%
So I said to her, all of this
is coming down to something

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:32.180 align:middle line:84%
that nobody ever
told you you had.

00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:34.190 align:middle line:84%
I asked her, did you
have any issues with food

00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:35.232 align:middle line:90%
when you were growing up?

00:43:35.232 --> 00:43:36.750 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes, I bloated all the time.

00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:37.550 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:39.800 align:middle line:84%
I was colicky when I was a
baby, et cetera, et cetera.

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:41.870 align:middle line:84%
I said, start
working on your diet.

00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:43.520 align:middle line:90%
Start working on your food.

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Sent her out some
Beyond Tangy Tangerine.

00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:46.713 align:middle line:90%
We started talking.

00:43:46.713 --> 00:43:48.380 align:middle line:10%
She just called me,
as a matter of fact,

00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:49.590 align:middle line:10%
before I got on the show today.

00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:51.080 align:middle line:10%
She got her Beyond
Tangy Tangerine.

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:52.100 align:middle line:10%
She was so excited.

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:54.950 align:middle line:10%
Now, she hasn't appreciated
the physical benefits

00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:56.030 align:middle line:10%
of what I did for her.

00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She will.

00:43:56.830 --> 00:43:59.030 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: But she
appreciated the connection,

00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:00.720 align:middle line:90%
the sense that somebody cared.

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And so yes, while it's true
that I love supplements,

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:05.300 align:middle line:84%
I love supplementing--
putting people

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:08.360 align:middle line:84%
on supplement programs, dietary
strategies, all of that.

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:11.930 align:middle line:84%
But really, this gives me an
opportunity to love people,

00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:13.550 align:middle line:90%
to help people.

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:14.840 align:middle line:10%
And there's no better--

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:16.550 align:middle line:10%
there's no better reward for me.

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:17.900 align:middle line:10%
I get the benefits from it.

00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:19.700 align:middle line:84%
George, when you
love somebody, guess

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:21.710 align:middle line:84%
who is getting the
energy of the love?

00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:22.820 align:middle line:90%
You are.

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:26.180 align:middle line:84%
Your serotonin's going-- no,
your biochemistry changes.

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:28.237 align:middle line:84%
When you hate
somebody, your bio--

00:44:28.237 --> 00:44:29.570 align:middle line:90%
you're the one with a bad heart.

00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:31.612 align:middle line:84%
You're the one that gets
the high blood pressure.

00:44:31.612 --> 00:44:33.680 align:middle line:84%
You're the one whose immune
system is suppressed.

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:36.470 align:middle line:84%
So when we connect with
people, when we love people,

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:38.690 align:middle line:90%
it's us that benefits.

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:40.160 align:middle line:84%
Not only is there
really nobody out

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:42.800 align:middle line:84%
there, it's all us anyway
in terms of unified field,

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.600 align:middle line:84%
but our biochemistry
is connected

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:45.937 align:middle line:90%
to how we relate to the world.

00:44:45.937 --> 00:44:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

>>FUCHS: Thank you so much.

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Nothing thrills me
more than when I'm at an event

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.870 align:middle line:10%
and somebody comes
up to me and says,

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:59.030 align:middle line:10%
pharmacist Ben Fuchs or Doc
Wallach have saved my life.

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:00.800 align:middle line:84%
It's the world's
greatest feeling.

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:03.410 align:middle line:84%
As Ben would say, it
makes you feel better.

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:06.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
