>>KELLY SULLIVAN WALDEN: Never
thought of it as something

00:00:12.103 --> 00:00:13.770 align:middle line:84%
I would ever do
for a career, but I

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.079 align:middle line:84%
found that when people
started to tell me dreams,

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.020 align:middle line:84%
I would all of the sudden see
a whole world of information,

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.173 align:middle line:84%
kind of like how some
people read Tarot cards.

00:00:21.173 --> 00:00:23.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: I want you
to interpret this for us.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.140 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Oh, good.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.032 align:middle line:84%
So can I tell you
about my five steps

00:00:26.032 --> 00:00:27.240 align:middle line:90%
to being an awakened dreamer?

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.280 align:middle line:90%
Because it relates to this.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.915 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: I've interviewed
some people myself

00:00:30.915 --> 00:00:33.890 align:middle line:84%
that have worked kind of the
cyber warfare kind of thing.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:34.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Remote viewers.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.750 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: And it's legit.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.280 align:middle line:84%
For dream-a-festing, I
have this 3D methodology.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.060 align:middle line:84%
The first D is-- and this might
be a little bit out there,

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.877 align:middle line:90%
but I think you can handle it.

00:00:46.877 --> 00:00:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've developed
some oracle cards.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: I have.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.797 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's do
a little sample.

00:00:50.797 --> 00:00:51.840 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Let's do it.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.960 align:middle line:84%
Our dreams are helping us to
work through the challenges

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.775 align:middle line:84%
that we have so we can really
start to explore beyond belief.

Kelly, welcome back
to the program.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: It is such
a pleasure and a dream

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.930 align:middle line:90%
to be back with you.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: By the way,
what an astounding outfit

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.640 align:middle line:90%
you are wearing.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Thank you.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.440 align:middle line:90%
We're kind of color coordinated.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Look how great that is.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.563 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Thank you.

00:01:43.563 --> 00:01:44.521 align:middle line:90%
I'm dressed up for you.

00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:45.938 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Where did
that come from?

00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:47.530 align:middle line:10%
>>WALDEN: From my
dear friend, Gypsy.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.997 align:middle line:10%
She gave me this right before
she passed a few months ago.

00:01:49.997 --> 00:01:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.130 align:middle line:90%
You will remember her forever.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.930 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: I do.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:53.260 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm wearing her.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.910 align:middle line:90%
Is that not creepy?

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nice job, Gypsy.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Thank you, Gypsy.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.045 align:middle line:90%
Oh, thank you for asking.

00:01:59.045 --> 00:02:01.723 align:middle line:84%
I feel like we're just
bringing her into this dream

00:02:01.723 --> 00:02:02.890 align:middle line:90%
that we're having right now.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Speaking of dreams--

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.630 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Oh, yeah.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --how did we
get involved in dreams?

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.199 align:middle line:90%
What did you do here?

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: How did I
get involved in dreams?

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.420 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.110 align:middle line:10%
I've been paying close
attention to dreams

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.890 align:middle line:10%
since I was a very
little girl, starting

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:17.890 align:middle line:10%
at about five years old.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.170 align:middle line:84%
I shared a bedroom with my
younger sister, Shannon.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And we used to have tandem
dreaming experiences

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.120 align:middle line:84%
where we would be in a
similar dreamscape at night.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And in the morning when
we'd talk about our dreams,

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.560 align:middle line:84%
we would relate what
happened and we would realize

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.820 align:middle line:90%
that we had both been there.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.865 align:middle line:84%
And so we didn't realize
it was a phenomenon.

00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:38.740 align:middle line:84%
It was just this fun
thing that we got to do.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.140 align:middle line:84%
But that got me paying
attention to dreams,

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.210 align:middle line:84%
got me caring about
dreams, interested.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.650 align:middle line:84%
It was a way to stay
entertained, frankly,

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.870 align:middle line:90%
more than anything.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.600 align:middle line:84%
But then as I grew
up and my dreams

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.440 align:middle line:84%
were kind of like an ability
to be psychic about things

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.640 align:middle line:90%
that were happening.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.790 align:middle line:84%
My dreams would give me
information about relationships

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.097 align:middle line:84%
and just being able to
help me navigate my life.

00:03:01.097 --> 00:03:02.680 align:middle line:84%
But I never thought
of it as something

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.210 align:middle line:90%
I would ever do for a career.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.310 align:middle line:84%
I did want to be in
the helping profession.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.230 align:middle line:90%
I thought I'd be a therapist.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.870 align:middle line:84%
But I found that when people
started to tell me dreams,

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.290 align:middle line:84%
I would all of a sudden see
a whole world of information,

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.450 align:middle line:84%
kind of like how some
people read Tarot cards.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:17.800 align:middle line:90%
They see information.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.170 align:middle line:90%
Dreams are my Tarot cards.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.960 align:middle line:84%
When I became a certified
clinical hypnotherapist

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.450 align:middle line:84%
over 20 years ago,
I really started

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.310 align:middle line:84%
to pay attention to the power
of the subconscious mind.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And when I heard that
the subconscious mind,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.940 align:middle line:84%
according to the American
Hypnosis Association,

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.710 align:middle line:90%
is 88% of our mind's power--

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.080 align:middle line:90%
that's our dreaming mind--

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.590 align:middle line:84%
versus our logical,
conscious mind is only 12%.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.373 align:middle line:90%
What a difference.

00:03:42.373 --> 00:03:43.540 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: It got me really--

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.550 align:middle line:90%
it kicked in my passion.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do some people
not remember their dreams?

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: Dreams are
not easy to remember.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.220 align:middle line:84%
Even people like me who
are frequent flyers,

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.930 align:middle line:90%
I tend to remember dreams often.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.040 align:middle line:84%
If I don't go out of my way to
remember a dream, it will slip.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.290 align:middle line:90%
So we have to be--

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.620 align:middle line:90%
we have to look for them.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.310 align:middle line:84%
We have to have a reason
why we're going after them.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.070 align:middle line:84%
Just like developing
any psychic ability.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.050 align:middle line:84%
Often, it doesn't
just land in our lap.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.200 align:middle line:84%
For some strange-- some people,
it just lands in their lap.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.723 align:middle line:84%
But for most of us, we have
to put a little effort in.

00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:18.640 align:middle line:84%
But that little bit of
effort, even if we just

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.740 align:middle line:84%
spend five minutes
in the morning

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.010 align:middle line:84%
before we get up and check
the news, check our emails,

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.350 align:middle line:84%
if we just spend five minutes
first checking our dreams,

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.560 align:middle line:84%
anybody can start
to remember dreams.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When I
remember a dream, Kelly,

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.420 align:middle line:90%
I remember one dream.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.150 align:middle line:84%
How many dreams do
we dream a night?

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: Well, it's anywhere
between three to nine

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:41.290 align:middle line:90%
big dreams.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why can't I
remember all of them?

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: Even people that
have great dream recall

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.230 align:middle line:84%
usually don't
remember all dreams.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.450 align:middle line:84%
It's a rare phenomenon
when somebody can remember.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.302 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I really only
remember one dream per night.

00:04:52.302 --> 00:04:54.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: But you
remember one per night.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.225 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:04:55.225 --> 00:04:56.030 align:middle line:90%
That puts you--

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, not that I
remember a dream every night,

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.930 align:middle line:84%
but I only remember
one when I do remember.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: Because you're
probably remembering the one

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.550 align:middle line:84%
that has the most
vivid detail or it's

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.140 align:middle line:90%
the most emotionally charged.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.890 align:middle line:84%
That's why so many people
say that they only remember

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.120 align:middle line:90%
nightmares or bad dreams.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's not because they're
only having nightmares,

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.920 align:middle line:84%
but it's because those
are the most easy to

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.080 align:middle line:84%
catch, because they're
the most visceral.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.030 align:middle line:90%
They're hard to forget.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's the vivid,
colored ones and the ones

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.580 align:middle line:84%
that are emotional that tend
to be the ones easier to catch.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Psychologist
Doris Cohen

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.950 align:middle line:84%
was on "Open Minds,"
talking about dreams

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.740 align:middle line:84%
and how to decipher
them, much like you do.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.610 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Ooh.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.193 align:middle line:10%
>>DORIS COHEN: The
language of dreams,

00:05:38.193 --> 00:05:40.150 align:middle line:10%
it's like learning
a new language.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.900 align:middle line:10%
I speak four languages,
and the language of dreams

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.760 align:middle line:10%
is yet another one.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.020 align:middle line:10%
Well, 95% of the population
don't know that language, which

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.220 align:middle line:10%
is the language of symbols.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.620 align:middle line:10%
It's the language
of the unconscious.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.750 align:middle line:10%
So when you're dreaming about
the dream I was telling you--

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.900 align:middle line:10%
I dreamt my father was in
this car accident and died--

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.470 align:middle line:10%
what does my father represent
in my life symbolically?

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.420 align:middle line:10%
That's the language of symbols,
of the unconscious, you see?

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.390 align:middle line:10%
And if he dies--

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.940 align:middle line:10%
and by the way, the
dreamer is always

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.590 align:middle line:10%
dreaming about the dreamer.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.400 align:middle line:10%
So Regina is always dreaming
about Regina, not about

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.300 align:middle line:10%
her producers, her director,
her mother, her father, sweetie,

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.640 align:middle line:10%
her beloved.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.150 align:middle line:10%
Whomever appears in your
dreams is really whatever

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.760 align:middle line:10%
they represent in your life.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.110 align:middle line:10%
You're not dreaming about them.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.420 align:middle line:10%
You're dreaming about Regina.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.480 align:middle line:10%
So if I dream my father was
in that car accident and died,

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.790 align:middle line:10%
I'm dreaming about Doris.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.210 align:middle line:10%
I'm not dreaming about
my father, you see.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.770 align:middle line:10%
And death is only an ending.

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.800 align:middle line:10%
It's not necessarily
physical death.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.010 align:middle line:10%
So perchance maybe the
message from my unconscious

00:06:55.010 --> 00:07:00.560 align:middle line:10%
is that the impact that
my father had in my life

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.050 align:middle line:10%
may be coming to an end.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.130 align:middle line:10%
That's what death is.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:05.600 align:middle line:10%
It's the end of the life force.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.400 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.608 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Yes, I do.

00:07:07.608 --> 00:07:09.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you agree with that?

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.180 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Mostly, yes.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I have my doubts.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:13.550 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: OK.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:14.480 align:middle line:90%
What are your doubts?

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I think if you
dream about someone dying,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.510 align:middle line:90%
it could be precognitive.

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it's about me.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.410 align:middle line:90%
I think it's about them.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.465 align:middle line:84%
So I would not agree
with her on that.

00:07:26.465 --> 00:07:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: I agree that
we should look at dreams

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.260 align:middle line:84%
from a few different
perspectives,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.600 align:middle line:84%
because I think sometimes
the dreams are literal.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.150 align:middle line:90%
They are about what we see.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.022 align:middle line:84%
That's played out so
many times in my life,

00:07:37.022 --> 00:07:38.480 align:middle line:84%
and I know so many
people that have

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.390 align:middle line:84%
dreamt very strange
happenings, and then

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.620 align:middle line:90%
those things come true.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they do
happen for other people.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.300 align:middle line:84%
But until that
happens I always say,

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.790 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't hurt to
look at every dream

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:51.890 align:middle line:90%
as if it were just for you.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:55.142 align:middle line:84%
I like that perspective, because
I feel like in the meantime,

00:07:55.142 --> 00:07:56.600 align:middle line:84%
we can do something
with that dream

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.220 align:middle line:90%
and we can at least explore it.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.520 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't click, like if
it just feels like no, no, no,

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.260 align:middle line:84%
this dream, I'm
dreaming about George,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.570 align:middle line:84%
this is all about George,
this is not for me,

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:08.840 align:middle line:84%
then if that's my true feeling,
then it probably is so.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.600 align:middle line:84%
But if I dream about George
Noory, then I have to say,

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.510 align:middle line:84%
well, I'm exploring
my inner George,

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:18.230 align:middle line:84%
the inner masculine aspect of
me, the inner authority figure.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:22.130 align:middle line:84%
It's like I break everybody in
the dream down to adjectives.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:23.420 align:middle line:90%
Three adjectives.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.970 align:middle line:84%
What does that person
represent to me?

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.660 align:middle line:90%
How do they feel to me?

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And then, what part of
myself am I grappling with?

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.882 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are dreams
wake-up calls, Kelly?

00:08:33.882 --> 00:08:35.090 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: I believe they are.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.640 align:middle line:84%
I believe more often
than not, they are.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:43.100 align:middle line:84%
From the perspective that with
our logical mind, like I said

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.500 align:middle line:84%
before, from the American
Hypnosis Association,

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.190 align:middle line:84%
we're only using 12-- right
now, in our waking dream,

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.140 align:middle line:84%
we're only using 12%
of our mind's power.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.660 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like putting your
hands in front of your eyes,

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.030 align:middle line:90%
and this is what you see.

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:57.800 align:middle line:90%
This is legit, these blinders.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.230 align:middle line:90%
Inside this frame, this is true.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:01.400 align:middle line:90%
This is real.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.430 align:middle line:84%
But at night when we
go to sleep and dream,

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:05.990 align:middle line:90%
those blinders fall away.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, there's
all these other things

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.240 align:middle line:90%
that had been there all along.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.870 align:middle line:84%
They didn't just appear,
but we have access.

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:15.920 align:middle line:90%
It's the access.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.650 align:middle line:90%
It's the thin wall syndrome.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:21.500 align:middle line:84%
The walls go down,
and all of a sudden

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:25.700 align:middle line:84%
we are privy to wisdom,
information, guidance

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.228 align:middle line:84%
that was there
knocking on the door,

00:09:27.228 --> 00:09:29.270 align:middle line:84%
but we just couldn't hear
it in our waking state.

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:31.395 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are many
kinds of dreams, of course.

00:09:31.395 --> 00:09:35.420 align:middle line:84%
Precognitive, lucid
dreaming, all kinds

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.490 align:middle line:90%
that we have to dabble with.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:38.960 align:middle line:90%
Nightmares.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.790 align:middle line:84%
What creates so many
different dreams?

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:42.590 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Whew.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, I love the saying
in "A Course in Miracles."

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:48.980 align:middle line:84%
They say that every human
has their own personalized

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.420 align:middle line:90%
curriculum for life.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.940 align:middle line:84%
So I think our dreams are giving
us our personal curriculum

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:54.740 align:middle line:90%
for life.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.240 align:middle line:90%
They're helping us to work out.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.500 align:middle line:84%
Often our dreams are helping us
to work through the challenges

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:05.060 align:middle line:84%
that we have so that we can get
to the place where we're free,

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.090 align:middle line:84%
we're unburdened and
unshackled enough

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:11.420 align:middle line:84%
so we can really
start to explore

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:16.520 align:middle line:84%
beyond belief, beyond what we
already know what's common.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so I think that there's
two functions of dreams,

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:22.790 align:middle line:84%
to help us just do our dirty
laundry so that we can awaken

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:26.390 align:middle line:84%
in the morning and be decent
humans and go about our day

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:28.880 align:middle line:90%
and not get arrested.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:29.960 align:middle line:90%
That's stage one.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Most of us never
get past stage one.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.810 align:middle line:84%
But if we can do our work,
then we get to the place

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.940 align:middle line:84%
where we can enter
stage two of dreaming,

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and this is where
we get to explore

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.650 align:middle line:84%
beyond the edges of what's
possible for being a human.

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Should we
believe our dreams?

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:51.150 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: I think we
should believe them--

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.200 align:middle line:90%
I like that question--

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.390 align:middle line:84%
I think we should believe
them, but look at them

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:55.680 align:middle line:90%
through the symbolic lens.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.560 align:middle line:84%
This is what I do agree with
that the woman on the screen

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:01.440 align:middle line:84%
was sharing about earlier,
that our dreams I believe

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.960 align:middle line:84%
do speak in the
language of symbol.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.280 align:middle line:90%
It's our first language.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.450 align:middle line:90%
Everyone speaks it.

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:09.990 align:middle line:84%
We speak in symbols all
day long, but we forget,

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:12.270 align:middle line:84%
our dreams are
speaking symbolically.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:16.650 align:middle line:84%
So if a door closes and a window
opens in a dream, that means,

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:18.810 align:middle line:84%
well, maybe the
obvious opportunity

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:20.520 align:middle line:84%
that we were
pursuing is closing,

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.770 align:middle line:84%
but something else
is opening up.

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Or if pigs are
flying in our dreams,

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.750 align:middle line:90%
it's like something is possible.

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or we're flying.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: We're
flying in our dreams.

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:30.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:31.980 align:middle line:90%
Then we're liberated.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.050 align:middle line:90%
We're above the noise.

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:35.160 align:middle line:90%
We're above the fray.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.885 align:middle line:84%
We're exploring
our higher nature.

00:11:37.885 --> 00:11:39.510 align:middle line:84%
So we have to just
look at the wordplay

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:42.420 align:middle line:84%
that we already always speak
anyway and just apply that

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.860 align:middle line:90%
toward interpreting our dreams.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.155 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does stress and
tension affect our dreams?

00:11:47.155 --> 00:11:48.030 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Absolutely.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:51.810 align:middle line:84%
This is why I say most people
just do the problem solving

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:53.640 align:middle line:90%
aspect of their dreams.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.570 align:middle line:84%
We could, if we wanted to, if
we solved a lot of our problems

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:00.657 align:middle line:84%
in the day, then it would be
like-- so think about dreams

00:12:00.657 --> 00:12:01.740 align:middle line:90%
like it's a laundry thing.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.282 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
more for women.

00:12:03.282 --> 00:12:05.010 align:middle line:84%
I think more women
do laundry than men.

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:06.450 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I'm being sexist here.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:08.440 align:middle line:84%
But our dreams are
trying to help--

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I do mine.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.245 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: You do
your own laundry.

00:12:10.245 --> 00:12:11.040 align:middle line:90%
Whoo!

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.270 align:middle line:90%
George, I knew that about you.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thank you.

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: [LAUGHS]
But if we can do--

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:19.230 align:middle line:84%
like, in the day, if
we can forgive people

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:22.230 align:middle line:84%
as we go along, if we can
make amends, if we do things

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:25.110 align:middle line:84%
that mitigate our stress
as much as possible, then

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:29.580 align:middle line:84%
our dreams don't have
to be so full of anxiety

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:33.660 align:middle line:84%
so that we can some dreaming
tribes say that the best

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.630 align:middle line:84%
way to live our
lives is in order

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:43.110 align:middle line:84%
to have strong dreams, meaning
like exercise, eat well,

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:44.790 align:middle line:84%
not just because
it's good for you,

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.780 align:middle line:84%
not just because it's
moral or anything,

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:50.800 align:middle line:84%
but in order to dream well so
that you have a thriving dream

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:51.600 align:middle line:90%
life at night,

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.420 align:middle line:84%
so that you can really go
places and do things and bend

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.270 align:middle line:84%
time and bring
something back that

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.880 align:middle line:90%
will be of value to the tribe.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
nightmares, Kelly?

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: Nightmares I believe--
and some people might disagree

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:09.350 align:middle line:84%
with me-- but I believe our
nightmares are unsung heroes

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:11.270 align:middle line:90%
of our subconscious mind.

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.940 align:middle line:84%
I believe our nightmares,
just like every dream,

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:18.290 align:middle line:84%
comes to us in the service of
health, healing, and wholeness.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Our nightmares show up
when we're out of balance,

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.770 align:middle line:84%
out of harmony, or if we're on
the verge of doing something

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:26.780 align:middle line:84%
that's not good for us,
or if we're coming out

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:28.190 align:middle line:90%
of a destructive pattern.

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Our nightmares are
trying to truly wake us

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.190 align:middle line:84%
up so that hopefully
we'll remember that dream

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:37.130 align:middle line:84%
and it'll grip us so
much that it's not

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:40.340 align:middle line:84%
going to let go of its grip
until we course correct.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the dream
part of the brain,

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.740 align:middle line:90%
or is it outside of the brain?

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.010 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Whew.

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:49.880 align:middle line:84%
There's a neurological
functioning that happens.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.280 align:middle line:84%
But I believe the
dream is beyond--

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:55.910 align:middle line:84%
dreams are beyond just the
neurological functioning.

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:58.990 align:middle line:90%
I believe they're metaphysics.

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:01.850 align:middle line:84%
They're part of our
greater sensibility.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:05.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we could say that even
going back to caveman days,

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.510 align:middle line:84%
our dreams are trying
to keep us alive.

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:12.930 align:middle line:84%
They're part of our ability
to stay on this planet as long

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:13.730 align:middle line:90%
as possible.

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:16.010 align:middle line:84%
Often, it's our
limbic brain that

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:19.820 align:middle line:84%
is running much of our
dreams, our fight and flight.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.880 align:middle line:84%
It's why we have so many
running, chasing, fighting

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.690 align:middle line:90%
kind of dreams.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:25.505 align:middle line:90%
It's trying to keep us alive.

00:14:25.505 --> 00:14:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want you to
interpret this for us.

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:28.180 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Oh, good.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a
recurring dream,

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:32.450 align:middle line:90%
which I don't have anymore.

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:34.370 align:middle line:84%
When I went to the
University of Detroit

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:36.650 align:middle line:84%
to get my degree
in broadcasting,

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:40.850 align:middle line:84%
I ended up having
to switch my shift,

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:43.207 align:middle line:84%
because I got a full-time
job at a television station.

00:14:43.207 --> 00:14:44.290 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Congratulations.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:45.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And I was 19 years old.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Wow.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So in order
to keep that job,

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:53.270 align:middle line:84%
I had to take night courses,
so I flipped everything.

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And my dad thought I was
going to quit college,

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:56.900 align:middle line:90%
and he was all upset with me.

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Dad, I'm
not going to quit.

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:00.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get my
degree in four years.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to get it at
night, because I'm working

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.290 align:middle line:90%
during the daytime eight hours.

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:09.290 align:middle line:84%
So I was doing, like, 15
hours a day, school and work.

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:10.140 align:middle line:90%
So I did it.

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.590 align:middle line:84%
I got my degree in
four years, graduated,

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:14.600 align:middle line:90%
grew up in the business.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And years later, Kelly,
we needed 128 credit hours

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.110 align:middle line:90%
to graduate, which I did.

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:22.910 align:middle line:90%
I graduated.

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:24.500 align:middle line:90%
Got my degree.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:29.630 align:middle line:84%
I would have a nightmare
that I came up to 127,

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.390 align:middle line:84%
one credit hour short
of getting my degree.

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:34.557 align:middle line:90%
I would wake up in a cold sweat.

00:15:34.557 --> 00:15:35.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Oh, I bet.

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.330 align:middle line:90%
I didn't graduate.

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd realize it's
a dream and I'd be OK.

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:45.470 align:middle line:90%
But in order for it to go away--

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:47.420 align:middle line:84%
because this was
a recurring dream,

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:50.230 align:middle line:84%
this would happen
once or twice a week--

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:53.290 align:middle line:84%
I got my college
diploma and put it

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:55.630 align:middle line:90%
on the side of the bed stand.

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And when I would wake up in
that cold sweat, I'd look over,

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:02.735 align:middle line:84%
and there was my college
degree with my name on it.

00:16:02.735 --> 00:16:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And it hit me,
that's my diploma.

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:06.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm OK.

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: So you only had these
dreams after you graduated?

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:09.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: After the fact.

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:10.820 align:middle line:90%
After the fact.

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And then they went away after
I put the diploma on the stand.

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:15.730 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Interesting.

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But why was I dreaming
I was a credit hour short?

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.955 align:middle line:84%
I was never able
to figure that out.

00:16:21.955 --> 00:16:22.755 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: OK.

00:16:22.755 --> 00:16:26.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a great dream,
great dream series.

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And congratulations,
by the way, for--

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:28.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes!

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:29.710 align:middle line:90%
I did it.

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:30.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: You did it.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I promised
my dad, and I did it.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.640 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Yes.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.980 align:middle line:84%
So many people who
are driven will

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:40.450 align:middle line:84%
have dreams of coming up
short, and it's because--

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:43.270 align:middle line:84%
it's like, slackers don't
have these kind of dreams.

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:46.090 align:middle line:84%
People that don't care don't
have these kind of dreams.

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:47.690 align:middle line:90%
So it means that you care.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:51.490 align:middle line:84%
It means that you're in the
game and you're in it to win it.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:53.290 align:middle line:84%
So anybody who has
these kind of dreams

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:54.325 align:middle line:84%
should feel good
about themselves.

00:16:54.325 --> 00:16:55.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it a nightmare?

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: I would say it's on
the spectrum of a nightmare.

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:02.440 align:middle line:84%
But I would say if it
were me, I would look at--

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:05.200 align:middle line:84%
I would think that any
time you had this dream,

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.900 align:middle line:84%
you might have been up
against a new challenge,

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.569 align:middle line:84%
wondering if you're
going to make the grade,

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:14.089 align:middle line:84%
wondering if you're
going to succeed.

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:16.089 align:middle line:84%
Like, a lot of people
that are successful people

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:20.770 align:middle line:84%
will have dreams that
hearken back to school issues

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:23.407 align:middle line:84%
when they're up against a
new challenge in their life,

00:17:23.407 --> 00:17:25.490 align:middle line:84%
and they're wondering if
they're going to make it.

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:27.849 align:middle line:84%
And so they're really
trying to figure out

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:30.560 align:middle line:84%
how to cross the finish
line, so to speak.

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.670 align:middle line:84%
So that dream theme
will tend to show up

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:35.020 align:middle line:90%
so that it's trying to get--

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.780 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's trying
to get you, the dreamer,

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:40.570 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that you've dotted
your I's and cross your T's,

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:43.660 align:middle line:84%
and that you're prepared for the
next thing that you're up to.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.030 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing really
to do with back

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:49.090 align:middle line:84%
in school other than the fact
that that was a stressful time.

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could it have been
my father as well, pushing me,

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:56.760 align:middle line:84%
telling me, you're not
going to get your degree,

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.460 align:middle line:84%
you can't, you can't work full
time and do school full time,

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:01.630 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to happen?

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:03.837 align:middle line:90%
Could that be part of it?

00:18:03.837 --> 00:18:05.170 align:middle line:90%
Because he really believed that.

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:07.280 align:middle line:84%
He thought I wasn't
going to do it.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.090 align:middle line:90%
And I showed him.

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:08.890 align:middle line:90%
I did it.

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: I might-- if this
whole thing were my dream,

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:16.840 align:middle line:84%
I would think that your
father's higher self was

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:21.280 align:middle line:84%
using that kind of fear factor
to get you to prove to him,

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.410 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes I think
parents will do that.

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:25.120 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, oh, this
is going to happen.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.290 align:middle line:90%
Like, you can't do that.

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:27.623 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, oh, yes, I can.

00:18:27.623 --> 00:18:28.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: As opposed to,
oh, you're fine, honey.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.620 align:middle line:84%
You're so good just
the way you are.

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.290 align:middle line:84%
You're like, OK, maybe I
don't have to push myself.

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:38.740 align:middle line:84%
So whatever it was, even
if it was stressful--

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:42.010 align:middle line:84%
and that was probably
an unpleasant experience

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:46.780 align:middle line:84%
to feel like you had to
fight so hard, but it worked.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I kept
feeling, I can't fail.

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:49.510 align:middle line:90%
I can't fail.

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:50.552 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: You can't fail.

00:18:50.552 --> 00:18:52.555 align:middle line:84%
And also, people
that are achievers--

00:18:52.555 --> 00:18:53.680 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you're an achiever.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.030 align:middle line:90%
You're a successful man.

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:58.090 align:middle line:84%
It takes something to not
just survive in this world,

00:18:58.090 --> 00:18:59.680 align:middle line:90%
but to thrive and to do well.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.710 align:middle line:90%
So it takes something.

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:06.358 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that your spirit,
you brought in this father,

00:19:06.358 --> 00:19:07.900 align:middle line:84%
you brought in this
series of dreams,

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:12.220 align:middle line:84%
all of these stressful things
to help to give you that edge

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:15.490 align:middle line:84%
to push you across the edge
so that you could become

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:16.630 align:middle line:90%
the success that you are.

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:19.265 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
shared dreams, Kelly?

00:19:19.265 --> 00:19:20.065 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Whew.

00:19:20.065 --> 00:19:22.630 align:middle line:84%
They're special, kind of like
I was talking about the dreams

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:23.800 align:middle line:90%
that I had with my sister.

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:28.111 align:middle line:84%
I believe that when we have
shared dreams with people,

00:19:28.111 --> 00:19:31.070 align:middle line:84%
we develop a deeper psychic
connection with them.

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:34.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's just about
the dream that we share,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.747 align:middle line:84%
but it's about really
connecting on a soul-ular level.

00:19:37.747 --> 00:19:38.830 align:middle line:90%
Not just a cellular level.

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:39.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:42.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, give me your thoughts
on author Jared Zeizel.

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:45.670 align:middle line:84%
He was on Gaia's "Open Minds"
talking about shared dreams.

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:46.510 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: OK.

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:48.052 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: What do
you see happening

00:19:48.052 --> 00:19:51.010 align:middle line:10%
when people start actually
actively sharing their dreams

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:52.597 align:middle line:10%
as a practice with one another?

00:19:52.597 --> 00:19:54.430 align:middle line:10%
>>JARED ZEIZEL: Well,
I think one thing that

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:58.060 align:middle line:10%
happens, as with
all storytelling,

00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.650 align:middle line:10%
is usually empathy grows.

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:01.030 align:middle line:10%
You know, you just--

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:04.510 align:middle line:10%
you put yourself in someone
else's shoes, and you connect.

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:08.350 align:middle line:10%
And you essentially
feel and can imagine

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:10.570 align:middle line:10%
what that person went through.

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:12.940 align:middle line:10%
And if you're doing that kind
of in the present moment,

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:17.390 align:middle line:10%
you're almost subconsciously
going through that experience

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:18.190 align:middle line:10%
yourself.

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:23.140 align:middle line:10%
So you're initially creating
a shared experience.

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:26.110 align:middle line:10%
And in addition to
that, as we know,

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:29.180 align:middle line:10%
dreams can be very
fanciful, it can be fluid,

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.810 align:middle line:10%
it can be even quite
confusing at times

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:36.460 align:middle line:10%
because our mind will
project these metaphors that

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.680 align:middle line:10%
don't quite make
sense on the surface.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:41.397 align:middle line:10%
But once we start talking
about it, someone might--

00:20:41.397 --> 00:20:42.730 align:middle line:10%
especially someone close to you.

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:43.660 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: It
triggers something.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:44.060 align:middle line:10%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.727 align:middle line:10%
And they'll be like,
oh, that reminds me

00:20:45.727 --> 00:20:47.677 align:middle line:10%
of the time you did blank.

00:20:47.677 --> 00:20:49.510 align:middle line:10%
And then that person
will be like, oh, yeah.

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:51.730 align:middle line:10%
I think that the dream
is connected to that.

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:52.600 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: Right.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:53.400 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.530 align:middle line:10%
It gives a lot of key
subconscious information.

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:58.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Shared dreams.

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: Yeah, this is
why dream groups are really

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.405 align:middle line:84%
wonderful, the moment
somebody shares a dream

00:21:04.405 --> 00:21:05.950 align:middle line:90%
and the group kind of weighs in.

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:08.770 align:middle line:84%
We play the game of
if it were my dream.

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:11.832 align:middle line:10%
So I always suggest
that nobody ever

00:21:11.832 --> 00:21:13.540 align:middle line:10%
say, well, this is
what your dream means.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:14.540 align:middle line:10%
I know for sure.

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:15.640 align:middle line:10%
It's if it were my dream.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.920 align:middle line:10%
You have to imagine
that it was your dream

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.920 align:middle line:10%
and that all of the characters
that were played out

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.010 align:middle line:10%
were in you.

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:24.970 align:middle line:84%
So in the end of
a session, a dream

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:27.410 align:middle line:84%
session among
absolute strangers,

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:29.950 align:middle line:84%
people are so deeply
bonded, similar

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:33.400 align:middle line:84%
to what was being
said on the show.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.870 align:middle line:90%
You go way past the ego.

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:37.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this happens
to me sometimes.

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:40.570 align:middle line:84%
I'll be at a cocktail
party where-- before COVID,

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:43.000 align:middle line:84%
obviously, when we could
do those kind of things--

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.280 align:middle line:84%
somebody would say, oh,
what do you do for a living?

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.500 align:middle line:90%
And I'd say, oh, I do dreams.

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:48.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Dream.

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And so a stranger
will tell me a dream,

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:53.440 align:middle line:84%
and I will give my
reflection on it.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And then all of the sudden
people nearby are listening

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:56.860 align:middle line:90%
and they're like, [GASP].

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:58.570 align:middle line:90%
There's tears.

00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:00.400 align:middle line:84%
There's this bonding
that happens.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:04.330 align:middle line:84%
It's like this very deeply
human thing happens.

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And we bypass the business
card and the resume

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:09.670 align:middle line:90%
and the pedigree.

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:12.700 align:middle line:84%
It's like we're soul
to soul so quickly.

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:16.600 align:middle line:84%
It's like an intimacy
activator, instantly.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.931 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we train ourselves
to enter other people's dreams?

00:22:19.931 --> 00:22:20.731 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Ooh.

00:22:20.731 --> 00:22:23.400 align:middle line:90%


00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.890 align:middle line:90%
I am-- yes.

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:26.270 align:middle line:90%
I'll say yes, we can.

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:28.250 align:middle line:90%
And I caution--

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:31.460 align:middle line:84%
I caution against
this unless you're--

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it ethical?

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: Well, I
think sometimes--

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.740 align:middle line:84%
it depends on why
you want to do it.

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:40.850 align:middle line:84%
I've had some people that
were, for example, in love

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:43.550 align:middle line:84%
with somebody, having an
unrequited love experience who

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:48.120 align:middle line:84%
wanted to infiltrate their
love interest's dreams.

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, OK,
that's unethical.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:50.540 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And good luck with that,
because even if you do

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:56.000 align:middle line:84%
get into somebody
else's dream and you

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.270 align:middle line:84%
are able to hook them and
convince them to love you,

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:02.180 align:middle line:84%
the fact that you had
to go through those--

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:04.100 align:middle line:84%
the fact that you had
to push upstream so hard

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.960 align:middle line:84%
probably means that
it's not going to work.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.210 align:middle line:84%
You might get them for a
minute, but it's probably not

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:09.560 align:middle line:90%
going to sustain.

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:12.530 align:middle line:84%
From a healing
perspective, I will often

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:14.550 align:middle line:90%
dream about my clients.

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:17.540 align:middle line:84%
I think we dream about
whatever we're interested in

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.550 align:middle line:84%
and whatever we're
passionate about.

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:21.170 align:middle line:84%
Those will show
up in our dreams.

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:24.425 align:middle line:84%
Now, how to get into
somebody else's dreams,

00:23:24.425 --> 00:23:27.140 align:middle line:84%
this takes a whole
other level of thought.

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:28.072 align:middle line:90%
Why would we want to--

00:23:28.072 --> 00:23:29.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's powerful.

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:30.740 align:middle line:90%
Oh, for manipulation.

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:31.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Well, absolutely.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:32.800 align:middle line:90%
And I know--

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.230 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed some people
myself that have worked

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:39.980 align:middle line:84%
on the level of government,
have worked at the UN,

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:43.760 align:middle line:84%
have worked doing some-- kind
of like from the movie "Men Who

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.800 align:middle line:84%
Stare at Goats," kind of the
cyber warfare kind of thing--

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:47.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Remote viewers.

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: --and
they-- and it's legit.

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.460 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.410 align:middle line:84%
Some people are
very, very skilled

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:59.030 align:middle line:84%
at being able to step into
the psyche of other people.

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:01.160 align:middle line:84%
That's a little bit
beyond the work that I do.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.690 align:middle line:90%
Is it possible?

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:03.860 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And I would say if anybody
is interested in going

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:09.620 align:middle line:84%
into that area, I would
say, first of all, make sure

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:11.420 align:middle line:84%
that you've done a lot
of your own healing

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:13.010 align:middle line:90%
first so you're not just--

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:15.560 align:middle line:84%
you're not going into it
for the wrong reasons,

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.600 align:middle line:90%
and thus creating a boomerang.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Whatever we do comes
back to us, so we

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:22.070 align:middle line:84%
have to be careful with
whatever it is we do.

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have used going
into the dream state of others

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:27.830 align:middle line:90%
to get things done.

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Jobs, better positions,
and it's worked.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.370 align:middle line:84%
I will go to bed,
concentrate on a--

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:39.340 align:middle line:84%
let's say that you're
responsible for hiring,

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.530 align:middle line:84%
and I'll get to
know who you are.

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:44.980 align:middle line:84%
I'll go to bed and
concentrate on Kelly Walden,

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.150 align:middle line:84%
that this person's
going to hire me.

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:47.950 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:51.110 align:middle line:84%
Within two days, you would
have called me and said, hey,

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:52.210 align:middle line:90%
we have a job opening.

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:53.500 align:middle line:90%
Are you interested?

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:54.910 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:55.900 align:middle line:90%
Because I've done it.

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.275 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: Well, maybe you need
to be giving that seminar,

00:24:58.275 --> 00:25:00.320 align:middle line:90%
because clearly you did that.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.240 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's--

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I
continue to do it.

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: Well,
it's very powerful.

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:07.240 align:middle line:84%
It means that you are a
powerful sorcerer, George Noory.

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:08.560 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Not everybody--

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's why I
plant these little things

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:10.870 align:middle line:90%
in their mind.

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:11.440 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Right.

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't know if it's
planting it in their mind.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:14.350 align:middle line:90%
I mean, from--

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:15.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's what
I think I'm doing.

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:16.423 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: And maybe it is.

00:25:16.423 --> 00:25:19.870 align:middle line:84%
But from my perspective, I
like to look at each of us

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:21.580 align:middle line:90%
as a hologram.

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And everyone in the world,
past, present, and future,

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:27.380 align:middle line:84%
is within the
hologram of ourselves.

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:30.640 align:middle line:84%
So if what happened to you
were my dream experience,

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:34.480 align:middle line:84%
I would think I was connecting
with that part of myself

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:38.470 align:middle line:84%
so deeply, so intimately, I
was creating such a bridge

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:40.720 align:middle line:90%
that there was an outer effect.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.820 align:middle line:84%
I like to think
of-- to me, it feels

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:45.190 align:middle line:84%
more ethical to think
of it in terms of I'm

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:47.890 align:middle line:84%
doing everything I can
on my side of the street

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:51.430 align:middle line:84%
to attune myself to the
best possible outcome that

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:55.060 align:middle line:84%
relates to that person for
the highest good of all.

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:58.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's not so much that I'm
going over there to them.

00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:01.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking about them within
myself, that part of myself.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.540 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- maybe this
is a little different.

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:06.400 align:middle line:84%
We'll teach the
seminar together.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We should.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.990 align:middle line:84%
When I was in high school, I
would be sitting behind people,

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:14.100 align:middle line:84%
and I would concentrate
on the back of their head

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.880 align:middle line:90%
for them to turn around.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:19.900 align:middle line:84%
I wanted them to feel,
somebody's staring at me.

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And within two minutes,
the person would go--

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:25.560 align:middle line:90%
and turn around.

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: Well, you are
somebody who's been--

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:31.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're skilled
at this subtle energies.

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And clearly, you came
here to have an impact.

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And to me, what's really
brilliant is being able to do--

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:42.780 align:middle line:84%
this is what I call
dream-a-festing,

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:47.880 align:middle line:84%
being able to affect matter,
to be able to affect the world.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.770 align:middle line:84%
But you do a lot of the
work on the inner plane.

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:51.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.310 align:middle line:90%
And it's always for good.

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:55.227 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: Always
for good, because it

00:26:55.227 --> 00:26:57.810 align:middle line:84%
would be silly to do it for bad,
because it comes back around,

00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:58.840 align:middle line:90%
so we don't want that.

00:26:58.840 --> 00:26:59.640 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:04.200 align:middle line:84%
But we can accomplish
so much with our energy,

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.990 align:middle line:84%
with our own dreams,
with our own thoughts,

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:10.740 align:middle line:84%
without having to lift a muscle,
without having to do anything,

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:12.810 align:middle line:84%
without having to
strain ourselves.

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:14.805 align:middle line:90%
So many people are like, ah!

00:27:14.805 --> 00:27:16.410 align:middle line:90%
Trying to manifest, manifest.

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:18.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, why not dream-a-fest?

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Let your dreaming mind
do the heavy lifting.

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:22.020 align:middle line:90%
Kind of like--

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
what dream-a-fest is?

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: It's where
you have a goal.

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:27.330 align:middle line:90%
You have an outcome.

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And you think about it very
specifically at bedtime,

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:32.370 align:middle line:90%
right before you go to sleep.

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And more than just
thinking about the thing

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:39.960 align:middle line:84%
that you want, you to imagine
the feeling tone of it.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And with that, you go to
sleep with that in mind.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.810 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're handing over
your wish list to the dreams,

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:48.480 align:middle line:84%
saying, you do
the heavy lifting.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get a
good night's sleep.

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And in your dreams,
your dreaming mind--

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It goes
to work for you.

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:56.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: It goes
to work for you.

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Then you wake up, and
ideally you wake up.

00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:00.507 align:middle line:84%
You complete the feet back loop
by having a remembered dream

00:28:00.507 --> 00:28:01.840 align:middle line:90%
when you wake up in the morning.

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, what I do
then, I do exactly that,

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:08.310 align:middle line:84%
but I take it a step further,
and that's concentrate

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:11.740 align:middle line:84%
on an individual
at the same time.

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:14.115 align:middle line:84%
So when you-- when you have
a problem and you go to sleep

00:28:14.115 --> 00:28:17.070 align:middle line:84%
and you say, I need
this fixed tomorrow,

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:19.410 align:middle line:84%
I need to make sure I have
enough money coming in to pay

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:21.450 align:middle line:90%
a bill, and you go to bed.

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
in the mail, you

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.760 align:middle line:84%
get a check from your
insurance company for a rebate

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.410 align:middle line:90%
that you overpaid.

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:30.360 align:middle line:90%
And you go, my god.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.340 align:middle line:90%
I can use this to pay that bill.

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:35.340 align:middle line:84%
That used to happen
to me years ago.

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:41.360 align:middle line:84%
But I also then used it to
concentrate on certain people

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:42.560 align:middle line:90%
to tie it into that.

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.260 align:middle line:90%
And it works.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: So tell me what
you think about this.

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:50.900 align:middle line:84%
For dream-a-festing, I
have this 3D methodology.

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:54.400 align:middle line:90%
The first D is to Drop it.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And this means that consider,
like, to kind sort out,

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.170 align:middle line:90%
what's of my ego?

00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:04.640 align:middle line:84%
What is just my will
versus thy will?

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And how do you know unless
you become willing to let go?

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:11.060 align:middle line:90%
And then the second D is Desire.

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And desire with a small
d is (SCRATCHY VOICE)

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:15.500 align:middle line:90%
I want this because I want it.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:16.370 align:middle line:90%
Ha, ha, ha.

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:17.660 align:middle line:90%
My pretty.

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:22.100 align:middle line:84%
But the desire with a capital
D actually means of the stars.

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:24.380 align:middle line:84%
It means to connect
with the father.

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:29.540 align:middle line:84%
It's actually about
becoming in sync with god,

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:31.738 align:middle line:90%
with your spiritual essence.

00:29:31.738 --> 00:29:33.530 align:middle line:84%
So when you connect
with that, after you've

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:35.840 align:middle line:84%
dropped everything-- it's
kind of like that saying,

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.532 align:middle line:84%
if you love someone,
set them free.

00:29:37.532 --> 00:29:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And if they come
back, then they're

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:40.470 align:middle line:90%
really meant to be yours.

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:42.440 align:middle line:90%
So let your desires go.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And whatever does come
back, consider that's legit.

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And then the third aspect
of it is the Divine design.

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Imagine-- and this might
be a little bit out there,

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.440 align:middle line:90%
but I think you can handle it--

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.660 align:middle line:84%
but imagine through
a visualization

00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:02.600 align:middle line:84%
that you are the universe, that
you are the supreme creator

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.860 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:06.350 align:middle line:84%
From that perspective,
look down and say,

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:08.900 align:middle line:84%
what would I want
for this person

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:11.245 align:middle line:84%
as it relates to
the whole matrix?

00:30:11.245 --> 00:30:14.345 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've not used
that technique yet.

00:30:14.345 --> 00:30:15.470 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: It's interesting.

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:17.637 align:middle line:84%
Because if you think, well,
I want to be successful,

00:30:17.637 --> 00:30:20.450 align:middle line:84%
I want to have love in my life,
I want to have better health,

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:22.730 align:middle line:84%
and you look at it from
the higher perspective,

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:26.330 align:middle line:84%
you might realize, well, if I
was designing this universe,

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:30.170 align:middle line:84%
if I may be so bold, I
would want that for him too,

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:33.955 align:middle line:84%
because I would see the
positive ripple effect on life.

00:30:33.955 --> 00:30:36.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you're
talking about manifestations.

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And author Mike Dooley was on
the Gaia show "Inspirations."

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:43.040 align:middle line:84%
Great guy, talking
about manifestations.

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:44.540 align:middle line:10%
>>MIKE DOOLEY: So
we bought a ticket

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:48.590 align:middle line:10%
where there's these physical
laws, these energy coordinate

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:53.870 align:middle line:10%
points, where physically it will
one day be explained exactly

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:55.380 align:middle line:10%
how our thoughts become things.

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:59.390 align:middle line:10%
But until then,
we're in this soup.

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:01.280 align:middle line:10%
And unlike a
nighttime dream, which

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:03.760 align:middle line:10%
is otherwise identical
to the daytime dream,

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.260 align:middle line:10%
except there's a lone dreamer,
not seven and a half billion,

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:08.677 align:middle line:10%
in a nighttime dream, I can
think gold coins and a million

00:31:08.677 --> 00:31:10.520 align:middle line:10%
dollars, and it's in
the palm of my hand.

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:13.320 align:middle line:10%
In a dream where there's
this continuity that we agree

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.382 align:middle line:10%
to call time and space, both.

00:31:15.382 --> 00:31:17.090 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA GARR: That's
the ticket we bought.

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:18.673 align:middle line:10%
>>DOOLEY: That's the
ticket we bought,

00:31:18.673 --> 00:31:19.940 align:middle line:10%
which does not limit us.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:22.710 align:middle line:10%
It just slows the
manifestation process down.

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:26.930 align:middle line:10%
So instead of manifesting a
million dollars spontaneously,

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:29.750 align:middle line:10%
the more miraculous thing
that starts happening

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:31.880 align:middle line:10%
is its nearest equivalent.

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.900 align:middle line:10%
And I mean equivalent.

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:35.870 align:middle line:10%
I mean a million dollars
in gold coins or stock

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:38.300 align:middle line:10%
certificates or your
business ballooning

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:39.920 align:middle line:10%
overnight, blowing up.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:42.500 align:middle line:10%
The nearest equivalent
is being pressed to you

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.530 align:middle line:10%
in the moment you
had that thought.

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:49.640 align:middle line:10%
And to experience it, to
merge this now with that now,

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.930 align:middle line:10%
we call the future.

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:52.160 align:middle line:10%
You need to show up.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.210 align:middle line:10%
You need to get out.

00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:54.813 align:middle line:10%
You need to maintain
the thought--

00:31:54.813 --> 00:31:56.480 align:middle line:10%
>>GARR: Next step,
next step, next step.

00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:00.140 align:middle line:10%
>>DOOLEY: And the next step,
to string the moments together,

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:03.815 align:middle line:10%
you have to vigilantly hold that
thought of a million dollars.

00:32:03.815 --> 00:32:05.087 align:middle line:10%
And it's not easy.

00:32:05.087 --> 00:32:06.420 align:middle line:10%
It's going to go out the window.

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:10.520 align:middle line:10%
That's why you want to get
excited about it emotionally.

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:11.540 align:middle line:10%
A million dollars.

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:11.600 align:middle line:10%
Great.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:12.290 align:middle line:10%
A million dollars.

00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:13.332 align:middle line:10%
What's a million dollars?

00:32:13.332 --> 00:32:15.582 align:middle line:10%
A million-- can I even
comprehend a million dollars?

00:32:15.582 --> 00:32:18.150 align:middle line:10%
It's lay flat sleeper
seats all around the world.

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:18.950 align:middle line:10%
>>GARR: [LAUGHS]

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:21.050 align:middle line:10%
>>DOOLEY: A million dollars
is a home in Florida

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:22.070 align:middle line:10%
and a home in Mexico.

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:25.310 align:middle line:10%
A million dollars is freedom
for my wife and my daughter.

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:27.320 align:middle line:10%
A million-- now
I'm dressing it up

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.540 align:middle line:10%
and I'm feeling some
passion, and that's going

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:31.070 align:middle line:10%
to carry me through the moment.

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:34.400 align:middle line:10%
So it's not just the
thought that goes in one ear

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.700 align:middle line:10%
and out the other.

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:38.870 align:middle line:10%
And while I hold
that passion, I need

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:42.710 align:middle line:10%
to do my best, which will
always seem insufficient.

00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:46.550 align:middle line:10%
I need to do my best to now
move towards a million dollars.

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:49.730 align:middle line:10%
So buy the lottery ticket,
start the business,

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:54.500 align:middle line:10%
expand the business, write
the book, ask for a raise,

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:56.270 align:middle line:10%
move towards abundance.

00:32:56.270 --> 00:33:02.690 align:middle line:10%
You must-- you must, in your own
way, in your own calculations,

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:04.970 align:middle line:10%
do your best to
move towards that

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:06.920 align:middle line:10%
which you want while
holding the vision,

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:09.500 align:middle line:10%
while enjoying your life, while
giving yourself permission

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:13.370 align:middle line:10%
to be happy now, because you've
already manifested so much, you

00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:14.730 align:middle line:10%
and everyone else.

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:20.150 align:middle line:10%
And so you can enjoy the journey
and prepare to be astounded.

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:21.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I like that guy.

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:23.495 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: I love that guy.

00:33:23.495 --> 00:33:26.065 align:middle line:84%
He dares to speak on
behalf of the universe.

00:33:26.065 --> 00:33:27.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he's spot on.

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:28.070 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Yeah.

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:29.200 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.500 align:middle line:90%
It is about action.

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:32.210 align:middle line:90%
And you demonstrated that.

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:35.300 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just you having a
dream or wanting something,

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:38.030 align:middle line:84%
but showing up and having-- and
taking the action and getting

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:39.462 align:middle line:90%
the job, getting the--

00:33:39.462 --> 00:33:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you need
to be ready for it.

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:42.280 align:middle line:90%
That's the other thing.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Absolutely.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wishing for
it, dreaming about it.

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:45.850 align:middle line:90%
That's one thing.

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Yes.

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But if it comes through
and you get that opportunity,

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:52.360 align:middle line:90%
you better be ready for it.

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:53.260 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Yes.

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:55.352 align:middle line:84%
So can I tell you
about my five steps

00:33:55.352 --> 00:33:56.560 align:middle line:90%
to being an awakened dreamer?

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:57.610 align:middle line:90%
Because it relates to this.

00:33:57.610 --> 00:33:58.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: So I always tell
people to apply this formula

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:04.780 align:middle line:84%
when you're feeling stressed,
if you're feeling like, oh,

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:05.740 align:middle line:90%
you're not--

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:07.420 align:middle line:84%
there's a gap of
between where you are

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:10.728 align:middle line:84%
and where you want to be,
whether it's really stressful

00:34:10.728 --> 00:34:12.520 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's just
a little bit of angst.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.920 align:middle line:84%
So this is kind of to
calm that and also put you

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.560 align:middle line:90%
in sync with what you want.

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:19.810 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing, using
five, the first step

00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:22.750 align:middle line:84%
is to remember that you're
already at one with the one.

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:25.510 align:middle line:84%
You're already connected
to the whole of life.

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:26.620 align:middle line:90%
Could not be more so.

00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:29.710 align:middle line:84%
So at least energetically,
remember that you are--

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just like
the Dalai Lama.

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:32.770 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Kind of like that.

00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and that's an
instant vibration raiser.

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:40.989 align:middle line:84%
Number two is to become
at peace with duality

00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:43.570 align:middle line:90%
and to remember, oh, yeah.

00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:45.100 align:middle line:90%
I signed up for this.

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:48.370 align:middle line:84%
I signed up for this place
where-- like, perhaps we all

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:51.639 align:middle line:84%
come from this angelic realm
where we think it, we get it,

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:53.330 align:middle line:90%
it's all so easy.

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:54.400 align:middle line:90%
We're all connected.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.590 align:middle line:90%
It's like kumbaya every day.

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:58.270 align:middle line:90%
And maybe we got a little bored.

00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:00.980 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we wanted a
little bit of challenge.

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:04.280 align:middle line:84%
So we came here to be able
to experience contrast

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.970 align:middle line:84%
so that we can appreciate the
oneness that we're already in.

00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:08.500 align:middle line:90%
So we signed up for this.

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Every challenge we have
is about perception,

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:12.850 align:middle line:90%
the perception of duality.

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:16.120 align:middle line:84%
The third is to look for
threes and to remember

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.460 align:middle line:84%
that the divine
third, when it comes

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:21.280 align:middle line:84%
to navigating that
triangulation,

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.420 align:middle line:84%
to be able to remember
that, here's me.

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:24.220 align:middle line:90%
Here's the goal.

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:25.270 align:middle line:90%
Like, if you're my goal.

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:26.070 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:29.110 align:middle line:84%
But to also look up to the
north star, this higher

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:32.020 align:middle line:84%
point that's going
to help to give me

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:33.620 align:middle line:90%
perspective and guidance.

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:35.960 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just me
trying to get to George.

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.810 align:middle line:84%
It's like, let me
follow something

00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:40.482 align:middle line:84%
higher that's going to take
me there in the highest way.

00:35:40.482 --> 00:35:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Fourth thing-- and this is what
really relates to what Mike

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:44.170 align:middle line:90%
Dooley was saying--

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:46.750 align:middle line:90%
fortune favors fullness.

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:50.110 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to manifesting
or dream-a-festing,

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:53.770 align:middle line:84%
we want to be in that place of
remembering how full we already

00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:55.990 align:middle line:90%
are and grateful for ourselves.

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:59.560 align:middle line:84%
This is why the rich get
richer, the poor get poorer.

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:02.410 align:middle line:84%
Based on our
vibrational set point,

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:05.270 align:middle line:84%
we tend to keep
attracting based on that.

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:06.940 align:middle line:84%
So if we want to
attract more, we

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:11.680 align:middle line:84%
need to remember how full
and fortunate we already are.

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:13.420 align:middle line:90%
And then you know the fifth one.

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:16.750 align:middle line:84%
It's to step into the
five-year-old self when it

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:19.750 align:middle line:84%
comes to manifesting, the way
that we manifested when we were

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:21.910 align:middle line:84%
little kids, the
way we could turn--

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:24.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, literally in
my backyard growing up

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:27.820 align:middle line:84%
in Huntington Park, California,
we had a little piece of dirt

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:28.630 align:middle line:90%
in the backyard.

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that was
a treasure island.

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:33.730 align:middle line:84%
It was magical, and
there was so much joy.

00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:37.750 align:middle line:84%
I used to borrow my mom's
jewelry and bury it in the sand

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:39.430 align:middle line:90%
and make a map and then--

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:42.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we could see
things that weren't there.

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:45.250 align:middle line:84%
We could have
treasures every day.

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's the energy that
makes us radiant and attractive

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:53.290 align:middle line:84%
to amazing things
in our waking life.

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:54.910 align:middle line:90%
It's a vibrational shift.

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:58.030 align:middle line:84%
In that high vibe, we
tend to be magnetic

00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:59.890 align:middle line:84%
so we don't have to
work so darn hard,

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:01.810 align:middle line:84%
even though the hard
work isn't a bad idea.

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've developed
some oracle cards.

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: I have.

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:05.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's do
a little sample.

00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:06.280 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Let's do it.

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.697 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
a number of cards

00:37:07.697 --> 00:37:09.290 align:middle line:84%
that you have
written inscriptions.

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:10.090 align:middle line:90%
You have it here.

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:13.700 align:middle line:84%
I'll pick a card, and then
you tell me what it means.

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: OK.

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:17.270 align:middle line:84%
So this is the awakened
dreamer oracle card.

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:19.270 align:middle line:90%
So these are meant to be--

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:21.610 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to shuffle
these for you, George.

00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And these are meant
to be something

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:26.620 align:middle line:84%
that you play with
in your waking life

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:29.110 align:middle line:84%
if you're in the middle
of making a decision.

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:31.060 align:middle line:84%
If you're feeling
out of sorts and you

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:33.303 align:middle line:84%
want to get back into that
zone, you want to feel--

00:37:33.303 --> 00:37:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Should I
go for that job?

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:35.830 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Should I go--

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:38.680 align:middle line:90%
yeah, should I call that person?

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:40.420 align:middle line:84%
Should I eat that
extra piece of cake?

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:41.530 align:middle line:90%
Or whatever the thing is.

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And these are brand new, so
they're a little bit stiff,

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:44.500 align:middle line:90%
so I'm just going to kind of--

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let me just pick one.

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:46.513 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: All right.

00:37:46.513 --> 00:37:48.730 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to ask you to
think of a question first.

00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:49.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:52.920 align:middle line:90%


00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.020 align:middle line:90%
Will the world ever be at peace?

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:55.937 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: [LAUGHS] OK.

00:37:55.937 --> 00:37:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a
pretty big question.

00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:58.410 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: OK.

00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And you're probably going
to pick a handful of them,

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:01.110 align:middle line:84%
because this is
a brand new deck.

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:02.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm just
going to take one.

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: OK.

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.980 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what you get.

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:06.400 align:middle line:90%
George, you got-- all right.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.200 align:middle line:90%
Let me see.

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:07.990 align:middle line:90%
Drumroll, please.

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will the
world over be at peace?

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:09.900 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Oh, my god.

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:10.920 align:middle line:90%
My glasses.

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.592 align:middle line:90%
I need my glasses to read this.

00:38:12.592 --> 00:38:13.800 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you have reading glasses?

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm going to give you--

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: You do?

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:15.640 align:middle line:90%
Oh, great.

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:16.270 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:17.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to get to see.

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:19.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be more
like George every minute.

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.820 align:middle line:90%
These are perfect.

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:23.130 align:middle line:84%
Bring your highest
to your lowest.

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:28.170 align:middle line:84%
Call to mind your greatest
strength, the aspect of you

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:31.140 align:middle line:84%
that is the most
spiritually mature.

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:35.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, infuse that power into
the place where you feel

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:38.460 align:middle line:90%
the weakest or most vulnerable.

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:41.910 align:middle line:84%
You will be more powerful-- you
will be a more powerful force

00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:44.440 align:middle line:90%
to be reckoned with.

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:47.460 align:middle line:84%
So this is giving you
a little action step

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:50.670 align:middle line:84%
to take in response
to, is the world ever

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:51.823 align:middle line:90%
going to be a better place?

00:38:51.823 --> 00:38:52.740 align:middle line:90%
Is that your question?

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep.

00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: So how do you
create that is to bring

00:38:56.490 --> 00:38:58.200 align:middle line:90%
your highest to your lowest.

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Think about the part of you
that's naturally strong.

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:03.060 align:middle line:90%
Naturally like, I got this.

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And transfer that energy
to the part of you

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.983 align:middle line:84%
that's like, (SCARED VOICE) oh,
will the world ever be better?

00:39:07.983 --> 00:39:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we all need
to do it individually

00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:11.040 align:middle line:90%
and collectively--

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Exactly.

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --in order
to get that done fast.

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:15.202 align:middle line:84%
So you can do that for
just about anything.

00:39:15.202 --> 00:39:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: For any
question, yeah.

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would you do it daily?

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:19.920 align:middle line:84%
What kind of day am I going
to have, and you pull a card?

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: Yeah, some
people-- oh, let's see.

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.080 align:middle line:90%
You got another one.

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:23.163 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to play with--

00:39:23.163 --> 00:39:26.330 align:middle line:84%
I always think there's something
when one falls out of the deck.

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:27.760 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to try this?

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One more.

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:29.160 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: One more.

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:29.490 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:30.250 align:middle line:90%
You've got your glasses.

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:31.050 align:middle line:90%
I'll let you read this one.

00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You want
me to read this?

00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:32.820 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Yeah.

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:34.300 align:middle line:90%
And the question is--

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:35.100 align:middle line:90%
let's see.

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:35.900 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:37.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is this for you?

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:39.150 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDEN: Sure,
this will be for me.

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Ooh, there's a relationship
in my life with a dear person

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:47.280 align:middle line:84%
that I'm having a
moment of struggle with,

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.450 align:middle line:84%
and I'd like some
support with that.

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:52.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The headline says
the knower that knows.

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:54.750 align:middle line:84%
There's a knower
within you who always

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:57.690 align:middle line:84%
knows what to do,
where to go, with whom

00:39:57.690 --> 00:39:59.520 align:middle line:90%
to contact and connect.

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:02.400 align:middle line:84%
The evidence of being
attuned to this voice

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:05.520 align:middle line:84%
is that you are flooded
with peace, case, grace,

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.620 align:middle line:90%
and electric vitality.

00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Amplify the voice of the
knower by acting on its wisdom.

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Sounds like it's telling
me that this is up to you.

00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:16.090 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Yeah.

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:17.382 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You make the decision.

00:40:17.382 --> 00:40:18.220 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Yeah.

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:19.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.490 align:middle line:84%
It's like that
perspective that we

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:22.240 align:middle line:84%
might ask all these
questions, but there's

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.400 align:middle line:90%
some part of us that does know.

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we just don't
want to accept that we know.

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:30.850 align:middle line:10%
We'd rather be
small and vulnerable

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:32.380 align:middle line:10%
and insecure and
say, I don't know.

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:33.640 align:middle line:10%
But maybe we know a lot more.

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:36.020 align:middle line:10%
Maybe we're a lot more
powerful than we realize.

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:36.820 align:middle line:90%
That helps.

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:37.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.310 align:middle line:84%
So I say, yeah, pick
one up in the morning

00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:41.530 align:middle line:84%
as part of a morning
ritual, a meditation,

00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:43.060 align:middle line:90%
a way to start the day.

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:46.213 align:middle line:84%
Maybe pick one up, shuffle
it go before you go to sleep.

00:40:46.213 --> 00:40:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle of the day, if
you're going through something,

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:52.190 align:middle line:84%
if you're on the verge of
making a decision, stop.

00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:52.990 align:middle line:90%
Get centered.

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:54.010 align:middle line:90%
Ask a question.

00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:55.300 align:middle line:90%
And pull the card.

00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:56.545 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:40:56.545 --> 00:40:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Kelly, how do people
track you down?

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:00.610 align:middle line:10%
>>WALDEN: They can go
to my website, which

00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:03.130 align:middle line:10%
is kellysullivanwalden.com.

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:04.570 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: W-A-L-D-E-N.

00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:08.530 align:middle line:10%
>>WALDEN: D-E-N. And
Ihadthestrangestdream.com

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:09.790 align:middle line:10%
is also my website.

00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And on Facebook, it's Kelly
Sullivan Walden Dreams.

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Instagram, Twitter,
and now Clubhouse--

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:18.595 align:middle line:84%
that's a new one--
it's @kellyswalden.

00:41:18.595 --> 00:41:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:21.190 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDEN: Thank you, George.

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:23.110 align:middle line:84%
It's always such a
dream to be with you.

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And I love the way you sing
to me before the camera rolls,

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:27.190 align:middle line:90%
so thank you so much.

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:29.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I sang a song about
dreams by The Letterman,

00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:32.720 align:middle line:84%
the Four Tops, or
whoever sang that song.

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:36.610 align:middle line:84%
But let me tell you, dreaming
is a very powerful tool.

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:40.060 align:middle line:10%
If you can use it well,
it'll change your life.

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:41.050 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:43.150 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
