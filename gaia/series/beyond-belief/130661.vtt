Pleasure to be here.

Thank you.

>>NOORY: What were you,
about 13 when you first

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.550 align:middle line:84%
started appearing on "Coast
to Coast" talking about these?

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: 15 years old, I
think, is when I started, yeah.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.056 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:01:22.056 --> 00:01:25.090 align:middle line:84%
What would cause a
little 15-year-old

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.410 align:middle line:84%
to get so interested
in UFOs and then start

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.236 align:middle line:90%
accumulating all this data?

00:01:31.236 --> 00:01:32.860 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: I wish
I had a great story.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.690 align:middle line:10%
It was curiosity, and I didn't
like the structured learning

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:36.550 align:middle line:10%
of school.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.383 align:middle line:84%
So make sure my mom and
dad aren't watching,

00:01:38.383 --> 00:01:40.570 align:middle line:84%
but I just didn't want
to go through high school

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.420 align:middle line:84%
and hit the history
books, and I started

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.680 align:middle line:84%
looking at the real
history and the government

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.500 align:middle line:84%
side of their UFO
connection and expanded that

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.664 align:middle line:84%
to pretty much every government
secret you could ever imagine.

00:01:53.664 --> 00:01:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
your friends say

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.050 align:middle line:90%
when you started doing this?

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: It was
my secret other life.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.020 align:middle line:90%
There weren't really--

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.195 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They didn't even now?

00:01:59.195 --> 00:02:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: No.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was about 17 or 18
when NBC did a big expose

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.070 align:middle line:84%
on the Black Vault in a special
they did on Whitley Strieber's

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.560 align:middle line:90%
book "Confirmation."

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And that was probably the
thing that put me on the map,

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.480 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, where people said,
oh, look what John's doing.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.360 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.860 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't make any sense.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And some of the teachers
had a daily news article

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.260 align:middle line:84%
where my picture was in
the paper, stuff like that.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And that was it, I mean, that's
really what got me started.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And obviously then
my friends became

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.939 align:middle line:84%
aware of what my
secret other life was.

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:32.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you haven't
stopped, have you?

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.063 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: I haven't stopped.

00:02:34.063 --> 00:02:35.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm surprised.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, 2016 marks my
20th year doing this,

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.630 align:middle line:84%
and I never thought when
I was a 15-year-old kid

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.750 align:middle line:84%
and I started writing letters to
the CIA and the NSA and the FBI

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.530 align:middle line:84%
that 20 years after that
I would still be doing it

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.450 align:middle line:90%
and amassed 1.5 million pages.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.600 align:middle line:90%
I never thought that.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.590 align:middle line:90%
And yet here I am.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And that curiosity, which I
wish was a more exciting story--

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.400 align:middle line:84%
I've never had an experience
or never seen anything--

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.560 align:middle line:84%
that curiosity has
never gone away.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's just I
would say heightened

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.400 align:middle line:84%
and deepened over
the last 20 years.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've
gotten documents back

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.410 align:middle line:84%
under the Freedom of
Information Act that

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.017 align:middle line:90%
are blacked out, scratched out.

00:03:15.017 --> 00:03:16.850 align:middle line:84%
What did you think when
you would get those?

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.010 align:middle line:90%
What are they trying to hide?

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.135 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Well, it
makes you scratch your head.

00:03:20.135 --> 00:03:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Because you got to
keep in mind what

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.470 align:middle line:84%
the government wants you to
believe on the UFO phenomena.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And simply put, it's
easily explainable.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.330 align:middle line:84%
From 1947 to 1969,
they did their,

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.702 align:middle line:84%
quote unquote "investigation"
with Project Blue Book,

00:03:33.702 --> 00:03:36.160 align:middle line:84%
or what ultimately became the
umbrella name of Project Blue

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.960 align:middle line:90%
Book.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And out of 12,000-plus cases,
they felt that they could

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.610 align:middle line:84%
positively identify all of it,
and they weren't interested

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:45.960 align:middle line:90%
anymore after that.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.640 align:middle line:84%
So my key interest that
I kind of honed in on

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.930 align:middle line:84%
was that 1969 cutoff date,
the end of their investigation

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:53.980 align:middle line:90%
to date.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And to my surprise, there
were literally thousands

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.560 align:middle line:84%
and thousands of pages
that shouldn't exist.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.750 align:middle line:84%
This was a phenomenon
that was explainable,

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.330 align:middle line:84%
and yet, like you
just mentioned,

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.640 align:middle line:84%
you get these documents that are
classified, top secret, blacked

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.400 align:middle line:84%
out, in some cases blacked
out from top to bottom.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And these were
not prior to 1969.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.592 align:middle line:84%
These were decades after,
into the '80s, into the '90s,

00:04:14.592 --> 00:04:15.425 align:middle line:90%
even into the 2000s.

00:04:15.425 --> 00:04:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
try to hold them up

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.226 align:middle line:84%
to the light to see if you
could see through it and stuff

00:04:18.226 --> 00:04:18.380 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.046 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: I wish
it worked that way.

00:04:20.046 --> 00:04:23.580 align:middle line:84%
No, they're pretty wise when
they black everything out, I

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.550 align:middle line:84%
mean, they literally will
black everything out and then

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.710 align:middle line:84%
photocopy the blacks,
all that's on the page.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.876 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
gotten a document, John, that

00:04:30.876 --> 00:04:32.350 align:middle line:90%
was almost all blacked out?

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah, 100%.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're wondering,
why did I even get this?

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.756 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:04:34.756 --> 00:04:36.800 align:middle line:84%
Why did the poor tree get
cut down for this one?

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And not one or two pages--
there's been documents were it

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.740 align:middle line:84%
will be a 150-page document,
and I'll be excited,

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.190 align:middle line:84%
and I'll open it up, and
there's the letter that

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.600 align:middle line:84%
says Dear Mr.
Greenewald, this is

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.870 align:middle line:90%
the response to your request.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:47.745 align:middle line:90%
Here is the document.

00:04:47.745 --> 00:04:48.545 align:middle line:90%
You go, all right.

00:04:48.545 --> 00:04:49.470 align:middle line:90%
I got something.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And you go to the next page,
blacked out top to bottom,

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.750 align:middle line:84%
go to the next page, blacked
out top to bottom, and literally

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.380 align:middle line:90%
the entire document.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And so in those cases, you just
kind of scratch your head go,

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.050 align:middle line:84%
OK, guys, just say the
entire thing is exempt.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.759 align:middle line:84%
So it is rare for them to
black out an entire page,

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:05.800 align:middle line:90%
because they'll usually--

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.715 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's got to
be frustrating, John.

00:05:07.715 --> 00:05:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: It is frustrating.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.120 align:middle line:84%
But it makes me realize
there's something more.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's
why the curiosity in me

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.790 align:middle line:84%
is only deepened,
because you make

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.530 align:middle line:84%
those types of
discoveries, where

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.040 align:middle line:84%
this subject is classified at
the highest levels of secrecy.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.120 align:middle line:90%
That's documented.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.060 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
take my word for it

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.860 align:middle line:84%
or this whistleblower's
word for it.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.670 align:middle line:84%
That is documented in what
the government will give you,

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.090 align:middle line:84%
and that tells a
very scary story

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.096 align:middle line:84%
when you look at what
the government gives you,

00:05:36.096 --> 00:05:37.720 align:middle line:84%
because then the
wheels start turning--

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or what
they don't give you.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Well, that's
where the wheels start turning,

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.694 align:middle line:84%
and you go, well, if I can read
this document-- because there

00:05:43.694 --> 00:05:45.110 align:middle line:84%
are quite a few
that you can read.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
paint the picture

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.630 align:middle line:90%
that everything is blacked out.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.270 align:middle line:84%
But if you can read
certain documents,

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.390 align:middle line:84%
and they're amazing
to read, then you

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.010 align:middle line:84%
look at those blacked out ones
and go, what's under that?

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.630 align:middle line:90%
And that's what keeps me going.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Freedom
of Information Act

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.910 align:middle line:84%
was set up to help Americans
get information on issues that

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.130 align:middle line:90%
were going on in this country.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
what it really is.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.210 align:middle line:84%

the Freedom of Information Act,

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.814 align:middle line:90%
or FOIA, if you prefer.

00:06:11.814 --> 00:06:14.670 align:middle line:84%
FOIA, simply put,
allows the people

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.630 align:middle line:84%
of the commonwealth access to
all public records and access

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.420 align:middle line:84%

business is being conducted.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.760 align:middle line:90%
Seems simple enough.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.000 align:middle line:84%
But as a member of
a board of visitors,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.350 align:middle line:84%
there are a few things
we should review.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.750 align:middle line:90%
First, let's discuss meetings.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Seems like a simple
concept, right?

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:33.640 align:middle line:84%
You've no doubt attended
countless meetings

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.355 align:middle line:90%
in your professional career.

00:06:35.355 --> 00:06:37.930 align:middle line:84%
But as an appointed member
of a board of visitors

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.230 align:middle line:84%
for a public college
or university,

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.060 align:middle line:84%
the definition of
a public meeting

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.460 align:middle line:84%
may be different than
what you're familiar with.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.790 align:middle line:84%
You are now a public
servant and need

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:51.260 align:middle line:84%
to understand exactly what
constitutes a public meeting.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.850 align:middle line:90%
Here's how it works.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.470 align:middle line:84%
Any gathering of three or more
board members can be a meeting.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:00.100 align:middle line:84%
It can be face to face, over
the phone, or by means of video,

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.530 align:middle line:90%
like Skype.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And here's what
really trips people up

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.160 align:middle line:84%
who are not used to
being public servants.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.640 align:middle line:84%
It's not about the
location of a meeting.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.830 align:middle line:84%
It's only about the
content of the discussion.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.760 align:middle line:10%
FOIA applies when any assemblage
of three or more board members

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.290 align:middle line:10%
meet and discuss board
business, which is

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.911 align:middle line:10%
by definition public business.

00:07:21.911 --> 00:07:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, John, that was an
example of FOIA for meetings,

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.910 align:middle line:84%
for example and who's doing
what and who's saying what.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Your documents encompass all
kinds of things, don't they?

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.580 align:middle line:84%
The FOIA allows you to
get pretty much anything,

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.240 align:middle line:84%
not only textual records
or board meeting minutes,

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.870 align:middle line:90%
but also photographs, videos.

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.760 align:middle line:84%
You can essentially request
any federal document

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.620 align:middle line:84%
under the Freedom
of Information Act.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.949 align:middle line:84%
Now, simply put, the FOIA
allows you access to it,

00:07:48.949 --> 00:07:50.740 align:middle line:84%
doesn't always mean
you're going to get it.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.550 align:middle line:84%
So there's a certain
set of exemptions

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:56.860 align:middle line:84%
that if information fits
into one of these categories,

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.620 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, they will
redact it and black it out.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.310 align:middle line:84%
The most commonly is the
first exemption, which is B1.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.037 align:middle line:84%
That's National
security information.

00:08:05.037 --> 00:08:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the
easy one for them.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD:
That's the easy one.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.570 align:middle line:90%
Because what's the definition--

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:09.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Classified.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:09.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.926 align:middle line:90%
What's the definition of it?

00:08:10.926 --> 00:08:11.970 align:middle line:90%
And we don't know.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And when you get
UFO documents that

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.420 align:middle line:84%
are exempted for
B1, which means it's

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.210 align:middle line:84%
a threat to national security
if they were to tell you

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:21.850 align:middle line:84%
and I about it, that makes
you ask that question,

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.012 align:middle line:84%
like, well, what about the
planet Venus swamp gas--

00:08:24.012 --> 00:08:25.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are we missing?

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: --or Billy
Bob's hallucination?

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:29.530 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't make any sense.

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.240 align:middle line:90%
So what is classified about it?

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
that is something

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.743 align:middle line:84%
that's a very big,
fat question mark when

00:08:35.743 --> 00:08:37.409 align:middle line:84%
you deal with the
government, because we

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:38.640 align:middle line:90%
don't have an answer to it.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: From the moment you
send in a request, generally

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:43.669 align:middle line:84%
how long does it take
to get a response?

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Depends
on the agency.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.852 align:middle line:84%
By law, they have 10 business
days to give you a response.

00:08:47.852 --> 00:08:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, that doesn't
mean that they're

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:50.680 align:middle line:84%
going to give you the
document requested.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You just get something.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: They'll just say,
George, we got your request.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.510 align:middle line:90%
We're processing it.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Some cases it could take weeks
to a couple months, other cases

00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.560 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And in cases
you get nothing?

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Well, they
by law have to respond.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.020 align:middle line:84%
So if they give you like
literally no response

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.870 align:middle line:84%
whatsoever, you can
essentially appeal that

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.560 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, you
need to respond.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.727 align:middle line:84%
So generally they're pretty
good about responding.

00:09:12.727 --> 00:09:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't, again, mean that you're
going to get the information.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:18.360 align:middle line:84%
My record is over 15 years
for a document to come.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.318 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: I've only
been doing this for 20.

00:09:21.318 --> 00:09:24.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have to be
specific in your request?

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.799 align:middle line:84%
And if so, how do you
know what to ask for?

00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:28.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: It's a fine line.

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:31.210 align:middle line:84%
You have to figure out that--
you have to be specific

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:33.340 align:middle line:84%
enough so they know
what you're requesting,

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.710 align:middle line:84%
but not too specific,
because then you

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:38.910 align:middle line:84%
may be so specific you're
omitting certain material

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.212 align:middle line:90%
that you want.

00:09:40.212 --> 00:09:42.670 align:middle line:84%
But if you're too broad, they'll
tell you you're too broad,

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:44.200 align:middle line:90%
and they'll reject your request.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.420 align:middle line:84%
So you have to find
that little medium point

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:48.450 align:middle line:84%
to request what you're
requesting to make sure

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:51.580 align:middle line:84%
you get everything, but it's not
too broad where they reject it.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
know what to request?

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: That's
a great question.

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.480 align:middle line:90%
It's a paper trail.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, the only
way to really explain

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:01.839 align:middle line:84%
it is you take document
A, and you just

00:10:01.839 --> 00:10:04.130 align:middle line:84%
start seeing references to
other documents and reports.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
write that down.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:06.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:07.430 align:middle line:90%
You just keep going.

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:08.620 align:middle line:90%
And it branches off.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm telling you, the
amount of information

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:14.460 align:middle line:84%
that's there at our
fingertips is very powerful.

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:15.780 align:middle line:90%
And there is a lot there.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm a big advocate
for the FOIA working.

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.015 align:middle line:90%
I do, despite my frustrations--

00:10:20.015 --> 00:10:20.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You like it.

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:21.690 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: I do.

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think it gives the
public insight to what

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.290 align:middle line:90%
the government is doing.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.870 align:middle line:84%
I think the biggest
misconception about it

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:28.850 align:middle line:90%
is people dismiss it.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:31.477 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, if it's
important, you won't get it.

00:10:31.477 --> 00:10:33.310 align:middle line:84%
That's not necessarily
true, because there's

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:36.020 align:middle line:84%
been huge milestones
that have come out,

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.930 align:middle line:84%
not only with the UFO topic,
but even branching out

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:42.000 align:middle line:84%
from that with the use of the
Freedom of Information Act.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.370 align:middle line:90%
So I'm a big advocate for it.

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:45.661 align:middle line:84%
I encourage anybody, if you're
looking for information,

00:10:45.661 --> 00:10:47.950 align:middle line:84%
have fun with it,
give it a shot.

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:50.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yes, it may
involve a lot of patience

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.897 align:middle line:84%
and take some time, but
it's a process that works.

00:10:52.897 --> 00:10:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Try it out.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:54.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah, try it out.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:55.961 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been
the shortest request

00:10:55.961 --> 00:10:58.170 align:middle line:90%
time and the longest for you?

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:00.045 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: I'd
have to double check.

00:11:00.045 --> 00:11:01.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wouldn't want
to be quoted on this,

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.910 align:middle line:84%
but one of the quickest
responses I ever got--

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We won't tell anybody.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah,
Yeah, this isn't

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:06.860 align:middle line:90%
being recorded or anything.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:07.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.291 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: One of
the quickest responses

00:11:09.291 --> 00:11:11.590 align:middle line:84%
that I ever got to
a FBI FOIA request

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:13.920 align:middle line:90%
was for a request on myself.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And it has one of the quickest
responses that the FBI ever

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.380 align:middle line:84%
gave me, and they said
there's no records on you.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.210 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is what
you wanted to hear.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Well, let
me play devil's advocate.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Yes, because, well, I feel safer
because the government isn't

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:31.420 align:middle line:84%
watching me and surveilling my
phone and so on and so forth,

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.250 align:middle line:90%
or so they claim.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:36.340 align:middle line:84%
But I think to play
devil's advocate, what's

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:39.000 align:middle line:84%
scarier, though-- I
was 15 when I started.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.280 align:middle line:84%
20 years later, I've got 1.5
million pages of material

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.150 align:middle line:84%
on the internet that I give
away to the world for free.

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:48.890 align:middle line:84%
I would hope that that gets
somebody's interest just

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:50.960 align:middle line:84%
to make sure I'm not
doing anything wrong.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.865 align:middle line:90%
I'm not.

00:11:51.865 --> 00:11:54.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm an open book, and I
do everything legally.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.240 align:middle line:84%
But I'm a patriot at heart,
and I would want the government

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.610 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that people
that may be up to no good,

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:04.330 align:middle line:84%
not in my case, but in
other cases, that they're

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:05.130 align:middle line:90%
watching that.

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a little scary
that they don't care that all

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:11.320 align:middle line:90%
these documents are out there.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.832 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe
they already know.

00:12:13.832 --> 00:12:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they already
know who's doing what.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Maybe.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what's been
the longest request, again?

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Over 15 years.

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:21.400 align:middle line:84%
It took 15 years
to get a response?

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah, to
get the actual document.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.394 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What were you looking
for that took 15 years?

00:12:27.394 --> 00:12:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: It was
a classified report

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:29.890 align:middle line:90%
from the '60s.

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:32.700 align:middle line:84%
It was on aviation, and
I'm a big history buff.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.540 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't a
UFO-related document,

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:38.240 align:middle line:84%
but it really kind of showed
you how long you have to wait.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And I did an article about
this and published it,

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.940 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't about the
information that was received.

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.220 align:middle line:84%
It was about what
happened on the planet

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.232 align:middle line:84%
while I was waiting for
this document to come.

00:12:47.232 --> 00:12:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everything happened.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.055 align:middle line:84%
I mean, 15 years is
a long, long time.

00:12:51.055 --> 00:12:52.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The world changed.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: So I talked about
the different presidential

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.480 align:middle line:84%
administrations and
what laws were passed

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:56.980 align:middle line:84%
and this, that, and
the other thing,

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.210 align:middle line:84%
and I kind of made an
article of about profiling

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:02.060 align:middle line:84%
that 15-year wait for
that one document to come.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
investigated and requested

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:06.590 align:middle line:90%
info on the JFK assassination?

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:07.840 align:middle line:90%
And did you get anything back?

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:08.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.880 align:middle line:84%
There's been amazing
researchers out there

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.310 align:middle line:90%
that have really tackled that.

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:14.290 align:middle line:84%
I have sent out
requests about it.

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:15.420 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing how--

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jim Marrs
being one of them.

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Jim
Marrs, yeah, who I've

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:18.670 align:middle line:90%
known for many, many years.

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.490 align:middle line:90%
So he's done amazing work.

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:24.380 align:middle line:84%
So I wouldn't say that it's one
of my number-one focal points,

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.180 align:middle line:84%
but when you do look
at the documents,

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.340 align:middle line:84%
and I have done quite a
few requests about it,

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.980 align:middle line:84%
it is amazing how much
is still classified.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And one of the angles that I've
been requesting a lot lately

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.460 align:middle line:84%
and putting it on
the black vault

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.850 align:middle line:84%
is the Mob connection
and all of that.

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:40.160 align:middle line:90%
And like I said--

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
something deep there.

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:42.710 align:middle line:90%
And you can tell.

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:45.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even after
decades and decades

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:47.340 align:middle line:84%
since this has
happened, this is still

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.170 align:middle line:84%
heavily classified
topic on something

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:51.610 align:middle line:90%
that's just a "conspiracy."

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John, do you
sometimes wonder, oh, boy, I

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:56.440 align:middle line:84%
think I'm pushing
a little too much,

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm going a little too far?

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: I've
worried a little bit.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:04.010 align:middle line:84%
I told myself when I was
young, don't get paranoid,

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:07.130 align:middle line:84%
because that paranoia
can take over you.

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen it in the field,
and it's an unfortunate thing.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.950 align:middle line:84%
So I never want to go that
way that I'm pushing too hard

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:15.179 align:middle line:90%
or I've pushed a button.

00:14:15.179 --> 00:14:17.220 align:middle line:84%
But there's been a couple
times where I kind of--

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm sure you
have stepped on toes.

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:19.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: --have
thought, like,

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.047 align:middle line:84%
maybe this is something that I'm
pushing a little bit too hard

00:14:22.047 --> 00:14:23.880 align:middle line:84%
for, and I don't want
to know the answer to.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:24.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.200 align:middle line:84%
You had mentioned
Project Blue Book.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I
remember it was headed up

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:32.120 align:middle line:84%
by the consultant Dr. J.
Allen Hynek, who's no longer

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.600 align:middle line:84%
with us, whose claim to
fame while he was part

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:39.790 align:middle line:84%
of the project was, of course,
swamp gas out of Michigan,

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:42.370 align:middle line:84%
which haunted him for
the rest of his career.

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:45.700 align:middle line:84%
But what was so
amazing about Hynek

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.850 align:middle line:84%
was that he eventually
changed his tune.

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he always was a believer
in extraterrestrials and UFOs,

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:55.590 align:middle line:84%
but you didn't know that when
he was heading up Project Blue

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:56.390 align:middle line:90%
Book.

00:14:56.390 --> 00:15:00.020 align:middle line:84%
But when he got out of
the project, he changed.

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.570 align:middle line:84%
Or he went public, and
he became a believer.

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:07.440 align:middle line:84%
But Project Blue Book is an
amazing story all by itself.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:14.670 align:middle line:90%


00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:16.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NARRATOR: Here are the facts.

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:18.630 align:middle line:84%
After World War II,
the United States

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:21.060 align:middle line:84%
was plagued with reports
of Unidentified Flying

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.060 align:middle line:90%
Objects, or UFOs.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.600 align:middle line:84%
In 1951, more Americans
reported UFO sightings

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.030 align:middle line:84%
than at any point
in American history.

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.330 align:middle line:84%
The public demanded
an explanation.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Oddly enough, the
Air Force obliged.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:36.280 align:middle line:84%
The first investigations
began in 1946.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And by 1947, Project
Sign was born.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.770 align:middle line:84%
In 1948, the study reached
inconclusive results

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:45.350 align:middle line:84%
but stated that UFOs
were real and most likely

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:46.910 align:middle line:90%
not made on Earth.

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:48.910 align:middle line:10%
The project was dismantled,
and the Air Force

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:51.480 align:middle line:10%
created Project Grudge,
which was specifically

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.830 align:middle line:10%
designed to disprove the
conclusions of Project Sign.

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:57.380 align:middle line:84%
Project Grudge attributed
most UFO sightings

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:01.220 align:middle line:84%
to misinterpretation, hysteria,
or other mundane causes.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:04.870 align:middle line:84%
However, it still could not
explain 23% of the sightings.

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Within a year, Project
Grudge folded and was

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.020 align:middle line:90%
replaced by Project Blue Book.

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:12.410 align:middle line:84%
Project Blue Book ran from
1948 through the '60s,

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:15.160 align:middle line:84%
and its results are still a
subject of intense debate.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.030 align:middle line:84%
Were the official
results correct?

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Wee most of these UFO
sightings easily explained

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:22.000 align:middle line:84%
as mass hysteria, freak
weather phenomenon,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.480 align:middle line:90%
or mistaken observers?

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Or was it, as some
conspiracy theorists believe,

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.810 align:middle line:90%
a smokescreen?

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.759 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John, was Project
Blue Book a smokescreen?

00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: I definitely
would lean on the side

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.410 align:middle line:84%
that it was more
of an explanation

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:36.960 align:middle line:90%
than an investigation.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:40.850 align:middle line:84%
I think that the biggest
problem during that era

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:42.840 align:middle line:84%
were the people itself,
the general public,

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.450 align:middle line:90%
because people were afraid.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And there was
panic, because there

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:49.220 align:middle line:84%
were these objects that were
seen that weren't explainable.

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:52.020 align:middle line:84%
There's documented proof that
some of the more important UFO

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:55.219 align:middle line:84%
sightings were funneled outside
of the Blue Book system.

00:16:55.219 --> 00:16:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They didn't put it in.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:57.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: No.

00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:00.350 align:middle line:84%
So you look at the
statistic, well, only 701

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:03.220 align:middle line:84%
in the grander scheme
of over 12,000 sightings

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.650 align:middle line:90%
remained unidentified.

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:07.859 align:middle line:84%
Well, that statistic
isn't true, because using

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:10.180 align:middle line:84%
their own documents,
we can prove

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:13.930 align:middle line:84%
that the more
important UFO files

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.439 align:middle line:90%
were funneled somewhere else.

00:17:15.439 --> 00:17:17.230 align:middle line:84%
So the question mark
is, where did they go?

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did the project end,
or did it go under wraps?

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Well,
this is my kind

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:27.700 align:middle line:84%
of focal point of my research
on what happened after 1969.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And intelligence
records show when

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:31.373 align:middle line:84%
you deal with the
Defense Intelligence

00:17:31.373 --> 00:17:33.260 align:middle line:84%
Agency, the National
Security Agency,

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:37.520 align:middle line:84%
that UFO information was
compiled well after 1969.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's important, because
obviously it wasn't case

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.000 align:middle line:90%
closed.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.690 align:middle line:84%
This was not an
investigation where

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:46.040 align:middle line:84%
they had some kind of
conclusion and that was it.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:46.470 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:48.178 align:middle line:84%
Why would all these
intelligence agencies

00:17:48.178 --> 00:17:51.990 align:middle line:84%
care about UFO records that were
happening all over the world,

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:54.930 align:middle line:84%
not only just here in
America, but everywhere?

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And so when you look at
those thousands of pages,

00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.590 align:middle line:90%
they shouldn't exist.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Those are some of the most
heavily classified ones.

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Those are the ones that
are the most blacked out

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.700 align:middle line:84%
out of all of the UFO
information out there.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.900 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's starting
to paint this picture

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.170 align:middle line:84%
and add to the story,
that, number one, they

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:13.050 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't exist at all.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.720 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that they do and
they're the most classified,

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.880 align:middle line:90%
that tells us something.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something's going on.

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Mhm.

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dr. Hynek
changed his tune.

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:24.250 align:middle line:84%
He became a believer,
a big believer,

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:27.830 align:middle line:84%
set up his own
organization in Chicago.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:30.170 align:middle line:90%
I wish he were still with us.

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:32.260 align:middle line:84%
What happened to him,
John, in your opinion?

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Why did he change from a
disbeliever to a believer?

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: In my opinion,
it has to be what he saw.

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:42.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, from what I
understand from kind of UFO

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.950 align:middle line:84%
legend is the Socorro landing
was one of the ones that

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:47.530 align:middle line:90%
made him more of a versus the--

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:49.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the one in
New Mexico, where a police

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:52.990 align:middle line:84%
officer saw an
object and a couple

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:56.090 align:middle line:84%
occupants scurrying
around, and then they

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:57.247 align:middle line:90%
got back in and took off.

00:18:57.247 --> 00:18:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Right.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that, here
we are many, many years later,

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:03.850 align:middle line:90%
we have no explanation for.

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:07.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I thought originally
that he may have witnessed

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:11.190 align:middle line:84%
a test of the moon lander,
and that it landed,

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.240 align:middle line:84%
occupants got out,
it took off again.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.874 align:middle line:84%
But then I kind
of threw that out.

00:19:14.874 --> 00:19:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: It's
a great theory.

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:18.415 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's
one that, out of everything

00:19:18.415 --> 00:19:20.831 align:middle line:84%
that I've heard, is the only
one that really kind of holds

00:19:20.831 --> 00:19:21.670 align:middle line:90%
water.

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:23.590 align:middle line:84%
But I would think
that there's nothing

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:25.720 align:middle line:84%
really classified
about the lunar landing

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.520 align:middle line:84%
missions anymore, so
if that was a test

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.740 align:middle line:90%
and this has been something--

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:30.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell us.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:31.620 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Exactly.

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.520 align:middle line:84%
The government has
an opportunity here

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.200 align:middle line:84%
to just say, hey,
look, 30 years ago

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:40.004 align:middle line:84%
when there were a lot of
news stories about this,

00:19:40.004 --> 00:19:42.170 align:middle line:84%
it was something that we
wanted to keep a little bit

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:43.010 align:middle line:90%
more secret.

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Now here we are in
the 21st century.

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's just go ahead
and release it.

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:50.290 align:middle line:84%
So they have an opportunity
to kind of squash this,

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:51.430 align:middle line:90%
and they never have.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:52.980 align:middle line:90%
They've never been able to.

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:57.740 align:middle line:84%
So let's just dismiss all
12,000-plus cases except that

00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:01.090 align:middle line:84%
one, and I think that that's
probably what Hynek saw

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:03.520 align:middle line:84%
as there's something
more to this.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this wasn't a farmer
in the middle of Kansas,

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:07.450 align:middle line:84%
not that there's anything wrong
with those types of sightings.

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, because they see
a lot of things in Kansas.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.283 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: They
see a lot of stuff.

00:20:10.283 --> 00:20:12.120 align:middle line:84%
But this was a police
officer in New Mexico,

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.220 align:middle line:84%
obviously reputable
in the community,

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.980 align:middle line:84%
who saw something that
was far beyond what

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.710 align:middle line:90%
most UFO observers see.

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He never
changed his story.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.590 align:middle line:90%
We lost him a few years ago.

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:22.390 align:middle line:90%
He died.

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:25.161 align:middle line:84%
But he stayed pretty pat
on what he says he saw.

00:20:25.161 --> 00:20:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah, and
the documents are there.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.479 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're something you
can get from the government

00:20:30.479 --> 00:20:32.020 align:middle line:84%
under the Freedom
of Information Act.

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:33.190 align:middle line:84%
Those files have
been declassified.

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:34.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they in the Vault

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:36.131 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah,
the Socorro stuff

00:20:36.131 --> 00:20:37.820 align:middle line:90%
is definitely in the Vault.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.111 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's an amazing story.

00:20:39.111 --> 00:20:41.870 align:middle line:84%
How come we don't get those
kinds of stories anymore, John?

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:44.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't hear them
like we used to,

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:49.470 align:middle line:84%
the landings, the
indentations, the witnesses.

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:52.890 align:middle line:84%
We don't seem to
have that anymore.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:53.780 align:middle line:90%
Something's changed.

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah, and it's
the internet, I hate to say it.

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:59.560 align:middle line:84%
What is the most powerful
tool and something

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.680 align:middle line:84%
that I love dearly is also,
I think, the biggest threat

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:05.575 align:middle line:84%
to the subject, because I
call it the hunt for virality.

00:21:05.575 --> 00:21:09.070 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people out there,
they want the next viral video.

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:12.550 align:middle line:84%
They want the 2 million, 5
million, 10 million hits.

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And what better way to
get that than a UFO video?

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's been proven
time and time again,

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:20.050 align:middle line:84%
and we see hoax after
hoax after hoax.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:20.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, they make them up.

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Why haven't
we seen cases like this?

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:24.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:26.360 align:middle line:84%
I think that
probably there is now

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:30.100 align:middle line:84%
such an aura around this field
that the majority of stuff

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.600 align:middle line:90%
out there is hoaxed.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.884 align:middle line:84%
And I probably safely
say the majority

00:21:33.884 --> 00:21:35.550 align:middle line:84%
of the stuff that's
out there is hoaxed.

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In those days, the old
days, we didn't have Photoshop.

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:41.560 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have the ability
to doctor up prints.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:42.970 align:middle line:84%
There are some
incredible photos.

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:43.886 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Exactly.

00:21:43.886 --> 00:21:45.940 align:middle line:84%
You had the photos and
in some cases videos,

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.090 align:middle line:90%
and you had testimony.

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And this was not something
that was because they

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.470 align:middle line:90%
wanted the next viral hit.

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:52.680 align:middle line:90%
The internet wasn't around.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:56.620 align:middle line:84%
So you had a much different
level of legitimacy

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.120 align:middle line:84%
to a lot of those
types of cases.

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:01.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you get photographs
in Freedom of Information Act

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.010 align:middle line:90%
requests or just copy?

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: No, just copy.

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:07.370 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the stuff,
when you do photographs,

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:09.490 align:middle line:84%
it's like a 12th
generation photocopies.

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:10.290 align:middle line:90%
It's ridiculous.

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:11.036 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't see anything.

00:22:11.036 --> 00:22:11.836 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:22:11.836 --> 00:22:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a photocopy of
a photocopy of a photocopy.

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases
with the CIA, they

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:20.140 align:middle line:84%
had some obvious photos
of I'm not sure what.

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:23.890 align:middle line:84%
It was connected to a flying
saucer case in Denmark.

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And there was a file folder
of a bunch of photographs.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.310 align:middle line:84%
But again, like these
12th generation copies.

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And when you request real,
actual photographs, which

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:37.075 align:middle line:84%
you can do under the FOIA, they
stamp these things, Best Copy

00:22:37.075 --> 00:22:39.200 align:middle line:84%
Available, and then they
just send you these 12th--

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Send you
the worst they can.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Exactly.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:42.110 align:middle line:90%
So, come on.

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:44.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, does it seem
logical that they just

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:46.750 align:middle line:84%
have a stack of this
intelligence that's

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.410 align:middle line:90%
12th generation photocopies?

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:50.990 align:middle line:84%
Or they probably have
the originals somewhere.

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The fact
that Hynek became

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:55.847 align:middle line:84%
a believer, what does that tell
you about the field of Ufology?

00:22:55.847 --> 00:22:57.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: There's
something there.

00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:58.230 align:middle line:90%
There really is.

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's what keeps me
going and people like me going

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:04.960 align:middle line:84%
to try and figure out and keep
pushing to that disclosure,

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.760 align:middle line:90%
I guess.

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:06.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To get the truth.

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah,
to get the truth.

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Whether that is that
disclosure of the government

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:12.620 align:middle line:84%
finally admitting something
or what, it doesn't matter.

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.850 align:middle line:90%
But we have to work together.

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:17.320 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, disclosure
is on our side.

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not on the
government's side.

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:22.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm not popular with saying
that I do not believe disclosure

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.720 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that
people want it to happen

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.560 align:middle line:84%
or the president of
the United States.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:28.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree with you.

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:31.590 align:middle line:84%
I go at it with Steve Bassett
all the time about this.

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:34.320 align:middle line:84%
I say, Steve, it's just not
gonna happen, not that way.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:34.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:35.410 align:middle line:90%
And I love Steve.

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:36.800 align:middle line:84%
I've been friends with
him for a long time.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.200 align:middle line:84%
But I know he hates
me when I say it,

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.360 align:middle line:84%
because he doesn't want the
negative energy out there.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:40.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:42.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: And
I don't blame him.

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:44.710 align:middle line:84%
He's done amazing advocacy
work to try and get

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:45.895 align:middle line:90%
this issue to the forefront.

00:23:45.895 --> 00:23:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:46.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: But
in the same respect,

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:49.036 align:middle line:84%
I just don't think
it's going to happen.

00:23:49.036 --> 00:23:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Even if Hillary's elected,
even if John Podesta leads

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:54.750 align:middle line:90%
the charge, I'll tell you why.

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:57.604 align:middle line:84%
Even if she wanted to release
information, she can't.

00:23:57.604 --> 00:23:58.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They get her.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: And have
the documented evidence

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:03.960 align:middle line:84%
to show that the National
Security Agency and the Defense

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence Agency
has mysteriously

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:08.100 align:middle line:90%
"lost" all of their UFO files.

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Poof.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Now, they've
released the blacked out one.

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:13.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: And
under the FOIA you

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.620 align:middle line:84%
can request what's called
a mandatory classification

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:16.420 align:middle line:90%
review.

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:18.660 align:middle line:84%
In essence, what's
classified in 1980

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:21.580 align:middle line:84%
may not necessarily
be classified in 2016.

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:23.920 align:middle line:84%
So you can go and ask
them to re-review it.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And in both of
those agency cases,

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:28.380 align:middle line:84%
separated by about
12 to 16 months,

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:31.790 align:middle line:84%
I think, they both told
me two separate times,

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:33.150 align:middle line:90%
we've lost everything.

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You believe that?

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:35.110 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:36.276 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Of course not.

00:24:36.276 --> 00:24:38.170 align:middle line:90%
But how convenient.

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:41.760 align:middle line:84%
So now all we have is
a stack of classified,

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.680 align:middle line:84%
but blacked out, but
obviously classified

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:46.500 align:middle line:84%
UFO material, those pages
that shouldn't exist.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.054 align:middle line:90%
That's all one in the same.

00:24:48.054 --> 00:24:49.720 align:middle line:84%
So you've got this
stack of information,

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.590 align:middle line:84%
and you say, OK,
government, you released

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:53.044 align:middle line:90%
these 10, 15, 20 years ago.

00:24:53.044 --> 00:24:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Let's go ahead and
review them, maybe we

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:56.810 align:middle line:84%
can get some of this
information out.

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:58.710 align:middle line:90%
And they go, oh, sorry.

00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:59.510 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, John.

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They still won't do it.

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:01.476 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah,
we've nothing.

00:25:01.476 --> 00:25:03.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The person
or persons who

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:07.300 align:middle line:84%
are compiling this information,
before they send it out

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:10.120 align:middle line:84%
to people like you,
wouldn't you love

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.910 align:middle line:84%
to be a fly on their
shoulder to see

00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:15.020 align:middle line:90%
what they're really reading?

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:16.010 align:middle line:90%
It's got to be amazing.

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:16.355 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:25:16.355 --> 00:25:18.930 align:middle line:84%
No, if they would hire me, I
think I'd apply for that job.

00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:20.970 align:middle line:84%
But I'm probably on the
number one blacklist.

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:21.928 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You'd leak it.

00:25:21.928 --> 00:25:23.650 align:middle line:90%
You'd become an Edward Snowden.

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:24.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: No.

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:26.090 align:middle line:90%
I'll say I wouldn't do that.

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Come on.

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:27.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: But I'm curious.

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:29.456 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You wouldn't
call up "Coast to Coast"

00:25:29.456 --> 00:25:32.820 align:middle line:84%
and say, George, this incredible
case that I'm looking at,

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:34.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking at it right here.

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:36.208 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: All right,
I'd call you about it.

00:25:36.208 --> 00:25:38.240 align:middle line:84%
But, no, I would
love, like you said,

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.360 align:middle line:90%
to be the fly on the wall.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.940 align:middle line:84%
But some secrets
just have to be kept.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the
day and joking aside,

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:48.640 align:middle line:84%
I think that whatever is
about this topic we can prove

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.600 align:middle line:84%
beyond any shadow of a
doubt, it is something

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.174 align:middle line:84%
that is heavily
classified and is

00:25:52.174 --> 00:25:54.590 align:middle line:84%
an obvious threat to national
security if they release it.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:55.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.498 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: That's the
big, fat question mark

00:25:57.498 --> 00:25:58.350 align:middle line:90%
that I can't answer.

00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:59.891 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is something
happening to us

00:25:59.891 --> 00:26:02.170 align:middle line:90%
as people by these inhabitants?

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:03.890 align:middle line:90%
Is that the scary thing?

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Because would they
be concerned, John,

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:10.710 align:middle line:84%
about this incredible
technology, free energy?

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:12.880 align:middle line:90%
That's a possibility, too.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.680 align:middle line:84%
But there's something
else more sinister

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:17.630 align:middle line:84%
going on here that they
don't want us to know,

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:19.262 align:middle line:90%
and they're afraid of panic.

00:26:19.262 --> 00:26:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah,
it's the panic.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:25.484 align:middle line:84%
And I honestly-- and there's two
ways that I kind of look at it.

00:26:25.484 --> 00:26:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Number one, you
do have the panic.

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.483 align:middle line:84%
So if they do know
something, and they

00:26:28.483 --> 00:26:32.030 align:middle line:84%
were to release it, people
that are watching this program,

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:35.580 align:middle line:84%
yourself, myself, we'd
probably handle it just fine.

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:38.020 align:middle line:90%
We'd say, aha, we were right.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:41.139 align:middle line:84%
We had a mission, and we
went for it, and we get it.

00:26:41.139 --> 00:26:43.680 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of percentage
of people out there that just

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.480 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And it would challenge
how they were raised,

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:49.320 align:middle line:84%
challenge their religion,
challenge their morality,

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.630 align:middle line:90%
challenge everything.

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:53.800 align:middle line:84%
In that same respect, I think
there's a huge possibility

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.070 align:middle line:84%
that the government
just doesn't know.

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And that in itself I think
plays into that panic.

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Because if the US
government is like--

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:02.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or they're helpless.

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:02.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:03.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're helping.

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:04.050 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Helpless.

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:05.360 align:middle line:90%
They're not number one anymore.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The brave men
that were at the Alamo

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:09.850 align:middle line:90%
knew that they were doomed.

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:12.320 align:middle line:90%
They knew they were outnumbered.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.060 align:middle line:84%
They were hoping against
hope that reinforcements

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:19.810 align:middle line:84%
would get to them before
Santa Anna's army got to them.

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:21.360 align:middle line:90%
That didn't happen.

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:25.520 align:middle line:84%
But they were there because
they knew they had an out,

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:28.180 align:middle line:84%
and they were fighting
for something.

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Is it conceivable that the
government knows something

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:36.480 align:middle line:84%
so horrendous about the
extraterrestrial presence that

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.820 align:middle line:84%
they know they cannot tell
us, they cannot fight for us?

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:41.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: It's
quite possible.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And this leads into a huge,
huge, huge debate on let's get

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.130 align:middle line:84%
beyond the debate on
intelligent life out.

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:49.930 align:middle line:90%
They're out there.

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:51.930 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we take the next
step, and they're here.

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:52.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Why are they here?

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.158 align:middle line:90%
What are they here for?

00:27:54.158 --> 00:27:56.207 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: David Jacob
says it's not good.

00:27:56.207 --> 00:27:58.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: And you do have a
lot of those types of stories.

00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:01.880 align:middle line:84%
Not one or two, but hundreds,
if not arguably thousands

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.210 align:middle line:84%
of abduction cases
that are obviously

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:07.026 align:middle line:84%
something that is very
traumatic and scary for those

00:28:07.026 --> 00:28:07.900 align:middle line:90%
that went through it.

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the
testing of people,

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:11.580 align:middle line:90%
doing things against your will.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:12.840 align:middle line:90%
To me, it's kidnapping.

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:13.640 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And so if the government
ever were to say,

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:19.220 align:middle line:84%
well, we believe that there is a
connection to extraterrestrials

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:23.200 align:middle line:84%
but we don't know,
imagine that reaction.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Because all of a sudden, all
those abduction cases, which,

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:30.330 align:middle line:84%
again, present company excluded,
a lot of the public would say,

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:31.250 align:middle line:90%
oh, they're crazy.

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:33.180 align:middle line:90%
That didn't happen to them.

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:37.560 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, now that just
pretty much becomes gospel.

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:39.432 align:middle line:84%
Those cases now
probably happened

00:28:39.432 --> 00:28:40.890 align:middle line:84%
if that type of
admission came out.

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think would
happen if the government said,

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:48.510 align:middle line:84%
people are being abducted,
they're not being returned,

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:50.890 align:middle line:84%
and we can't do
anything about it.

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:51.691 align:middle line:90%
We can't stop this.

00:28:51.691 --> 00:28:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah, I think
you would have that panic.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:55.010 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Because-- I love to
do public speaking.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And when I ask the
audiences, how many of you

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.030 align:middle line:84%
have heard of the
Heaven's Gate cult?

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And everybody raises
their hand, or at least

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.320 align:middle line:90%
the majority of people.

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And I go, OK, put
your hands down.

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:10.680 align:middle line:84%
How many heard of the
Heaven's Gate cult

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.660 align:middle line:90%
before they killed themselves?

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:14.740 align:middle line:90%
And like pretty much nobody.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And my point with that is
you have these little groups,

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:19.840 align:middle line:84%
sometimes bigger
groups, that have

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.620 align:middle line:90%
these very radical beliefs.

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And so when you start
to cross that line

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:29.420 align:middle line:84%
and you erase the cover-up
and you erase that line,

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:31.876 align:middle line:84%
and now all of a sudden the
government's admitting it,

00:29:31.876 --> 00:29:33.750 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see
those types of groups pop

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:36.820 align:middle line:84%
up from where you
would never expect.

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that, then you
have major world religions

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:42.490 align:middle line:84%
which would definitely
be challenged.

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:44.200 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like some
of them are starting

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.980 align:middle line:84%
to make adjustments
a little bit,

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.830 align:middle line:84%
because as science
expands, there's

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:50.370 align:middle line:84%
going to be that day where
we find out we're not alone.

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:51.170 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm sorry.

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:54.262 align:middle line:84%
I know I don't have the
scientific proof of that.

00:29:54.262 --> 00:29:55.970 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's going
to be science that

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:57.546 align:middle line:90%
really ultimately shows us.

00:29:57.546 --> 00:29:59.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got some
e-mails here for you, John.

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:00.745 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you a few.

00:30:00.745 --> 00:30:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Ketty from Michigan, do
you feel that the Freedom

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.410 align:middle line:84%
of Information Act
is being upheld

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:07.439 align:middle line:90%
to the degree it was designed?

00:30:07.439 --> 00:30:08.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: I
think it's definitely

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:13.690 align:middle line:84%
morphed over the years, in some
ways good, in some ways bad.

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:16.960 align:middle line:84%
The digital age
wasn't quite what

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:20.300 align:middle line:84%
it was when the FOIA was
passed versus what it is now.

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:25.820 align:middle line:84%
So in the government's defense,
you have a much easier way

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:26.970 align:middle line:90%
to submit FOIAs.

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:29.100 align:middle line:84%
So even though I'm a
big advocate for it--

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:30.337 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is there a form?

00:30:30.337 --> 00:30:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: You could
just write a letter.

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:32.970 align:middle line:90%
I made my own.

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:35.139 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's just a
very simple process.

00:30:35.139 --> 00:30:36.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To be specific, right?

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:36.690 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Just say it's a
request under the FOIA.

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:41.540 align:middle line:84%
There's a couple fee categories
that you have to figure out

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.440 align:middle line:90%
what you fit into.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.870 align:middle line:84%
But in essence, they're
pretty good at helping you.

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:47.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like
if you do it wrong,

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:50.000 align:middle line:84%
they're just gonna
like shun you.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.840 align:middle line:84%
In their defense, they do a lot
of work to try and help you.

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Because I do think
that they're trying.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
have to pay them?

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.197 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: In
some cases, you do.

00:30:59.197 --> 00:31:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're making
money on this stuff.

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:03.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Well, they
claim it covers costs.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:06.970 align:middle line:84%
The CIA is one of the ones
that gives me the hardest time.

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:10.470 align:middle line:84%
They want me to write a
check for $300 every time

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:13.810 align:middle line:84%
I write them a FOIA request
just to search for records,

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:15.750 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not guaranteed anything.

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And no other agency
does that tactic.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that in
this day and age, that was not

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:24.850 align:middle line:90%
how this bill was passed.

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And back to that
e-mail's question,

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:31.860 align:middle line:84%
I think the FOIA's
not something that

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:35.050 align:middle line:84%
should be for somebody
who has $300 to spend

00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:36.479 align:middle line:90%
every time they write a letter.

00:31:36.479 --> 00:31:38.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, granted that's
not a ton of money--

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It adds up.

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:40.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: But when you're
asking for information,

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:41.650 align:middle line:90%
it adds up very, very quickly.

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:43.414 align:middle line:84%
And you're not even
guaranteed anything.

00:31:43.414 --> 00:31:45.830 align:middle line:84%
So they want $300, and then
they say, well, sorry, George.

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:47.610 align:middle line:90%
We looked, but we found nothing.

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:48.870 align:middle line:90%
Well, you're out $300 now.

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:49.900 align:middle line:90%
Next?

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.019 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make sense.

00:31:51.019 --> 00:31:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Next e-mail is
in from someone you know,

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:54.770 align:middle line:90%
John Greenewald, Sr.

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:55.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yes, Dad.

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:59.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he simply
says, why have you stayed

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:03.630 align:middle line:90%
so devoted to what you do?

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:06.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Him and mom have
been, I think, my biggest fans.

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:08.714 align:middle line:90%
Dad-- I can say this.

00:32:08.714 --> 00:32:10.880 align:middle line:84%
He'll kind of cringe, but
he worked for a government

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:14.176 align:middle line:84%
contractor and worked on
the SSME, the main engine

00:32:14.176 --> 00:32:15.050 align:middle line:90%
of the space shuttle.

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:17.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of in my blood to
love all this type of stuff.

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:19.774 align:middle line:84%
And he saw at a
young age-- I think

00:32:19.774 --> 00:32:22.190 align:middle line:84%
he wanted me to hit the history
books and the school books

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:25.000 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more versus
filing FOIA requests.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote my first book
at 18 and stuff like that.

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:30.980 align:middle line:84%
So I think he wanted me a little
bit more heavier in school,

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:35.630 align:middle line:84%
but just kind of thought, OK,
this is what he wants to do.

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:38.720 align:middle line:84%
To his question, he's seen
me get challenged more

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.180 align:middle line:90%
than anybody.

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there's
a lot I don't publish,

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:46.690 align:middle line:84%
not for any other reason
other than it's just

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:49.070 align:middle line:84%
my personal journey
of trying to fight

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:51.100 align:middle line:90%
to get these documents out.

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:54.170 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't care
what took six years to get

00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:55.640 align:middle line:90%
and how much of a struggle--

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do.

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:58.731 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: But I do because
I went through it, where

00:32:58.731 --> 00:33:01.020 align:middle line:84%
others-- and I love this
aspect of the Black Vault--

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:02.850 align:middle line:84%
where others then can
download something

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:08.000 align:middle line:84%
like that that took me 6 or
10 or even 15 years to get.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.620 align:middle line:90%
So why have I not given up?

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:15.214 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's those types of
reasons that keep me going.

00:33:15.214 --> 00:33:16.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chris from
Kansas City, can you

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:20.360 align:middle line:84%
tell us the true story
of Operation High Jump?

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:21.160 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yes.

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.076 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:33:22.076 --> 00:33:25.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: That's a
very interesting project.

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:29.920 align:middle line:84%
I had discovered a
handwritten in German letter

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.710 align:middle line:84%
that was sent to a high-up
military officer in the Army

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:34.260 align:middle line:90%
in 1947.

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And the short of it
was that Adolf Hitler

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:38.170 align:middle line:90%
was alive and well--

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:39.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I believe that.

00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: --that
he was carted off

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.290 align:middle line:84%
in a specially
designed U-boat, he

00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:48.330 align:middle line:84%
was off the coast of Antarctica,
he had achieved the hard water

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:51.290 align:middle line:84%
to get a nuclear
weapon and put it

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:53.730 align:middle line:84%
on some V2s that were
aimed at England and all

00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:55.520 align:middle line:90%
these other key targets.

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.830 align:middle line:90%
And so this letter is amazing.

00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:59.640 align:middle line:84%
Shortly after this
letter was written,

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:03.490 align:middle line:84%
Operation High Jump was one of
the biggest Naval assemblies

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:05.650 align:middle line:90%
the United States has ever done.

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:07.210 align:middle line:90%
And they went to Antarctica.

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:07.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To get him

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:08.925 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: And
they just threw

00:34:08.925 --> 00:34:11.840 align:middle line:84%
all of their
weaponry down there.

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:15.380 align:middle line:84%
The public story is it
was a training exercise.

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:17.429 align:middle line:84%
Now, anybody who
reads "The Art of War"

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:19.560 align:middle line:84%
knows military
strategy is you don't

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:23.420 align:middle line:84%
take all of your chess pieces
and move them all over.

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:24.389 align:middle line:90%
Because what happens?

00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:25.520 align:middle line:90%
You're vulnerable.

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:29.429 align:middle line:84%
And yet during High Jump, that's
kind of the big conspiracy

00:34:29.429 --> 00:34:31.360 align:middle line:84%
and kind of question
mark about it,

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.850 align:middle line:84%
is why would you take
almost everything that you

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:35.766 align:middle line:90%
have and just put it down to--

00:34:35.766 --> 00:34:36.765 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just go for it.

00:34:36.765 --> 00:34:37.565 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:34:37.565 --> 00:34:38.880 align:middle line:90%
It just didn't make any sense.

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.340 align:middle line:84%
So I've got thousands
of pages on High Jump.

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:44.852 align:middle line:84%
That claim it was a training
exercise to see how their--

00:34:44.852 --> 00:34:45.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You think not.

00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:47.393 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD:
--weaponry and equipment

00:34:47.393 --> 00:34:49.590 align:middle line:84%
would work in
those temperatures.

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:52.340 align:middle line:84%
You know, here's what I
would say about that topic.

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:56.264 align:middle line:90%
And this scares me a little bit.

00:34:56.264 --> 00:34:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Going back to the
letter, this was

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.772 align:middle line:84%
somebody who was Hitler's
high-up Nazi generals.

00:35:00.772 --> 00:35:01.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A legitimate letter.

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:03.688 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: It was
a legitimate source.

00:35:03.688 --> 00:35:06.100 align:middle line:84%
I filed FOIA requests to
every intelligence agency,

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:09.470 align:middle line:84%
including the Army, trying
to figure out what did they

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:10.830 align:middle line:90%
do with this letter.

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:12.804 align:middle line:84%
Now, even though
Hitler has an FBI file,

00:35:12.804 --> 00:35:14.220 align:middle line:84%
and it's very
interesting to see--

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:16.386 align:middle line:84%
they've got pictures of
Hitler on how he would look,

00:35:16.386 --> 00:35:19.281 align:middle line:84%
a bald Hitler and long-haired
Hitler, Hitler with a beard.

00:35:19.281 --> 00:35:20.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With a real mustache.

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:21.988 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: With
a real mustache.

00:35:21.988 --> 00:35:25.040 align:middle line:90%
And there's those documents.

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:27.650 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't do
anything with this letter.

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:30.200 align:middle line:84%
So there's two ways
to look at this.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Number one, they
did nothing with it.

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:33.720 align:middle line:90%
And that's scary.

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Number two, they did
something, and it was true,

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:40.677 align:middle line:84%
and they covered it all up and
claim that there's nothing.

00:35:40.677 --> 00:35:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Scary, which no
matter which way you--

00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:43.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
probably the case.

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Which is
probably the case, yeah.

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.120 align:middle line:90%
And it's not far-fetched.

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:49.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it sounds like a
crazy conspiracy theory,

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:53.340 align:middle line:84%
but not far fetched that some of
these guys from the Third Reich

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:54.250 align:middle line:90%
escaped Germany.

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:56.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of them
did, so why not--

00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:58.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Many went to
Argentina and Brazil.

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: And
a lot of them still

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:02.070 align:middle line:90%
have offspring there today.

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let me give
you our final e-mail.

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:10.300 align:middle line:84%
Chuck from Mississippi, do
you see contact of disclosure

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:12.580 align:middle line:90%
happening any time soon?

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: I don't,
not in the sense

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.550 align:middle line:84%
that the government is
going to come clean.

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:18.352 align:middle line:90%
I just don't see it.

00:36:18.352 --> 00:36:19.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's unfortunate.

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: It is, but
I think that-- I truly

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:28.670 align:middle line:84%
believe that disclosure is more
or less the public getting off

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:32.180 align:middle line:84%
their chairs and
looking at the topic.

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:33.940 align:middle line:84%
That's where disclosure
is going to come.

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:36.370 align:middle line:84%
So many people today, they
want that viral video.

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:40.692 align:middle line:84%
They want that 13.5-second
video proof that's undeniable.

00:36:40.692 --> 00:36:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want to spend
any more time than that.

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
not gonna get that.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: You're
not gonna get that.

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:45.240 align:middle line:90%
It takes time.

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's what a
lot of the public at this point

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.970 align:middle line:84%
is looking for,
because our attention

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:53.742 align:middle line:84%
spans are getting smaller
and smaller and smaller.

00:36:53.742 --> 00:36:54.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thank you, internet.

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:55.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Exactly.

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:57.160 align:middle line:84%
You've got Twitter,
where you've got

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.620 align:middle line:84%
to misspell every single
word you type to make

00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:01.740 align:middle line:90%
it fit into those characters.

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Your videos, the most popular
ones are under two minutes.

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:07.950 align:middle line:84%
So the attention span is going
way, way down of the public,

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:09.330 align:middle line:90%
and that's scary.

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Because as I raise my
son, who's now two,

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.880 align:middle line:84%
I want him to be
fascinated by books.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:16.540 align:middle line:84%
I want him to be able to
read and write and not

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:21.370 align:middle line:84%
have to worry about him tweeting
and misspelling every word

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:25.620 align:middle line:84%
and using the most horrific
grammar just because he can.

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.570 align:middle line:84%
I think that that's-- I
hate to use this term,

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:29.970 align:middle line:84%
but just it's
dumbing down society.

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And when you attribute
that to the UFO phenomena,

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.150 align:middle line:90%
we're missing something.

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:38.382 align:middle line:84%
And we're not going to get
disclosure from the government.

00:37:38.382 --> 00:37:40.090 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going to
come from our side.

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:40.960 align:middle line:90%
But we need to work at it.

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.751 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Took me a
while to figure out what

00:37:42.751 --> 00:37:44.650 align:middle line:90%
LOL meant on text messages.

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:45.820 align:middle line:90%
What is this stuff?

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:46.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah. [LAUGHING]

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.621 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: I
realized what it was.

00:37:47.621 --> 00:37:51.950 align:middle line:84%
In the Black Vault,
1.5 million pages--

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:55.910 align:middle line:84%
what is the single
most incredible thing

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:57.960 align:middle line:90%
you've put in there?

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: It's hard
to round it down to one.

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:04.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The one that
just blows you wide open.

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:06.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: When I found
black-and-white proof

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:10.680 align:middle line:84%
that the United States Air Force
had a manual for investigating

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:11.750 align:middle line:90%
UFOs.

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:13.880 align:middle line:84%
That was key and
important for my research,

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:16.180 align:middle line:84%
because going back
to that 1969 cutoff

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:18.560 align:middle line:84%
date and all these
thousands of pages,

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.450 align:middle line:84%
I finally found
irrefutable proof

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:22.380 align:middle line:84%
that that one agency,
the Air Force,

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:24.990 align:middle line:84%
that was responsible for
those investigations,

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:27.780 align:middle line:84%
still were collecting
UFO records.

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And to kind of
summarize the story,

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:32.940 align:middle line:84%
they're taking
these UFO reports--

00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:34.065 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Under no heading.

00:38:34.065 --> 00:38:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: They're called
[? Servies ?] Reports.

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:38.390 align:middle line:84%
And they're sending them
to the NORAD installation,

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:40.030 align:middle line:90%
which kind of makes sense.

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:42.980 align:middle line:84%
But consequently, since
it's under Canadian control

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:46.260 align:middle line:84%
and the United States control,
it's not subject to FOIA.

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:48.270 align:middle line:84%
So when I filed a FOIA
requests to NORAD,

00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:49.610 align:middle line:90%
I found that out the hard way.

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:50.693 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't get it.

00:38:50.693 --> 00:38:51.960 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Well, exactly.

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.760 align:middle line:84%
But they said, in good
faith-- and I never

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:56.130 align:middle line:84%
understood that term, in
good faith-- in good faith,

00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:58.710 align:middle line:84%
they looked for documents,
they found nothing.

00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:01.180 align:middle line:84%
About a year after
I got that denial,

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:03.840 align:middle line:84%
I called the Canadian
government, the Department

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.550 align:middle line:90%
of National Defense, and--

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:07.634 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That Paul Hellyer
used to head up, right?

00:39:07.634 --> 00:39:08.433 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Mhm.

00:39:08.433 --> 00:39:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And I asked them-- this was
the guy on the phone that

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:11.950 align:middle line:90%
answered the phone.

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking for these
[? Servies ?] reports.

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:14.940 align:middle line:84%
Because I felt like,
what are the odds?

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.730 align:middle line:84%
They have this manual
for reporting it,

00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:18.222 align:middle line:90%
but they really have nothing?

00:39:18.222 --> 00:39:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And so the guy
didn't know my name.

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.055 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know
why I was calling.

00:39:21.055 --> 00:39:23.020 align:middle line:84%
This was in a
special UFO office.

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm looking for
these [? Servies ?] reports.

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:26.993 align:middle line:84%
It's called Communication
Instruction.

00:39:26.993 --> 00:39:28.360 align:middle line:90%
I was giving him the acronym.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And he interrupts
me in mid-sentence,

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:32.146 align:middle line:84%
and he had them
within arm's reach.

00:39:32.146 --> 00:39:33.270 align:middle line:90%
He had a big stack of them.

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:34.145 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right there.

00:39:34.145 --> 00:39:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: And I pretty
much fell off my chair.

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:38.673 align:middle line:84%
Why would this guy at the
Department of National Defense

00:39:38.673 --> 00:39:41.200 align:middle line:90%
have these things on his desk?

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.451 align:middle line:90%
And so I eventually got them.

00:39:42.451 --> 00:39:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He knew
that Greenewald was

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:44.620 align:middle line:90%
going to get a hold of them.

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD:
Eventually I guess I'd

00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:47.340 align:middle line:84%
start attacking the
Canadian government, too.

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:48.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You might
as well have it then.

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:50.250 align:middle line:84%
So I ended up getting
the documents.

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:52.541 align:middle line:84%
There's actually thousands
of them that exist up there.

00:39:52.541 --> 00:39:53.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Anything revealing?

00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Well,
a lot of UFO-- I

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:57.550 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't say any
Earth-shattering reports,

00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:59.560 align:middle line:84%
but you do get a lot
of the flying saucer,

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.870 align:middle line:84%
lights in the sky, even
a crop circle report that

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:03.180 align:middle line:90%
was get entangled in all this.

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
sometimes inundate

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:07.587 align:middle line:90%
you to just bog you down?

00:40:07.587 --> 00:40:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: I've
thought about that,

00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:11.890 align:middle line:84%
but I have such a data hound
that I don't mind if they try

00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:12.700 align:middle line:90%
and bog me down.

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You want
to be bogged down.

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah, I'll
take the boxes of stuff.

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:15.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Take it.

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.360 align:middle line:84%
What does your-- you
got a little boy, right?

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:18.610 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah, Christian.

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does your
wife say about all this work

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:22.680 align:middle line:90%
that you continue to do?

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:24.446 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: She loves it.

00:40:24.446 --> 00:40:27.240 align:middle line:84%
It's probably not every
day that a woman has

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:29.390 align:middle line:84%
to deal with her husband
firing off thousands

00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:32.820 align:middle line:84%
of FOIA requests trying to
get every government secret

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:34.240 align:middle line:90%
imaginable, but she's a trooper.

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:37.030 align:middle line:84%
She's always been
supportive since day one.

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Even Christian now is
coming into the office

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:42.542 align:middle line:84%
and climbing on my chair and
typing away, pretty much.

00:40:42.542 --> 00:40:43.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're teaching him.

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:44.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And so he's getting
in on it, too.

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:47.591 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What drives you, John?

00:40:47.591 --> 00:40:48.850 align:middle line:90%
Why do you keep doing this?

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:50.475 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: I love
the letters I get.

00:40:50.475 --> 00:40:51.630 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:55.430 align:middle line:84%
I've gotten them from
second, third, fourth graders

00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:59.020 align:middle line:84%
doing research reports, high
schoolers, college students,

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:00.710 align:middle line:84%
even up to
great-great-grandmothers,

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:02.402 align:middle line:90%
saying, thank you.

00:41:02.402 --> 00:41:03.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thank you
for what you do.

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:04.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's a little bit of a
cheesy way to look at it,

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:08.790 align:middle line:84%
but those are the
letters that I love.

00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:10.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you get a
letter like that,

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:12.560 align:middle line:84%
and you realize,
well, that took me

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:16.650 align:middle line:84%
10 years to get, hours
to program, X, Y, and Z,

00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:18.480 align:middle line:84%
and that one letter
made it all worthwhile.

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:22.200 align:middle line:84%
So do I think that I'm going
to get that ultimate truth one

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:25.340 align:middle line:84%
day that's gonna just blow
this whole thing wide open?

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:26.140 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:26.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm not really sure.

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Will you the mistake?

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Will you get the letter
that hasn't been blacked out

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:35.240 align:middle line:84%
because somebody screwed
up in Washington?

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Well, as the
NSA and the DIA told me,

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:40.457 align:middle line:84%
all that stuff, there's
nothing to send anyway.

00:41:40.457 --> 00:41:42.790 align:middle line:84%
That's why I don't think
Clinton, even if she wanted to,

00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:43.766 align:middle line:90%
can release anything.

00:41:43.766 --> 00:41:45.140 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
there's something

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:47.530 align:middle line:84%
to be said that that
stuff is just gone now.

00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And as a guy who loves history,
especially UFO history,

00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:54.940 align:middle line:84%
for that to be lost,
it's lost forever.

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:59.580 align:middle line:84%
So those are thousands of pages
now that are just up and gone.

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:01.790 align:middle line:84%
You've lost that
history forever.

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:04.240 align:middle line:84%
So there's no mistake to
be made, because according

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:06.360 align:middle line:90%
to them, they lost it all.

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are other countries
providing information

00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:10.049 align:middle line:90%
to their constituents?

00:42:10.049 --> 00:42:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Other
countries have come out

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.015 align:middle line:90%
with UFO-related documents.

00:42:13.015 --> 00:42:14.931 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're a little
easier, aren't they?

00:42:14.931 --> 00:42:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: A little
bit, but for me, I always

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:22.490 align:middle line:84%
question whether or not it's
US technology that maybe we're

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:26.640 align:middle line:84%
not supposed to be flying in
over that particular country.

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:30.550 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, our
backyard here in America,

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:33.370 align:middle line:84%
we have to test our toys
beyond those borders.

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:35.789 align:middle line:84%
And it's no secret that
we've done it in the past.

00:42:35.789 --> 00:42:38.080 align:middle line:84%
It's no secret that we're
going to do it in the future.

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:42.440 align:middle line:84%
So when a government releases
their UFO information,

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:46.560 align:middle line:84%
I do start to think, well, could
this be top-secret technology?

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't dismiss it.

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:52.540 align:middle line:84%
But there is that big kind
of question mark for me.

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:55.460 align:middle line:84%
So I don't want to
diminish that information,

00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:57.540 align:middle line:84%
because it is very
important to the field,

00:42:57.540 --> 00:42:59.277 align:middle line:84%
but I do have my
questions about it.

00:42:59.277 --> 00:43:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can I ask you
some quick questions?

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:03.040 align:middle line:90%
Just give me a yes or no.

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:03.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: OK.

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we being
visited by extraterrestrials

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:09.070 align:middle line:90%
from other planetary systems?

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:10.939 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: I don't know.

00:43:10.939 --> 00:43:12.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That wasn't an option.

00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:13.580 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGHING]

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: I was
fearing you'd say that.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm a kind of-- I
don't want to-- I

00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:19.020 align:middle line:90%
know you said just yes or no.

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:20.440 align:middle line:84%
The reason I say
I don't know, I'm

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:22.770 align:middle line:84%
the type of person that
needs to see to believe.

00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:25.689 align:middle line:84%
And since I've never seen
anything, I can't say for sure.

00:43:25.689 --> 00:43:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
being practical here.

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: But when
you look at the documents

00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:29.960 align:middle line:84%
and you look at
the evidence, you

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:32.910 align:middle line:84%
can start etching out all
of the skeptical responses

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:34.400 align:middle line:90%
to what UFOs are.

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, I believe that
that is one of the strongest

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:38.300 align:middle line:90%
possibilities.

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:40.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we being
deceived by government?

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:42.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yes.

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will government
ever finally disclose to us?

00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:46.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: No.

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John, if
people want to get

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:50.200 align:middle line:84%
more information on the Black
Vault, where do they go?

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.950 align:middle line:10%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.
www.theblackvault.com.

00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:53.133 align:middle line:90%


00:43:53.133 --> 00:43:54.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Black Vault.

00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: The Black
Vault. Actually, both work,

00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:56.420 align:middle line:90%
blackvault.com works fine.

00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:57.461 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right, good.

00:43:57.461 --> 00:43:58.320 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:43:58.320 --> 00:43:59.300 align:middle line:10%
>>GREENEWALD: And,
yeah, everything's

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:00.930 align:middle line:10%
downloadable for
free, and there's not

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:02.570 align:middle line:10%
a penny that's charged for it.

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:05.640 align:middle line:84%
You can go on and download
every 1.5 million pages

00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:06.440 align:middle line:90%
if you'd like.

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Keep doing
what you're doing.

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:07.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Thank you.

00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:08.480 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because in the future,
it will be 2.5 million pages.

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: I hope so.

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.280 align:middle line:90%
I hope so.

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:15.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We may never
find out from government

00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:18.640 align:middle line:84%
whether extraterrestrial
life and the presence

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.540 align:middle line:90%
is indeed happening or real.

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:22.060 align:middle line:90%
We may never find that out.

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:25.160 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you one
thing that is a fact.

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:28.560 align:middle line:10%
John Greenewald will not
give up and will continue

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:30.600 align:middle line:10%
to search for the truth.

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:34.170 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
