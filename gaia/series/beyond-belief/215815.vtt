>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.730 align:middle line:10%
Jessie Herman,
our special guest,

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.610 align:middle line:10%
channels the non-physical
entity group called Vagrein,

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.460 align:middle line:10%
sharing their wisdom
to guide others.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.370 align:middle line:90%
She is the author of Vagrein--

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Seeking Ends When
Sharing Begins,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.400 align:middle line:84%
and works as a life
coach and pranic energy

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.480 align:middle line:90%
healer in Milan, Italy.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.842 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Jessie.

00:00:40.842 --> 00:00:42.300 align:middle line:84%
>>JESSIE HERMAN:
Thank you so much.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
all over the map.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Yes.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Spell
Vagrein for people

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.510 align:middle line:90%
who want to find your book.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: For sure.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.320 align:middle line:90%
V-A-G-R-E-I-N.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.865 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are they?

00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:54.740 align:middle line:10%
>>HERMAN: They're a
non-physical entity group

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.240 align:middle line:10%
that brings messages of
unity, consciousness,

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.380 align:middle line:10%
and radical self-acceptance that
are beyond the space and time,

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.940 align:middle line:10%
non-physical, non-local.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And they're bringing
our requests

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.310 align:middle line:84%
for the upgrading of
consciousness to humanity.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.995 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
they come upon you?

00:01:10.995 --> 00:01:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Very reluctantly.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.280 align:middle line:10%
I didn't really want
to be a channel at all.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.540 align:middle line:10%
And I had my own
spiritual journey start

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.065 align:middle line:10%
when my daughter was born,
so I began meditating.

00:01:21.065 --> 00:01:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of my gifts
that I had in childhood

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.020 align:middle line:84%
came, started
coming back online.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And then I had
this sort of knock

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.330 align:middle line:84%
on my consciousness
of this message that

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.660 align:middle line:90%
wanted to come through.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did was not
want to go ahead and channel.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.530 align:middle line:84%
I'd only found out about
channeling recently before that.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, I got so
fed-- it was actually my 40th

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.100 align:middle line:90%
birthday.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.162 align:middle line:84%
I got so fed up with this
pressure of a message that

00:01:44.162 --> 00:01:45.120 align:middle line:90%
wanted to come through.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.440 align:middle line:90%
I said you know what I'll do?

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.480 align:middle line:84%
I will show you that I'm not the
right person by actually going

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.260 align:middle line:90%
ahead and attempting this.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's when channeling
just came through right away.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it
scare you originally?

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: Yes,
absolutely scared me.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.840 align:middle line:90%
I thought I'd gone crazy.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
other people say?

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: I didn't
tell anyone right away.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, you
kept it a secret.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: I did.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Not for very long, though,
because they actually

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.500 align:middle line:84%
told me in some of the
first channeling sessions

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.230 align:middle line:84%
that people would
gather around me

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.650 align:middle line:84%
that would be able to encourage
me and allow me to open up

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.160 align:middle line:90%
to this channeling gift.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And very shortly afterwards,
several weeks afterwards,

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.770 align:middle line:84%
I did meet a group
of people who already

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.480 align:middle line:84%
were passionate about
channeled entities.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And they were really
excited when I told them

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.570 align:middle line:90%
what was happening to me.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.270 align:middle line:84%
So they encouraged me to try
it out in front of a group.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.385 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I realized
that it wasn't mine to hide.

00:02:34.385 --> 00:02:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
this is important.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.650 align:middle line:84%
We have a clip of you from your
very first one-on-one session

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.590 align:middle line:90%
with Vagrein.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Yes,

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
important for people

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.440 align:middle line:84%
to understand what
we're talking about.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: That's right.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.820 align:middle line:10%
>>VAGREIN: We are available.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.490 align:middle line:10%
You already know everything
you need to know.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.400 align:middle line:10%
You are already able to
speak for us in our present.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.660 align:middle line:10%
Cannot speak to all of you
because all of you will not

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.740 align:middle line:10%
hear.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.050 align:middle line:10%
We use those of you in
form to speak for us,

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.620 align:middle line:10%
so that those that
would not hear directly

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.870 align:middle line:10%
can choose to misinterpret.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.300 align:middle line:10%
The term alienation is perfect.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.200 align:middle line:10%
There's no need to fear
for even the alienation

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.860 align:middle line:10%
that you face as a
bridge or a messenger

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.680 align:middle line:10%
is perfectly placed to respect
those who do not wish to hear.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.690 align:middle line:10%
This is a protection.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And you may continue to share
yours or our message, which

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.610 align:middle line:90%
is the same.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.020 align:middle line:10%
And those who do
not wish to hear

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.420 align:middle line:10%
may think that there is
something wrong with you,

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.360 align:middle line:10%
that you've made it up, that
you are mentally unwell.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.190 align:middle line:10%
A part of them knows, a
part of them hears anyways.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.510 align:middle line:84%
There's a natural, instinctual
fascination with the truth.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.220 align:middle line:10%
And those who do
not wish to hear

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.130 align:middle line:10%
with their ears or
their heads may still

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.250 align:middle line:10%
choose to hear with their hearts
and in their perfect time.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.780 align:middle line:10%
Rise.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.940 align:middle line:10%
We watch as you
continue to play games.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.630 align:middle line:10%
Even the game to save
the world is a game.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.880 align:middle line:10%
The rising does not
happen through action.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.940 align:middle line:10%
You are already arisen.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.260 align:middle line:10%
It is not a verb.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.300 align:middle line:10%
The dark ones, those
who are sleeping,

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.110 align:middle line:10%
those who are actively
harming, they need your love.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.959 align:middle line:10%
There are no villains.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.240 align:middle line:10%
Judgment is judgment.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.070 align:middle line:10%
You will walk.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.870 align:middle line:10%
You will see.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.750 align:middle line:10%
You will see things that you
cannot resolve because they are

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.370 align:middle line:10%
unresolvable, because there
was never anything to resolve.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.450 align:middle line:10%
The atrocities, the
horrors, as you call them,

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.620 align:middle line:10%
only exist because
you continue to choose

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.840 align:middle line:10%
to see them as separate.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.720 align:middle line:10%
Separate from what?

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.000 align:middle line:10%
Separate from the
creator, which is you.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.480 align:middle line:10%
You look away and look
away from yourself.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.290 align:middle line:10%
One cannot resolve
what is unresolvable.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.430 align:middle line:10%
You cannot fix
what is not broken.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.700 align:middle line:10%
You cannot change
the changeless.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.500 align:middle line:10%
God is the what is.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.960 align:middle line:10%
We come because
we too play games.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.880 align:middle line:10%
There are so many levels.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.490 align:middle line:10%
And this game is simultaneous.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.970 align:middle line:10%
The question is,
what do you want?

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.620 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to play the
game of saving the world?

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.560 align:middle line:10%
The world that does
not need to be saved?

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.080 align:middle line:10%
Or do you want the what is?

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.270 align:middle line:10%
Do you want God?

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Pretty
profound, Jessie.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.030 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Yeah.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.830 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:26.631 align:middle line:90%
They are.

00:05:26.631 --> 00:05:27.560 align:middle line:90%
They are quite deep.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That is them
channeling through you.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: That is the
day of my 40th birthday,

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.610 align:middle line:84%
where I lay down on my bed
and hit Record on a telephone

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:37.570 align:middle line:90%
recorder.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And off it went.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: And just said,
OK, do what you will

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.870 align:middle line:90%
and we'll see what happens.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't have actual
recall of that speaking

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.610 align:middle line:90%
having happened through me.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.620 align:middle line:84%
So when I came out of this what
I thought was three minutes,

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.370 align:middle line:84%
but ended up being
about 25 minutes-- that

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.510 align:middle line:84%
has been sped up a little
bit for convenience sake.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.090 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know
the time had passed,

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.090 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't have
recollection of what was said.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.540 align:middle line:84%
I had to actually play it back
to hear what had been shared.

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
they want with us?

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: Well, actually,
it's interesting

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.910 align:middle line:84%
because it's the
other way around.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.980 align:middle line:84%
It's that we are calling
into existence their ability

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:16.890 align:middle line:90%
to serve us.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.130 align:middle line:84%
So humanity has come
to a space where

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.810 align:middle line:90%
we want to raise consciousness.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:22.830 align:middle line:90%
We want to have peace.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.390 align:middle line:90%
We want to have unity.

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And so what manifests from that
desire that humanity is calling

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.710 align:middle line:84%
through are these
messengers that

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.500 align:middle line:84%
come to be able to guide us,
to give us the wisdom that's

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.190 align:middle line:84%
already in us, but in a way
that can be seen as a permission

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.920 align:middle line:84%
slip of OK, now that I hear
it from what I perceive

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.410 align:middle line:84%
of as an external
source, I can now

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.970 align:middle line:84%
begin to adopt it, learn how
to work with this energy,

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.492 align:middle line:84%
learn how to step up into
that higher version of myself.

00:06:48.492 --> 00:06:50.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that they actually
want anything with us,

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.283 align:middle line:84%
it's that we want
something with them.

00:06:52.283 --> 00:06:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Beyond this
program, Beyond Belief, what

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.640 align:middle line:84%
are you doing to transmit this
message to the other people?

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: So I'm
sharing a lot on YouTube

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.130 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of
social media platforms.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm writing more books that
will be coming out shortly.

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:08.470 align:middle line:84%
I do one-on-one
sessions with clients

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.370 align:middle line:84%
who have specific questions that
they want to ask about any topic

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.330 align:middle line:84%
whatsoever, and really
just going around

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.370 align:middle line:84%
the world to where
people will have me speak

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.830 align:middle line:84%
and hosting events, having
these conversations.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.955 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there other
people channeling Vagrein?

00:07:23.955 --> 00:07:26.247 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: There aren't, but
there are other people that

00:07:26.247 --> 00:07:27.620 align:middle line:90%
channeled the same frequency.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.548 align:middle line:84%
So that's the interesting
thing about Vagrein.

00:07:29.548 --> 00:07:30.465 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain that.

00:07:30.465 --> 00:07:31.265 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Yeah.

00:07:31.265 --> 00:07:36.310 align:middle line:84%
So Vagrein again, as I said, is
a placeholder name in that they

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:37.880 align:middle line:90%
didn't say this is our name.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.460 align:middle line:84%
They said here's
a convenient word

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.770 align:middle line:84%
that you can use to associate
with the energy that

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.110 align:middle line:84%
comes through this
particular vessel as Jessie.

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Because people like
to personify energy.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And so when they first shared
the name with myself, actually,

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.790 align:middle line:84%
it was really only to give
something to be recognizable by.

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:58.890 align:middle line:84%
However, the energy
itself, they often

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:01.830 align:middle line:84%
say the energy can be
accessed by anyone, anywhere,

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.650 align:middle line:84%
and will come through the
specific filters of the person

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.720 align:middle line:84%
that's channeling,
or even they often

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.190 align:middle line:84%
use the symbolism
of a leaf on a tree.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.070 align:middle line:84%
They say we're also
the energy that flows

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:12.982 align:middle line:90%
through a leaf on the tree.

00:08:12.982 --> 00:08:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And quite humorously,
they often say,

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.880 align:middle line:84%
we're also the bag of dog
poo in the park that's

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.420 align:middle line:90%
been left in the trash.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not all of us.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:21.610 align:middle line:90%
Not all of us.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:22.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Yeah.

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:25.410 align:middle line:84%
So it's really interesting that
they will associate themselves

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.630 align:middle line:84%
or the energy that is that
frequency with absolutely

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:28.930 align:middle line:90%
everything that is.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.980 align:middle line:84%
So I would say that other
channels are tapping

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:35.010 align:middle line:84%
into the same frequency,
but it wouldn't necessarily

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.630 align:middle line:90%
be labeled as Vagrein.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In that
first transmission,

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.359 align:middle line:84%
they seem somewhat
annoyed with humans.

00:08:41.359 --> 00:08:42.159 align:middle line:90%
Are they?

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:43.772 align:middle line:84%
Did I pick that--
did I pick that up?

00:08:43.772 --> 00:08:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: There's
definitely a little bit

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.070 align:middle line:84%
of a play back and forth
with me specifically,

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.690 align:middle line:84%
because the
conversation, if you want

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:51.760 align:middle line:84%
to look at the linearity
of that moment,

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.790 align:middle line:84%
the conversation before that
was me being very much like,

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm done with you.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to deal
with you anymore.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.290 align:middle line:90%
Go away from me.

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:02.520 align:middle line:84%
So there was already
a play between the--

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Leave me alone.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: Yeah, the
asking of service

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.710 align:middle line:84%
to be brought through
me, and then them

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.940 align:middle line:84%
sort of having a
push back to that.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.790 align:middle line:84%
So they were kind of
calling me out specifically.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:15.900 align:middle line:84%
But of course, that message
is also for humanity

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.228 align:middle line:84%
because we do tend to
play a lot of games.

00:09:18.228 --> 00:09:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are you doing with
group channeling these days?

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: With group channeling?

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:24.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: Yeah, I have
groups that I connect with.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we've got a clip
of your first group channeling

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:28.660 align:middle line:90%
session.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:34.230 align:middle line:84%
Let's listen in on the Vagrein
interaction with your group.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:35.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SPECTATOR: Is
it relevant for us

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:39.570 align:middle line:90%
to know what density you're in?

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:42.660 align:middle line:10%
>>VAGREIN: We are from
a space that holds

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.950 align:middle line:10%
oneness in complete reverence.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:50.430 align:middle line:10%
We love in a way that is beyond
the physical capabilities

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:51.870 align:middle line:10%
of matter.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:56.260 align:middle line:10%
We do not exist in space
time but time space.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And we are completely
aware of our limitlessness.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:05.070 align:middle line:10%
These characteristics
are shared by many

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:09.840 align:middle line:10%
and touched upon by
some in many densities.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.520 align:middle line:10%
Also, the numerical
names and explanations

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.610 align:middle line:10%
that have been made
available to you

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:21.480 align:middle line:10%
are imperfect, as
they are language,

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.880 align:middle line:10%
which is symbol and not truth.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:30.330 align:middle line:10%
So in the same way, you
never actually see a river

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.500 align:middle line:10%
because river is movement.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.640 align:middle line:10%
There is no river.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.210 align:middle line:10%
The same understanding
could be applied

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:38.610 align:middle line:10%
to the conceptual
descriptions that

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:42.490 align:middle line:10%
have been placed upon what
is for convenience sake.

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:46.240 align:middle line:10%
Answering directly would violate
the free will of the vessel.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.460 align:middle line:10%
And so we hope that the
answer was sufficiently

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.872 align:middle line:10%
received to the question.

00:10:52.872 --> 00:10:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Later on in
the program, Jessie,

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.730 align:middle line:84%
you're going to channel
Vagrein and I'll

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.180 align:middle line:90%
ask them some questions.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking forward to that.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:10:59.890 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Same.

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm going
to be tough on them.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:01.920 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Sure.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.450 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Since you've been
doing this now, how many years?

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: It's about six years.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:07.620 align:middle line:90%
Six years on.

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Six years.

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:09.150 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Yeah.

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:10.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Has it been satisfying?

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: Oh, it's
wonderfully satisfying.

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:14.640 align:middle line:90%
It's really fulfilling.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.920 align:middle line:84%
It feels so good
when I'm channeling.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Some people say that they're
channeling-- people often

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.070 align:middle line:84%
ask me, do you get tired
or do you get drained?

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:21.480 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.720 align:middle line:90%
I get very energized.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.940 align:middle line:90%
I get very enlivened.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And though I don't remember the
transmissions that come through,

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:30.540 align:middle line:84%
I see that over time, a
lot of their teachings

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.330 align:middle line:84%
have impacted me
directly and have

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:38.880 align:middle line:84%
solidified states of being in me
that I didn't previously think

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:39.775 align:middle line:90%
were even possible.

00:11:39.775 --> 00:11:40.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, what was the impetus
for the book Vagrein--

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.460 align:middle line:84%
Seeking Ends When
Sharing Begins?

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:49.170 align:middle line:10%
>>HERMAN: So that book is really
a compilation of the first six

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.440 align:middle line:10%
months of transmissions
that I was doing,

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.840 align:middle line:10%
which they then had me kind of
cut up into the different bits

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.350 align:middle line:10%
and pieces and reassemble based
upon the themes and topics that

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.190 align:middle line:10%
were discussed over
those six months.

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:05.540 align:middle line:84%
So there are topics on
health, there's relationships,

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:09.230 align:middle line:84%
there's death, there's
channeling itself.

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Really, anything that a human
being faces in their lifetime

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:16.580 align:middle line:84%
is covered sort of as a
base level in the book.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And what that book
is a guide to is

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.180 align:middle line:84%
there's an answer
for everything,

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.700 align:middle line:90%
and it's always inside oneself.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:30.550 align:middle line:84%
But it's really a very
broad strokes description

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.600 align:middle line:84%
of what their main
messagings are.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's less specific than
what they get into later on.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How often
do you channel them?

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.013 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Oh, almost every day.

00:12:39.013 --> 00:12:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Almost every day when
I'm working with clients

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:42.940 align:middle line:90%
or I'm doing different events.

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.035 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many different
entities are there?

00:12:45.035 --> 00:12:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: That's another
interesting question

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:49.285 align:middle line:84%
because while they say that
they're a non-physical entity

00:12:49.285 --> 00:12:52.830 align:middle line:84%
group, just similarly to what
they said in that transmission

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:54.900 align:middle line:84%
there, often what
they have to share

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:57.160 align:middle line:84%
with us is out of
convenience for our sake.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.840 align:middle line:84%
So the question about being
a group or being multiple

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.300 align:middle line:84%
is more along the
lines of if they

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.980 align:middle line:84%
were to say they were
singular, we would

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:05.865 align:middle line:90%
believe they were singular.

00:13:05.865 --> 00:13:06.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: But the
concept of the multiple

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.360 align:middle line:84%
isn't even accurate
because it's not

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.260 align:middle line:90%
a fixed number of singularity.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:15.360 align:middle line:84%
It's an expansiveness
of what would be outside

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.410 align:middle line:90%
of accounting's ability.

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:19.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
like angelic beings?

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.920 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: No, no.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.000 align:middle line:84%
They don't associate with any
of the specific frequencies

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.600 align:middle line:90%
like of ET or angelics or--

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.080 align:middle line:84%
yeah, those would be the
main two or paranormal,

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.310 align:middle line:84%
but something above that that
encompasses those energies as

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:35.110 align:middle line:90%
well.

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:36.943 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had to
illustrate a picture,

00:13:36.943 --> 00:13:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Jessie, what they might look
like, what would it look like?

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: So I know that they
don't have physical form,

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:49.160 align:middle line:84%
and they would get pretty
specifically irritated with me

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.670 align:middle line:84%
for trying to come
up with an idea.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:52.530 align:middle line:84%
But of course, I'm
an artist myself.

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And so at one point, I did,
from my emotional space, come up

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:59.303 align:middle line:84%
from what I feel emotionally
they would be represented by.

00:13:59.303 --> 00:14:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that
I've shared with you guys.

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's take a look
at a artistic representation

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.950 align:middle line:90%
of a Vagrein.

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: So it's represented
by the multiplicity

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:12.780 align:middle line:84%
of the characters but
they're all the same.

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:13.580 align:middle line:10%
And then--

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:14.970 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They have human faces.

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:16.428 align:middle line:10%
>>HERMAN: They do
have human faces.

00:14:16.428 --> 00:14:21.340 align:middle line:10%
And it is something that, again,
is my emotional connection

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.140 align:middle line:10%
to them.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.130 align:middle line:10%
This would be how my heart
feels or would represent it.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:26.700 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: If they
connected with me,

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.348 align:middle line:10%
would the picture
look different?

00:14:28.348 --> 00:14:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: Oh, absolutely
it would look different.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:32.000 align:middle line:84%
I've had other
people explain to me

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.500 align:middle line:84%
what they see when
they think of Vagrein.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And one person talk to me about
seeing a large glowing pyramid

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.120 align:middle line:90%
when they imagine--

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:39.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh really.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: --Vagrein energy.

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:41.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:44.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's very subjective
to each of us

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:47.060 align:middle line:84%
because it is a
part of each of us.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:49.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How vivid is
the imagery when you

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:50.850 align:middle line:90%
speak and channel with them?

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: So I don't
remember what they say,

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:57.560 align:middle line:84%
but I have this experience
of extremely vivid imagery

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:58.800 align:middle line:90%
of what they're saying.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:58.910 align:middle line:90%
So if--

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mean unless
you listen to it on tape--

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.655 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Yeah.

00:15:01.655 --> 00:15:03.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --you don't
remember what they're saying?

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:04.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: No.

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When we channel
later today in the program,

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:08.538 align:middle line:84%
you will have no recollection
of what you said?

00:15:08.538 --> 00:15:09.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: No, I won't remember.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'll have to tell you.

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: You'll have
to tell me or I'll

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.377 align:middle line:84%
have to watch the recording
like everyone at home.

00:15:14.377 --> 00:15:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or watch Beyond Belief.

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:16.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Exactly.

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:20.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have to get popcorn
and everything to go and watch

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:22.365 align:middle line:90%
the episode.

00:15:22.365 --> 00:15:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do they want?

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:26.030 align:middle line:90%
Do they believe in God?

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:28.912 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: So God is that concept
of the all that is and source.

00:15:28.912 --> 00:15:30.620 align:middle line:84%
They did mention God
in that transmission

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.090 align:middle line:84%
we spoke of earlier,
which I didn't even

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:33.270 align:middle line:90%
remember they had mentioned.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And it is the concept of God
or source is that vastness

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:40.830 align:middle line:90%
of that interconnectedness.

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:42.870 align:middle line:84%
So I would say if the question
is, do they believe in God?

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:44.547 align:middle line:84%
Yes, because they
speak of it often.

00:15:44.547 --> 00:15:46.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever channeled
anything with them that

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.813 align:middle line:90%
is a little disturbing to you?

00:15:48.813 --> 00:15:49.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Absolutely for me.

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:50.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:50.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like what?

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: So I've
had conversations

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:57.250 align:middle line:84%
with people who unfortunately
are not in a good place

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:59.000 align:middle line:84%
emotionally, and maybe
they're considering

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.420 align:middle line:84%
ending their lives, or people
who are having transitions

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.760 align:middle line:84%
because perhaps they have cancer
or they're in end of life.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:06.980 align:middle line:90%
It is sad.

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And that makes me
uncomfortable, to be honest,

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.220 align:middle line:90%
if I can pick up on it.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And it stays-- it gets a
little hard to stay in a trance

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.960 align:middle line:84%
when there's something that
touches me specifically

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.420 align:middle line:84%
that I'm aware because
I can be aware of what's

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.520 align:middle line:84%
happening if the conversation
goes in that direction.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.260 align:middle line:90%
But I've learned to trust them.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Because when there is a
situation that does need

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:28.653 align:middle line:84%
like someone being directed
to a professional help

00:16:28.653 --> 00:16:30.320 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is,
they tend to do that.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And they tend to have a very
strong sense of responsibility

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.110 align:middle line:84%
and understanding of
humans, of what is needed

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:38.210 align:middle line:84%
and what is a spiritual
issue and what

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:40.740 align:middle line:84%
is a very human issue that's
going on in someone's life.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
grown to like them?

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:43.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Oh yeah.

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:45.350 align:middle line:90%
We have so much fun.

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.150 align:middle line:84%
They tease me all
the time because I

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:48.420 align:middle line:90%
don't channel for myself.

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.380 align:middle line:84%
So they watch me go through the
trials and tribulations of being

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:53.420 align:middle line:84%
human and step in
all the potholes

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.600 align:middle line:84%
and fall down all
the staircases.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.170 align:middle line:84%
They have a little
bit of had you

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:01.350 align:middle line:84%
asked we would have told
you so type of attitude.

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:02.870 align:middle line:84%
So we have this
back and forth type

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:04.290 align:middle line:84%
of energy, which
is a lot of fun.

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:05.970 align:middle line:90%
And I love the collaboration.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:09.140 align:middle line:84%
I love bringing this message
to people in the ways

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.190 align:middle line:84%
that they're
instructing to do so.

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:13.140 align:middle line:90%
And it's really satisfying.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.109 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
ever bother you?

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: They do sometimes but
not about my personal stuff.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.940 align:middle line:84%
So if there's some direction
that's my sharing needs to go in

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:28.250 align:middle line:84%
or there's something coming up
that is specifically impactful

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:29.120 align:middle line:90%
that they want to--

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.703 align:middle line:84%
right now, they want
to channel in it,

00:17:30.703 --> 00:17:33.650 align:middle line:84%
maybe I have to drop everything
and go and set up the camera

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:35.025 align:middle line:84%
and transmit
something to people.

00:17:35.025 --> 00:17:36.775 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did you
think when you first

00:17:36.775 --> 00:17:37.800 align:middle line:90%
started channeling them?

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.860 align:middle line:84%
Did you think there was
something wrong with you?

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Yes.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:44.040 align:middle line:84%
So I thought that
maybe I'm eccentric.

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:48.030 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'm crazy, actually crazy
and there's a problem here.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe your brain
has this ability

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.930 align:middle line:90%
to make up all kinds of things.

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:57.418 align:middle line:84%
It was proven to me over time
that it's something that feels

00:17:57.418 --> 00:17:59.960 align:middle line:84%
to be external to me, because
there's things they know that I

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.800 align:middle line:90%
don't or I can't.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.500 align:middle line:84%
But at the beginning,
I thought, well, great.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.620 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm just crazy.

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:10.130 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be a problem for
managing the rest of my life.

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't at all
know that it was

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.465 align:middle line:84%
going to go in this
direction, that I'd

00:18:13.465 --> 00:18:16.132 align:middle line:84%
be doing this full time
because that wouldn't have even

00:18:16.132 --> 00:18:17.340 align:middle line:90%
been a thought at the moment.

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.200 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have been able
to handle that thought.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
humans are they

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:24.842 align:middle line:84%
channeling during any
given time on this planet?

00:18:24.842 --> 00:18:27.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: In terms of how much
are they channeling through?

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:27.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:29.825 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: So the way
that they would probably

00:18:29.825 --> 00:18:32.480 align:middle line:84%
answer that question
would be all of them.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:36.300 align:middle line:84%
But that's not a satisfactory
question normally for people.

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.460 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Does that
mean one or 10 million?

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:40.852 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: It would be
basically all of them,

00:18:40.852 --> 00:18:43.310 align:middle line:84%
because the same energy that
creates them coming through me

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:45.560 align:middle line:84%
is the energy that creates
you coming through you.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:49.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a specific
energy in that

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:52.300 align:middle line:84%
the one that comes through
me has the frequency

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.990 align:middle line:84%
and will have the
certain messages.

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:57.320 align:middle line:84%
But you're also presently
channeling yourself.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And they would say
from their perspective,

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.500 align:middle line:90%
that it's the same thing.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.970 align:middle line:84%
It's the same stream that
goes off into different rivers

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:04.850 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What have you learned
is their core message to us?

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: So beginning the core
message was unity consciousness.

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:14.000 align:middle line:84%
They've been learning
through interaction,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.920 align:middle line:84%
what is required for
that unity consciousness

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:18.800 align:middle line:90%
to become manifest.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's really shifted towards
radical self-acceptance,

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:25.780 align:middle line:84%
a message of each
and every human

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:28.300 align:middle line:84%
being coming to a space of
understanding themselves

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.430 align:middle line:84%
and accepting themselves
to such a level

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:33.190 align:middle line:84%
that they're able to
then share their gifts

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:35.770 align:middle line:84%
and follow the purpose that
they chose themselves to come

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:37.060 align:middle line:90%
to have this experience for.

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.602 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, they
gave you an option

00:19:38.602 --> 00:19:40.380 align:middle line:84%
of being a channeler
or a teacher.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:41.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Yes.

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You chose what?

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: I chose channeler.

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:46.190 align:middle line:84%
It makes life, I think,
a little bit easier.

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Even though it's a
little bit stranger,

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:52.420 align:middle line:84%
it feels more that
you don't necessarily

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:55.780 align:middle line:84%
have to be as present or
to have this information

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:57.410 align:middle line:84%
and process it through
your own brain.

00:19:57.410 --> 00:19:59.398 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, I enjoy
my human experience

00:19:59.398 --> 00:20:00.940 align:middle line:84%
and making all the
mistakes because I

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:03.730 align:middle line:84%
love that part of being
human and thrive in that part

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:05.780 align:middle line:90%
of having all the adventures.

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a teacher, people
expect different things of you.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.568 align:middle line:84%
They expect you to be a
different way than people

00:20:12.568 --> 00:20:13.610 align:middle line:90%
expect me as a channeler.

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:15.402 align:middle line:84%
People are perfectly
happy for me to be me,

00:20:15.402 --> 00:20:17.540 align:middle line:84%
as long as I'm
channeling consistently

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.420 align:middle line:90%
the way that they enjoy.

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:20.757 align:middle line:90%
The rest of my life is mine.

00:20:20.757 --> 00:20:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's
channel them now.

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:22.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Yeah.

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:23.300 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long does it take
you to get into that mode?

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:27.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: Oh, only a
couple of minutes maximum.

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:28.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:30.560 align:middle line:90%
And I'll ask Vagrein questions.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.477 align:middle line:84%
Am I talking to
one person or many?

00:20:32.477 --> 00:20:34.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: Well, they'll
speak in the plural.

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:35.477 align:middle line:90%
So they speak in the plural.

00:20:35.477 --> 00:20:39.140 align:middle line:84%
They'll say we, but you can
address it as one energy.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do we begin?

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: I just close my
eyes, and they will say hello.

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:43.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:43.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: OK.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:44.700 align:middle line:90%
I'll see you soon.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:57.762 align:middle line:90%


00:20:57.762 --> 00:20:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>>VAGREIN: Good night to you.

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:00.560 align:middle line:84%
We are pleased to be
meeting you in this fashion.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And we are eager to discuss
with you anything you so choose.

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:03.820 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hello.

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.360 align:middle line:90%
How many of them are you?

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VAGREIN: We are
not a many nor a one.

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:13.930 align:middle line:84%
It is simply to be able to
converse with you in ways

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:15.650 align:middle line:90%
that you are in comfort.

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Because the actual energy
does not have individuation.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.870 align:middle line:90%
It is more abstract than that.

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:25.780 align:middle line:84%
So eventually,
perhaps, we will begin

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.850 align:middle line:90%
to explain that abstractness.

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:30.490 align:middle line:84%
But for the purposes
of what is being shared

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:33.230 align:middle line:84%
and what is being asked
of us in this now moment,

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:38.950 align:middle line:84%
it does allow us to speak as
if we were a very large group.

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:41.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you come to
people like Jessie Herman?

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:42.820 align:middle line:90%
What do you want?

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>>VAGREIN: It is a mix
of physical or genetic

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.660 align:middle line:84%
predisposition, coupled
with the ability

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:58.280 align:middle line:84%
to release and
relinquish the control.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:02.200 align:middle line:84%
This particular vessel
did, once the dam broke

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.960 align:middle line:84%
of their resistance,
release and relinquish

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:10.600 align:middle line:84%
the control or the
resistance, the reluctance

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:14.000 align:middle line:84%
to allowing this sort of
communication to come through.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.270 align:middle line:84%
That in and of
itself is potentially

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:19.990 align:middle line:84%
the biggest skill that
a channel can have,

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:24.410 align:middle line:84%
the fearlessness of the space
of non-existence that, yes,

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:28.850 align:middle line:84%
is temporary but does have
to be what is witnessed.

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:32.382 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is your
main message for humanity?

00:22:32.382 --> 00:22:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>>VAGREIN: Our main
message is you do not

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:37.760 align:middle line:84%
need to suffer nearly as
much as you are doing.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.030 align:middle line:84%
You can and you are
choosing to step

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:41.660 align:middle line:90%
towards unity consciousness.

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it does involve the
learning curve or the growing

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:47.620 align:middle line:84%
pains that you are
currently experiencing

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:49.130 align:middle line:90%
and see all around you.

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:52.180 align:middle line:84%
But our secondary
message would be

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:56.650 align:middle line:84%
that path can be walked through
the space of understanding

00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:58.960 align:middle line:84%
yourself, of coming
to a realization

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:02.800 align:middle line:84%
that you are a miracle, that
you are a blessing, that you are

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.700 align:middle line:84%
here specifically because
you are deeply wanted exactly

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:07.640 align:middle line:90%
as you are.

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:11.540 align:middle line:84%
The only one who does not
want you at times is yourself.

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And as you move more and
more towards the directives

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:16.990 align:middle line:84%
that your inner being
or your higher self

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:19.270 align:middle line:84%
are calling into you,
the more and more

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:21.070 align:middle line:84%
frequently you will
have everything

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:23.410 align:middle line:84%
that you are desiring
in life because you

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:25.450 align:middle line:90%
are meant to be here.

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Humankind seems to be
embattled in war, destruction.

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:34.870 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
of us as a people?

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:41.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VAGREIN: We think that
you are in your perfection,

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:44.820 align:middle line:84%
working through desires
that you are deeply wanting.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Humanity, for as much as it
seems like it might not be,

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:51.850 align:middle line:84%
is an extremely sensitive
and compassionate group.

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:55.740 align:middle line:10%
You do ultimately all
desire to have that harmony

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:58.690 align:middle line:10%
and to have that peace
within yourselves.

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:03.270 align:middle line:10%
And it is requiring for you to
create scenarios and situations

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:08.220 align:middle line:10%
in which you are very
clear and very decisive

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:11.400 align:middle line:10%
about that desire for the
peace within yourselves.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:15.090 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately for you, but
not at all out of alignment

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:17.700 align:middle line:84%
with the grander
plans, you have chosen

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.250 align:middle line:84%
to have the experience
of desiring peace

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:22.570 align:middle line:84%
through the experience
of what you said,

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:24.490 align:middle line:90%
such as war or destruction.

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Because without the desire,
you do not have the motivation

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:29.080 align:middle line:90%
to move towards it.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:30.750 align:middle line:84%
So when you are
seeing things, getting

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:33.083 align:middle line:84%
what you would call worse on
your planet, what is really

00:24:33.083 --> 00:24:36.090 align:middle line:84%
occurring is that you are
stimulating yourselves

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:38.550 align:middle line:84%
more and more towards
what you are ultimately

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:40.590 align:middle line:90%
going to step into.

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:43.433 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can we make
ourselves better people?

00:24:43.433 --> 00:24:45.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VAGREIN: Well, the first
step is to listen to more

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.600 align:middle line:84%
of your heart because your heart
does have wisdom that your mind

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:52.410 align:middle line:84%
cannot have due to conditioning
or due to the fact that

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:54.730 align:middle line:84%
your mind or your brain
is simply a computer.

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:57.460 align:middle line:84%
So if you are listening to your
heart more and more frequently,

00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:59.800 align:middle line:84%
yes, your life does
seem more scary.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:01.330 align:middle line:90%
It does require more courage.

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:04.810 align:middle line:84%
There is no coincidence why that
word is formatted in that way.

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:08.850 align:middle line:84%
But what it does also allow
you to do is to take the risk

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:11.620 align:middle line:84%
of loving and to take the
risk of being that quote,

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:12.610 align:middle line:90%
"better person."

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:15.610 align:middle line:84%
No one again is judging
you other than yourselves.

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:17.980 align:middle line:84%
So you are not becoming
a better person.

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.080 align:middle line:84%
So as to have the
approval of existence,

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.850 align:middle line:84%
existence ultimately does not
care if you are a good person

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:26.130 align:middle line:84%
or what you call a bad
person because it does not

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:27.310 align:middle line:90%
see the difference.

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:31.690 align:middle line:84%
You are all equally beautiful
and divine in your presentation.

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:35.040 align:middle line:84%
However, you did come
with free will and desire

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.080 align:middle line:84%
to have the life
that you are wanting.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And in that desire of having
the life that you are wanting,

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:44.250 align:middle line:84%
what you can do moment to moment
is say, who is it I want to be?

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:46.750 align:middle line:84%
With the answer to that question
filtered through the heart,

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:50.550 align:middle line:84%
you will automatically become
a quote "better person."

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:53.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think of us as people?

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VAGREIN: We think
you are quite humorous,

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:59.200 align:middle line:84%
and that you are entertaining
to interact with.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:03.160 align:middle line:84%
We think that you do not
see yourself in the light.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.850 align:middle line:84%
That existence already
sees you, and that can

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:08.440 align:middle line:90%
be perplexing to our energy.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Of course, that too is
part of the process of you

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:13.390 align:middle line:90%
coming into a realization.

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, you are
the ones in control

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.230 align:middle line:90%
of this entire storyline.

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And you would not put these
obstacles on your path

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.560 align:middle line:84%
if you did not have a direct
desire to jump and hop

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:23.530 align:middle line:90%
over them.

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long have you
been channeling humans?

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VAGREIN: We have
always been in existence

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:34.060 align:middle line:84%
in that it has been many
names through many vessels.

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:37.060 align:middle line:84%
It has been many ways
and many manifestations.

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.650 align:middle line:90%
It is in art or music.

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:41.110 align:middle line:84%
It is in creativity
or invention.

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:44.010 align:middle line:84%
It is in yes what you see
as in terms of profits

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.350 align:middle line:84%
and also in terms of what
you now call channels.

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:49.380 align:middle line:84%
We are no different
than the energy

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.700 align:middle line:84%
that is available to each
and every one of you.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.300 align:middle line:84%
When you do tap into
that aspect of you that

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.400 align:middle line:84%
is what you perceive of
as higher than yourselves,

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.710 align:middle line:84%
it is not ultimately
higher than yourselves.

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:04.020 align:middle line:84%
What it is, though, is the
mystery of the unknown aspects

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:07.860 align:middle line:90%
of the isness of all that is.

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you on
a different plane?

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.220 align:middle line:90%
Are you in a different universe?

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:13.870 align:middle line:84%
Are you in a
different dimension?

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:15.280 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VAGREIN: So in terms
of this question,

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:20.850 align:middle line:84%
the simplest answer is we
do not actually even exist

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:22.958 align:middle line:84%
when we are not being
or at least in the way

00:27:22.958 --> 00:27:24.750 align:middle line:84%
that you are perceiving
us, when we are not

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:28.890 align:middle line:84%
being in the moment of
channeling through this vessel.

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there are times in which
that energy is intertwined

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:35.800 align:middle line:84%
in terms of her waking days,
and she can sense into us.

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:40.420 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of where we exist,
what we are not being tapped in,

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:42.850 align:middle line:84%
it is as if the
radio is turned off.

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:47.220 align:middle line:84%
So it is simply the
energy of our isness

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:48.720 align:middle line:84%
that is floating
through the ethers.

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.178 align:middle line:84%
And when you turn
the radio on, you

00:27:50.178 --> 00:27:51.610 align:middle line:90%
are able to hear the messages.

00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:55.200 align:middle line:84%
It is not, however,
that we after this

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.410 align:middle line:84%
encounter, go and
order a pizza and sit

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:00.480 align:middle line:84%
on our planet
having conversations

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.172 align:middle line:90%
with the other entities.

00:28:02.172 --> 00:28:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
ever had a pizza?

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:04.773 align:middle line:90%
>>VAGREIN: No we have not.

00:28:04.773 --> 00:28:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
missing something.

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>>VAGREIN: We are.

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:09.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you believe in God?

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>>VAGREIN: We believe that God
or your concept of God is close

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:15.630 align:middle line:84%
or your concept is close
to what we describe

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:17.470 align:middle line:90%
when we do talk of all that is.

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:20.350 align:middle line:84%
It has been personified
sometimes to our benefit,

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:21.910 align:middle line:90%
sometimes to our detriment.

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:29.350 align:middle line:84%
So belief in God would also
ask the question, well to you,

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:31.320 align:middle line:90%
what does that word mean?

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you see the future?

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VAGREIN: We see all of
the potential futures, which

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:36.510 align:middle line:90%
is infinite.

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:40.680 align:middle line:84%
So we do not speak on the future
because that future is written

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:44.140 align:middle line:84%
by that being that
is in front of you

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:46.600 align:middle line:84%
when you are looking through
your eyes in each now moment.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.240 align:middle line:84%
Every choice you
make is shifting

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.010 align:middle line:84%
to a timeline in which that
choice then cascades on.

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Only because you are in linear
time, cascades on to a future.

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:56.710 align:middle line:90%
It is a future, not the future.

00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And understanding that
gives you a lot more power.

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.662 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the future something
that will be or could be?

00:29:02.662 --> 00:29:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>VAGREIN: It is
always a could be.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:05.350 align:middle line:90%
It is hypothetical.

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:06.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So we have free choice?

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:07.980 align:middle line:90%
>>VAGREIN: You do.

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We can
alter the future.

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:10.590 align:middle line:90%
>>VAGREIN: Yes you can.

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:12.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Will we?

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>>VAGREIN: That is up to you
in that they are all available.

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Every single possible
thing you can imagine

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:20.260 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely available.

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is also why you
have such entertainment when

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:26.915 align:middle line:84%
you watch your TV programming
and when you watch your movies.

00:29:26.915 --> 00:29:28.290 align:middle line:84%
Because what you
are doing is you

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:30.960 align:middle line:84%
are manifesting in
a form that does not

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.940 align:middle line:84%
feel like it is directly
related to your linear path.

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:38.100 align:middle line:84%
Examples of the what could
be or what is already,

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:40.610 align:middle line:84%
your imagination is
fantastic for manifesting

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:43.620 align:middle line:84%
your potential futures, if
you would like to do so.

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes that
manifests as anxiety.

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:47.220 align:middle line:84%
Other times, it
manifests as excitement.

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:49.860 align:middle line:84%
But you do tap into that
energy quite frequently.

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:53.850 align:middle line:84%
You can change the future
because there is no future.

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:55.800 align:middle line:90%
There is only each now moment.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And everything you do
in each now moment, yes,

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:02.405 align:middle line:84%
changes the future because the
only the future that there is

00:30:02.405 --> 00:30:04.830 align:middle line:84%
is the one that stems from
the one that you are on.

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:09.120 align:middle line:84%
So if you would or do want to
change the future, first of all,

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.370 align:middle line:84%
do not entertain
any other futures.

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Entertain the end goal
that you are wanting

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:16.910 align:middle line:84%
and act as if you are
heading towards that end

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:19.400 align:middle line:84%
goal with every choice
that you are making.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you like
to ask me a question?

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:24.350 align:middle line:90%
>>VAGREIN: Yes.

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:25.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go ahead.

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>>VAGREIN: We would like to ask
you one of the questions that

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.890 align:middle line:90%
is often asked to our vessel.

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And that is what made you step
into the service in the way

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:37.077 align:middle line:90%
that you did?

00:30:37.077 --> 00:30:38.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is something
I personally wanted

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:42.150 align:middle line:90%
to do since I was a young boy.

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:46.440 align:middle line:84%
I felt it was my
mission, my calling.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.160 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I did.

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VAGREIN: And what gave you
the faith that it was possible?

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:57.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My inner being,
myself, my realization

00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:00.600 align:middle line:84%
that I could get the message
out to people who need it.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.330 align:middle line:90%
And this planet needs it.

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:04.530 align:middle line:90%
>>VAGREIN: Indeed.

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is what our
messaging mirrors in that.

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:11.550 align:middle line:84%
That faith that
you had in yourself

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:14.850 align:middle line:84%
is exactly what
allowed you to create

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:17.230 align:middle line:90%
the world that you created.

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And that did allow you to get
this message out to so many.

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you saw
destruction happening,

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.197 align:middle line:84%
would you notify
us and let us know?

00:31:26.197 --> 00:31:27.780 align:middle line:84%
>>VAGREIN: No, because
there's nothing

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:29.650 align:middle line:84%
wrong with the
destruction happening.

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:31.875 align:middle line:84%
You see, you are
not the first beings

00:31:31.875 --> 00:31:34.250 align:middle line:84%
that have been on this planet
nor are you the only beings

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:35.520 align:middle line:90%
that are on this planet.

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nor will
we be the last.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>>VAGREIN: Indeed.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And all that is is looking
out for all that is.

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:43.220 align:middle line:84%
So whenever something
is occurring

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:46.020 align:middle line:84%
that humans do not find to
be their preference, great.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:48.890 align:middle line:84%
It means that there is more
information for humans of what

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:50.490 align:middle line:90%
their preference actually is.

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And that particular
thing is something

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.840 align:middle line:84%
that they then, with
their free will,

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:57.770 align:middle line:84%
can go ahead and work
upon and grow through

00:31:57.770 --> 00:31:59.220 align:middle line:90%
and experience through.

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:00.900 align:middle line:90%
It does happen all the time.

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And so there's no reason for
us to alarm anyone of anything

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:07.730 align:middle line:84%
because nothing has
ever really gone wrong.

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:12.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why have you selected
Jessie Herman as a vehicle

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.810 align:middle line:90%
to get your message through?

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>>VAGREIN: Well, it is the
willingness again of this vessel

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:21.380 align:middle line:84%
to be available for this
particular message and also

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:25.790 align:middle line:84%
the ability or the potentials
that were cultivated

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:27.920 align:middle line:84%
in this vessel to
allow for this to be

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:31.910 align:middle line:84%
the crossroads of our
energy and theirs.

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:34.578 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
end up picking her?

00:32:34.578 --> 00:32:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>>VAGREIN: Well, it
is like anything.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.470 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this is a good point
because whenever something

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:42.450 align:middle line:84%
is wanting to be called
through by the collective,

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:48.660 align:middle line:84%
a sort of tally goes out to see,
well, where are the candidates.

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And this could be inventions,
or this could be artwork,

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:52.860 align:middle line:90%
or this could be music.

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:55.380 align:middle line:84%
It really is anything that
you are wanting to call in.

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And then the most
willing candidate

00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:58.920 align:middle line:90%
generally gets the contract.

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:03.020 align:middle line:84%
It is quite similar
to any of the projects

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:04.440 align:middle line:90%
that you create on your planet.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:07.160 align:middle line:84%
So being open, if
you are a human that

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.990 align:middle line:84%
does want to step
into service, being

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:11.720 align:middle line:84%
open to what the universe
is calling through

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:16.490 align:middle line:84%
and allowing yourself to
hear that call and yes

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:18.200 align:middle line:90%
place your application perhaps.

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.490 align:middle line:84%
She did not know she was
placing her application,

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:21.990 align:middle line:90%
but that journey was a long one.

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:24.140 align:middle line:84%
It did start with
her own willingness

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:26.180 align:middle line:84%
to begin meditation
and then willingness

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:28.610 align:middle line:84%
to be open to new
concepts, et cetera.

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:32.770 align:middle line:84%
So it was a who applied
when the job became

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:36.550 align:middle line:84%
open type of situation and who
had the skills for that job.

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you hopeful
for the future of humanity?

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>>VAGREIN: We are in that we
do have a relationship with you

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:45.440 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:47.860 align:middle line:84%
We do quite enjoy our
interaction with you.

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:50.720 align:middle line:90%
And therefore, we would--

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.770 align:middle line:84%
and part of our mission is,
because we are so connected

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:58.040 align:middle line:84%
with your desires, is we feed
on your hope for humanity.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:01.420 align:middle line:84%
It is quite difficult
at times for you

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:03.110 align:middle line:90%
when you are losing hope.

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:05.350 align:middle line:90%
So we can bolster that.

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:09.139 align:middle line:84%
And we can help to
maintain that hope for you

00:34:09.139 --> 00:34:11.560 align:middle line:84%
when you tune into
those energies

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:15.070 align:middle line:84%
that you would consider to
be along the same frequency

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:17.320 align:middle line:90%
as our transmissions.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:20.179 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thank you for
spending time with us today.

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:21.219 align:middle line:90%
>>VAGREIN: We thank you.

00:34:21.219 --> 00:34:25.389 align:middle line:84%
And we leave you with the light
and the love of a thousand suns.

00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:26.955 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Please
bring Jessie back.

00:34:26.955 --> 00:34:33.550 align:middle line:90%


00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:37.120 align:middle line:90%
You don't remember anything?

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: OK, let's see
if there was any visuals.

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:41.480 align:middle line:84%
They talked about a
leaf at one point.

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.614 align:middle line:90%
I often see the leaf.

00:34:42.614 --> 00:34:45.489 align:middle line:90%


00:34:45.489 --> 00:34:48.310 align:middle line:90%
And no, I don't.

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:49.670 align:middle line:90%
Oh, they asked you questions.

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They asked me.

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:50.389 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Yeah.

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:51.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They
asked me for money.

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:52.370 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Oh, really?

00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, I'm kidding.

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:54.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm kidding.

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:54.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: And did you say yes?

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:55.790 align:middle line:90%
You signed something?

00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:57.760 align:middle line:90%
Really.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.360 align:middle line:90%
They were very interesting.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Great.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:01.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad.

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And extremely hopeful.

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Yeah.

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:07.250 align:middle line:84%
They're very loving energy,
even though they're--

00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:08.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they like you.

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Yeah.

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:10.572 align:middle line:90%
We get along now.

00:35:10.572 --> 00:35:11.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They like you a lot.

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:12.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Yeah.

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:14.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was an
interesting session.

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:15.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: I'm glad.

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You definitely
have to watch it on tape.

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: I will.

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:18.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:19.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:22.540 align:middle line:84%
I always feel very dopey
after the sessions end

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:26.210 align:middle line:84%
and filled with just
this bliss energy.

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:30.380 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just, yeah,
feeling wonderful.

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:32.131 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
gifted as a child?

00:35:32.131 --> 00:35:33.673 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: I had a
lot of experiences,

00:35:33.673 --> 00:35:34.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Anything unusual?

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: Very interesting
experiences, both paranormal

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.000 align:middle line:90%
and extraterrestrial.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like what?

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: So
paranormal experiences

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:44.170 align:middle line:84%
would be seeing
ghosts, what could be

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:45.380 align:middle line:90%
known as ghosts in the house.

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:46.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Spirits?

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:46.730 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Spirits.

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:47.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And the ET experiences
were sort of being--

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:52.940 align:middle line:84%
and these memories
only came back later,

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:58.370 align:middle line:84%
but being taken onto crafts
and having exercises to do,

00:35:58.370 --> 00:36:02.557 align:middle line:84%
playing, trying to lift things,
telekinesis, things like that.

00:36:02.557 --> 00:36:05.140 align:middle line:84%
There were exercises you were
meant to do, almost like school.

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:07.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you believe you
were abducted as a child?

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:08.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Yeah.

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:09.640 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't call it
abducted, though.

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.320 align:middle line:90%
That word is a little--

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Kidnap-ish.

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:16.370 align:middle line:90%
So more so, yeah interacting.

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:17.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Borrowed?

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:18.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Borrowed?

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:19.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:23.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
your parents tell you?

00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:25.173 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: Well, they--
actually, that was probably

00:36:25.173 --> 00:36:28.120 align:middle line:84%
why I suppressed the gifts
is that they weren't really

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:31.700 align:middle line:84%
receptive to listening to me or
to believing what I was saying.

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:34.030 align:middle line:84%
I got accused of having
an overactive imagination

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:38.330 align:middle line:84%
or wanting attention or
just simply it wasn't true.

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:39.380 align:middle line:90%
Stop talking about it.

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:40.220 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:43.670 align:middle line:84%
I did stop talking about it
and not get it all-- not really

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:45.880 align:middle line:84%
just not share anything
that was happening for me.

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You underwent
psychological testing.

00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: I did.

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:49.822 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:49.822 --> 00:36:50.622 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:36:50.622 --> 00:36:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: So I wasn't
doing good in school.

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the teachers
had suggested perhaps

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:59.080 align:middle line:84%
she has a learning
deficiency or a low IQ

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:01.130 align:middle line:84%
or something's going
on with this person.

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:05.560 align:middle line:84%
So I had this testing,
which is strange

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:08.530 align:middle line:84%
because I don't know if it
actually was an IQ test.

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Because the tests that were
being done in my memory

00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:14.020 align:middle line:84%
were very similar to
the sort of things

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:17.000 align:middle line:84%
that I was doing in the
extraterrestrial spaces,

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.600 align:middle line:84%
so checking if I
had ESP or checking

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.890 align:middle line:84%
if I could solve problems
that were not solvable,

00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:22.820 align:middle line:90%
things like that.

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And I got a transmission
to say, don't get it right.

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:28.290 align:middle line:90%
Don't use your gifts right now.

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:29.090 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't.

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:31.822 align:middle line:84%
And they went back to the
school and said, no, there's

00:37:31.822 --> 00:37:32.780 align:middle line:90%
nothing wrong with her.

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:33.590 align:middle line:90%
Her IQ is great.

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:34.850 align:middle line:90%
If anything, she's just bored.

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:36.897 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you part of
an ET training program?

00:37:36.897 --> 00:37:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: I feel
like that's possible.

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:41.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't have concrete
sort of understanding yet,

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:44.770 align:middle line:84%
but that is something that's
sort of in the back of my mind

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:46.760 align:middle line:84%
as maybe that's
what was going on.

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do your
friends, your associates,

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.190 align:middle line:84%
have they had any
involvement in any of this?

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:52.935 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: In terms
of Vagrein or?

00:37:52.935 --> 00:37:53.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All of this.

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:54.802 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Everything.

00:37:54.802 --> 00:37:59.260 align:middle line:84%
So what I hypothesize, and
I don't have confirmation

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:04.930 align:middle line:84%
from the ET people that or
beings that I interact with,

00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:09.190 align:middle line:84%
is I think that as a kid,
I was trained or tested

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:11.410 align:middle line:90%
because of some predisposition.

00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And that at some
point in my life,

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:18.230 align:middle line:84%
I was given a new
job, kind of like,

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:20.063 align:middle line:84%
I think what Vagrein
was just talking about.

00:38:20.063 --> 00:38:22.190 align:middle line:84%
They were talking about
a job hunt type of thing.

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:24.650 align:middle line:84%
That is something they
were saying just now.

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And they were like, OK,
well, this particular person

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.700 align:middle line:84%
that we have worked with for
a long time has the ability

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:31.850 align:middle line:90%
to bring this through.

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:33.290 align:middle line:90%
And now that's her job.

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you been involved
in a hybridization program?

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:37.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Yeah.

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:39.560 align:middle line:84%
So I think that was my
job before channeling.

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:42.700 align:middle line:84%
That was the assignment
before channeling.

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me what
you remember about that.

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:45.860 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: OK.

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:50.090 align:middle line:84%
So when I was probably
in my early teens,

00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:52.930 align:middle line:84%
there was an energy that was
very frequently around me

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:55.713 align:middle line:84%
that was felt like it was
very connected with me.

00:38:55.713 --> 00:38:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And again, that was something
that I was still repressing.

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:02.470 align:middle line:84%
So that I feel like that was
probably my first hybrid child.

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:05.530 align:middle line:84%
But later in life, and this is
when the memories started coming

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:08.180 align:middle line:90%
back, I had a miscarriage.

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:11.500 align:middle line:84%
That was what's called a missed
miscarriage in a pregnancy

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:13.190 align:middle line:90%
between my daughter and my son.

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And what occurs in
that is the heartbeat

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:18.980 align:middle line:84%
just stops, so
there's no heartbeat.

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And when I checked in with my
higher self, guides, et cetera,

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:25.430 align:middle line:84%
about that, and this was
way before I was channeling,

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:29.940 align:middle line:84%
I was told that actually
that being had been extracted

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:34.410 align:middle line:84%
and went to be grown
on a ship, that there

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:36.900 align:middle line:84%
was this hybridization
program going on.

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And then reflected in that--
and there were lots of instances

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:44.790 align:middle line:84%
throughout my younger years,
including autoimmune disease

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:46.350 align:middle line:84%
and lots of
different things that

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:48.780 align:middle line:84%
were going on that I
started to get information

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:52.410 align:middle line:84%
about an involvement on a
biological physical level

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:55.020 align:middle line:90%
with something extraterrestrial.

00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:56.620 align:middle line:90%
So that was really interesting.

00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And then I had a second
pregnancy shortly afterwards.

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:00.960 align:middle line:90%
It was my son.

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.028 align:middle line:90%
And he was a twin originally.

00:40:03.028 --> 00:40:04.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These are
human pregnancies?

00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Yes.

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:06.370 align:middle line:90%
These are human pregnancies.

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:08.290 align:middle line:90%
And he was a twin.

00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And the second baby
disappeared, which

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:12.155 align:middle line:90%
apparently happens quite a lot.

00:40:12.155 --> 00:40:14.290 align:middle line:84%
I think it's called
vanishing twin syndrome,

00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:17.692 align:middle line:84%
which lots of people don't know
about until it happens to you.

00:40:17.692 --> 00:40:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And again, there I
was told that this

00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:22.410 align:middle line:84%
was part of what I had
signed up for in terms

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:24.480 align:middle line:84%
of the hybridization
program, and that that

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.938 align:middle line:84%
was a different
kind of experiment,

00:40:25.938 --> 00:40:28.920 align:middle line:84%
that that baby was
somewhere else and still is,

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:29.720 align:middle line:90%
as far as I know.

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:33.540 align:middle line:90%


00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:34.630 align:middle line:90%
And then I was out.

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:36.190 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I'm
ending this contract.

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:37.523 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do this anymore.

00:40:37.523 --> 00:40:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And so that's when that
kind of energy ended.

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's also when a lot
of my health issues ended.

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:46.210 align:middle line:84%
So that was really an
interesting coincidence.

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:48.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you leave
the hybridization program

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:49.570 align:middle line:90%
on your own?

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:50.370 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Yeah.

00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:55.830 align:middle line:84%
I really, really recall the
pain from having lost the twin

00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:59.435 align:middle line:84%
and going to bed with the
conscious understanding of OK,

00:40:59.435 --> 00:41:01.060 align:middle line:84%
the next time I meet
with these beings,

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:03.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell them that
I'm not doing that anymore.

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually
really quite close

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:06.370 align:middle line:90%
to when I began channeling.

00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
they think of you?

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: My
understanding is that it's

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.850 align:middle line:90%
like a work arrangement.

00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:14.065 align:middle line:90%
It's like colleagues.

00:41:14.065 --> 00:41:15.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I asked them that.

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Yeah.

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:16.678 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They like you.

00:41:16.678 --> 00:41:17.478 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: OK.

00:41:17.478 --> 00:41:18.300 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:19.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:22.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they seem to have
selected you out of anybody

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:23.770 align:middle line:90%
they could have picked.

00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:25.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Yeah, but it's not--

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.160 align:middle line:90%
it's right place, right time.

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:30.712 align:middle line:84%
Like everything that's
your-- your mission, right?

00:41:30.712 --> 00:41:32.620 align:middle line:84%
There has to be a
collaboration, right?

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:35.100 align:middle line:84%
I think your answer was
something along the lines of you

00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:36.040 align:middle line:90%
felt it, right?

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:37.000 align:middle line:90%
You felt you had a mission.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that was the same
experience I had growing up.

00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:41.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't think up until I
got to very close to when

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:44.410 align:middle line:84%
I began channeling did I know
I was here for a purpose.

00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:47.860 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as I
did, you just know.

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:48.910 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:50.950 align:middle line:84%
So if there's that collaboration
with the universe, great.

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:51.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm in.

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
do publicly to teach

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:56.790 align:middle line:90%
other people this message?

00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: So I share
a lot on YouTube.

00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:00.460 align:middle line:90%
I share a lot in events.

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:05.710 align:middle line:84%
I share a lot really in
any way I can try to.

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:08.280 align:middle line:84%
I also have a podcast in
which I interview other people

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.000 align:middle line:90%
because that's lots of fun.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.750 align:middle line:84%
So that podcast is more
accessible to people

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:14.572 align:middle line:84%
who are maybe just
coming to spirituality,

00:42:14.572 --> 00:42:16.780 align:middle line:84%
who are in that space before
they know their mission,

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:19.030 align:middle line:84%
or maybe they know it but
they're a little bit afraid.

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And so they hear the
experiences of different people

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:24.750 align:middle line:84%
and how they went from, let's
say, a normal everyday life

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:26.410 align:middle line:84%
to some spiritual
gift that they have

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:28.480 align:middle line:84%
or to some calling
that they had.

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's called the Some
Kind of Mystic podcast

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:32.460 align:middle line:84%
because I believe
we're all mystics.

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:33.910 align:middle line:90%
And I really enjoy that.

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:36.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's another route in which
I try to share these messages.

00:42:36.850 --> 00:42:39.070 align:middle line:84%
That's not necessarily
mostly Vagrein,

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:41.355 align:middle line:90%
but that's ways I try to share.

00:42:41.355 --> 00:42:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And then I also
do life coaching.

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This journey hasn't
been totally pleasant for you.

00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: No.

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You've had cancer.

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Yes.

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:48.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:50.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did you beat it?

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: So I
had breast cancer.

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:54.430 align:middle line:84%
I discovered it very
early, which was great.

00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:58.360 align:middle line:84%
I actually discovered a
non-cancerous tumor first,

00:42:58.360 --> 00:42:59.947 align:middle line:90%
which was getting quite large.

00:42:59.947 --> 00:43:01.030 align:middle line:90%
And they had that removed.

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:03.655 align:middle line:84%
And while they were having that
removed, I said, you know what?

00:43:03.655 --> 00:43:07.060 align:middle line:84%
There's something going on
with this other part of my body

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:07.860 align:middle line:90%
just here.

00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:09.250 align:middle line:84%
While you're in there
for the surgery,

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:11.645 align:middle line:84%
for the thing that just is
fine, just take that out too.

00:43:11.645 --> 00:43:12.520 align:middle line:90%
And they tested that.

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And that indeed
was breast cancer.

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:17.860 align:middle line:84%
So I opted well, they
suggested a mastectomy.

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:20.080 align:middle line:84%
So I did go ahead and
have a mastectomy.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:22.355 align:middle line:84%
And luckily, everything was
fine with the lymph nodes

00:43:22.355 --> 00:43:24.230 align:middle line:84%
and everything was fine
with everything else,

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:26.060 align:middle line:84%
so I don't have to have
any treatment after that.

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:27.460 align:middle line:90%
You beat it.

00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:28.378 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Yeah.

00:43:28.378 --> 00:43:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Congratulations.

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:30.253 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Thank you.

00:43:30.253 --> 00:43:34.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you
think you beat it?

00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:37.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: I think that
the experience served

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:39.940 align:middle line:84%
because that was another
experience that I had that very

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:41.000 align:middle line:90%
much humbled me.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And I can directly say
that before, even though I

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:46.610 align:middle line:84%
was channeling before
that experience,

00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:50.560 align:middle line:84%
that experience and knowing that
maybe my time was limited really

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.190 align:middle line:90%
set a fire underneath of me.

00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And it put me in a position
where a lot of my distortions

00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:58.820 align:middle line:84%
or my limiting beliefs around
what it means to show up,

00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:01.480 align:middle line:84%
or what it means to present
yourself, or leave a word,

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:04.510 align:middle line:84%
market yourself, or whatever
it is, they just disappeared.

00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Because I realized, maybe
there's not that much time.

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that,
knowing that there maybe

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:11.620 align:middle line:90%
wasn't that much time--

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:13.060 align:middle line:84%
because up until
you're clear, you

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:14.477 align:middle line:84%
don't know if
you're clear, right?

00:44:14.477 --> 00:44:18.980 align:middle line:84%
So not knowing if there
was or wasn't enough time,

00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:22.420 align:middle line:84%
I also made the decision that it
didn't matter if I reach people

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:24.300 align:middle line:90%
today or after I'm gone.

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:26.430 align:middle line:84%
That the message
was more important

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:28.330 align:middle line:90%
than anything else around it.

00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:31.870 align:middle line:84%
So I got very, very
focused on my mission.

00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that
is a huge part of both

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:38.807 align:middle line:84%
why the cancer appeared in that
it was needed, that experience.

00:44:38.807 --> 00:44:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And I really have a lot
of gratitude to the growth

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:42.348 align:middle line:84%
that I had through
that experience,

00:44:42.348 --> 00:44:45.300 align:middle line:84%
and also why ultimately,
it didn't become

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:47.380 align:middle line:90%
a long term drawn out thing.

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:50.700 align:middle line:84%
I also made a pretty radical
decision in that space

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:54.563 align:middle line:84%
because the options were go
ahead and get reconstruction,

00:44:54.563 --> 00:44:56.230 align:middle line:84%
which is very much a
normal thing to do.

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:57.480 align:middle line:90%
And very good for many people.

00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you can do
that anytime you want.

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HERMAN: Yeah or not.

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:02.970 align:middle line:10%
But I didn't want to have to
go and have other surgeries

00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:04.420 align:middle line:10%
or do other things.

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:07.020 align:middle line:10%
So I said what's
actually important to me

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:09.540 align:middle line:10%
in this now moment
was to get as fast

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:12.150 align:middle line:10%
as possible back to my
mission and not be distracted

00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:13.780 align:middle line:10%
by this external thing.

00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:15.503 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's next
for Jessie Herman?

00:45:15.503 --> 00:45:17.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: What's next
for Jessie Herman?

00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:19.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, lots
of exciting things.

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:22.560 align:middle line:84%
I've got more events
coming up shortly.

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:23.360 align:middle line:90%
I've got a retreat.

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.943 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be creating more
and more events because I really

00:45:25.943 --> 00:45:27.570 align:middle line:84%
enjoy the interaction
with people.

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:29.862 align:middle line:84%
When you're channeling and
you don't remember anything,

00:45:29.862 --> 00:45:32.690 align:middle line:84%
it can be a little unsatisfying
because afterwards, the person

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:35.160 align:middle line:84%
goes off and you're like,
OK, well, an hour has gone by

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:37.160 align:middle line:84%
and I don't remember
anything, and I didn't even

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:38.660 align:middle line:84%
interact with the
person personally.

00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:40.110 align:middle line:84%
But when I go and
do live events,

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:42.950 align:middle line:84%
that's a lot of fun to interact
with people and have fun.

00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:45.427 align:middle line:84%
And a lot more books
are coming out.

00:45:45.427 --> 00:45:47.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
name of this book?

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:48.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: Speaking Ends
When Sharing Begins.

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.553 align:middle line:84%
My next one will be
called A Call to Change.

00:45:50.553 --> 00:45:53.690 align:middle line:10%
Insight is the other
book, Vagrein Insight.

00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:54.840 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And your website?

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:59.008 align:middle line:84%
>>HERMAN: My website
is www.jpherman.com.

00:45:59.008 --> 00:46:01.050 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Jessie, thanks
for being on the program.

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:01.800 align:middle line:10%
>>HERMAN: Thank you so much.

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:02.970 align:middle line:10%
It's been so lovely.

00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:05.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I love
your forthfulness.
