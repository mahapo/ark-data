00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.050 align:middle line:10%
What you are about to hear
over the next 60 minutes

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.250 align:middle line:10%
is a very fascinating,
somewhat disturbing subject.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.009 align:middle line:84%
Now, you've heard us talk about
black eyed children showing up

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.240 align:middle line:90%
at your doorstep.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.350 align:middle line:90%
Strange phenomenon.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.450 align:middle line:90%
Ghosts, and things like that.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.130 align:middle line:84%
But what you're
going to hear tonight

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.440 align:middle line:90%
is something very, very strange.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Something very, very real that
is happening on the planet.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.250 align:middle line:84%
David Paulides, of course,
is the researcher, author,

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.420 align:middle line:90%
and investigator.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.720 align:middle line:84%
He started all this with
his book, "Missing 411,"

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.180 align:middle line:84%
which dealt with people
disappearing in our public park

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.980 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.510 align:middle line:90%
They merely vanished.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.360 align:middle line:90%
David, welcome.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad you're still here.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID PAULIDES:
Thanks, George.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:01.546 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be here.

00:01:01.546 --> 00:01:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was it about
this subject that got you first

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.750 align:middle line:90%
involved in investigating?

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.300 align:middle line:10%
>>PAULIDES: Years ago I was
doing some peripheral research

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.590 align:middle line:10%
in a national park.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.200 align:middle line:10%
I noticed a couple park
rangers following me around,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.430 align:middle line:10%
which isn't that unusual, and
I went back to my location

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.840 align:middle line:10%
off the park site.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And these guys showed
up independently,

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.360 align:middle line:84%
and they said they
knew of me, and they

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.160 align:middle line:84%
had been looking into missing
people at the various parks

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.160 align:middle line:90%
that they had worked at.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.523 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And they realized
that on the front end when

00:01:31.523 --> 00:01:34.350 align:middle line:84%
somebody goes missing,
there's a lot of activity,

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.840 align:middle line:90%
there's a lot of investigation.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.782 align:middle line:84%
And then after about seven or
eight days, everything stops.

00:01:39.782 --> 00:01:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And when they tried to find
out what happened to the victim

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.640 align:middle line:84%
and get more information,
they were stymied,

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.140 align:middle line:84%
and they said something
didn't feel right.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.148 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And then subsequent
to the disappearance,

00:01:50.148 --> 00:01:53.070 align:middle line:84%
the follow up investigation
by special agents of the Park

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.230 align:middle line:90%
Service really never happened.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Weird.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.141 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Very strange.

00:01:57.141 --> 00:01:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
you know, somebody

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.019 align:middle line:90%
ought to be looking into this.

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Because the people were
disappearing in areas

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.370 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't think that
would fit that normal mode,

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.090 align:middle line:84%
meaning that you and I, say,
take our kids to the park

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.730 align:middle line:84%
and a child disappears
in a valley area

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.320 align:middle line:90%
where there's a lot of activity.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And we're not talking far
back into the back country.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.050 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these occur
right in a populated area

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.950 align:middle line:90%
of the national park.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In front
of other people?

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.670 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Apparently.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.470 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.220 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: As we
can logically assume,

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.450 align:middle line:84%
when people go into the
back country, things happen.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And those disappearances
occur as well,

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.660 align:middle line:84%
but it's those valley
disappearances that

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.285 align:middle line:90%
got my interest right away.

00:02:35.285 --> 00:02:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And of course, your mind
may go immediately to, well,

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.030 align:middle line:84%
it's some kind of person
to person involvement.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.360 align:middle line:84%
Some sicko out
there, or something.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Right.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.031 align:middle line:84%
But when you get
into the numbers,

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:46.530 align:middle line:84%
when you start to
vet the cases, you

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.330 align:middle line:84%
realize that something
more is going on

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.796 align:middle line:90%
than what's readily apparent.

00:02:49.796 --> 00:02:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: David, of
the missing people--

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.080 align:middle line:84%
we'll get into a lot
of cases tonight--

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.390 align:middle line:90%
how many never show up?

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.330 align:middle line:84%
Where they don't, for
example, find the bodies?

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.680 align:middle line:90%
They're just gone.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.477 align:middle line:90%
What's that percent?

00:03:02.477 --> 00:03:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: It's
probably close to 50.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.380 align:middle line:90%
Maybe 60%.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just never show up?

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.010 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Massive searches.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.840 align:middle line:90%
Hundreds of people.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.150 align:middle line:90%
Air, ground, dogs.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.360 align:middle line:90%
And they can't find the people.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And if they do find them,
they're usually found deceased.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And the strange
part of our research

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.870 align:middle line:84%
has found that when
these people are located,

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.030 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes they're found
in an area that had been

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.750 align:middle line:90%
searched sometimes dozens--

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:30.640 align:middle line:90%
hundreds of times.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like they're put back
later, or something like that?

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: You
know, I never say

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.150 align:middle line:84%
that this is the fault
of the searchers.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't think, just as
you said, that the missing

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.910 align:middle line:84%
were in that location when
it was originally searched.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of the-- let's say
50% that are found dead--

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.490 align:middle line:84%
are they always found dead, or
are some of them found alive?

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:50.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: There's a
very small percentage

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:51.655 align:middle line:90%
that are found alive.

00:03:51.655 --> 00:03:52.946 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Small-- small percent.

00:03:52.946 --> 00:03:56.950 align:middle line:84%
OK, so of the let's say
the 50% of the missing that

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.920 align:middle line:84%
are found dead, what percent
would you obviously say

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.540 align:middle line:90%
that person was murdered?

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.860 align:middle line:84%
He's butchered, he's stabbed,
somebody shot him in the head--

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.080 align:middle line:90%
what's that percent?

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.900 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Zero.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Zero?

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And the reason I
say that is because there's

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.950 align:middle line:84%
a certain vetting
policy we have that

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.470 align:middle line:90%
gets the cases in front of us.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.020 align:middle line:84%
So if it's an obvious
case of a shooting,

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.660 align:middle line:84%
a murder on the trail,
we won't even look at it.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.910 align:middle line:84%
It's not even included
in our research.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.490 align:middle line:84%
Those incidents
occur highly rare,

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.090 align:middle line:84%
and when people
question me about that

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.760 align:middle line:84%
and we're here in Colorado,
I tell them, well,

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.960 align:middle line:84%
if you and I went
out on a trail,

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.900 align:middle line:84%
80% of the people in the
trail are carrying guns.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:42.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.500 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.320 align:middle line:90%
And they should.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.200 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Right.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And if there's an
incident out there,

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.580 align:middle line:84%
you're going to hear about
a shootout on a trail

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.120 align:middle line:90%
when it just doesn't happen.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.920 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: So the incidents
where there's a murderer

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.910 align:middle line:90%
on the trail--

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.280 align:middle line:84%
you know, you read about
those and they make big press.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.840 align:middle line:84%
But the cases we're
talking about?

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.310 align:middle line:84%
They really don't make big
press a lot of the times.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Many of the times you
never hear about it,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.880 align:middle line:84%
except maybe a small town
local newspaper or media.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.394 align:middle line:90%
So it's very rare.

00:05:08.394 --> 00:05:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: All right,
to set the scene,

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.300 align:middle line:84%
you have a movie out now
called "Missing 411,"

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.370 align:middle line:90%
which is absolutely astounding.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.410 align:middle line:90%
We have the trailer.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.720 align:middle line:90%


00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.750 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm an abductee's mother.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.290 align:middle line:10%
I was visiting my parents
in Ritter, Oregon.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.240 align:middle line:10%
And so I said, well,
where's your brother?

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.760 align:middle line:10%
And he said, oh, he
went around the barn.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:38.520 align:middle line:10%
Then we went back to find
him, and he wasn't there.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.450 align:middle line:10%
>> According to
Oregon State Police,

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.930 align:middle line:10%
there are 41 missing
children in Oregon.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.450 align:middle line:10%
>> It's unknown what
happened to these people.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.330 align:middle line:10%
It extends far beyond just kids.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Hundreds of people vanish
from our national parks

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.340 align:middle line:10%
and forests under very unusual
but very similar circumstances.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.650 align:middle line:10%
>> In a lot of these
cases, search and rescue,

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.720 align:middle line:10%
or the volunteer
searching people,

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.730 align:middle line:10%
have already gone over certain
areas not once, not twice,

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.190 align:middle line:10%
but even dozens of times.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.020 align:middle line:10%
And then the child
is found there--

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.070 align:middle line:10%
maybe a year, maybe
a few years later.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.500 align:middle line:10%
>> To think that I'm actually
sitting here, holding my son.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.340 align:middle line:10%
But this is-- this is
what I have left of him.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.900 align:middle line:10%
>> We're talking
about a very large,

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.390 align:middle line:10%
even worldwide collective
of information here.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.140 align:middle line:10%
>> We turned around, and here
was this little toddler walking

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.230 align:middle line:10%
out of the fog with absolutely
no clothes on at all.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.046 align:middle line:10%
>> It's troubling.

00:06:33.046 --> 00:06:33.930 align:middle line:10%
You know?

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.750 align:middle line:10%
I got members of my
search and rescue

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.159 align:middle line:10%
that aren't sleeping too well.

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:40.700 align:middle line:10%
>> If you have areas that you
don't even know there's missing

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.720 align:middle line:10%
people, it makes it really
difficult to reinvestigate when

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.840 align:middle line:10%
more information comes.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Some of these
situations are so unusual,

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.260 align:middle line:10%
you have to think beyond
the bounds of what's normal.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.030 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the
reports says, well,

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.640 align:middle line:10%
the reason why you didn't
find any DNA or blood,

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.980 align:middle line:10%
or anything on Jared's
clothing is because either he

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.710 align:middle line:10%
or something removed
his clothing.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.452 align:middle line:10%
There's just too much.

00:07:02.452 --> 00:07:04.660 align:middle line:10%
There are too many questions
that don't have answers.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.190 align:middle line:90%


00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.650 align:middle line:10%
>> The family's been
accused of drug use,

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.579 align:middle line:10%
and of sleeping
with certain people.

00:07:13.579 --> 00:07:15.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Everybody thinks, well,
I'll come up to a polygraph.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:16.590 align:middle line:10%
Go ahead.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:17.390 align:middle line:10%
Go right on ahead.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.510 align:middle line:10%
I have nothing to hide.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.030 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, everybody
wants an answer.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.033 align:middle line:10%
Hopefully someday
we'll come up with one.

00:07:24.033 --> 00:07:26.366 align:middle line:10%
>> Does the National Park
Service keep a list of missing

00:07:26.366 --> 00:07:27.282 align:middle line:10%
people in their parks?

00:07:27.282 --> 00:07:39.480 align:middle line:90%


00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "Missing
411" the movie.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.390 align:middle line:84%
What an amazing-- your
book, of course, is amazing.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.010 align:middle line:90%
The movie is, too, David.

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:49.970 align:middle line:84%
The research that you've put
into it is mind-boggling.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.969 align:middle line:84%
Is there anybody else doing what
you're doing in this country?

00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Not that I know of.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're out
there all by yourself?

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:57.060 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Right.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The park rangers--

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.000 align:middle line:84%
do you think they
know something,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.334 align:middle line:90%
and they're just not telling us?

00:08:02.334 --> 00:08:04.708 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: So in the movie
we spent a great deal of time

00:08:04.708 --> 00:08:05.855 align:middle line:90%
in national parks.

00:08:05.855 --> 00:08:06.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:07.689 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And
part of that process

00:08:07.689 --> 00:08:10.730 align:middle line:84%
is that you have to get a film
permit to film in the park.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And at
the beginning we

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.583 align:middle line:84%
thought, well, maybe we're going
to get some rebuff from them,

00:08:15.583 --> 00:08:17.530 align:middle line:84%
and they're going
to turn us down.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is that
everything went steamrolled,

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:21.222 align:middle line:90%
and we were walking in.

00:08:21.222 --> 00:08:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And clearly
you had to tell them

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:25.450 align:middle line:84%
why you were going to go in
there and videotape, right?

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:26.620 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: No doubt.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, in that clip
right there, there

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:32.230 align:middle line:84%
was a sheriff from
Klamath County, Oregon,

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:35.929 align:middle line:84%
and it involved the boy who
disappeared at Crater Lake.

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And he was a very
astute younger sheriff,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:45.190 align:middle line:84%
and when the boy
disappeared, he wanted

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:47.380 align:middle line:84%
to throw resources at
it, and he was held back

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.030 align:middle line:90%
by the National Park Service.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And they said hey, we're going
to look for this on our own.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:53.923 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Right after
the boy disappeared,

00:08:53.923 --> 00:08:54.990 align:middle line:90%
it started to snow.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And it snowed pretty heavy
for the next couple of days.

00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, after the Park
Service realized

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.020 align:middle line:84%
that this wasn't going to
be a quick resolution, days

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:05.560 align:middle line:84%
after the boy disappeared,
they called in the sheriff.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, he told us in the
movie, he was upset.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.670 align:middle line:84%
Because when a small
boy disappears--

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:11.740 align:middle line:84%
a small child disappears--
you've got to throw

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.440 align:middle line:90%
every resource you can at it.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.325 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And fast.

00:09:14.325 --> 00:09:14.610 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Fast.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:15.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.100 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And in that case
there was never a resolution.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.870 align:middle line:90%
The boy was never found.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about
his frustration

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.820 align:middle line:84%
with the Park Service
because of that.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't want to indict
the searchers at all,

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.760 align:middle line:84%
because the decisions are
made by people much higher

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.940 align:middle line:90%
than those searchers.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The families
must be going

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:37.724 align:middle line:84%
through all kinds of horror
when people disappear.

00:09:37.724 --> 00:09:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: You know, George,
and that's probably the most

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.720 align:middle line:90%
touching thing about this work.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Both of us being parents,
know what it's like.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Even the thought of
losing your child.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And these families
have no support.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of that seven
to eight days they continually

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.170 align:middle line:90%
say, we never hear anything.

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:58.320 align:middle line:90%
There's no follow up.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.845 align:middle line:84%
They kind of think that
they're out there by themselves

00:10:00.845 --> 00:10:02.220 align:middle line:84%
until you read
the books, and you

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.190 align:middle line:84%
realize there's hundreds
and hundreds of these cases

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.410 align:middle line:90%
with very similar tendencies.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And the Park Service
doesn't really

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.460 align:middle line:84%
want to acknowledge
any of it, and they

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.690 align:middle line:84%
don't want any of the
information to go out.

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:16.400 align:middle line:84%
When I first
started this I filed

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.440 align:middle line:84%
series of Freedom of
Information Act requests

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.930 align:middle line:84%
against the National
Park Service asking them

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.430 align:middle line:84%
for their lists
of missing people.

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And George, if you and
I walked into any medium

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.480 align:middle line:84%
sized police department
in the United States

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.188 align:middle line:84%
and asked the chief
for a list of missing

00:10:29.188 --> 00:10:31.460 align:middle line:84%
people in his jurisdiction,
or her jurisdiction--

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:31.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We'd get it.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:32.700 align:middle line:90%
We'd get it.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Within an hour.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.867 align:middle line:84%
He'd have-- or she'd
have it on her desk.

00:10:35.867 --> 00:10:37.450 align:middle line:84%
The National Park
Services, they don't

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:38.994 align:middle line:90%
keep track of that information.

00:10:38.994 --> 00:10:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
keep track of people

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.530 align:middle line:90%
disappearing in their parks?

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:43.597 align:middle line:90%
That's bizarre.

00:10:43.597 --> 00:10:44.680 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: I would agree.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.138 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would
think that there's

00:10:46.138 --> 00:10:48.850 align:middle line:84%
some clandestine operation
tracking all this right now,

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:50.195 align:middle line:90%
and they're perplexed.

00:10:50.195 --> 00:10:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Well, I--

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.990 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to some of the
best investigative journalists

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:54.520 align:middle line:84%
in the United
States, and they said

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.840 align:middle line:90%
they're outright lying to you.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: They have a
list of missing people.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They've got to.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.940 align:middle line:84%
In your opinion,
David, how many people

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.634 align:middle line:84%
are missing just from
the park systems alone?

00:11:03.634 --> 00:11:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Well,
that's-- that's tough,

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.462 align:middle line:90%
because they won't tell us.

00:11:06.462 --> 00:11:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we don't know
how far back to go, right?

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:09.470 align:middle line:90%
1700s?

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:11.420 align:middle line:90%
1800s?

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Well, just in our
research I have cases going

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:15.715 align:middle line:90%
back--

00:11:15.715 --> 00:11:17.090 align:middle line:84%
there's nine
countries that we've

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:18.480 align:middle line:90%
documented these incidents in.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.785 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: That
fit this profile.

00:11:20.785 --> 00:11:22.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same profile.

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:23.750 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And in
those nine countries

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:27.170 align:middle line:84%
we have one case goes all the
way back to 1768 in France.

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:28.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:29.660 align:middle line:84%
If you had to guess,
though-- speculate

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:33.780 align:middle line:84%
on how many total people we're
talking about disappearing?

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: So we've documented,
right now in our books,

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:37.574 align:middle line:90%
about 1,100.

00:11:37.574 --> 00:11:39.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 1,100 people--

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:40.070 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Right.

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Since this first
episode to where we are today.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.410 align:middle line:90%
And they continue.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.110 align:middle line:84%
This bizarre case--
now, this guy was found,

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:52.940 align:middle line:84%
but the Toronto firefighter
who went skiing in New York

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.910 align:middle line:84%
disappeared for
God knows how long

00:11:55.910 --> 00:12:00.800 align:middle line:84%
and ended up in California,
2,500 miles away, still

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.610 align:middle line:84%
in his ski outfit, and has
no idea how he got there.

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:06.590 align:middle line:90%
Something happened to this guy.

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:09.290 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: So he's out skiing
in the area of Lake Placid

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:10.794 align:middle line:90%
with his friends, from Toronto.

00:12:10.794 --> 00:12:12.710 align:middle line:84%
He's a captain in the
Toronto Fire Department.

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:13.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:14.780 align:middle line:90%
He's not fooling around, here.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Well, and
I don't think people

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:18.439 align:middle line:84%
understand that when you become
a policeman or a fireman,

00:12:18.439 --> 00:12:19.980 align:middle line:84%
you go through
psychological testing.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:20.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: So the person,
especially being a captain--

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:26.640 align:middle line:84%
the thought of him being
mentally unstable--

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-uh.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.100 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: I don't think so.

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:28.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: And--

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or playing
a game on his family?

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:31.580 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.900 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: I don't think so.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.860 align:middle line:84%
So the real interesting
part of that story

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:40.820 align:middle line:84%
is that I've written about
people who were skiing,

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:42.980 align:middle line:90%
who disappeared on the slopes.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:46.070 align:middle line:84%
Some were never found,
some were found later.

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Months and months later, under
really unusual conditions.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.950 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's
a lot of questions.

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:55.229 align:middle line:84%
I know he was interviewed by
the New York State Police,

00:12:55.229 --> 00:12:57.020 align:middle line:84%
and they haven't released
anything, really,

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.500 align:middle line:90%
about that interview.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And I know he's
back in Canada now.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.930 align:middle line:90%
I would love to talk to him.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'd love to
regress his hypnosis.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:06.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:09.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, did he get picked up by
a trucker who was kind enough

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.390 align:middle line:90%
to take him somewhere?

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.790 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, what do
you tell the trucker?

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:14.810 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:18.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm in my ski outfit, I
need to go to California?

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:20.500 align:middle line:90%
And does he have money on him?

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.640 align:middle line:90%
Does he eat?

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.370 align:middle line:90%
It's weird.

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Well, one
of the interesting parts

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:30.860 align:middle line:84%
of these 1,100 cases, many of
them where the victim is found,

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.740 align:middle line:90%
they have head injuries.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Head injuries that
have caused death.

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:36.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:38.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And
in his incident he

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.142 align:middle line:84%
told the press
that he thought he

00:13:40.142 --> 00:13:41.350 align:middle line:90%
had some type of head injury.

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.100 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: So that's
an interesting parallel.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And like you said, they
find him with his ski helmet

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.300 align:middle line:90%
and same clothing.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And then the real
odd thing to me

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.670 align:middle line:84%
was he said somewhere along
the line he had a haircut.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:54.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:55.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.485 align:middle line:90%
Where'd that come from?

00:13:56.485 --> 00:13:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Exactly.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Strange.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, you highlighted
in the film a lot

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.260 align:middle line:90%
of missing children cases.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.290 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about that, why
you highlighted on that.

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: So we could have
gone many gamuts with this.

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:11.050 align:middle line:84%
We could have done it about
hunters, hikers, adult,

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:12.160 align:middle line:90%
females.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.175 align:middle line:84%
We chose to do children
for one reason.

00:14:15.175 --> 00:14:16.800 align:middle line:84%
If I sat down with
you and I said,

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.910 align:middle line:84%
well, a person
disappeared at point A

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:22.660 align:middle line:84%
and he was found 5 miles
away and 2,000 feet uphill--

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.490 align:middle line:84%
well, somebody like you
and I, not a big deal.

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:27.030 align:middle line:90%
But a two-year-old child?

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-uh.

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: I don't think so.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's for that reason
we focused on children.

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:37.000 align:middle line:84%
They really can't go that
far in the wilderness.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.479 align:middle line:84%
And when they set up their
parameters to search,

00:14:40.479 --> 00:14:42.520 align:middle line:84%
they're usually searching
within those parameters

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.510 align:middle line:90%
where 95% of the kids are found.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And in
those incidents--

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.330 align:middle line:84%
just go back to the
Crater Lake incident--

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.240 align:middle line:84%
they kept going further, and
further, and further out.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.380 align:middle line:90%
They bring canines in.

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:55.490 align:middle line:84%
The canines can't
bring up a scent.

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:58.030 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden the
weather changes.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:00.370 align:middle line:84%
They bring in
professional trackers.

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:03.580 align:middle line:84%
None of these people
can find a little child.

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:04.660 align:middle line:90%
Which doesn't make sense.

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And there's no predation
evidence, either.

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that there's no attack
by a bear, a mountain lion.

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.260 align:middle line:90%
That would be a big scene.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.426 align:middle line:90%
It'd be evident.

00:15:12.426 --> 00:15:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I remember you told
me once on "Coast to Coast,"

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:18.430 align:middle line:84%
the radio show, that in some
cases when these people are

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:23.140 align:middle line:84%
disappeared, it could be
weeks, could be months,

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:28.010 align:middle line:84%
and that in some cases they're
found in their clothes.

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:29.230 align:middle line:90%
The clothes are clean.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:31.750 align:middle line:90%
No mud, no nothing.

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.880 align:middle line:84%
If you're in the wilderness
for a couple of weeks,

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:37.040 align:middle line:84%
a couple of months,
you're going to be dirty,

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.060 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
have dirt everywhere.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.220 align:middle line:90%
How could it be so pristine?

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:45.130 align:middle line:84%
It's like somebody
washed their clothes.

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: So I'm betting
that there's even more to this.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.730 align:middle line:84%
It's evident when a
searcher finds you

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:54.070 align:middle line:84%
if your clothes
are really clean,

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:58.930 align:middle line:84%
but they never mention
the body itself.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.570 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I write about
in the books is a lot of times

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:06.520 align:middle line:84%
if the person is found alive
and they get to a hospital,

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.150 align:middle line:84%
the notes in the hospital is
that there's a small fever

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:11.690 align:middle line:90%
associated with that person.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:12.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fever-- something.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:13.910 align:middle line:90%
Bruises?

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: No--
very rare, bruises.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.700 align:middle line:90%
But a small fever is evident.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.460 align:middle line:84%
They never say-- and many
times you don't get to see

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:22.900 align:middle line:90%
the medical report--

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:26.677 align:middle line:84%
I would like to know if the
body was clean, as well.

00:16:26.677 --> 00:16:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like the clothes?

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.590 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Like the clothes.

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:32.770 align:middle line:84%
So if the clothes are clean
and the body is clean,

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:34.520 align:middle line:84%
you really have
something odd going on.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.172 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: And--

00:16:36.172 --> 00:16:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it's still
odd if the clothes is clean

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:39.700 align:middle line:90%
and the body isn't clean.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:40.500 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:41.210 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: I agree.

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:42.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, the
clothes has got to get dirty

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.380 align:middle line:90%
before the body, I would think.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.100 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: You would think so.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:45.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is weird.

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:47.910 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go through
some scenarios with you

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:50.350 align:middle line:84%
that I want to ask you,
and then have you weigh it.

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:52.190 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
children you highlight

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:55.780 align:middle line:84%
in your film, "Missing
411," is DeOrr Kunz.

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:56.700 align:middle line:90%
Strange case.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:00.030 align:middle line:90%


00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:03.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, they went down there
probably 10, 15 minutes,

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.327 align:middle line:10%
and then they saw minnows.

00:17:05.327 --> 00:17:06.910 align:middle line:10%
And they were going
to go back to camp

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:09.339 align:middle line:10%
and get little man
because he loves fish.

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:12.230 align:middle line:10%
Like, he loves bugs,
stuff like that.

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:15.880 align:middle line:10%
And so they went back up
there, and DeOrr looks at Bob

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.550 align:middle line:10%
and says, where's little DeOrr?

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:20.520 align:middle line:10%
And Bob says he was right here.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:21.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Where's little DeOrr?

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.645 align:middle line:10%
He grabbed the [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:22.645 --> 00:17:23.650 align:middle line:10%
He's right there.

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:25.690 align:middle line:10%
Of course, he's not there.

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:28.900 align:middle line:10%
Grandfather claims he didn't
go inside his trailer,

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:29.860 align:middle line:10%
but I believe he did.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Police say that Isaac
Reinwand at this time is down

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:33.970 align:middle line:10%
at the creek fishing.

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:35.350 align:middle line:10%
They say they panic.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.960 align:middle line:10%
They do a search of the
immediate campground.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.382 align:middle line:10%
They look wherever they can.

00:17:39.382 --> 00:17:40.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Craziness started,
everybody's--

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.048 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they started yelling,
they started searching.

00:17:43.048 --> 00:17:45.010 align:middle line:10%
>> They searched for
about 15 to 20 minutes.

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:45.940 align:middle line:10%
No sign of them.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Dennis decided
they'd better call 911.

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:49.820 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a remote area.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.610 align:middle line:10%
You can't get cell
phone service.

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:54.720 align:middle line:10%
Jessica says, miraculously,
she got a signal.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Um, my two-year-old son--

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.735 align:middle line:10%
um, we can't find him.

00:17:58.735 --> 00:18:01.360 align:middle line:10%
>> DeOrr hops in his truck, goes
down the road to see if he can

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.650 align:middle line:10%
get better service.

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:05.090 align:middle line:10%
Both-- I mean, both of them
were on the phone with 911

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:05.890 align:middle line:10%
at the same time.

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:07.300 align:middle line:10%
You know, my son's missing.

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.190 align:middle line:10%
Can you help us?

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:13.510 align:middle line:10%
And then it's just all
been chaos from there.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What percent of the
people are just never found?

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.640 align:middle line:90%
About 50%, you were saying?

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.760 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Approximately.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a high number.

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:20.820 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: It is.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.403 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we're going to go
through some scenarios for you,

00:18:23.403 --> 00:18:25.960 align:middle line:84%
David, and I just want you
to give me the possibilities,

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.360 align:middle line:84%
because this is a very
unusual circumstance.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.100 align:middle line:90%
It's very strange.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:34.600 align:middle line:84%
In cases like the little Kunz
boy, he just disappeared.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.770 align:middle line:90%
He was gone.

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And do people hear
sounds associated

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:40.780 align:middle line:90%
with the disappearance?

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:43.690 align:middle line:84%
Like oh, mommy, or
anything like that?

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:45.070 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Never.

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And there's been a lot
of questions about why

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.290 align:middle line:90%
that Kunz case was in our film.

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:53.710 align:middle line:84%
But as we were in production,
that case happened.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Little boy in the
wilderness, we jumped on it.

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And if you understand the books,
and you understand the profile

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:03.070 align:middle line:84%
points, you'd understand
why that's in the movie.

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:05.080 align:middle line:90%
Boy disappears in a campsite--

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:05.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: --in
the midst of others.

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Nobody hears anything,
nobody sees anything.

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:12.530 align:middle line:84%
They bring the
dogs in, the dogs--

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:13.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No scent.

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Exactly.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.750 align:middle line:84%
A lot of things that
evolved, it was near water.

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:20.140 align:middle line:84%
He was just right near a
creek when he disappeared.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.098 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, they thought
he fell in the creek,

00:19:22.098 --> 00:19:23.710 align:middle line:90%
and that's why it was searched.

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:25.501 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people have
pointed to the parents

00:19:25.501 --> 00:19:28.540 align:middle line:84%
and said, well, they
have to be involved.

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, as a policeman I've been
involved in some pretty high

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:32.892 align:middle line:90%
profile cases.

00:19:32.892 --> 00:19:33.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You sure have.

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:37.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And one
of those incidents, it

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:39.370 align:middle line:90%
involved a missing girl.

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And immediately the
FBI was brought in,

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.110 align:middle line:90%
and they focused on the dad.

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:45.232 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:19:45.232 --> 00:19:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And people
have to understand

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:53.580 align:middle line:84%
that when children disappear
in amongst a group of parents,

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:56.430 align:middle line:84%
it's only natural for the
police to focus on the parent.

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: First.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.810 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Absolutely.

00:19:57.810 --> 00:19:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And the best
advice I can give any parent,

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:03.637 align:middle line:84%
give them 100% of
your cooperation.

00:20:03.637 --> 00:20:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:05.700 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Take a polygraph.

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.494 align:middle line:84%
Exclude yourself
so they can move on

00:20:07.494 --> 00:20:08.910 align:middle line:84%
and start getting
the case closed.

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:10.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And
in the Kunz case,

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:14.250 align:middle line:84%
yeah, there was a lot
of peripheral nonsense

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:16.350 align:middle line:84%
that went on, but the
truth of the matter

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:19.590 align:middle line:84%
is that the profile
points we established

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:21.360 align:middle line:84%
are evident in
that disappearance,

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.860 align:middle line:84%
and the boy still
hasn't been found,

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:25.170 align:middle line:84%
and the sheriffs are
still un-- they don't

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:26.430 align:middle line:90%
have any clue what's going on.

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:27.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bizarre.

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:28.980 align:middle line:84%
What's the percent of
adults disappearing

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.870 align:middle line:90%
compared to children?

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:32.670 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: You know,
there's probably

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:37.632 align:middle line:84%
60%, 70% adults,
20% to 30% kids.

00:20:37.632 --> 00:20:39.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
of them are alone

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:41.400 align:middle line:90%
as opposed to being in a group?

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: It's very rare when
a child disappears completely

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:46.420 align:middle line:90%
alone.

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:50.280 align:middle line:84%
They're in a setting where
parents, or relatives,

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.840 align:middle line:90%
or grandparents are nearby.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.215 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There
are people around.

00:20:53.215 --> 00:20:54.050 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Right.

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has anybody ever
said, he was right next to me?

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:04.980 align:middle line:84%
I turned my head, I blinked
my eyes, and he was gone.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:06.545 align:middle line:90%
Has that ever happened?

00:21:06.545 --> 00:21:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Did you take
that out of my book?

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:10.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: I could
say many, many times.

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:15.870 align:middle line:84%
That's almost an exact quote
from the parents or the people

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:18.210 align:middle line:90%
they were with.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:19.560 align:middle line:90%
They're walking along.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:23.700 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the child may
scoot ahead a little bit,

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.300 align:middle line:90%
fall behind just a bit.

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:29.450 align:middle line:84%
But you know when you're with
your kids they can move around.

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:30.604 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:21:30.604 --> 00:21:31.770 align:middle line:90%
But you know where they are.

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:32.930 align:middle line:90%
You feel where they are.

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:33.730 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Right.

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that that
happens more times than not.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's strange.

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:40.490 align:middle line:84%
All right, I'm going to
ask you some scenarios,

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:43.340 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of it's
speculation on your part,

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:46.040 align:middle line:84%
but I want you to
say probability.

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:50.840 align:middle line:84%
One, somebody has
disappeared in a park system

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:54.740 align:middle line:84%
because there's a murderer
out there, or a serial killer,

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:58.180 align:middle line:84%
and that person somehow
gets this person.

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And gets-- now, we
haven't negated the fact

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:02.510 align:middle line:84%
that there are other
people in the area,

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:04.130 align:middle line:90%
nobody hears anything.

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:08.270 align:middle line:84%
Those are all things we have to
really concentrate on and add

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:09.200 align:middle line:90%
to the ingredient.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.310 align:middle line:84%
But a serial killer or a
murderer just scoops them up.

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:14.870 align:middle line:90%
Possibility?

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Serial
killer I'd say 0%.

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:23.030 align:middle line:84%
A possibility of a killer
in some cases maybe 0.1%.

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:24.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to say never.

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:24.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:25.510 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: But--

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:27.047 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But very
low on the list.

00:22:27.047 --> 00:22:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Again, just
like what you cited.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.130 align:middle line:84%
Professional trackers
don't find any tracks,

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:33.170 align:middle line:84%
there's no scent trail
for the dogs to follow.

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:34.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:38.040 align:middle line:90%
All right, so there's that.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:41.700 align:middle line:84%
A UFO beams somebody aboard
and takes them that way.

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:46.180 align:middle line:84%
It just-- it's hovering miles
above the atmosphere and it

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:51.000 align:middle line:84%
spots this little kid, or this
guy who's alone and just goes--

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:51.820 align:middle line:90%
zoop.

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:52.620 align:middle line:90%
And they're gone.

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:55.450 align:middle line:90%
They're taken.

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: So one
of the things that I

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.990 align:middle line:84%
get queried about all the time
is a scenario similar to that.

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And my question
back to those people

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:10.950 align:middle line:84%
is that the victim disappears
99% of the time with others.

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:13.090 align:middle line:90%
So how come nobody sees this?

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:14.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:17.300 align:middle line:84%
It would be as if you
disappeared right here.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.290 align:middle line:90%
Poof, you're gone.

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:22.560 align:middle line:84%
I got a lot of explaining to do,
because that's a weird thing.

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.150 align:middle line:84%
But I would think
you were zapped.

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:26.100 align:middle line:84%
If you just
disappeared right now,

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.630 align:middle line:84%
that would be one
of my scenarios.

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:29.120 align:middle line:90%
But people aren't saying that.

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Never.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:30.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:33.334 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: But my question
is that if that is occurring,

00:23:33.334 --> 00:23:35.500 align:middle line:84%
then wouldn't those people
come forward and say hey,

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:36.540 align:middle line:90%
this is what we saw?

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:36.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:37.830 align:middle line:90%
You would think so.

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:40.730 align:middle line:84%
An animal grabs the
person or the kid.

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And the animal
could be a Bigfoot,

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:47.280 align:middle line:84%
it could be a mountain lion,
it could be something-- a bear.

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:50.040 align:middle line:84%
But again, that
would make sounds.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:53.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some bear that's
growling after some kid is

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:54.660 align:middle line:90%
going to make an animal sound.

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:56.310 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to be silent.

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:58.421 align:middle line:90%
But-- possibilities?

00:23:58.421 --> 00:23:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: I get
asked that, again,

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.580 align:middle line:84%
at conferences I'm
at all the time.

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
I explain to people

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:08.230 align:middle line:84%
is that when a mountain
lion or a bear grabs you,

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:09.870 align:middle line:84%
what are you
immediately going to do?

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:10.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Scream.

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:10.930 align:middle line:90%
Yell.

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:11.470 align:middle line:90%
Kick.

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Scream.

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:12.130 align:middle line:90%
Yell.

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:13.540 align:middle line:90%
Fight for your life.

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And even as a child,
we'll do the same thing.

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:20.474 align:middle line:84%
And when they grab you, and
when that predation occurs,

00:24:20.474 --> 00:24:21.640 align:middle line:90%
blood is going to be around.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:22.990 align:middle line:90%
Clothing is going to be around.

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:23.823 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:24:23.823 --> 00:24:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: There's going to
be a scene there of mass chaos.

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.146 align:middle line:84%
And then if they decide
that OK, you're dead,

00:24:29.146 --> 00:24:30.520 align:middle line:84%
and we're going
to take you away,

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.374 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be drag marks
of you going across the ground.

00:24:33.374 --> 00:24:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And somebody is
going to hear it or see it.

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:35.970 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: For sure.

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:37.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Especially if there
are witnesses in the area.

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And
then to that point

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:42.430 align:middle line:84%
I always tell people, hey, I'm
going to give you a homework

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:43.450 align:middle line:90%
assignment.

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:45.520 align:middle line:84%
When you leave here, I
want you go to Wikipedia

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.760 align:middle line:84%
and look up the number of
fatal mountain lion attacks

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:51.310 align:middle line:84%
in North America in
the last 100 years.

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:53.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not a lot.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:53.800 align:middle line:90%
Not a lot.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.424 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Is it--
is it more than 20?

00:24:55.424 --> 00:24:56.230 align:middle line:90%
Is it more than 50?

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:57.610 align:middle line:90%
Is it more than 100?

00:24:57.610 --> 00:24:59.830 align:middle line:84%
I'll just tell you
this-- it's less than 20

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:00.760 align:middle line:90%
in the last 100 years.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:01.655 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I would believe that.

00:25:01.655 --> 00:25:02.988 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: So it's really rare.

00:25:02.988 --> 00:25:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I'd
bet of those 20,

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:06.220 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot of
screaming involved

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:07.670 align:middle line:90%
by the person who got attacked.

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:08.250 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Oh, absolutely.

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:09.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A lot.

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:11.200 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Even if there
were witnesses, they saw it.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Oh my god, this thing came
down and pulled Johnny,

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:13.950 align:middle line:90%
and ripped him up.

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And took him, and there's
blood, and everything else.

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:16.600 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Sure.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
now another scenario.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And some of these are
farfetched, David--

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:26.760 align:middle line:84%
this kid-- this person somehow
walks into another dimension

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.200 align:middle line:90%
or portal.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.990 align:middle line:84%
This is a strange universe,
anything could happen.

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:34.770 align:middle line:84%
But they merely walk into a
portal or some other dimension,

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:36.090 align:middle line:90%
and they're gone.

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And they haven't quite
figured out how to come back.

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:41.410 align:middle line:90%
Possible?

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: I've been very
fortunate during this research

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.850 align:middle line:84%
to have some phenomenal
people talk to me about this.

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And not too long ago
I was in Wisconsin

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:52.230 align:middle line:84%
and I talked to Dr. John
Brandenburg, an expert

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:53.295 align:middle line:90%
on portals.

00:25:53.295 --> 00:25:53.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And our
conversation was interesting

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:59.040 align:middle line:84%
because it was free flowing
and he gave me a lot of time.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.110 align:middle line:84%
And what I asked him was
is if this is occurring,

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:04.890 align:middle line:84%
John, then why in the
middle of New York City--

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:06.510 align:middle line:84%
why aren't we walking
down the street

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:08.676 align:middle line:84%
and seeing the person in
front of us just disappear?

00:26:08.676 --> 00:26:09.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: So my question
back to him is this--

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.130 align:middle line:84%
it's almost as though the victim
gets out of sight momentarily,

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:19.560 align:middle line:90%
and they disappear.

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.810 align:middle line:84%
So my question is
that can portals

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:24.642 align:middle line:90%
be directed and targeted--

00:26:24.642 --> 00:26:25.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To the person?

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: To the person.

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By somebody.

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: By
something, someone--

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:30.440 align:middle line:84%
he goes, Dave, that's
a phenomenal question.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.050 align:middle line:90%
He goes, I'll tell you this.

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:34.634 align:middle line:84%
He says, there are
organizations right now looking

00:26:34.634 --> 00:26:35.550 align:middle line:90%
into that exact thing.

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, by god.

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: I said, so my
question isn't outrageous?

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:43.930 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, Dave-- he
said, if portals exist,

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:46.920 align:middle line:84%
then we should be able to
manipulate and target them.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.321 align:middle line:90%
That's from Brandenburg.

00:26:48.321 --> 00:26:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what am I
missing in these scenarios

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.560 align:middle line:90%
and possibilities?

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:53.680 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
a serial killer.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.080 align:middle line:90%
We've talked about portals.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.560 align:middle line:90%
We've talked about UFOs.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:59.290 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
animals that could do it.

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:01.510 align:middle line:90%
What else is left?

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Oftentimes I get,
well, they wanted to disappear.

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:08.505 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I don't
believe any child wants

00:27:08.505 --> 00:27:10.380 align:middle line:84%
to disappear from their
parents in the middle

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:11.180 align:middle line:90%
of the wilderness.

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And if we're
talking about an adult that's,

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:19.080 align:middle line:84%
again, part of the vetting
process of what we do.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:22.110 align:middle line:84%
If there's any type
of mental illness,

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:24.330 align:middle line:84%
if there's any
type of indication

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:27.740 align:middle line:84%
of voluntary disappearance,
marital issues, et cetera,

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:28.540 align:middle line:90%
we'll vet it out.

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:30.960 align:middle line:90%
We won't do it.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.190 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, maybe they
drowned in a nearby lake.

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, in most of
those incidents,

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:40.850 align:middle line:84%
the location-- the water
has been dragged many times.

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:43.440 align:middle line:90%
They put underwater sonar in it.

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes-- in
fact, the majority

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:48.050 align:middle line:84%
of times if somebody
disappears in water,

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:51.170 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be a limited
amount of time based

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:54.240 align:middle line:84%
on the temperature of the
water and the temperature

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.270 align:middle line:84%
of the atmosphere-- the
body's going to rise.

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:57.070 align:middle line:90%
It'll be found.

00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:57.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:00.110 align:middle line:90%
So let's add that as a scenario.

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:05.300 align:middle line:84%
An accidental disappearance
caused by a mishap.

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.670 align:middle line:84%
A drowning or
something, or falls off

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:09.395 align:middle line:84%
the cliff, or
something like that.

00:28:09.395 --> 00:28:11.270 align:middle line:84%
But generally you're
going to find that body.

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:13.680 align:middle line:84%
You're going to find
something else that happened.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:17.650 align:middle line:84%
So that's another scenario
that we could consider.

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:19.570 align:middle line:90%
This is still too weird.

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:25.620 align:middle line:84%
This comes back to me as a
reporter, an investigator--

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:28.880 align:middle line:84%
the answer is the
bizarre answer.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's either a portal,
a dimension, a UFO--

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.450 align:middle line:90%
something like that grabbing it.

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:35.880 align:middle line:90%
Because nothing else is logical.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: I think you and
I are at the same place.

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.030 align:middle line:84%
I like to think
of a wagon wheel,

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:43.870 align:middle line:84%
and there's spokes
in the wagon wheel.

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:44.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:47.044 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And you need, say,
five spokes for that wheel

00:28:47.044 --> 00:28:48.330 align:middle line:90%
to be stable.

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:51.060 align:middle line:84%
George, I think I'm on half
of one spoke at this point.

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.686 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:28:52.686 --> 00:28:54.310 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: People
always ask me, well,

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:56.230 align:middle line:90%
when are you going to solve it?

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:59.860 align:middle line:84%
I think as we move
forward, you have

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:02.680 align:middle line:84%
to understand the
complexity of the issue.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've written
seven books now.

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:05.524 align:middle line:10%
One book deals--

00:29:05.524 --> 00:29:07.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Your latest is
"Off The Grid," right?

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.240 align:middle line:10%
>>PAULIDES: Yeah.

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.910 align:middle line:10%
"Missing 411, Off The Grid."

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:14.260 align:middle line:10%
I wrote one book that was
specifically about young men--

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:18.280 align:middle line:10%
super healthy,
athletic, top intellects

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:20.980 align:middle line:10%
who disappeared and were
later found in rivers, ponds,

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:22.187 align:middle line:10%
and streams, dead.

00:29:22.187 --> 00:29:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Half the time they
couldn't figure out

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:27.660 align:middle line:84%
why they died, the other half
of the time it was drowning.

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.160 align:middle line:90%
Now, this was in big cities.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:33.780 align:middle line:84%
These-- the victims on this
didn't make sense when I first

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:35.580 align:middle line:90%
started to investigate it.

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:37.592 align:middle line:84%
And when you think
of a big city,

00:29:37.592 --> 00:29:39.300 align:middle line:84%
and you're thinking
about people in water

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:40.770 align:middle line:90%
that are ending up dead--

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:43.020 align:middle line:84%
to me I'm thinking
about drug dealers,

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:47.430 align:middle line:84%
drug users, alcoholics,
transients living in the river.

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:49.800 align:middle line:90%
It's never that.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And I never have
found a case like that

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.420 align:middle line:90%
when I wrote that book.

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:56.780 align:middle line:90%
So the complexity of it is huge.

00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's that case
in the former Soviet Union--

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Dyatlov Pass, where all
the skiers were dead.

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:06.700 align:middle line:90%
All of them.

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:07.991 align:middle line:90%
And they can't figure out what.

00:30:07.991 --> 00:30:10.810 align:middle line:84%
Happened it's almost
as if they said

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:13.930 align:middle line:84%
they were trying to
crawl out of their tent

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:16.720 align:middle line:90%
in a panic from within.

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.370 align:middle line:90%
Not from the outside.

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:20.110 align:middle line:90%
Scratch marks on the inside.

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:21.850 align:middle line:90%
It's weird.

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:23.890 align:middle line:84%
Do those kinds of stories
fit into this kind

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:28.120 align:middle line:84%
of category of the bizarre,
in terms of what happened?

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Donnie Eichar wrote
a book about that incident.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.931 align:middle line:90%
And he actually traveled there.

00:30:31.931 --> 00:30:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- and I've
communicated with him several

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:35.320 align:middle line:90%
times.

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.800 align:middle line:84%
One thing that's quite
different about that incident

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.210 align:middle line:84%
and every case I
have investigated

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:42.400 align:middle line:84%
is that those people
suffered horrific injuries.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:43.362 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:30:43.362 --> 00:30:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: I haven't found
any of that in any of the cases

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:47.260 align:middle line:90%
I've investigated.

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that
we're vetting him out.

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:50.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm not finding it.

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And there are a few issues with
that case that are similar,

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:56.830 align:middle line:84%
and that occurred
in a rural area,

00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:59.160 align:middle line:90%
way up in the middle of nowhere.

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:02.790 align:middle line:84%
In some of the incidents
they were missing clothing,

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:04.744 align:middle line:90%
and they were missing shoes.

00:31:04.744 --> 00:31:06.160 align:middle line:84%
They attributed
some of the deaths

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:09.370 align:middle line:84%
to hypothermia,
which is similar.

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:11.170 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
issues that, you know,

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:13.400 align:middle line:84%
if you were strong you
could link them together.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.550 align:middle line:84%
But the one thing
that separates it all

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:17.650 align:middle line:90%
is these horrific injuries.

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In this
case-- your cases--

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:20.590 align:middle line:90%
it's not happening.

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Of the 50% that are found, and
they're found dead primarily,

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:28.360 align:middle line:90%
what's the cause of death been?

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.040 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: So that's
across the board.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they can't
figure out the--

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:32.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They cannot.

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:33.349 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: They cannot.

00:31:33.349 --> 00:31:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And that in itself
is interesting.

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:39.280 align:middle line:84%
You would think with
today's pathology

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.740 align:middle line:84%
they'd find out
exactly what happened.

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: So in the
books there's coroners,

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.630 align:middle line:84%
medical examiners out there
that are reading these.

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was contacted a
couple of years ago,

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:51.850 align:middle line:90%
and I met with this one coroner.

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And we sat down, and
we started to talk,

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:56.470 align:middle line:84%
and they said, Dave,
you're on to something.

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Don't-- don't let
people confuse you,

00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:00.370 align:middle line:84%
but we've had cases
in our jurisdiction--

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:03.430 align:middle line:84%
and this person works in a
very large jurisdiction--

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:06.225 align:middle line:84%
and they said, we've
had cases just like that

00:32:06.225 --> 00:32:07.600 align:middle line:84%
where all the
coroners sit around

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.766 align:middle line:84%
and we talk about it, because
it doesn't make sense.

00:32:09.766 --> 00:32:11.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:12.760 align:middle line:90%
They just die.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:16.225 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: They just died,
and we don't have the ability

00:32:16.225 --> 00:32:17.350 align:middle line:90%
to figure out what's wrong.

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:19.031 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's interesting
about that--

00:32:19.031 --> 00:32:20.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:21.613 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: I've had
people come to me

00:32:21.613 --> 00:32:24.190 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, you don't
realize that their soul is gone,

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:25.540 align:middle line:90%
and that's why they died.

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:28.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's another
conceivable possibility.

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Their soul is taken,
and they just die.

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:31.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Is that
a cause of death?

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:32.260 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:33.135 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:32:33.135 --> 00:32:36.430 align:middle line:84%
If somebody's suffocated
or smothered--

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:38.560 align:middle line:84%
somebody captures a
little kid and suffocates

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.270 align:middle line:84%
the kid, that would show up as
a cause of death, wouldn't it?

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Absolutely.

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:43.413 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There would be
some anomaly in the lungs,

00:32:43.413 --> 00:32:44.810 align:middle line:90%
or something, that they'd see.

00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:45.650 align:middle line:90%
Some stress.

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:46.450 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Right.

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: God-- are
you baffled by this?

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:49.480 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: I am.

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's frustrating
to me because I realize

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:54.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm not the sharpest
knife in the drawer,

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:57.220 align:middle line:84%
and I talk to people daily
about these incidents.

00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And I try to encompass
myself with people that

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:03.070 align:middle line:90%
are even smarter than myself.

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:05.717 align:middle line:84%
One of those guys actually works
for you, George [INAUDIBLE]..

00:33:05.717 --> 00:33:06.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love him.

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:07.060 align:middle line:90%
My man.

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:07.860 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Yeah.

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:10.270 align:middle line:84%
George and I talk about
this all the time.

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And George is one
of those people that

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:15.100 align:middle line:84%
came up and said in the
movie that the National Park

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:16.380 align:middle line:90%
Service is outright lying.

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:16.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: They have
lists of missing people.

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:19.080 align:middle line:90%
They're just not giving it up.

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:19.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Now, in
a lot of these cases

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:25.510 align:middle line:84%
the parents get
very frustrated when

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:28.060 align:middle line:84%
the coroner comes back and
says a cause of death that

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:30.830 align:middle line:84%
doesn't make sense, or
they can't figure it out.

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, in a few of
these isolated cases

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.010 align:middle line:84%
the parents have paid
for a second autopsy.

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On their own?

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:37.360 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: On their own.

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.850 align:middle line:90%
It costs about $2,500.

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.335 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:33:40.335 --> 00:33:44.130 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And when a
normal person, you and I die,

00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:46.600 align:middle line:84%
they put our blood and urine
through drug screening.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:47.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Well, there's 20
drugs that they screen for,

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:53.550 align:middle line:84%
and they won't go outside
those bounds because of cost.

00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, in these second
autopsies the parents

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.800 align:middle line:84%
have paid for this
extraordinary amount of work,

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:01.582 align:middle line:84%
and their screening goes
from 20 to 50 to 75 drugs.

00:34:01.582 --> 00:34:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They want an answer.

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:04.290 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: They want an answer.

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:08.489 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's unusual is in the
deaths where the people were

00:34:08.489 --> 00:34:09.630 align:middle line:90%
found in water--

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:13.050 align:middle line:84%
that was "Missing 411,
A Sobering Coincidence,"

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:19.380 align:middle line:84%
in those two deaths they
found super high levels of GHB

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:22.530 align:middle line:90%
in the victim's body.

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:24.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, it doesn't
make sense that it

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:27.960 align:middle line:84%
was there, number one, because
they weren't in an environment

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.580 align:middle line:90%
to get drugged.

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And number two, they
couldn't figure out

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:35.506 align:middle line:90%
how it was administered or when.

00:34:35.506 --> 00:34:36.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Now, the body
produces very minute levels

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:41.409 align:middle line:90%
of GHB on its own.

00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:42.960 align:middle line:90%
So we've had these talks--

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:46.380 align:middle line:84%
is there some type of
event that forces the body,

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:48.389 align:middle line:84%
that we don't
understand, to produce

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:49.800 align:middle line:90%
these super high levels?

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what is GHB?

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: GHB to
most people would

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:54.870 align:middle line:90%
be known as the date rape drug.

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:55.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh.

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:56.520 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Most
of the time it's

00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:59.557 align:middle line:84%
men giving it to a woman
in a bar, leaving with her,

00:34:59.557 --> 00:35:00.356 align:middle line:90%
and raping her.

00:35:00.356 --> 00:35:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So the body doesn't
produce it naturally?

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:04.440 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Very minute amounts.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.422 align:middle line:90%
But not in amounts--

00:35:05.422 --> 00:35:07.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But not in the
amount that they found?

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:08.400 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Correct.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And essentially what it does
to you is it paralyzes you,

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.594 align:middle line:84%
but your thinking
process is still working.

00:35:15.594 --> 00:35:17.010 align:middle line:84%
You know what's
happening to you--

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:17.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You just can't move.

00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: You can't move.

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:20.216 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's frightening.

00:35:20.216 --> 00:35:23.850 align:middle line:84%
So if I take that and I give
you super high levels of GHB,

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:26.250 align:middle line:84%
and I drop you
into water, can you

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:28.180 align:middle line:84%
think about that
horrific scenario?

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:30.263 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a horrible
way to drown, isn't it?

00:35:30.263 --> 00:35:31.384 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: It is.

00:35:31.384 --> 00:35:33.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you saying
that that's happening?

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.383 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: In these few--

00:35:34.383 --> 00:35:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if it is,
who's giving them the drug?

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:40.250 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Well, the numbers
I write about, it's sobering.

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:42.140 align:middle line:90%
They're phenomenal.

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:46.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, this exact scenario is
occurring in the United Kingdom

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.100 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very famous
place, Manchester--

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:53.867 align:middle line:84%
and they're called the
Manchester canal deaths.

00:35:53.867 --> 00:35:55.450 align:middle line:84%
People go out there
and read about it.

00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:57.370 align:middle line:84%
There was a documentary
made about it.

00:35:57.370 --> 00:36:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Young men, predominantly,
who end up in a canal, dead.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.270 align:middle line:84%
The canal sometimes only
has 2 feet of water.

00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:05.710 align:middle line:90%
You could have stood up in it.

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.815 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: But they're dead.

00:36:08.815 --> 00:36:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's ever seen
someone go in,

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:13.740 align:middle line:84%
nobody's ever seen
somebody come out alive.

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:14.830 align:middle line:90%
They're all dead.

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:17.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's many areas in the
UK where this is occurring.

00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:20.190 align:middle line:84%
Also in Spain, and
in North America.

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:22.629 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do they have
this drug in their system?

00:36:22.629 --> 00:36:24.420 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Not that
I've found, but again,

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:26.639 align:middle line:84%
we go back to that
screening scenario

00:36:26.639 --> 00:36:27.680 align:middle line:90%
that the government does.

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You gotta be
able to look for it.

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:29.440 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Exactly.

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And in this particular
case, how would that drug

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.040 align:middle line:84%
have been administered
to these people?

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.300 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: That's the
million dollar question.

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:37.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:40.950 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: A lot of times it's
almost always, in these cases,

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:42.670 align:middle line:84%
people have been
drinking alcohol.

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:44.090 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes a lot of alcohol.

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:46.627 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, but it would
have to be in the alcohol.

00:36:46.627 --> 00:36:47.460 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Correct.

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:49.376 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times these
people are at parties

00:36:49.376 --> 00:36:50.400 align:middle line:90%
where nobody's around.

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they buying
it from one single source?

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: No.

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:56.350 align:middle line:84%
No, these are far
different cities.

00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:57.390 align:middle line:90%
Different continents.

00:36:57.390 --> 00:36:59.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
we're asking questions

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:00.850 align:middle line:90%
like an investigator would.

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:03.240 align:middle line:84%
They say, all right,
six people disappeared.

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.430 align:middle line:84%
They all had this
drug in their system.

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:07.485 align:middle line:90%
What's the commonality here?

00:37:07.485 --> 00:37:10.950 align:middle line:84%
Oh, they all drank
this kind of vodka.

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:12.450 align:middle line:90%
Where did they get the vodka?

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:14.430 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it came from this store.

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:16.650 align:middle line:84%
The sicko at the
store is putting

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:18.270 align:middle line:90%
this stuff in the vodka.

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:19.410 align:middle line:90%
That's not happening.

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:20.670 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Impossible.

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And they're all
drinking different types

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:25.430 align:middle line:84%
of alcohol, different
continents, different times.

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And there was a study that
was released about a year ago

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.630 align:middle line:90%
from the United Kingdom--

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:33.990 align:middle line:84%
Scotland Yard-- and they wrote
about this exact scenario

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:35.367 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about.

00:37:35.367 --> 00:37:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And they ended up with
the exact conclusions

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.760 align:middle line:90%
you and I are talking about.

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the study GHB
is never mentioned,

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:43.060 align:middle line:90%
which I thought was interesting.

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:46.856 align:middle line:84%
But then again, I haven't
seen a family in the UK

00:37:46.856 --> 00:37:48.230 align:middle line:84%
take it to the
level that these--

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:49.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For the testing.

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Right.

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They weren't
tested for it.

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:54.120 align:middle line:84%
There was a particular search
that I want us to look at.

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.580 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:58.530 align:middle line:10%
>> While it's possible that
Disch merely stepped out of his

00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:01.830 align:middle line:10%
substation and got lost in
a blizzard and nothing more,

00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:04.230 align:middle line:10%
there are many curious aspects
to this story that some

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:06.750 align:middle line:10%
Freudian researchers
have made note of.

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:09.240 align:middle line:10%
In this book, "Our Haunted
Planet," the late John Keel

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.400 align:middle line:10%
wrote of some of the
more mysterious elements

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.530 align:middle line:10%
of the vanishing of
Carl Robert Disch,

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:16.650 align:middle line:10%
including a curious quote that
appeared in "The Baltimore Sun"

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:18.900 align:middle line:10%
regarding the huskies
used in the search.

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:21.250 align:middle line:10%
Speaking to William
J. [INAUDIBLE],,

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:23.550 align:middle line:10%
a writer at the Sun,
Ron [INAUDIBLE],,

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:27.600 align:middle line:10%
Byrd station leader said, quote,
"If Disch had fallen and was

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:30.540 align:middle line:10%
lying in the snow, the huskies
would have seen him long

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:32.100 align:middle line:10%
before the searchers did.

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:35.131 align:middle line:10%
Similarly, if he had fallen and
was covered by drifting snow,

00:38:35.131 --> 00:38:36.630 align:middle line:10%
the dogs would have
discovered mound

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:38.480 align:middle line:10%
and rushed to investigate it.

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.110 align:middle line:10%
That's just the
way huskies are."

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:41.490 align:middle line:90%
Unquote.

00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:42.765 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a bizarre case.

00:38:42.765 --> 00:38:44.430 align:middle line:90%
Of course, they're all bizarre.

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:45.830 align:middle line:90%
What about this one?

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: This case
is in my latest book

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:49.860 align:middle line:84%
because it is
extremely different

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:53.220 align:middle line:90%
than a standard disappearance.

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:55.030 align:middle line:10%
Carl Disch worked
right down the road--

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.830 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: From here.

00:38:55.830 --> 00:38:59.010 align:middle line:10%
>>PAULIDES: From here, at
Boulder Labs in Colorado.

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:02.760 align:middle line:84%
He grew up in Wisconsin,
was a star football player.

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:03.900 align:middle line:90%
Super intellect.

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Athletic.

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:05.700 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Very.

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And he became a
physicist, which is one

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:10.590 align:middle line:90%
of the key points in my books.

00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:12.817 align:middle line:84%
I have documented several
cases of physicists

00:39:12.817 --> 00:39:13.650 align:middle line:90%
who had disappeared.

00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:15.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it
was-- his ancestry?

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:15.780 align:middle line:90%
Is that--

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:16.560 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: German.

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Which is
another key point.

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:21.760 align:middle line:84%
Many German physicists
have disappeared.

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:22.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.904 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And I'm not
talking about, you know,

00:39:25.904 --> 00:39:27.840 align:middle line:90%
they voluntarily-- no.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:31.050 align:middle line:84%
They all fit the scenario
we're going to talk about.

00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:35.610 align:middle line:90%
So Disch gets hired in February.

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:38.160 align:middle line:84%
He gets sent to the
Byrd ice station,

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:40.980 align:middle line:90%
and he brings his dog with him.

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And he's an
ionospheric physicist,

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:48.240 align:middle line:84%
and he works at a lab set
up from the main station,

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:51.180 align:middle line:90%
about 7,000 feet away.

00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And on May 8th, 1965 he's
working at this station.

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mhm.

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: There's
a blizzard going on.

00:39:57.450 --> 00:39:58.380 align:middle line:90%
Big one.

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And between the
two locations they

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:04.060 align:middle line:84%
have a rope that's strung
so as you're walking, even

00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:04.860 align:middle line:90%
in a blizzard--

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:05.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're holding on.

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:06.930 align:middle line:84%
You know how to get
to the other side.

00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: You're
not going to get lost.

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:08.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:10.860 align:middle line:84%
So he leaves in
the morning hours,

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:12.749 align:middle line:84%
and they wait, and
wait, and wait.

00:40:12.749 --> 00:40:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And after an hour and a
half the two guys go out,

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:16.350 align:middle line:90%
and they look for him.

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:17.760 align:middle line:90%
Can't find him.

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:20.820 align:middle line:84%
So they call everybody
together, and they

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:22.920 align:middle line:84%
get in their big winter
suits, and they get out

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:25.410 align:middle line:84%
their tractors and
their snow buggies,

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:26.580 align:middle line:90%
and they're looking for him.

00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:26.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:middle line:84%
I'd say the guy had a heart
attack, he's in the snow

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:29.370 align:middle line:90%
somewhere.

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:29.550 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:29.860 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Of course.

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:30.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:33.319 align:middle line:84%
And he's made this
trip hundreds of times.

00:40:33.319 --> 00:40:34.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not like he's
going to get lost.

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:35.812 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:40:35.812 --> 00:40:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: So they search
for him for a week--

00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:39.900 align:middle line:90%
they find nothing.

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And he had called his
parents in the weeks before.

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:47.400 align:middle line:84%
He said everything was great,
no problem, he's learning a lot.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.660 align:middle line:90%
He's enjoying this experience.

00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:52.640 align:middle line:84%
So during that
week period of time

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.370 align:middle line:84%
they called for more
assistance from other people

00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:56.810 align:middle line:90%
at other nearby stations.

00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:58.430 align:middle line:90%
They find nothing.

00:40:58.430 --> 00:41:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And they brought
in dogs, and they

00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:04.250 align:middle line:84%
thought even his own dog,
if they brought it out,

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:05.230 align:middle line:90%
would find him.

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:06.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:06.830 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Right.

00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:07.820 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, since the time
Disch disappeared

00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:12.320 align:middle line:84%
there's been less and
less ice at the ice

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.360 align:middle line:90%
station in that area.

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.490 align:middle line:90%
His body has never been found.

00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:18.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we did the
research on this,

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:22.310 align:middle line:84%
one of the unusual things in
one of the articles in one

00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:26.030 align:middle line:84%
of the newspapers is that
people at the ice station

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:28.310 align:middle line:84%
had reported in
the days while they

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:32.630 align:middle line:84%
were searching a humming sound
and strange lights in the sky.

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:33.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, boy.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:34.460 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And I
wrote about this.

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Well, then the
head of the Byrd ice station

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:42.140 align:middle line:84%
came out and said,
hey, that's a lie.

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:43.550 align:middle line:90%
This has never happened.

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:45.720 align:middle line:84%
The people aren't
telling the truth.

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:48.665 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it was strange how
hard they came out to deny it.

00:41:48.665 --> 00:41:49.498 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To deny it.

00:41:49.498 --> 00:41:50.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Now,
Disch was never found.

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:54.869 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To this
day, never found?

00:41:54.869 --> 00:41:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: None of his
equipment has been found.

00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:58.600 align:middle line:90%
None of his boots.

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.480 align:middle line:90%
A very strange disappearance.

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:04.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how far in
that region, in a blizzard,

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.640 align:middle line:90%
would somebody go?

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:06.499 align:middle line:90%
Not far.

00:42:06.499 --> 00:42:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: I don't
think you could go far.

00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:09.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:11.230 align:middle line:90%
That's what's even stranger.

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Well-- and then
in the stories I write,

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.752 align:middle line:84%
many times somebody
disappears with their dog.

00:42:16.752 --> 00:42:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the dog comes
back, and sometimes it doesn't.

00:42:19.210 --> 00:42:21.270 align:middle line:84%
In this incident,
weeks after Disch

00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:23.970 align:middle line:84%
disappeared, his
dog disappeared.

00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:25.740 align:middle line:90%
He was never found.

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:26.600 align:middle line:90%
I think that's odd.

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:27.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:31.020 align:middle line:84%
There's a case of Jack
Thomas, disappearance--

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:31.950 align:middle line:90%
that's a current one.

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:33.324 align:middle line:84%
Give us the
highlights, and we'll

00:42:33.324 --> 00:42:35.160 align:middle line:84%
look at a little
video about that.

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:36.450 align:middle line:90%
If you can, David.

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:37.650 align:middle line:90%
Again, another strange case.

00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think this
one was in 2016.

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:43.500 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: June 17th, 2016.

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.660 align:middle line:90%
Jack, 66 years old.

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:47.280 align:middle line:90%
In phenomenal health.

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:49.420 align:middle line:90%
He always liked to hike.

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:51.100 align:middle line:84%
George, one thing
I tell everyone

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:53.410 align:middle line:84%
who goes out in the
wilderness is number one,

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:54.440 align:middle line:90%
you hike in pairs.

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep.

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:57.198 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: If you choose
not to hike in pairs,

00:42:57.198 --> 00:42:59.440 align:middle line:84%
you carry what's called a
personal locator beacon.

00:42:59.440 --> 00:42:59.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:02.223 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: A lot of people
don't even know these exist.

00:43:02.223 --> 00:43:06.220 align:middle line:84%
They cost about $200, and if
you're hurt in the wilderness,

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:07.320 align:middle line:90%
you activate this.

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:08.845 align:middle line:84%
It sends a signal
up to a satellite.

00:43:08.845 --> 00:43:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they find you.

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:10.240 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Yeah.

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.114 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like a
missing plane somewhere.

00:43:12.114 --> 00:43:13.030 align:middle line:90%
That kind of thing.

00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:14.113 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Yeah, exactly.

00:43:14.113 --> 00:43:16.240 align:middle line:84%
The signal goes down to
the National Oceanographic

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.540 align:middle line:90%
and Atmospheric Administration.

00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And they call the search and
rescue in that jurisdiction.

00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:21.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:23.320 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: They can
find you within 10 feet.

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:25.420 align:middle line:90%
It's a really neat device.

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And say if you're hiking
off trail, you break a leg,

00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:30.425 align:middle line:84%
you don't have
this, you're dead.

00:43:30.425 --> 00:43:30.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: You are.

00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:32.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:33.241 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Jack had one.

00:43:33.241 --> 00:43:34.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:37.935 align:middle line:10%
>> They don't know
where Jack is,

00:43:37.935 --> 00:43:39.700 align:middle line:10%
and they don't
know what happened.

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:42.790 align:middle line:10%
>> New tonight, we're finally
putting a name and face

00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:45.670 align:middle line:10%
to the missing hiker who
disappeared in the Sawtooth

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:46.690 align:middle line:10%
wilderness.

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:48.790 align:middle line:10%
An experienced
hiker, Jack Thomas

00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:50.830 align:middle line:10%
went missing nearly
three weeks ago.

00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:52.720 align:middle line:10%
Search and rescue
teams spent five days

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.090 align:middle line:10%
in the wilderness looking
for him, but with no luck.

00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:57.589 align:middle line:10%
>> And then at that point the
Elmore County Sheriff's Office

00:43:57.589 --> 00:44:00.970 align:middle line:10%
called the search off, but his
family is determined to bring

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:01.790 align:middle line:10%
Jack home.

00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:03.970 align:middle line:10%
Our Alex Livingston
has the latest

00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:07.197 align:middle line:10%
now on their search
efforts, [INAUDIBLE],, Alex.

00:44:07.197 --> 00:44:09.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Dean and Mark, the
Thomas family describes Jack

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:12.610 align:middle line:10%
as an avid hiker who loved
nature and adventure.

00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:15.580 align:middle line:10%
And with the help of the John
Francis Foundation, a nonprofit

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:18.730 align:middle line:10%
based out of Minnesota that is
dedicated to helping families

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:20.770 align:middle line:10%
find their loved ones
in the wilderness,

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:22.900 align:middle line:10%
they're hoping to find him.

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:24.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hoping to find him.

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:25.386 align:middle line:90%
Did they ever?

00:44:25.386 --> 00:44:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: So let me--
let me tell you about that,

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:30.200 align:middle line:90%
is he activated his beacon.

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:32.960 align:middle line:90%
And like I said, within 10 feet.

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:36.650 align:middle line:84%
They found that he was on the
opposite side of the river

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:38.962 align:middle line:90%
than the trail, which is odd.

00:44:38.962 --> 00:44:40.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did that happen?

00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:41.570 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: How did that happen?

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:44.037 align:middle line:84%
They searched that area
up, and down, and sideways.

00:44:44.037 --> 00:44:45.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, in that area
where he disappeared

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:47.840 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of granite,
and a lot of boulders.

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Something else I talk
about in the books.

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:54.092 align:middle line:84%
The biggest geographical
cluster of the 59

00:44:54.092 --> 00:44:55.550 align:middle line:84%
in North America
I've written about

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:56.899 align:middle line:90%
is Yosemite National Park.

00:44:56.899 --> 00:44:58.940 align:middle line:84%
More people have disappeared
there than anywhere.

00:44:58.940 --> 00:44:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Weird.

00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:00.650 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And
what's the one place

00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:02.370 align:middle line:84%
in the world with
the most granite?

00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:03.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yosemite.

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:03.455 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Yosemite.

00:45:03.455 --> 00:45:04.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And where Jack disappeared,
it didn't make a lot of sense.

00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:12.796 align:middle line:84%
Now, not only did they do this
first five days of searching,

00:45:12.796 --> 00:45:14.420 align:middle line:84%
they also came back
with the foundation

00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:16.220 align:middle line:90%
and searched for another week.

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:19.290 align:middle line:84%
They brought in cadaver dogs,
they brought in regular dogs.

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:20.090 align:middle line:90%
They--

00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing.

00:45:20.570 --> 00:45:20.870 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:21.170 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:22.070 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Nothing.

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And just so people
understand, cadaver dogs

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:28.966 align:middle line:84%
can smell just a minute
amount of decay miles away.

00:45:28.966 --> 00:45:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they go crazy.

00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:30.590 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: They go crazy.

00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:31.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Jack Thomas
should have been found,

00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:35.030 align:middle line:90%
and he was never found.

00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And he had a
beacon, it went off.

00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:40.000 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't make sense.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:40.895 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:45:40.895 --> 00:45:42.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
ever find the beacon?

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: They
never found anything.

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:45.370 align:middle line:90%
It's a--

00:45:45.370 --> 00:45:46.607 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is going on?

00:45:46.607 --> 00:45:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Well,
that's why I'm here.

00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:50.410 align:middle line:84%
I was hoping you were
going to tell me, George.

00:45:50.410 --> 00:45:53.040 align:middle line:84%
You have access to so
many different people

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:55.510 align:middle line:84%
that I thought someone in
this world would come in

00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:56.835 align:middle line:90%
and say this is the answer.

00:45:56.835 --> 00:45:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you know,
I come from the school of,

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:01.780 align:middle line:84%
you know, look at
something natural first.

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:04.990 align:middle line:84%
You know, murders,
disappearances, accidents--

00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:08.075 align:middle line:84%
but once that's all weighed off,
and you say that's most of them

00:46:08.075 --> 00:46:11.410 align:middle line:84%
are weighed off, then you
come to the very unusual,

00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:12.780 align:middle line:90%
the strange.

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:14.440 align:middle line:90%
The mystical.

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And is there anything
in your research, David,

00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:21.940 align:middle line:90%
that showed you about folklore?

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:24.640 align:middle line:84%
I know you talked about
the case in the 1700s--

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:27.790 align:middle line:84%
but about folklore
about this happening?

00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:29.590 align:middle line:84%
Did Native Americans
talk about stuff

00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:32.350 align:middle line:84%
like this, or anything
like that, do you know?

00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:33.820 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Great, great idea.

00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:35.350 align:middle line:90%
And a great topic.

00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:38.170 align:middle line:84%
In one of the books I
wrote about, Iceland--

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:41.980 align:middle line:84%
and they have
folklore of people,

00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:45.857 align:middle line:90%
or fairies living in boulders.

00:46:45.857 --> 00:46:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And do you know, in
Iceland they won't

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:49.130 align:middle line:90%
move a boulder to make a road.

00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:50.590 align:middle line:90%
They'll put the road around--

00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Around the boulder.

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:52.999 align:middle line:84%
World they don't want to
disturb their habitat.

00:46:52.999 --> 00:46:54.040 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: That's right.

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.665 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow,
that's interesting,

00:46:55.665 --> 00:46:58.210 align:middle line:84%
because I've written about
boulders having the association

00:46:58.210 --> 00:46:59.620 align:middle line:90%
of missing people.

00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:02.320 align:middle line:90%
And boulder fields.

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And then in my latest book
that we're talking about today,

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:07.810 align:middle line:90%
I talked about granite.

00:47:07.810 --> 00:47:10.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a giant
mound of granite in Texas.

00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mhm.

00:47:11.530 --> 00:47:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And there's a
story from the late 1800s

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:17.140 align:middle line:90%
about a priest being chased.

00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And the priest said that he
ran on top of this giant piece

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:23.860 align:middle line:84%
of [INAUDIBLE],, and it
engulfed him, and took him.

00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And he said he walked
around inside this for days,

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:29.860 align:middle line:90%
and then it spit him out.

00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:30.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa!

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: I thought, wow.

00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:34.150 align:middle line:90%
Priests don't usually fabricate.

00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:36.290 align:middle line:90%
Or hallucinate.

00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:37.090 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Yeah.

00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:39.130 align:middle line:90%
So what happened there?

00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:41.210 align:middle line:84%
But I thought the
association of the granite,

00:47:41.210 --> 00:47:44.480 align:middle line:84%
it swallowing him and
spitting him out days later--

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:45.340 align:middle line:90%
strange.

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:49.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How much do we
not know about this planet,

00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:50.510 align:middle line:90%
and this universe?

00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Well,
we know far less

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:53.520 align:middle line:90%
than what we think we know.

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:56.650 align:middle line:84%
There's so much about the
world, and just the people

00:47:56.650 --> 00:48:00.690 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to in the last
seven years, and the access--

00:48:00.690 --> 00:48:03.517 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a constant eye
opening experience to me.

00:48:03.517 --> 00:48:05.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at one
more case that you looked at,

00:48:05.850 --> 00:48:07.710 align:middle line:90%
Dr. James McGrogan.

00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:10.890 align:middle line:90%
And he was from Colorado.

00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Something was
happening in Colorado.

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:13.189 align:middle line:90%
He was--

00:48:13.189 --> 00:48:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Disappeared
in Colorado.

00:48:14.970 --> 00:48:16.110 align:middle line:90%
Was from Indiana.

00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:16.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:17.850 align:middle line:90%
Let's look.

00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:20.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Dr. McGrogran, being
a marathon runner,

00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:22.050 align:middle line:10%
being in excellent shape--

00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:22.860 align:middle line:10%
he kept going.

00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:25.068 align:middle line:10%
He told the men that he'd
meet them at the next stop.

00:48:25.068 --> 00:48:27.410 align:middle line:10%
They were fine with
that, and away he went.

00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:29.460 align:middle line:10%
Now, Dr. McGrogan
was carrying what's

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:32.670 align:middle line:10%
called a split snowboard.

00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:34.470 align:middle line:10%
He was carrying
that on his back,

00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:38.310 align:middle line:10%
along with a backpack with a
cell phone and a cell phone

00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:43.470 align:middle line:10%
backup battery, a GPS unit,
a shovel, medical supplies,

00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:46.380 align:middle line:10%
and a variety of other
things, including a blanket

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:48.090 align:middle line:10%
and other protective gear.

00:48:48.090 --> 00:48:50.010 align:middle line:10%
He was ready for the worst.

00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And
apparently the worst

00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:52.590 align:middle line:90%
happened for this poor guy.

00:48:52.590 --> 00:48:53.390 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: So McGrogan
was an ER doctor--

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:57.780 align:middle line:90%
emergency room doctor.

00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And super sharp guy,
marathon runner.

00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:03.600 align:middle line:84%
He went with some
other physicians,

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:06.480 align:middle line:84%
and they were right up
here, up Highway 70.

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:08.850 align:middle line:90%
Right across from Vail Resort.

00:49:08.850 --> 00:49:10.616 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very
well-marked trail

00:49:10.616 --> 00:49:12.240 align:middle line:84%
that goes up to this
ice hut where they

00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:14.120 align:middle line:90%
were going to spend the night.

00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And McGrogran being
in excellent shape,

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:20.017 align:middle line:84%
his group stopped and he
says, hey, I'm not tired.

00:49:20.017 --> 00:49:21.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm gonna just kept going.

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:21.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm gonna keep going.

00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:22.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:22.050 --> 00:49:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: So he keeps going,
and they go to their next stop.

00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:25.120 align:middle line:90%
He's not there.

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And they think, well,
maybe he just kept going.

00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:29.520 align:middle line:84%
So they went up, and eventually
they reached the hut.

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:33.230 align:middle line:84%
He's not there, and
they're concerned.

00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:35.990 align:middle line:84%
This guy did everything
right, George.

00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:38.840 align:middle line:84%
He had backup batteries,
he had backup systems.

00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:40.790 align:middle line:90%
He had avalanche detection.

00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:42.950 align:middle line:84%
He had everything that
I would have had if I--

00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:44.312 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe a weapon?

00:49:44.312 --> 00:49:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: I don't think he--

00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:46.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't think he did.

00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:48.440 align:middle line:84%
But you know, what predators
are out in the middle

00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:50.000 align:middle line:90%
of winter in Colorado on this--

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.384 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing.

00:49:51.384 --> 00:49:53.300 align:middle line:84%
The bears are hibernating,
the mountain lions,

00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:55.250 align:middle line:90%
you would find the same.

00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:57.170 align:middle line:90%
Long story short, he disappears.

00:49:57.170 --> 00:49:58.400 align:middle line:90%
Giant search.

00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:00.020 align:middle line:90%
Giant search.

00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:03.170 align:middle line:84%
They bring in helicopters,
they bring in planes, they

00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:04.490 align:middle line:90%
bring in searchers.

00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:07.460 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to remember,
he's on a snow trail.

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So do they find
some of that trail he's on?

00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:12.590 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Here's the scenario.

00:50:12.590 --> 00:50:15.664 align:middle line:84%
If you're on that trail, and
if you deviated off the trail,

00:50:15.664 --> 00:50:16.580 align:middle line:90%
there would be marks--

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There would be
marks of your snowboard.

00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:19.240 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Right.

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, they followed every
mark, and every mark

00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:24.080 align:middle line:90%
turned around and came back.

00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, the location
where McGrogran

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:28.820 align:middle line:84%
was on this trail and the
location he was eventually

00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:32.810 align:middle line:90%
found, 6 miles to the east--

00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:37.160 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing but giant
hills and rolling snow.

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:40.460 align:middle line:84%
So if he would have traveled
from point A to point B,

00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:42.560 align:middle line:84%
It would have looked like
a giant snowplow going

00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:44.750 align:middle line:84%
through that mountain,
and the helicopters never

00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:45.280 align:middle line:90%
would have seen him.

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:46.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:47.713 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: But the
more amazing thing

00:50:47.713 --> 00:50:51.786 align:middle line:84%
is anywhere along that point,
you could see Vail Resort.

00:50:51.786 --> 00:50:53.160 align:middle line:84%
You could get out
your cell phone

00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:54.543 align:middle line:90%
and you could call for help.

00:50:54.543 --> 00:50:55.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bizarre.

00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: No marks, no call.

00:50:58.310 --> 00:51:00.960 align:middle line:84%
So they decided to search all
the way to this one valley

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:01.760 align:middle line:90%
6 miles away.

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And they went up the valley,
didn't find anything.

00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing.

00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: They
call off the search.

00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Within a day later, some other
people were up this valley,

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:12.690 align:middle line:84%
and they find his
body at the bottom.

00:51:12.690 --> 00:51:14.980 align:middle line:90%
Snow skis are still on his back.

00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:15.990 align:middle line:90%
He's wearing a helmet.

00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:19.260 align:middle line:84%
His helmet is caved in, and he
died from blunt force trauma

00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:21.400 align:middle line:90%
to the head.

00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's all that
the story tells you,

00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:26.560 align:middle line:84%
and that's all the public knows
from the public description

00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:28.210 align:middle line:90%
of the news accounts.

00:51:28.210 --> 00:51:30.460 align:middle line:90%
So I thought, this isn't right.

00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:32.650 align:middle line:84%
So I request from
Eagle County a copy

00:51:32.650 --> 00:51:36.346 align:middle line:84%
of the coroner's report, and
the search and rescue report.

00:51:36.346 --> 00:51:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow,
this is strange.

00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:40.560 align:middle line:84%
How come the news
never said that he's

00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:42.300 align:middle line:90%
found not wearing boots?

00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:45.090 align:middle line:90%
Why would he take his boots off?

00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:46.630 align:middle line:90%
That makes no sense.

00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: In a lot of
the cases I write about,

00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:50.296 align:middle line:84%
people are found
without shoes or boots.

00:51:50.296 --> 00:51:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who takes them?

00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:52.870 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: Where did they go?

00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:54.060 align:middle line:90%
They were never found.

00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And how did he get
point to point?

00:51:58.210 --> 00:52:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't he ever
use his cell phone?

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:02.560 align:middle line:84%
How did he get
dropped into there

00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:05.510 align:middle line:84%
and suffer a head
injury that is fatal?

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:06.310 align:middle line:90%
You know--

00:52:06.310 --> 00:52:07.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's weird.

00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:08.218 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: It's weird.

00:52:08.218 --> 00:52:09.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can you imagine--

00:52:09.350 --> 00:52:13.540 align:middle line:84%
just imagine for a moment the
people who have disappeared.

00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:18.070 align:middle line:84%
The horror that they must
encounter in that split moment?

00:52:18.070 --> 00:52:20.330 align:middle line:84%
For whatever has
happened to them.

00:52:20.330 --> 00:52:22.780 align:middle line:84%
It has got to be one of
the most frightening things

00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:25.280 align:middle line:84%
a human being could
ever go through.

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:27.300 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it is.

00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:29.840 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a
child or an adult,

00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:32.270 align:middle line:84%
something horrible
has happened to them.

00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: You know, and it's--

00:52:34.310 --> 00:52:37.550 align:middle line:84%
if we play out that GHB
scenario where you're awake,

00:52:37.550 --> 00:52:40.470 align:middle line:84%
you know what's happening
but you're immobile--

00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:44.380 align:middle line:84%
you know, why-- if something
is happening here, take me,

00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:45.930 align:middle line:90%
put me out so I don't know.

00:52:45.930 --> 00:52:48.270 align:middle line:90%
But to force me to be awake--

00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's sick.

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.070 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: That's really a
tough scenario to live with.

00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:51.945 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's sick.

00:52:51.945 --> 00:52:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Do you think, as we
wrap this up, David,

00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:58.350 align:middle line:84%
we're ever going to get
the answers to this?

00:52:58.350 --> 00:52:59.670 align:middle line:90%
Are you close?

00:52:59.670 --> 00:53:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: I'm hoping
that one of these victims

00:53:02.730 --> 00:53:04.132 align:middle line:90%
is going to live.

00:53:04.132 --> 00:53:05.340 align:middle line:90%
There's going to be a hiccup.

00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And tell
us what happened.

00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:07.883 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: And tell
us what happened.

00:53:07.883 --> 00:53:11.120 align:middle line:84%
But as I've stated before,
whatever's happening here,

00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:12.360 align:middle line:90%
they're 100% effective.

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:14.422 align:middle line:84%
They're never seen, and
they're never identified.

00:53:14.422 --> 00:53:15.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's no mistakes.

00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:16.410 align:middle line:90%
>>PAULIDES: No mistakes.

00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: David, thanks for
being on Beyond Belief.

00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULIDES: Thanks
for having me, George.

00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:20.040 align:middle line:90%
It was great being here.

00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:21.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just amazing research.

00:53:21.130 --> 00:53:22.080 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what a story.

00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:23.788 align:middle line:84%
This is something I've
followed with Dave

00:53:23.788 --> 00:53:25.290 align:middle line:90%
for a long, long time.

00:53:25.290 --> 00:53:28.590 align:middle line:84%
His movie out, of
course, is "Missing 411,"

00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:32.430 align:middle line:84%
and his latest book is
"Missing 411, Off The Grid."

Stories of people
actually disappearing

00:53:34.770 --> 00:53:36.720 align:middle line:90%
in our public park systems.

00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:40.590 align:middle line:84%
They simply vanish
without a trace.

00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:43.770 align:middle line:84%
It's got to be one of the
scariest, most bizarre stories

00:53:43.770 --> 00:53:44.870 align:middle line:90%
I've ever heard.

00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:47.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
