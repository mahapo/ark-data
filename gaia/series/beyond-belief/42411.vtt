00:00:05.316 --> 00:00:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>> [BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.898 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.898 --> 00:00:10.684 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.684 --> 00:00:13.650 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.270 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:26.775 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.775 --> 00:00:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.170 align:middle line:90%
Jeff Belanger our special guest.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, he's the
paranormal researcher goes

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.880 align:middle line:84%
are all over this planet
looking for different things,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.917 align:middle line:90%
unusual things, scary things.

00:00:39.917 --> 00:00:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes things that are
right in our own backyard,

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.002 align:middle line:90%
aren't they?

00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:44.210 align:middle line:90%
>>JEFFREY BELANGER: They are.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.390 align:middle line:84%
I've found there's some
legend in every town.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.920 align:middle line:84%
These are the things that
make our places special,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.240 align:middle line:90%
where we live.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.689 align:middle line:84%
Stories that the locals talk
about that you may not ever

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:55.980 align:middle line:84%
hear about unless someone
chooses to share it with you.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's what makes
these things so special.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.030 align:middle line:84%
They define us, they
define a region.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.861 align:middle line:84%
A legend belongs to a
person that experienced it,

00:01:03.861 --> 00:01:05.610 align:middle line:84%
belongs to the location
where it happened,

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.464 align:middle line:84%
and it belongs to the
greater community.

00:01:07.464 --> 00:01:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And the more we hear about,
the more famous it gets,

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.970 align:middle line:84%
people want to come there
to see it and become

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.480 align:middle line:84%
part of that story, which
is what I made a career on.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of
the greatest spots

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.040 align:middle line:84%
for hauntings or visitations
of ghostly apparitions

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.880 align:middle line:90%
happens to be in Washington DC.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.650 align:middle line:90%
The White House, right?

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.310 align:middle line:90%
Who would think that?

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.615 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: You know, I would.

00:01:28.615 --> 00:01:29.771 align:middle line:90%
I would think that.

00:01:29.771 --> 00:01:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Not only is it probably the
most famous house-- famous house

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.645 align:middle line:84%
in the United States, it's
the most famous haunted house.

00:01:34.645 --> 00:01:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is, so
much history left a mark.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Where history leaves a
mark, ghosts often follow.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And this building
has seen it all.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.040 align:middle line:84%
Every US president
has been there.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.436 align:middle line:84%
Washington died before
it was complete,

00:01:47.436 --> 00:01:49.810 align:middle line:84%
but he was still there for
the laying of the cornerstone.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.700 align:middle line:84%
When you walk into
the north portico,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.970 align:middle line:84%
when you walk into the
hall in the East Room,

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.020 align:middle line:84%
and you stand there and
you say, oh, my goodness,

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.270 align:middle line:84%
all the presidents stood
where I'm standing right now.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.970 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:59.330 align:middle line:90%
You connect with them--

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yes, it is
an incredible feeling.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:01.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: Incredible.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.313 align:middle line:84%
And the people that
work there-- and there's

00:02:03.313 --> 00:02:05.100 align:middle line:84%
about 100 employees
of the White House

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.280 align:middle line:84%
that are the cleaning crew, the
butlers, the grounds keepers.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.864 align:middle line:90%
These folks are apolitical.

00:02:09.864 --> 00:02:12.030 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter which
political party's in power--

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.649 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: --they work there.

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:16.464 align:middle line:84%
I met a third generation
White House butler.

00:02:16.464 --> 00:02:18.130 align:middle line:84%
His dad was a butler
at the White House,

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.580 align:middle line:84%
his dad's dad was a
butler at the White House.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Probably did the
movie on him. "The Butler."

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.381 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: "The Butler."

00:02:22.381 --> 00:02:24.070 align:middle line:90%
And so these guys have stories.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.670 align:middle line:90%
They're very credible witnesses.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm always looking
for credibility

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.425 align:middle line:84%
when I'm talking
to someone who--

00:02:28.425 --> 00:02:28.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.096 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER:
--witnessed something.

00:02:30.096 --> 00:02:31.600 align:middle line:84%
So they've been
drug tested, they've

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.160 align:middle line:84%
been psychologically screened
every which way because they're

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.280 align:middle line:84%
around the president, the first
family and other foreign heads

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.090 align:middle line:90%
of state.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.510 align:middle line:84%
These people are
very, very credible.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.487 align:middle line:84%
And they're
passionate historians.

00:02:41.487 --> 00:02:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And they're walking down
the hall doing their job.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.832 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed a
foreman who turned

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:48.040 align:middle line:84%
on the lights on the second
floor, part of his duties

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.081 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, and there's
Lincoln sitting right

00:02:50.081 --> 00:02:52.150 align:middle line:84%
outside the Lincoln
bedroom, crossing his legs,

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.660 align:middle line:84%
looked up at him,
and then disappeared.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And clearly he
said, I could see him.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: He saw him.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.538 align:middle line:84%
And here's the
thing about Lincoln.

00:02:57.538 --> 00:02:58.890 align:middle line:90%
It's not some faint apparition.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.080 align:middle line:84%
He's on our money, we
know what he looks like.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And he went downstairs
and he told the usher,

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.210 align:middle line:90%
I just saw Lincoln.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.484 align:middle line:84%
And he was told,
you're one of many

00:03:06.484 --> 00:03:07.900 align:middle line:84%
that has seen
Lincoln in this way.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So this is well
known within the White House?

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.941 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: Well known
and well documented.

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:14.490 align:middle line:84%
To quote Harry S Truman in a
letter to his wife-- President

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Truman-- "Sure as shootin'
the place is haunted."

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.460 align:middle line:84%
He wrote about that
ghosts six different times

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.720 align:middle line:90%
in letters to his wife.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.570 align:middle line:84%
He talked about hearing
someone walk around

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.903 align:middle line:84%
when he knew he was the only
person on the second floor,

00:03:24.903 --> 00:03:28.329 align:middle line:84%
went downstairs to find the
Secret Service representatives

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:29.870 align:middle line:84%
and say, what are
you doing upstairs?

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:30.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: I'm
not upstairs, sir.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm-- the president.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: I'm down here
where I'm supposed to be.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.417 align:middle line:84%
Whoever you heard
walking wasn't me.

00:03:35.417 --> 00:03:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And here's the thing,
the White House,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.300 align:middle line:84%
nothing is supposed
to happen in there

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.650 align:middle line:84%
that isn't checked
and double checked--

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:40.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: --by--

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No mistakes.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.121 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: That's right.

00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:44.780 align:middle line:84%
Doors aren't supposed to open
or close by themselves, nothing.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And so, when something
happens, everyone

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.580 align:middle line:90%
takes immediate notice.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.816 align:middle line:90%
And it's curious.

00:03:49.816 --> 00:03:51.190 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to
a Secret Service

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.874 align:middle line:84%
agent who was giving a
tour of the White House.

00:03:53.874 --> 00:03:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what do you
know about that ghosts here?

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
people have seen

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.090 align:middle line:84%
a British redcoat near
the north portico.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, he
mentioned Lincoln.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And I said, wow, you said
that so matter of fact.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Is this federal recognition
of the existence of ghosts.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I wouldn't know
anything about that, sir.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:08.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was your headline.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: Yeah.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He knew it.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: He knew it.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He knew it.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: But the
British Redcoat's

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.030 align:middle line:84%
curious because we
find out the White

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.754 align:middle line:84%
House was burned to
the ground in 1814.

00:04:16.754 --> 00:04:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, it was.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: The British
sacked Washington

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.661 align:middle line:90%
and it was just an empty shell.

00:04:20.661 --> 00:04:23.230 align:middle line:84%
The stone walls survived but
everything else burned up.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: And there's
two parts of the building--

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Olympus falling.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.835 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: --never
been painted.

00:04:26.835 --> 00:04:29.540 align:middle line:84%
You can still see the burn
marks on two different windows

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.640 align:middle line:84%
because what happens when
you let your guard down?

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.690 align:middle line:90%
This ghost serves as a reminder.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.339 align:middle line:84%
And so imagine seeing someone
on the lawn of the White House

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:37.380 align:middle line:90%
who doesn't belong there.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.920 align:middle line:90%
That's a security alert.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.220 align:middle line:84%
So these stories
come again and again.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.460 align:middle line:84%
Even in modern presidencies
they talk about it.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.120 align:middle line:90%
The Obamas have had experiences.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.120 align:middle line:84%
Michelle Obama talked
about a strange experience

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.960 align:middle line:90%
one of their guests had

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.251 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Reagans had a lot.

00:04:50.251 --> 00:04:52.515 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: The Reagans
talked-- Ronald Reagan said in

00:04:52.515 --> 00:04:54.264 align:middle line:84%
an off the cuff remark,
he said, you know,

00:04:54.264 --> 00:04:55.800 align:middle line:84%
my dog would just
bark wildly right

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.400 align:middle line:84%
in front of the Lincoln bedroom
and then never go in there.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and you
mentioned Truman so--

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:00.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: Truman, yeah.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.658 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --let's
take a little look

00:05:01.658 --> 00:05:03.910 align:middle line:84%
at a video with Truman
and the Abe Lincoln story.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.090 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>>According to History.com,
Harry Truman, the 33rd US

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.420 align:middle line:84%
President, once shared his
experience about its spookiness

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.200 align:middle line:84%
with his wife in
a letter noting,

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.150 align:middle line:84%
"I sit here in this old house
and work on foreign affairs,

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.440 align:middle line:84%
read reports and
work on speeches,

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.220 align:middle line:84%
all the while listening
to the ghosts walk

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.020 align:middle line:84%
up and down the hallway and even
right in here in the study."

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.940 align:middle line:84%
President Abraham
Lincoln's ghost

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.700 align:middle line:84%
has been known to be seen in the
hallways or his former bedroom.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.450 align:middle line:84%
During World War II, the
British Prime Minister Winston

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.520 align:middle line:84%
Churchill allegedly
saw Lincoln's ghost

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.950 align:middle line:84%
by the fireplace while staying
in the former president's

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.097 align:middle line:90%
bedroom.

00:05:38.097 --> 00:05:39.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's something.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.202 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is just
absolutely riveting.

00:05:41.202 --> 00:05:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: Yeah.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:42.240 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.740 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.100 align:middle line:90%
The witnesses are great.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.920 align:middle line:90%
Just to clarify briefly.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.650 align:middle line:84%
The Lincoln bedroom was
originally the executive office

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.500 align:middle line:84%
before they added the
east and west wings.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.910 align:middle line:84%
So now it's called
the Lincoln bedroom.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.340 align:middle line:84%
But that's where he
served as president.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.610 align:middle line:84%
So not only that, there's
also some curiosities

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:00.360 align:middle line:90%
that come forward.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.360 align:middle line:84%
There's a famous photograph by
White House photographer Abbie

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.050 align:middle line:90%
Rowe.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was
back in the '50s.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.883 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: Back in the
'50s the White House

00:06:06.883 --> 00:06:09.320 align:middle line:84%
was gutted because they
were rebuilding everything.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.270 align:middle line:84%
They were going
down a few levels

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.920 align:middle line:90%
and upgrading everything.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And this photograph
turns up, and if you

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.580 align:middle line:84%
look in the corner of
the photograph- we have

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.730 align:middle line:84%
a copy of it here--
you look in the corner

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.100 align:middle line:84%
of the photograph you see
this semi transparent figure.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting to
me is, the guys to the left

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.040 align:middle line:84%
are just as far away from the
camera, but they're solid.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And you've got this
figure on the right that's

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.560 align:middle line:90%
semi-translucent like that.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.400 align:middle line:90%
You can see right through it.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.070 align:middle line:90%
Curious, right?

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they can't see it?

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.071 align:middle line:84%
It looks like they're
not even noticing it.

00:06:38.071 --> 00:06:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: All we know
is this is a White House

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.190 align:middle line:84%
photo from White House
photographer Abbie Rowe who

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.857 align:middle line:84%
took the photo of the
renovations going on.

00:06:45.857 --> 00:06:48.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's really interesting
when things like this turn up

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.980 align:middle line:84%
and paranormal enthusiasts
say, aha, evidence.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.230 align:middle line:90%
Evidence to all these stories.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:53.938 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, somebody
like Abe Lincoln,

00:06:53.938 --> 00:06:57.080 align:middle line:90%
Jeff, why does he hang around?

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Because of the tragedy
of how he died?

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.437 align:middle line:84%
Does he have
unfinished business?

00:07:01.437 --> 00:07:03.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: I think he hangs
around because we need him.

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:04.580 align:middle line:90%
We still need him.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Our nation needs him
and, more than anything,

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.950 align:middle line:84%
the presidents need him,
all the modern US presidents

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.020 align:middle line:84%
need him because his was the
most difficult presidency.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:13.890 align:middle line:90%
Hands down.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And so whatever you're
going through as president,

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.820 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a war, terrorism,
whatever, you can always say,

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:21.950 align:middle line:90%
Lincoln had it worse.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:22.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.265 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: Give me strength.

00:07:23.265 --> 00:07:23.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Give me some--

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: Give me
strength, Lincoln.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --some advice.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.048 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: Yeah.

00:07:26.048 --> 00:07:27.970 align:middle line:84%
Be with me on this and
help me through this.

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does anybody
see Kennedy there?

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.266 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: I haven't heard
about Kennedy sightings.

00:07:32.266 --> 00:07:32.910 align:middle line:90%
Not there.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.980 align:middle line:84%
But there have been--
people have reported

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.930 align:middle line:84%
seeing a ghostly
cat which they view

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.000 align:middle line:84%
as a harbinger of
something bad that's

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.440 align:middle line:90%
about to happen to the nation.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.815 align:middle line:84%
Not just at the
White House, also

00:07:41.815 --> 00:07:45.110 align:middle line:84%
seen at the Capitol building
when they see the ghost cat.

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:51.180 align:middle line:84%
People have seen Abigail Adams,
her spirit hanging laundry

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.900 align:middle line:84%
in the East Room,
which is interesting.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.467 align:middle line:84%
When they first moved in, there
was no money for furniture.

00:07:55.467 --> 00:07:57.550 align:middle line:84%
So instead of going outside
to brave the elements,

00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.720 align:middle line:84%
she'd just hang her laundry
in the empty East Room

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.720 align:middle line:90%
and let it dry in there.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And so people will report
smelling soap and seeing

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:05.300 align:middle line:90%
a woman hanging laundry.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.900 align:middle line:84%
So many, so many stories just
pour out of that building

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:08.760 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.135 align:middle line:84%
I remember seeing Hillary
Clinton in an interview saying,

00:08:11.135 --> 00:08:12.860 align:middle line:84%
oh, it could be pretty
creepy at night.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.770 align:middle line:84%
George W Bush said how he
felt the place was haunted.

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They felt a presence.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:17.728 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: Yeah.

00:08:17.728 --> 00:08:19.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just president
after president

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:22.150 align:middle line:84%
has some remark
about this building.

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.687 align:middle line:84%
The impact of the building
itself is awesome.

00:08:24.687 --> 00:08:25.520 align:middle line:90%
Have you been there?

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah Yeah.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:26.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: I mean--

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I was there.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: You can't
help but be moved.

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.255 align:middle line:84%
I mean, forget the
paranormal, you just

00:08:30.255 --> 00:08:32.380 align:middle line:84%
walk through those
doors and you say, whoa.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:33.179 align:middle line:90%
This is big.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:36.039 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was invited there
for lunch with President Reagan.

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:37.094 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: Oh, nice.

00:08:37.094 --> 00:08:39.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I get there
and I figure, boy, this

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:40.360 align:middle line:90%
is really cool.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have lunch
with the president.

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:45.130 align:middle line:84%
I was so far away
from him, Jeff,

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:46.420 align:middle line:90%
I could barely even see him.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:47.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: Right.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.628 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean it was just
this little tiny Ronald Reagan.

00:08:49.628 --> 00:08:51.800 align:middle line:90%
I was way in the back somewhere.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.009 align:middle line:90%
But it's a fascinating place.

00:08:53.009 --> 00:08:53.758 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: It is.

00:08:53.758 --> 00:08:54.340 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.220 align:middle line:90%
And you breathe in history.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.160 align:middle line:90%
It's part of America.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.910 align:middle line:84%
We are-- we're part owners
of that house, you and I.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:03.830 align:middle line:84%
We pay our taxes and it's
such a special place.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's haunted
because it should be haunted.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.200 align:middle line:84%
Because we should remember
everything that took place

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.200 align:middle line:84%
there, some of the decisions
that were made that

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.140 align:middle line:90%
altered the course of humankind.

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:16.371 align:middle line:84%
From dropping
nuclear weapons to--

00:09:16.371 --> 00:09:17.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:17.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: Everything.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:17.960 align:middle line:90%
You name it.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.001 align:middle line:84%
All the decisions that
came out of that building.

00:09:20.001 --> 00:09:20.870 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We talked
earlier that Abe Lincoln

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:25.780 align:middle line:84%
was the one who
showed up the most.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.182 align:middle line:90%
Is that still the case?

00:09:27.182 --> 00:09:27.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: Yeah.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.750 align:middle line:84%
I think at some point
we become fixated.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.280 align:middle line:84%
When a first family
moves in, they

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.100 align:middle line:84%
got to know about the
ghost of Abe Lincoln.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.330 align:middle line:90%
He's the most prominent figure.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:37.246 align:middle line:90%
There are others but--

00:09:37.246 --> 00:09:39.921 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wonder if they
warn them or tell them.

00:09:39.921 --> 00:09:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: Well, especially--

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:42.503 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And how do you do that?

00:09:42.503 --> 00:09:45.380 align:middle line:84%
How do you talk to the
newly elected president--

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: Right.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --the
first lady and say,

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.610 align:middle line:84%
now, there's something we got to
tell you about the White House.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:53.460 align:middle line:90%
And, you know, they'll go, what?

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.367 align:middle line:90%
Its kind of haunted.

00:09:55.367 --> 00:09:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: I wrote a
children's book called

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.300 align:middle line:84%
"Who's Haunting
the White House?"

00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.000 align:middle line:90%
And the whole idea was--

00:09:59.000 --> 00:09:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great book, by the way.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:09:59.880 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: Thank you.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.379 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:10:00.379 --> 00:10:03.700 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea was to use
ghosts as an innovative way

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.600 align:middle line:90%
to teach history.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.170 align:middle line:84%
But it's, in many accounts,
just like the Truman clip,

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:10.580 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about people who
believe it's truly haunted.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:14.560 align:middle line:84%
I sent a copy when it was
done to President Bush--

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.580 align:middle line:84%
because that's when
I first went in there

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.554 align:middle line:84%
was under his
administration-- and he wrote

00:10:18.554 --> 00:10:20.470 align:middle line:84%
me back a nice letter
saying, congratulations.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:21.845 align:middle line:84%
And then I sent
a copy because it

00:10:21.845 --> 00:10:23.690 align:middle line:84%
was right near the
transition time-- I

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.030 align:middle line:84%
knew Obama had
children that were--

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:27.830 align:middle line:84%
they were much younger
then moving in.

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And how do you tell
your kids, you're

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:30.730 align:middle line:90%
moving into a haunted house?

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:31.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're
going to find out.

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.040 align:middle line:84%
If you don't tell them, they're
going to find out from someone.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:34.550 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or they'll
see something.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: They'll
see something.

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:37.640 align:middle line:90%
So I sent a copy of the book.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
something to be feared.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.409 align:middle line:84%
We don't hear about
dangerous encounters.

00:10:41.409 --> 00:10:42.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not there.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:42.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: No, not there.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.890 align:middle line:90%
For some reason.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: Well, I mean, it's
a supposed to be a safe place.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.230 align:middle line:84%
That's-- the White
House is built for that.

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And what's so
important, too, about

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.426 align:middle line:84%
living in a haunted
house-- whether it's

00:10:53.426 --> 00:10:55.370 align:middle line:84%
the White House
or your own home--

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.052 align:middle line:90%
we need to feel safe at home.

00:10:57.052 --> 00:10:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And one of things that's so
unnerving about a haunted house

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.985 align:middle line:84%
is, imagine having an
intruder that you can't see,

00:11:02.985 --> 00:11:05.360 align:middle line:84%
that you can't call the police
to have them ushered out--

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who won't believe you.

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:07.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: Right.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.570 align:middle line:90%
And and so that is unnerving.

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:10.570 align:middle line:90%
And you don't feel safe.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And when you don't
feel safe-- you're

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.900 align:middle line:84%
talking about Maslow's
hierarchy of needs, right?

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Personal safety is
pretty near the bottom,

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.010 align:middle line:90%
right above food and shelter.

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:22.300 align:middle line:84%
If you don't feel safe,
your life falls apart.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I think is so
disturbing about people that

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.700 align:middle line:90%
go through haunting experience.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:30.220 align:middle line:84%
You've got all of life's
regular challenges and now this.

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's why when
we hear about haunted home

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:37.090 align:middle line:84%
stories-- whether the White
House or someone else's-- we

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:39.460 align:middle line:84%
connect with those people
because we say, oh, my gosh,

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:40.335 align:middle line:90%
what if that were me?

00:11:40.335 --> 00:11:41.630 align:middle line:90%
What if that were my house?

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have a house back
in St. Louis built in 1929.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:47.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm convinced somebody
had died there

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:49.680 align:middle line:84%
because everybody who
stays at that house,

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.700 align:middle line:84%
whether it's my
granddaughter, or my daughter,

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:55.030 align:middle line:84%
or people who are there
when I'm not there,

00:11:55.030 --> 00:12:00.500 align:middle line:84%
everybody talks about this
old man who's in this house.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.636 align:middle line:90%
I have never seen him at all.

00:12:02.636 --> 00:12:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And I've owned this
place for nine years now.

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:08.050 align:middle line:84%
But everybody there
has said that they've

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:12.320 align:middle line:84%
seen this friendly old man just
kind of like hanging around.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.940 align:middle line:84%
They hear doors and steps
and all these other things.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Initially, I said,
folks, it's an old house.

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.240 align:middle line:90%
It was made in 1929.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.530 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
creaky steps and stuff.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:27.820 align:middle line:84%
But when everybody tells
you this, you got to think,

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.610 align:middle line:84%
you know what, there's
something going on.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:32.520 align:middle line:84%
But the question, Jeffrey,
is, why don't I hear it?

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.850 align:middle line:90%
Why don't I see it?

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:35.772 align:middle line:90%
Why do they do it?

00:12:35.772 --> 00:12:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: I think the
experience, sometimes,

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.220 align:middle line:90%
it's not for you.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:42.090 align:middle line:84%
I've been in situations where
there were four people, four

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:44.500 align:middle line:84%
of us standing there, and two
people are seeing something

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.670 align:middle line:84%
and I'm right next to
them and I don't see it.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think you're getting into
the realm now of belief, right?

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:52.530 align:middle line:84%
You're getting into the
realm of not hard science

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:54.880 align:middle line:90%
but experiential phenomena.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And so you might be tuned
to a different frequency.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.940 align:middle line:84%
We're all listening to the
noise around us all the time,

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:05.050 align:middle line:84%
and your frequency might be
just off of whatever is there.

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:05.970 align:middle line:90%
But who knows?

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:09.670 align:middle line:84%
Once you start tuning into it,
once you start looking for it,

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:12.067 align:middle line:84%
then it seems to happen
more frequently for people.

00:13:12.067 --> 00:13:13.400 align:middle line:90%
Once they know what to look for.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.180 align:middle line:84%
So you still may
have your encounter.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.154 align:middle line:84%
But how do you feel
owning a haunted home.

00:13:17.154 --> 00:13:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's kind of weird.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:18.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: Is it?

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:18.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: You ever
get out of the shower

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:21.120 align:middle line:90%
and go, hey, wait a minute.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.661 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's weird
because I'll have

00:13:22.661 --> 00:13:24.350 align:middle line:84%
to disclose it if I
ever sell the place.

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: Yeah.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:25.368 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Won't I?

00:13:25.368 --> 00:13:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: Well, you
know, stigmatized property

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.980 align:middle line:84%
is becoming a discussion
point in the law.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.810 align:middle line:84%
A stigma could be there
was a murder here.

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:34.510 align:middle line:90%
Forget ghosts.

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:34.680 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That you
might have to disclose.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.641 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: If they ask,
you have to disclose it.

00:13:38.641 --> 00:13:41.710 align:middle line:84%
But if it's a known haunt,
if people have been there,

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:44.220 align:middle line:84%
if people have talked about
it, written about it in books,

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:45.803 align:middle line:84%
then again, you'd
have to disclose it.

00:13:45.803 --> 00:13:48.800 align:middle line:84%
Because people might come
lurking on your property

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.940 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.240 align:middle line:84%
Because we want to see
something so badly.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know the movie
"The Conjuring" came out

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.380 align:middle line:84%
and I know the owners of the
house-- that have lived there

00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:59.240 align:middle line:84%
for 20 years, it's
not their story--

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.900 align:middle line:84%
they bought the house after--
and they have people at 2:00

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.630 align:middle line:84%
in the morning taking
pictures inside the house.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:08.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've had radio clients
that specialize in telling you

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.250 align:middle line:90%
if somebody died in your house.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:11.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: Right.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You give them the
information where you are.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And they go off and
do their work and they

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:16.560 align:middle line:90%
come back and say--

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: Right.

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:19.562 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --here so and
so died, or nobody died.

00:14:19.562 --> 00:14:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: Yeah.

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.080 align:middle line:90%
No, it's public record.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.770 align:middle line:84%
But imagine owning these
houses-- these poor folks

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:26.884 align:middle line:84%
in Rhode Island-- they're
70 years old and at 2:00

00:14:26.884 --> 00:14:29.050 align:middle line:84%
in the morning someone's
taking pictures or knocking

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:31.530 align:middle line:84%
on the door, can I come in
and look for your ghosts?

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.940 align:middle line:84%
It is a sigma and
it can be a problem.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And, at the end of the day,
maybe if we can not only

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:39.419 align:middle line:84%
respect the dead but
the living people.

00:14:39.419 --> 00:14:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's kind
of cool, isn't it?

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.918 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: It is cool.

00:14:41.918 --> 00:14:44.420 align:middle line:84%
It is cool because
the stuff captivates

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:47.180 align:middle line:84%
so much that it gets turned into
Hollywood blockbuster movies,

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:50.240 align:middle line:84%
gets turned into books, gets
turned into legends and lore.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.530 align:middle line:90%
And it is a global phenomenon.

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:53.585 align:middle line:90%
Ghosts won't go away.

00:14:53.585 --> 00:14:54.710 align:middle line:90%
I have no doubt about that.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:55.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They keep showing up.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.451 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: They do.

00:14:56.451 --> 00:14:56.950 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:00.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do some
ghosts hurt in a haunt?

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.896 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: It's rare.

00:15:01.896 --> 00:15:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Of all the stories
and interviews

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:06.830 align:middle line:84%
I've done over the years,
I think that's rare.

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:08.027 align:middle line:90%
Fear is not that rare.

00:15:08.027 --> 00:15:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Because if you hear someone
walking in your house,

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:12.359 align:middle line:84%
even if they mean you no
harm, it's still an intruder.

00:15:12.359 --> 00:15:14.285 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be
afraid and uncomfortable.

00:15:14.285 --> 00:15:15.910 align:middle line:84%
But actually getting
physically harmed,

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:18.560 align:middle line:84%
scratched, pushed,
maybe even possession,

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.320 align:middle line:84%
getting into that
realm, that's when

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:24.244 align:middle line:84%
I think we're starting to
deal with something that's

00:15:24.244 --> 00:15:25.410 align:middle line:90%
beyond the ghost experience.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:26.035 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:15:26.035 --> 00:15:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: Now we're
talking about who people--

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're in
a different arena.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:30.394 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: I think we are.

00:15:30.394 --> 00:15:32.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't like to
use the word demon.

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:34.959 align:middle line:84%
I think there are really
bad, horrible people-- living

00:15:34.959 --> 00:15:35.750 align:middle line:90%
people-- out there.

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:37.894 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: And I
can accept that there

00:15:37.894 --> 00:15:39.972 align:middle line:84%
would be really bad,
horrible spirits out there.

00:15:39.972 --> 00:15:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And if you're going to
tune into those energies

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:44.970 align:middle line:84%
and let them
co-mingle with you, I

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:47.580 align:middle line:84%
could see that influence
getting bad and dangerous.

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's the point where
we need to take charge,

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:53.760 align:middle line:84%
leave the environment if we
can-- if you have the means

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.710 align:middle line:84%
to get out of wherever that
is-- but deal with it also

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:57.360 align:middle line:90%
on every level.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.590 align:middle line:84%
On a spiritual level,
medical, and psychological.

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:00.548 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And do it all.

00:16:00.548 --> 00:16:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Technology is making
investigations even better.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:07.110 align:middle line:84%
We're going to show you some
in just a moment on "Beyond

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:14.350 align:middle line:90%
Belief."

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And welcome back
to "Beyond Belief."

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.630 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to talk about
technology, technology that

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:23.380 align:middle line:84%
allows us to look at
ghostly apparitions.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:26.750 align:middle line:84%
Jeff Belanger back with us
and Bill Chappell as well.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:28.400 align:middle line:84%
Jeff, tell us a
little bit about Bill

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.910 align:middle line:90%
and how you two got together.

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:32.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: Well, I've known
Bill for a number of years now.

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:35.845 align:middle line:84%
He's a paranormal engineer
and developer of equipment.

00:16:35.845 --> 00:16:37.970 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with him on
Ghost Adventures and things

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:38.470 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:42.310 align:middle line:84%
All the gear and gadgets you see
these guys use on television,

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:43.280 align:middle line:90%
Bill's been making it.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And so-- but this
new camera that he's

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.350 align:middle line:84%
brought with him
today is the most mind

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.350 align:middle line:84%
blowing thing I've
seen come along yet.

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:52.565 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bill, how did
you invent this stuff?

00:16:52.565 --> 00:16:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BILL CHAPPELL: Well, this is
kind of a culmination things.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.660 align:middle line:84%
Like I've told a lot of people,
it wasn't-- this wasn't an idea

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:00.820 align:middle line:90%
for a paranormal camera.

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.590 align:middle line:84%
I was also working
with a group of people

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:03.716 align:middle line:90%
who were doing telekinesis.

00:17:03.716 --> 00:17:04.215 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:17:04.215 --> 00:17:06.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BILL CHAPPELL: And I was
working on a documentary.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.187 align:middle line:84%
And, George, like anything
else, I'm highly skeptical.

00:17:10.187 --> 00:17:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to understand
what these people were doing.

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.842 align:middle line:84%
And they only want to work
in a darkened environment

00:17:14.842 --> 00:17:17.300 align:middle line:84%
so there's only so many cameras
you can get around a thing.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:18.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAPPELL: So
this type of camera

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.319 align:middle line:84%
is what's used-- is what's
called structured light.

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:23.390 align:middle line:84%
And its lets us
see depth of field,

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.250 align:middle line:84%
it lets us know so many
things we can't even

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:28.079 align:middle line:84%
see with the own eye--
how far you are from me,

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:29.250 align:middle line:90%
how long your arm is.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:31.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, incredible
detail can come out

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:32.630 align:middle line:90%
of one of these devices.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:34.100 align:middle line:90%
So I started with it this way.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.370 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be able to see
where somebody's foot was,

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:37.290 align:middle line:90%
where their arm was.

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing about the software

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:42.265 align:middle line:84%
is it's designed to
find and detect people.

00:17:42.265 --> 00:17:43.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In the dark.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAPPELL: In the dark.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:48.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually-- it's used--
people associate it with games.

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:51.440 align:middle line:84%
The actual endgame for
this, if you go for it,

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.080 align:middle line:84%
is the ultimate
consumer appliance.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see it as
technology goes on.

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:57.870 align:middle line:90%
Everything will use this.

00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:01.480 align:middle line:84%
It'll be the gesture, the
remotes, TV remotes type

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.260 align:middle line:84%
of control, keyboards,
they're history.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.390 align:middle line:84%
Five years now, 10 years
now, that technology

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:07.720 align:middle line:90%
will be outdated.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.950 align:middle line:84%
So this technology
is designed to find

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:11.610 align:middle line:90%
people in a given space.

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And these cameras
have a depth of field

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:17.860 align:middle line:84%
of about 16 to 20 feet and
about a 60 degree angle.

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:21.590 align:middle line:84%
So in working with this,
I had this table set up

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:23.230 align:middle line:84%
and I was working
with a group and I

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:26.020 align:middle line:84%
noticed that-- I could see,
it did exactly what I thought.

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.520 align:middle line:84%
I could see somebody
move their arm,

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.075 align:middle line:84%
and because of the
position of their elbow--

00:18:29.075 --> 00:18:31.580 align:middle line:84%
like I put it behind here--
it would still pretty much,

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.340 align:middle line:84%
the computer would
generate a skeletal field

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.810 align:middle line:90%
based on this part of the torso.

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:37.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you'd see the
real movement and all that.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAPPELL: Yeah.

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:39.680 align:middle line:84%
It would let me know
where the hand went.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.070 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
a camera wouldn't

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:42.445 align:middle line:84%
let me know what's
going on here,

00:18:42.445 --> 00:18:43.960 align:middle line:90%
but it could see the rest of it.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.250 align:middle line:90%
So it was really interesting.

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:46.570 align:middle line:90%
I thought it worked great.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And then everybody left
the room for a break

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:54.120 align:middle line:84%
and there was two chairs
and a little podium.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And I look up and the
camera is showing me

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:59.762 align:middle line:84%
something standing
on top of the podium.

00:18:59.762 --> 00:19:00.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a person.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.595 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAPPELL: A person.

00:19:01.595 --> 00:19:02.360 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And at first I kind
of thought, well, this

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:05.867 align:middle line:90%
is some kind of weird thing.

00:19:05.867 --> 00:19:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm trying to
shine lights and figure out

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:08.800 align:middle line:90%
what's going on.

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thinking maybe
there's somebody there, right?

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAPPELL: Somebody started
to walk into the room

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:12.639 align:middle line:90%
and it disappeared.

00:19:12.639 --> 00:19:14.305 align:middle line:84%
And that's where it
started me thinking,

00:19:14.305 --> 00:19:16.220 align:middle line:84%
well, maybe this
is something else.

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.210 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
I started doing

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:20.240 align:middle line:84%
was taking this off
the shelf device

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.780 align:middle line:84%
and I started
manipulating what's

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:23.060 align:middle line:90%
called the incidental angle.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:25.197 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to change
the depth of field

00:19:25.197 --> 00:19:26.905 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to change
some of the ratios

00:19:26.905 --> 00:19:28.740 align:middle line:90%
and proportions it worked with.

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And then we started
modifying the software.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:35.600 align:middle line:84%
The clip we're going to show
today is one where I rented out

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and entire hotel, just
myself and a friend.

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:40.000 align:middle line:90%
And we had it for four days.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.310 align:middle line:90%
So I try to eliminate anybody.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:44.300 align:middle line:90%
There was one person.

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.530 align:middle line:84%
There was a caretaker that lived
in the basement of the hotel.

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:48.490 align:middle line:84%
He was the only other
person in the hotel when

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:49.823 align:middle line:90%
we were doing these experiments.

00:19:49.823 --> 00:19:54.100 align:middle line:84%
So it was kind of a thing
that was solidifying

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.720 align:middle line:84%
something else was
going on for me.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.150 align:middle line:84%
Because, like I say,
I'm like everybody else.

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:01.077 align:middle line:84%
I have a belief that it goes
on but I don't know what it is.

00:20:01.077 --> 00:20:02.160 align:middle line:90%
And I'm always trying to--

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's take a--

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:02.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAPPELL: --find a better way.

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.773 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --look at what
you brought us here.

00:20:04.773 --> 00:20:06.634 align:middle line:90%


00:20:06.634 --> 00:20:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: So this clip,
I mean, that's Bill.

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:08.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAPPELL: Yeah.

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:09.739 align:middle line:90%
I'm sitting in a chair.

00:20:09.739 --> 00:20:10.488 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: Right.

00:20:10.488 --> 00:20:12.307 align:middle line:84%
So that's the software
doing exactly what

00:20:12.307 --> 00:20:13.140 align:middle line:90%
it's supposed to do.

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:13.640 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:17.030 align:middle line:84%
That's-- it mapped Bill,
a regular living person.

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:19.437 align:middle line:84%
And then this next part,
there was nothing in there

00:20:19.437 --> 00:20:20.020 align:middle line:90%
and suddenly--

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.186 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAPPELL: You see how it
forms from the center out

00:20:22.186 --> 00:20:22.850 align:middle line:90%
as it drops in?

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: Right.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And now we're seeing a living
person next to the stick figure

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:28.564 align:middle line:90%
in the chair, right?

00:20:28.564 --> 00:20:30.230 align:middle line:84%
You can see there's
nothing in the chair

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.320 align:middle line:84%
and now there's a living
person and there actually

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:33.590 align:middle line:90%
starts to be some interaction.

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:36.140 align:middle line:84%
This is where it
gets mind blowing.

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:36.780 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAPPELL: Now,
in this clip, this

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:40.950 align:middle line:84%
is actually the caretaker
we're talking about.

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And he's in here with
us for a few minutes.

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And we're playing
with the lights

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:46.580 align:middle line:90%
on and taking the lights off.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And now he's left the frame and
I'm walking in from the side

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.446 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
walk up to the chair

00:20:53.446 --> 00:20:54.820 align:middle line:84%
and you'll see me
put my arm out.

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.236 align:middle line:84%
Now, watch the
figure in the chair

00:20:56.236 --> 00:21:00.150 align:middle line:84%
because it's going to turn,
rotate and grab my arm.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: To me, this is
some of the most compelling

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:02.620 align:middle line:90%
footage--

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:02.986 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's small.

00:21:02.986 --> 00:21:03.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: --I've seen.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:04.860 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's like a child.

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's unbelievable.

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: So
when you see that,

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:08.650 align:middle line:84%
what's so incredible
to me, George,

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:10.890 align:middle line:84%
is that the camera is doing
what it's supposed to do.

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:11.820 align:middle line:90%
Find a human.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:12.445 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:21:12.445 --> 00:21:13.361 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: It's not--

00:21:13.361 --> 00:21:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It doesn't know if
its an apparition or not.

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:16.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: It just-- right.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:17.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's-- it's something.

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: It's doing
what it's supposed to do.

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:19.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.916 align:middle line:84%
And that was the Cripple Creek
Hotel in the Cripple Creek,

00:21:21.916 --> 00:21:25.470 align:middle line:84%
Colorado, which is-- it's
not a really well known haunt

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.090 align:middle line:90%
but it's getting there.

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:29.510 align:middle line:84%
A former hospital from
the Sisters of Mercy

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:30.870 align:middle line:90%
in the late 1800s.

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And this was a
lawless mining town,

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:36.440 align:middle line:84%
this is where miners went
who had accidents, victims

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.634 align:middle line:84%
of shootouts, cholera, like
all the various diseases that

00:21:39.634 --> 00:21:40.800 align:middle line:90%
came through that community.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's a hospital,
is this building,

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:43.799 align:middle line:90%
was a former hospital.

00:21:43.799 --> 00:21:45.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's got the history
and the back story.

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And plenty of
eyewitness accounts.

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:49.981 align:middle line:84%
And so you set this
thing up and all

00:21:49.981 --> 00:21:51.480 align:middle line:84%
it does is what
it's supposed to do.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.430 align:middle line:90%
Look for people.

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
standing there, George,

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:55.910 align:middle line:84%
and you see yourself
get mapped in

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:57.630 align:middle line:84%
and you see yourself
in the software,

00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:00.254 align:middle line:84%
and something's next to you and
sometimes you can even feel it,

00:22:00.254 --> 00:22:01.460 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of a cold area--

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:02.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: --and it's really
validating what you're feeling,

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:07.110 align:middle line:84%
what you're experiencing
at the time.

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:08.372 align:middle line:90%
And I can't explain it.

00:22:08.372 --> 00:22:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I love,
that's what I live for.

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:14.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What this, to a
novice, me, is picking up

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:15.630 align:middle line:90%
is energy waves.

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: Right.

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:17.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAPPELL: To a sense, yeah.

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:18.633 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Whether
it's physical or not,

00:22:18.633 --> 00:22:21.070 align:middle line:84%
it's picking up energy
first and foremost.

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:21.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: Sure.

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:23.690 align:middle line:84%
In the infrared part of
the spectrum, right, Bill?

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:25.148 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAPPELL: Well,
the infrared-- it

00:22:25.148 --> 00:22:26.610 align:middle line:84%
could actually be
done either way.

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:28.350 align:middle line:84%
The idea with
structured light is

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:30.740 align:middle line:84%
that you're sending
out a known pattern.

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:32.340 align:middle line:84%
The reason it's
done in infrared is

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.550 align:middle line:84%
because it's undetectable
to you and I.

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:37.380 align:middle line:84%
We don't see it so it doesn't
disturb the experience

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:39.120 align:middle line:90%
or whatever we're doing.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.984 align:middle line:84%
The camera knows
what it should see.

00:22:40.984 --> 00:22:43.150 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if you can
imagine it's something as

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:46.660 align:middle line:84%
simple as just X. It's much
more elaborate, but that idea.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:49.520 align:middle line:84%
So then it looks for distortions
within that field of view.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And by looking at that
distortion head on-- first,

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:54.220 align:middle line:90%
it looks for pixel distortion.

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Is it elongated,
does it stretch?

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And then it has a secondary
camera that's off axis to it.

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And by using just
a simple algorithm,

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:04.640 align:middle line:84%
you can calculate the
distortion of the pixel

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.420 align:middle line:84%
and where it is in reference
to the center of the screen.

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's what gives
the unit the ability

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:11.785 align:middle line:84%
to actually calculate
depth of field

00:23:11.785 --> 00:23:13.820 align:middle line:90%
and how far away something is.

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:15.610 align:middle line:84%
The camera will
actually gradient things

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:19.470 align:middle line:84%
so as you're walking through an
environment I can see the desk

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:22.010 align:middle line:84%
and it'll actually change color
towards the end of the desk.

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:24.840 align:middle line:84%
So I know how far
away something is.

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.600 align:middle line:84%
If I pan through here, I
know you're closer to me

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.640 align:middle line:90%
then George is.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Not-- and you might be a small
person, or a tall person,

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:35.174 align:middle line:84%
but I can actually, physically,
tell the difference.

00:23:35.174 --> 00:23:37.090 align:middle line:84%
Much different than we
can with our human eye.

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:39.390 align:middle line:84%
We don't discern depth
quite the same way.

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:42.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are these
ghostly apparitions,

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:43.950 align:middle line:90%
are the everywhere?

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:47.900 align:middle line:84%
When you scan a camera
somewhere, are they everywhere?

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.416 align:middle line:84%
Or in some cases,
nothing is there?

00:23:50.416 --> 00:23:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAPPELL: Well, a lot
of times-- and that's

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:53.170 align:middle line:90%
the frustrating part.

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:56.900 align:middle line:84%
There's certain places that
are just teeming with activity.

00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:01.420 align:middle line:84%
One time at the Saint Nicholas
it was just everywhere we

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:02.900 align:middle line:90%
particularly went and set up.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.724 align:middle line:84%
We had this one room where
the nuns were supposed to be

00:24:05.724 --> 00:24:07.640 align:middle line:84%
and people had seen them
praying over the beds

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:10.181 align:middle line:84%
and we actually have footage of
something standing on the bed

00:24:10.181 --> 00:24:13.300 align:middle line:90%
and then it actually lays down.

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:16.080 align:middle line:84%
We have one clip where
Dave Schrader was with me,

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:19.106 align:middle line:84%
and Dave is in the room and I
say, Dave, hold on a second.

00:24:19.106 --> 00:24:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And he stops and
you can actually

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.360 align:middle line:84%
see this figure turned towards
him and take a step towards him

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:23.942 align:middle line:90%
and walk out.

00:24:23.942 --> 00:24:25.400 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
point in time we'll

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.016 align:middle line:84%
go to another location,
or a different time

00:24:28.016 --> 00:24:29.890 align:middle line:84%
at the same location,
and nothing will occur.

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:30.598 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing.

00:24:30.598 --> 00:24:34.030 align:middle line:84%
If you were to take
this to Gettysburg,

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:38.007 align:middle line:84%
I would guess you'd have
apparitions all over the place.

00:24:38.007 --> 00:24:39.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAPPELL: It's possible.

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: Depends
on the day, right?

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:41.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAPPELL: It depends
on the day, absolutely.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:42.734 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: Bill was
kind enough to let

00:24:42.734 --> 00:24:44.800 align:middle line:84%
me be a beta tester
for one of his devices

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.760 align:middle line:84%
and I've taken it to
four different haunts

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.950 align:middle line:84%
around New England
on investigations.

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:49.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Successfully?

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: Three
nothing happened.

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:53.224 align:middle line:90%
But the fourth, it did.

00:24:53.224 --> 00:24:54.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There it was.

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:55.947 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: To me
that's further vali--

00:24:55.947 --> 00:24:57.530 align:middle line:84%
if it happened every
time I would say,

00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:58.488 align:middle line:90%
Bill, what's happening?

00:24:58.488 --> 00:24:59.840 align:middle line:90%
Every time, really?

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.284 align:middle line:84%
But three times I let it
run for hours and hours

00:25:02.284 --> 00:25:03.200 align:middle line:90%
in different sections.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.283 align:middle line:90%
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

00:25:04.283 --> 00:25:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And then this one-- it was
an old home, an old Victorian

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:08.110 align:middle line:90%
mansion.

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:10.484 align:middle line:84%
And I was standing there and
I saw myself get mapped in

00:25:10.484 --> 00:25:12.650 align:middle line:84%
and then this figure was
mapped in right next to me.

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And the homeowners
looking and he said,

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.010 align:middle line:84%
there used to be
a doorway there.

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:17.110 align:middle line:90%
That used to be a room.

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And he showed me,
after the event ended.

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:20.910 align:middle line:84%
You can see in the plaster
and you went behind

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:22.920 align:middle line:84%
and it's now became a
closet for another room.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.253 align:middle line:84%
There used to be doorway and
there was a figure standing

00:25:25.253 --> 00:25:27.292 align:middle line:84%
in what would have
been this doorway.

00:25:27.292 --> 00:25:28.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it moving?

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:30.105 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: It moved a little,
just a couple arm movements.

00:25:30.105 --> 00:25:31.530 align:middle line:90%
It only lasted a few seconds.

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.807 align:middle line:84%
My experience was
five or six seconds,

00:25:33.807 --> 00:25:34.890 align:middle line:90%
which is pretty long time.

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:35.681 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's not.

00:25:35.681 --> 00:25:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do these figures
walk into the scene

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:40.160 align:middle line:90%
or just appear and disappear?

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAPPELL: You know,
I've only seen it one time

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:46.550 align:middle line:84%
that we actually had something
walk into the screen.

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:50.270 align:middle line:84%
It's usually when you see it
it's almost like it unfolds.

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:52.270 align:middle line:84%
It starts from the
center and it breaks out.

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:54.960 align:middle line:84%
If I would show
you shots of this

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.425 align:middle line:84%
where we're mapping
people, the thing when

00:25:57.425 --> 00:25:59.800 align:middle line:84%
I let people play with this
I say, go around and find out

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.240 align:middle line:84%
just how difficult it is
to let this camera find

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.610 align:middle line:84%
somebody and project
a skeleton on it.

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:06.940 align:middle line:90%
Is it's not a simple process.

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.760 align:middle line:84%
But the person almost
shows up simultaneously.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:10.770 align:middle line:90%
Complete.

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:13.610 align:middle line:84%
Every time we find something
that's I would assume

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:18.860 align:middle line:84%
is not human, it's almost like
it unfolds in the environment.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:20.650 align:middle line:84%
It either drops
down from the top

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:22.730 align:middle line:84%
or from the center and
it just folds out like--

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:23.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Truly amazing.

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:24.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAPPELL: --it's forming it.

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:26.126 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, the
next evolution of this,

00:26:26.126 --> 00:26:28.710 align:middle line:84%
Bill and Jeff, is probably going
to be a communication device.

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:29.709 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: We're close.

00:26:29.709 --> 00:26:32.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because once you
realize they're there,

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:34.710 align:middle line:84%
the next step is to realize
how can you communicate

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:39.552 align:middle line:84%
with this being and you
might be onto something here.

00:26:39.552 --> 00:26:41.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: I really
think we're getting close.

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:43.240 align:middle line:90%
Proof is a very strong word--

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Edison
would have loved you.

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:47.226 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you are the
reincarnated Edison.

00:26:47.226 --> 00:26:48.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAPPELL: You never know.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: They
would have got along,

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:49.700 align:middle line:90%
I can tell you that for sure.

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAPPELL: Yeah, we
would have got along.

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: They definitely
would have got along.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do look alike.

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: A little
bit, little bit.

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:55.430 align:middle line:84%
But I think we're
getting close, George.

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:57.470 align:middle line:84%
I think stuff like
this, this camera that's

00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:58.970 align:middle line:84%
just doing what
it's supposed to do.

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:00.178 align:middle line:90%
Like you said, communication.

00:27:00.178 --> 00:27:02.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I could just wave
yes for no or whatever.

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.529 align:middle line:90%
You can establish that.

00:27:05.529 --> 00:27:07.320 align:middle line:84%
But what makes it start,
what makes it end,

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.030 align:middle line:84%
it's going to take a
lot of further study.

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:10.071 align:middle line:90%
But this is cutting edge.

00:27:10.071 --> 00:27:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you tried to
talk to the entity knowing

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:13.772 align:middle line:90%
that it was on camera?

00:27:13.772 --> 00:27:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: Absolutely.

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Once something starts to
happen, then we go into--

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it seem like
it's listening to you?

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.319 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: Well,
you can-- when it--

00:27:21.319 --> 00:27:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAPPELL: Sometimes--
sometimes yes and sometimes no.

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's-- that's similar
to what we've experienced

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:28.530 align:middle line:90%
in different types of things.

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's almost impervious
to what's going around it.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.460 align:middle line:84%
In the clip you saw it
actually-- I put my hand down

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:37.145 align:middle line:84%
to the chair, it rotates in
the chair and grabs my arm.

00:27:37.145 --> 00:27:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, it kind
of grabbed your arm.

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: But when I see
something map on the camera,

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:42.240 align:middle line:90%
that's my first question.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.240 align:middle line:90%
Can you raise your hand?

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.080 align:middle line:90%
Just put your hand up.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:44.880 align:middle line:90%
Let me know you understand.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:45.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or come to me.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:45.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: Yeah.

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Let me know that
we're communicating.

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And does
anything like that--

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: Can you hear me?

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --happen?

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: I haven't
had it happen yet

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:51.950 align:middle line:90%
but it's been fleeting so far.

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:52.825 align:middle line:90%
But you have, right?

00:27:52.825 --> 00:27:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAPPELL: I had
when we were shooting

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:56.489 align:middle line:84%
one of the episodes for
the-- can I say the?

00:27:56.489 --> 00:27:57.072 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:27:57.072 --> 00:27:57.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: "Ghost Adventures."

00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAPPELL: For
"Ghost Adventurers."

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And Billy Tolley and I-- Nick
had had a family emergency

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:04.970 align:middle line:84%
and left when we were in Cripple
Creek in another location.

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And Billy's downstairs
and he says,

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:08.690 align:middle line:84%
let me know if
something's going on.

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:10.315 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting--
and I've been sitting

00:28:10.315 --> 00:28:12.750 align:middle line:84%
in this room for like an
hour and nothing's going on.

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:14.124 align:middle line:84%
I'm in the dark
and I'm just kind

00:28:14.124 --> 00:28:17.550 align:middle line:84%
of fidgeting back and forth
with four cameras sitting on me.

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of sudden,
boom this thing pops in.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very small and it's
sitting up on a coffee table.

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.670 align:middle line:90%
And the feet are waving around.

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to get his
attention and he comes up.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And finally he gets up there
and I'm going, can you wave?

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:31.680 align:middle line:90%
Can you wave at us?

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:32.420 align:middle line:90%
Wave at Billy.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And you see it put it's
arm up and do this.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:35.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So it listened?

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAPPELL: I did.

00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:36.640 align:middle line:90%
We had the same--

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love that.

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:38.821 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAPPELL: The very
first time we actually

00:28:38.821 --> 00:28:40.470 align:middle line:84%
experimented in a
paranormal state

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:middle line:84%
where we would intentionally
using the camera

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.270 align:middle line:84%
for that use was actually
the the St. James hotel.

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And, again, I had
the entire hotel.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And I had Chris
Fleming, a psychic.

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:52.345 align:middle line:84%
And Chris is there
and Chris has no idea.

00:28:52.345 --> 00:28:55.140 align:middle line:84%
The new systems I take out,
I project it on the ceiling

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:57.660 align:middle line:84%
so the user can see
the interaction.

00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.250 align:middle line:84%
But Chris had no
idea what's going on

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:01.660 align:middle line:84%
and I wouldn't let anybody
say anything to him.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:05.360 align:middle line:84%
He's like, is there someone
there, can you give us a sign?

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:08.155 align:middle line:84%
And this thing pops in right
next to Chris, right down

00:29:08.155 --> 00:29:08.780 align:middle line:90%
about his knee.

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:09.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Little again.

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:10.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BELANGER: Little again.

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:10.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Small.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAPPELL: And
you could see it.

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like it's
trying to pound on his knee.

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And Chris is going,
can you give me a sign?

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And this thing is
just hitting him.

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:17.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These are like little
leprechauns or something.

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:19.529 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAPPELL: You know, I
don't know what that is,

00:29:19.529 --> 00:29:21.480 align:middle line:84%
George, when you look
at the type of things

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:24.600 align:middle line:84%
we're doing if this is
a dimensional phenomena.

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.000 align:middle line:84%
The size of it could
be simply nothing more

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.630 align:middle line:84%
than a lensing or
a Doppler effect.

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:31.730 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult
to understand.

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's so new and I'm
very cautious to jump out

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:36.120 align:middle line:90%
there and go, hey, this is it.

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:37.430 align:middle line:90%
Because, ultimately--

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:38.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, they may not be--

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAPPELL: You pay
the price with that.

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --ghosts.

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.640 align:middle line:84%
They may be entities
from another dimension

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.070 align:middle line:90%
that this is picking up.

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BELANGER: That's some of the
most interesting conversations

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:46.665 align:middle line:90%
that we've had.

00:29:46.665 --> 00:29:48.590 align:middle line:84%
When we go to breakfast
and lunch and stuff

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:51.120 align:middle line:84%
at these events and we start
talking about the why and the

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:51.930 align:middle line:90%
how.

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Is it a projection of
our own conscious mind?

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:55.880 align:middle line:90%
Which is still amazing, right?

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:56.200 align:middle line:90%
That's something.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.075 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is super.

00:29:57.075 --> 00:29:58.600 align:middle line:90%
Will, Bill, good luck with this.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And, Jeff, thanks for
bringing this along with us.

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:03.500 align:middle line:84%
This is an incredible
device that I

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.490 align:middle line:84%
think one day might
be a communication

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:07.620 align:middle line:90%
device with the other side.

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:08.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
Beyond Belief.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:27.067 align:middle line:90%
