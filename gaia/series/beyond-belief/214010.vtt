00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:20.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.790 align:middle line:10%
We've got a great
pram for you today.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.570 align:middle line:10%
Roger Burnley with us,
an intuitive life coach

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.680 align:middle line:10%
and a trance channel with 36
years of incredible experience.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.460 align:middle line:84%
He equips people with
personalized tools

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.260 align:middle line:84%
to unlock their inner
wisdom, and their

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.120 align:middle line:90%
manifesting their goals.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.110 align:middle line:84%
His firm belief in the untapped
potential within people

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.660 align:middle line:84%
fuels his incredible
mission to help

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.670 align:middle line:90%
them create their dream lives.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.932 align:middle line:84%
That's an amazing
task that you do, Rog.

00:00:48.932 --> 00:00:50.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ROGER BURNLEY:
Thank you, George.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's one that I've actually
run from for a long time.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BURNLEY: Because it was a
little unbelievable to me.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.430 align:middle line:10%
And so which was perfect for
me to be on "Beyond Belief"

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.079 align:middle line:10%
because it was not something
that I set out to do.

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:07.160 align:middle line:84%
The first part of my life,
I did so many other things.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.930 align:middle line:84%
I had many, many
different careers.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.630 align:middle line:84%
I was a vocal coach
for more than 35 years.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:12.890 align:middle line:90%
I had run businesses.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.120 align:middle line:90%
I did all of that.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.810 align:middle line:10%
But then it started
to come to the place

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.700 align:middle line:10%
where I knew I was
receiving information

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.200 align:middle line:10%
that was going to help--

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.410 align:middle line:10%
help the collective, basically,
in terms of this transition

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.250 align:middle line:10%
that we're moving
through in the world.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I bet you've seen all
kinds of things in your career.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BURNLEY: Yes, tons.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've-- working
with so many people--

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.040 align:middle line:84%
and I was just really
thinking about this.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.700 align:middle line:84%
I've worked, you know, coached
thousands of people over a time.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.910 align:middle line:84%
But you start to understand
human nature a lot more.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.220 align:middle line:84%
You start to
understand behavior.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.900 align:middle line:84%
But then it took me into a whole
other thing, this intuitive

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:48.710 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.080 align:middle line:84%
We're all intuitive and I,
you know, we just have it.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.930 align:middle line:84%
It just develops in different
ways for each of us.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Mine was a little
frightening in the beginning

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.500 align:middle line:90%
because I ignored it.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until 1988
that I started to do--

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.900 align:middle line:90%
I did automatic writing.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.240 align:middle line:90%
That's where it started.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Then I was receiving
information,

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.870 align:middle line:84%
but I wasn't going
to tell anyone

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:13.020 align:middle line:84%
because it was surprising
what was coming through.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.670 align:middle line:90%
And I spent about--

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.050 align:middle line:84%
I kind of hid it for
20 years, and then it

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.600 align:middle line:84%
got exposed at a certain
point because someone

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.020 align:middle line:90%
found some of my writings.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.680 align:middle line:84%
I would sit down every day,
and receive information.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.030 align:middle line:90%
And it was helping me.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.530 align:middle line:90%
It helped me with coaching.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.590 align:middle line:84%
It helped me with performing
so many other things.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.830 align:middle line:84%
But it was so out
of the ordinary

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.120 align:middle line:84%
that I wasn't going to
tell people about it.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And it was others who
started saying to me, Roger,

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.360 align:middle line:84%
we think you have something
else you're supposed to do.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.340 align:middle line:90%
That's really how it happened.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The automatic writing--

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.355 align:middle line:90%
who were you channeling?

00:02:49.355 --> 00:02:51.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BURNLEY: The name--
OK, in '88, I'm

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.020 align:middle line:84%
sitting down and making
a change in my life,

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.310 align:middle line:90%
and I am freaked out.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And I happen to read an
article from some guy who

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.070 align:middle line:90%
was talking about business.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And he said he started
doing automatic writing

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.980 align:middle line:84%
and he received information
that helped his business.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:08.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm desperate.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.350 align:middle line:90%
So I said, OK, I'll do anything.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.110 align:middle line:84%
I had been meditating
for a while,

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.142 align:middle line:84%
but I said, let
me try this thing.

00:03:14.142 --> 00:03:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting down and I said,
you know, let me have some paper

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.600 align:middle line:90%
and pen and see what happens.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.850 align:middle line:84%
For the first several
days, nothing happened.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
it felt like something

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.990 align:middle line:90%
took over my hand--

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Clicked in--

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BURNLEY: Yeah, and
I started writing.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was I'm having
this conversation.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And then when it
first came through,

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.390 align:middle line:90%
I said, who's speaking to me?

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And I heard very clearly,
this is another part of you.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.350 align:middle line:90%
It's your higher self.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.850 align:middle line:84%
But if that makes
you uncomfortable,

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.560 align:middle line:84%
you can call us
whatever you like.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Wilhelm,
I have no idea.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.450 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I had no clue as
to why I would say that name.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't know anyone
with that name.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm not German.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.310 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know
where it came from.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't revealed to me
until 30 years later about that.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.020 align:middle line:84%
Because it was saying
we have a connection.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.980 align:middle line:90%
We all do.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.050 align:middle line:90%
We come to find it out--

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.680 align:middle line:84%
find out what that is as we move
through our lives, as we ascend.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.540 align:middle line:84%
But those connections, my
work became very specific.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.950 align:middle line:84%
It was about-- every single
soul has this evolutionary path

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.860 align:middle line:84%
that they're on, and
there's not accidental

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.720 align:middle line:84%
that when they
show up, they just

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.240 align:middle line:84%
have to move through the
blockages and the resistance

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.950 align:middle line:84%
and the limitations
that we all have.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.330 align:middle line:84%
So the work started to
come about saying we all

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.940 align:middle line:84%
come into the world, we're not--
we don't come into the world

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:32.740 align:middle line:90%
naked.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.120 align:middle line:84%
We come in with
consciousness, but it

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.490 align:middle line:84%
comes from different places
and it's always limited.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.345 align:middle line:84%
So unless we decide
that we're going

00:04:40.345 --> 00:04:41.720 align:middle line:84%
to move through
those limitations

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.600 align:middle line:84%
in our individual lives,
we don't live the lives

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.110 align:middle line:90%
that we could have.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's a consciousness
that also develops over time.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, we know certain
things that we were able to do,

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.380 align:middle line:90%
you know, 100 years ago.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.010 align:middle line:84%
We can do much easier
now because that's

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.960 align:middle line:84%
the process of the
evolution that we

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.150 align:middle line:84%
move through in
our consciousness,

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.002 align:middle line:84%
but also in basically
in our world.

00:05:05.002 --> 00:05:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'll come back to that
name, Wilhelm, in just a moment.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.480 align:middle line:90%
Now, we talk about ascension.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.680 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean to you?

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BURNLEY: It means
that we're moving

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.480 align:middle line:84%
to a higher state of
understanding of consciousness.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.810 align:middle line:84%
We come into the world,
we're physical bodies,

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.860 align:middle line:84%
but we have a spirit and
an essence that is always

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.580 align:middle line:90%
within every single person.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.810 align:middle line:84%
But it's unique,
and it is different

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.020 align:middle line:90%
for every single person.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.860 align:middle line:84%
But if we don't understand that
we're all doing the same thing,

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.420 align:middle line:84%
then we start to
create conflict.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.820 align:middle line:90%
We start to create divisions.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.500 align:middle line:90%
And that's what was going on.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.810 align:middle line:84%
That's what's happening
in the world currently.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.050 align:middle line:90%
And so it just kind of went on.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.000 align:middle line:84%
From there, I kind
of sensed what

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.710 align:middle line:90%
was happening over the years.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.120 align:middle line:84%
And it was in 2019 that I
decided to release a book.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was kind asked to do
it because I was resisting.

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And I had a great
friend, Cam Kaminsky,

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.290 align:middle line:84%
who did help me
get this book done.

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.337 align:middle line:10%
It's called "Overcoming
Fear, a Guide to Freedom."

00:06:04.337 --> 00:06:05.420 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I've heard of it.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.230 align:middle line:10%
>>BURNLEY: Yeah, because fear
is that thing that holds us back

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.890 align:middle line:10%
from doing and making the steps
that we could make in our lives

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.317 align:middle line:10%
to understand and actually
ascend to a higher

00:06:16.317 --> 00:06:17.275 align:middle line:10%
state of consciousness.

00:06:17.275 --> 00:06:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's that
fear of I can't do it.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BURNLEY: Exactly.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.100 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And when you-- and I--
and I saw that so much

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.940 align:middle line:84%
when I actually when I was
coaching voice-- when I

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.690 align:middle line:90%
was doing that, I would see it.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.920 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, people just couldn't
hold on to who they were.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And I even had someone who came
to me because her therapist had

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.780 align:middle line:84%
referred her because they felt
some trauma must have happened

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.730 align:middle line:84%
for you because you're
not able to speak,

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.630 align:middle line:84%
and you're not using
your voice correctly.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.460 align:middle line:90%
Maybe voice lessons would help.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And so we did that,
and it actually it did.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.150 align:middle line:84%
She started to own
herself a little bit more

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:52.525 align:middle line:90%
by owning her voice.

00:06:52.525 --> 00:06:53.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's incredible.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BURNLEY: It was pretty
amazing to me as well.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And I kept-- and
again, like I said,

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.560 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand
what was happening.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And when I wrote the book in
2019, when it was released,

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.740 align:middle line:84%
I sensed something was
happening in the world.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.900 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't tell you
how I knew this,

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.140 align:middle line:84%
but I can go back and see
that I had written things

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.330 align:middle line:84%
that I had received
from Wilhelm that

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:16.890 align:middle line:84%
were talking about
the events that

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.050 align:middle line:90%
were happening in our world.

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen-- you've had many
people on talking about 2012.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't as familiar
as others with that.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.660 align:middle line:84%
But I'll just tell
you the story.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.170 align:middle line:84%
What happened in--
and this was 2021.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:32.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm out for a walk.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.960 align:middle line:84%
This is right
after the pandemic.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.740 align:middle line:90%
And I'm getting some exercise.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:36.790 align:middle line:90%
I go out for a walk.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.090 align:middle line:84%
I hear very clearly,
we gave you everything

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.470 align:middle line:90%
you needed to know in 2012.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:42.550 align:middle line:90%
And that sounded--

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We handed it to you.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:44.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BURNLEY: That's what I heard--

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.105 align:middle line:90%
was that we gave it to you.

00:07:46.105 --> 00:07:48.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, I wrote it down,
and I said that-- that

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.420 align:middle line:90%
didn't make sense to me.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.940 align:middle line:84%
I come into my
house-- and I just

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.940 align:middle line:84%
want people to have the story
because I come into my house,

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.600 align:middle line:84%
I go to my computer and I
look and I find a folder

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.783 align:middle line:90%
that I hadn't seen.

00:07:59.783 --> 00:08:01.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know if
it was a time where

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.030 align:middle line:84%
I had an assistant that
made this folder, but--

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tucked it away.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:05.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BURNLEY: Exactly.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:06.680 align:middle line:90%
And I never saw it.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And it was labeled
Wilhelm and I opened it.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And there are all these
messages from 2012.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.410 align:middle line:84%
The very first message was
titled infinite intelligence,

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:19.390 align:middle line:90%
saying, we all have it.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:22.460 align:middle line:84%
We just have to decide that
we're going to access it.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.690 align:middle line:90%
And it's a process.

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And that process
is our ascension.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.520 align:middle line:84%
That is what we each
do individually,

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.410 align:middle line:90%
and we do it collectively.

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And so when we refuse to move
through those restrictions

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.429 align:middle line:84%
and the old things,
the old paradigms,

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:39.530 align:middle line:84%
basically, then we have
difficulties in our lives.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.679 align:middle line:84%
And also we see it manifest
in our world, which

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:43.919 align:middle line:90%
is what we're seeing now.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Roger, do you think
it's easy for individuals

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.660 align:middle line:90%
to discover their life purpose?

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BURNLEY: Yes, I'm going
to say that because I want--

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:55.400 align:middle line:84%
because I've seen it happen
and because what happens--

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.310 align:middle line:84%
when I did this, I was
doubting all of this forever.

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And so there were so many things
that I received at that time

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:06.420 align:middle line:84%
because they also said that
we gave you information.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And we also did it
on specific days.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And then we also
gave you information

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.760 align:middle line:84%
that would resonate
on someone's birthday.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.430 align:middle line:84%
If you meet someone and if
we've given you a message,

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:17.910 align:middle line:90%
it will make sense for them.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.080 align:middle line:84%
I said that didn't
make sense either.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.690 align:middle line:84%
It says, yes, you're
all connected.

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And so-- and I was just
receiving cosmic guidance

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:26.460 align:middle line:90%
about--

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.310 align:middle line:84%
I even received it about
you on your birthday

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:30.090 align:middle line:84%
because I happened to
look it up last night.

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:31.048 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep, June 4th.

00:09:31.048 --> 00:09:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BURNLEY: And it says that
it was about flexibility

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:35.630 align:middle line:84%
and that you have
been this person who

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:39.230 align:middle line:84%
has been flexible in what you
could do because you are always

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:40.800 align:middle line:90%
seeking new information.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And that was one of the
greatest benefits for--

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:48.540 align:middle line:84%
for our humanity to be curious
enough to find different--

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And the message said again, when
you don't-- when you think that

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:56.390 align:middle line:84%
you know it all and you don't--
you close yourself off from new

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:57.960 align:middle line:90%
information that could come.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And so your entire life
has been about bringing

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.860 align:middle line:84%
in new information and
breaking down barriers.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.420 align:middle line:90%
And this is what we need.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.512 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it was so
incredibly important.

00:10:08.512 --> 00:10:10.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk about
Wilhelm for a moment.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.500 align:middle line:84%
Recently, Wilhelm
spoke on the importance

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.610 align:middle line:90%
of individual ascension process.

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:15.410 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:16.210 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:18.740 align:middle line:84%
- Too many of you-- we said
billions of people have

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:22.060 align:middle line:84%
forgotten who they are and don't
know that they're connected

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:22.860 align:middle line:90%
to source.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.620 align:middle line:84%
They're connected
to God, to Allah,

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:28.970 align:middle line:84%
to whatever-- whatever idea you
have about the great beyond,

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:32.010 align:middle line:84%
you're all connected and we've
given you something different.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:34.370 align:middle line:84%
We said that our
work was to combine,

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.380 align:middle line:84%
to take you through your
personal development

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:37.838 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
you have to do.

00:10:37.838 --> 00:10:39.848 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to do
a self-actualization.

00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:42.140 align:middle line:84%
That means moving through
that process of understanding

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.570 align:middle line:84%
how important you are and
you can create the life

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.680 align:middle line:84%
that you want to have or
you can do the career.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.347 align:middle line:84%
And that's about getting rid of
your-- your-- your-- your doubts

00:10:49.347 --> 00:10:52.880 align:middle line:84%
and building more in your--
your courage and building

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.550 align:middle line:84%
more of your empowerment because
then you can see wait a minute,

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.060 align:middle line:90%
this is what I'm supposed to do.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, imagine if more people are
doing that and they're happy

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:02.635 align:middle line:84%
and they're not fighting
with one another.

00:11:02.635 --> 00:11:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Can't you see how that would
cause your planet to evolve?

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
told you would happen.

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:07.530 align:middle line:90%
But you couldn't believe it.

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:09.740 align:middle line:84%
But don't worry, because our
being couldn't believe it

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:10.540 align:middle line:90%
either.

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:14.210 align:middle line:84%
Even though we have taken him
through every single difficult

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:16.050 align:middle line:90%
thing a human can experience.

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And now he's sitting
here at 73 years old

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:19.830 align:middle line:90%
and everything's healed.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And we've demonstrated
all of that.

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:23.040 align:middle line:90%
And we've told you over--

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.580 align:middle line:84%
over all these past
years because you

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.025 align:middle line:90%
don't accept it all at once.

00:11:27.025 --> 00:11:27.900 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't either.

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And we had him the other
day standing around dancing

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:32.460 align:middle line:90%
like he was 30 years old again.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, we said 20,
but he didn't want

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.490 align:middle line:84%
to give you so much that
you couldn't believe.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:37.290 align:middle line:90%
But that happened.

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:39.415 align:middle line:84%
And this is from a person
who lost part of his foot

00:11:39.415 --> 00:11:41.310 align:middle line:84%
and thought he could
never walk again.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And now he's doing more
than he ever could.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.150 align:middle line:84%
You each have that ability,
but you just don't believe it.

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.950 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And so we've been
breaking it down.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, the difficulty
for him has been

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.028 align:middle line:84%
that we have given him
so much over these years

00:11:54.028 --> 00:11:55.320 align:middle line:90%
that he couldn't understand it.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.880 align:middle line:90%
And we showed that as well.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.050 align:middle line:90%
We had him put out a video.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.230 align:middle line:84%
We've done it many times,
where we showed you

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:02.460 align:middle line:90%
the cabinet that he had.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:05.570 align:middle line:84%
He sat down every
single day for 35 years

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.230 align:middle line:90%
and wrote this information.

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And then he saw it
happen in his life.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, and then he went
through every horrible thing,

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:13.320 align:middle line:90%
even while he was receiving us.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.650 align:middle line:84%
But then that was
exactly the reason

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:18.860 align:middle line:84%
that he was able to receive
something that-- so none of you

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:19.980 align:middle line:90%
would have to do that.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.920 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to--
to suffer in that way.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And we've given you so many
messages to that regard.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And we said change
is inevitable.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.890 align:middle line:90%
It's going to change.

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:30.603 align:middle line:90%
But suffering is optional.

00:12:30.603 --> 00:12:32.000 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was that Wilhelm
speaking through you?

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:34.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BURNLEY: Yeah.

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Quite an individual.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:37.670 align:middle line:90%
Roger, tell us about Wilhelm.

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BURNLEY: Wilhelm
is a collector--

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.113 align:middle line:84%
It's-- it's just
cosmic consciousness.

00:12:41.113 --> 00:12:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And they said the
reason that they

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:45.410 align:middle line:84%
use Wilhelm is because it
was connected to my life,

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:47.160 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't figure
it out until later.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.780 align:middle line:90%
And I lived in Chicago.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.990 align:middle line:84%
I lived on a street
called Goethe.

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:53.000 align:middle line:90%
That made no sense to me.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.830 align:middle line:90%
Goethe and Dearborn in Chicago--

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.240 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know
what that name meant.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.810 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know how
to pronounce it, George.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:01.770 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm staring at that.

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And then later on, I'm sitting
in this-- years later--

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:11.840 align:middle line:84%
30 years later, I pick
up my phone and I see a--

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.470 align:middle line:84%
this personality test-- a
result of a personality test--

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:16.850 align:middle line:90%
Myers-Briggs, you know.

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:18.960 align:middle line:90%
And it had the advocate there.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I didn't
take the test.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.390 align:middle line:84%
I had taken it before, but
I hadn't taken it recently.

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:26.780 align:middle line:84%
So why is it sitting
there on my phone?

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm reading it and I
go, this sounds like me.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:31.830 align:middle line:90%
And then I look at--

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:35.460 align:middle line:84%
they always give a quote of
who this reference and they use

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.330 align:middle line:90%
Goethe.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I don't know
anything about Goethe.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Then years later--
and I kind of--

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:42.730 align:middle line:84%
I take some me a while
to find these things.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw that Goethe
wrote Wilhelm Meister.

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes--

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BURNLEY: And he wrote
Wilhelm Meister the search

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.550 align:middle line:90%
for self-actualization.

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And so Wilhelm says, you're
all connected in intelligence,

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:56.410 align:middle line:90%
and it happens over time.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And you just come
to understand it.

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:01.120 align:middle line:84%
Every person who came before
brought in intelligence

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.460 align:middle line:84%
you each will access it
if you're willing to.

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And so they kept giving
me more and more names

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:09.240 align:middle line:84%
of people that had given me
this information that could

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.100 align:middle line:90%
have created this philosophy.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.610 align:middle line:90%
They said it's a philosophy.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:14.790 align:middle line:84%
They called it your life
operating instructions.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:18.330 align:middle line:84%
Because your world is going
a little-- little sideways so

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:19.720 align:middle line:90%
you need a rebalancing.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
we've given you.

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:23.468 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
planetary ascension?

00:14:23.468 --> 00:14:25.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BURNLEY: It means
that when we understand

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.290 align:middle line:84%
that all the energies
of our planet

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:29.650 align:middle line:90%
operate in a particular way.

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:32.010 align:middle line:84%
What they started
to reveal was that

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:34.350 align:middle line:84%
when we start to
understand physics

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:36.570 align:middle line:84%
in a different way and
energies and all of that,

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:39.550 align:middle line:84%
but we as humans
are emitting energy.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And there will be a
quality at that energy.

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Is it a lighter energy or
a lower vibrational type

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:45.370 align:middle line:90%
of energy?

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And then when you put
everybody together

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:49.807 align:middle line:84%
and then you have a
mix, are you going

00:14:49.807 --> 00:14:52.390 align:middle line:84%
to put in more light or are you
going to put in more darkness?

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
period that we've

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.300 align:middle line:90%
moved-- we're moving through.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And they said whenever any
societal change happens,

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.240 align:middle line:90%
which we've had many before--

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.330 align:middle line:84%
like we can go back 100 years
and see something similar,

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:06.850 align:middle line:84%
but then we make a choice
as to the type of world.

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:09.030 align:middle line:84%
When I started doing
life channeling,

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:12.210 align:middle line:84%
it was fascinating because
they used to say at the end--

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:14.370 align:middle line:84%
because I never know
what's going to happen.

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:16.590 align:middle line:84%
But they said, the world
that you want to see

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:17.890 align:middle line:90%
is not guaranteed.

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is that
the responsibility of the world

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:23.700 align:middle line:84%
comes with each of us,
meaning we have to decide

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.600 align:middle line:84%
we're going to become
our best selves.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.080 align:middle line:84%
We're going to move
through whatever what.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.902 align:middle line:84%
They started me with-- and
this is so fascinating,

00:15:30.902 --> 00:15:32.610 align:middle line:84%
people couldn't
understand this, but they

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:37.410 align:middle line:84%
had me write an article in 2016
saying that I might be racist

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:40.020 align:middle line:90%
with misogynistic tendencies.

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:40.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:43.265 align:middle line:84%
>>BURNLEY: People say-- people,
why are you writing this.

00:15:43.265 --> 00:15:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Because they said,
unless we all understand

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:47.430 align:middle line:84%
that we have this
DNA that's connected

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:51.270 align:middle line:84%
to all sorts of individuals
that we don't know--

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:54.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can do our DNA test
and see that very clearly.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's all
energetic connections.

00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to
decide that we're

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.670 align:middle line:84%
going to rise to a higher
state of understanding.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.720 align:middle line:84%
They gave me one
message a while ago.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.660 align:middle line:84%
This was when I
started understanding

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:07.990 align:middle line:90%
what was happening now.

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And they said, your ancestors
are watching with curiosity,

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:14.700 align:middle line:84%
meaning we have
ancestors that existed,

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.430 align:middle line:84%
but they could do certain things
with the information, knowledge

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:18.850 align:middle line:90%
and wisdom that they have.

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:22.560 align:middle line:84%
But we're supposed to do more
because we have more now.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Roger, the planet
seems to be changing a lot.

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:26.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BURNLEY: Yes.

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:28.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For the
good, for the bad--

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.250 align:middle line:90%
why?

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:31.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BURNLEY: Because
their physical changes

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.470 align:middle line:84%
that are happening that go
on all the time and pupils,

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:37.080 align:middle line:84%
scientists and geologists
and all those folks,

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.470 align:middle line:90%
I've never studied that.

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:41.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- But there are these
changes that have happened

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.070 align:middle line:84%
and people can go back
and study all of that.

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:47.670 align:middle line:84%
But then we affect those
changes by the energy

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:50.100 align:middle line:84%
that we're emitting
as well, and that's

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.820 align:middle line:90%
the collective consciousness.

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And then they said,
when you think

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:57.030 align:middle line:84%
of this-- they would give me
things in increments, basically.

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:59.730 align:middle line:84%
They said, when you think
of how you learn something,

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:02.400 align:middle line:84%
you go to school and there's a
certain amount of information

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.210 align:middle line:90%
you gain and then you graduate.

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:06.030 align:middle line:84%
You go to the next
grade and then

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:07.470 align:middle line:84%
you do that and
you keep doing it,

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:10.300 align:middle line:84%
and that information is
implanted within you.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.950 align:middle line:90%
That's the individual.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:14.700 align:middle line:84%
But our civilization
does the same thing,

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.648 align:middle line:84%
but we have to decide
what we want it to be.

00:17:17.648 --> 00:17:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is there
so much turmoil, Rog?

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.065 align:middle line:84%
>>BURNLEY: Because
people are resisting

00:17:21.065 --> 00:17:22.589 align:middle line:90%
understanding who they are.

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:23.950 align:middle line:90%
I moved through.

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:25.380 align:middle line:84%
This is why they
said they wanted

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.200 align:middle line:84%
me to write that first
article, to talk about it,

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.350 align:middle line:84%
to become honest
acknowledging that there

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:35.550 align:middle line:84%
are certain things within me and
that history of myself that--

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:37.450 align:middle line:84%
that are limiting--
that I don't know.

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:38.948 align:middle line:84%
But they could
have been planted--

00:17:38.948 --> 00:17:39.990 align:middle line:90%
well, they're programmed.

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.930 align:middle line:90%
We're all programmed.

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:42.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were to
write the article today,

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:43.757 align:middle line:90%
would it be different?

00:17:43.757 --> 00:17:45.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BURNLEY: Oh, absolutely.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:48.352 align:middle line:84%
Because then what
started to happen is I--

00:17:48.352 --> 00:17:50.890 align:middle line:84%
I had a good friend who
would point this out to me.

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:52.150 align:middle line:90%
I could walk into a room.

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:55.720 align:middle line:84%
I could be in a huge place
filled with white people.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.000 align:middle line:84%
I would never
notice that, George.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.590 align:middle line:90%
I didn't notice that.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:00.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I note.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.473 align:middle line:84%
>>BURNLEY: That I was the
only Black person there.

00:18:02.473 --> 00:18:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I see people.

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:04.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BURNLEY: Yeah, exactly.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.280 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what I do.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.130 align:middle line:90%
I just see people.

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the information
that I was meant to bring in.

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- the reason
that was challenging is

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:20.020 align:middle line:84%
because it was so avant-garde,
it was so different.

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:22.120 align:middle line:90%
And like I said, I resisted it.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.560 align:middle line:84%
I called myself the reluctant
mystic many years ago

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.140 align:middle line:84%
because I also wanted
to understand it

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:29.920 align:middle line:90%
and I wanted to see the proof.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And the proof was
I started to heal.

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.990 align:middle line:90%
When we moved through--

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:36.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in different ways,
so many different ways.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not just physically,
it's emotionally,

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.000 align:middle line:90%
it's mentally and spiritually.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.770 align:middle line:90%
That's the ascension process.

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And we can reach these
levels because I've

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.650 align:middle line:84%
had every kind of
illness, disease and all

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:48.110 align:middle line:90%
of that throughout my life.

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I was being
punished for some reason.

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:54.925 align:middle line:84%
But it was most of it I was
resisting becoming myself.

00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.320 align:middle line:84%
Now you channeled
Wilhelm's perspective

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.900 align:middle line:84%
on the current
planetary ascension.

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.560 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what he has to say.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:03.360 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.818 align:middle line:84%
- Planetary ascension means
that you're all coming together

00:19:05.818 --> 00:19:09.630 align:middle line:84%
at a particular time in your
world, in your civilization,

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:13.230 align:middle line:84%
on your planet, where the
energies that you each will emit

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:14.770 align:middle line:90%
will cause an effect.

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're putting any
lower vibrational energies,

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.350 align:middle line:84%
then you're going
to have wars, you're

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:21.660 align:middle line:84%
going to have things that are
going on that you don't like,

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.460 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have hatred,
you're going to have anger,

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:24.970 align:middle line:90%
you're going to-- all of that.

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And then but if you decide
that you're going to shift

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.790 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to let
go of all the old stuff

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:31.625 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
start to love yourself,

00:19:31.625 --> 00:19:34.000 align:middle line:84%
then you're going to start to
see a very different world.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's the transition
that you would move through.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.105 align:middle line:84%
Now, we call it a
planetary ascension

00:19:38.105 --> 00:19:39.480 align:middle line:84%
because there are
different times

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.152 align:middle line:84%
throughout your civilization
where this occurs.

00:19:42.152 --> 00:19:43.860 align:middle line:84%
We've taken you back
through your history

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.360 align:middle line:84%
because if you look
at your history,

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.190 align:middle line:84%
we can take you back
thousands of years

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:49.770 align:middle line:84%
and you can understand that
over time things change

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:51.660 align:middle line:84%
and they change because
of the beings that

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:54.360 align:middle line:84%
live during a particular
time that decide that they're

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.140 align:middle line:90%
going to create something new.

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And so that is what we
have done, because you

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.610 align:middle line:90%
needed something different.

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:03.690 align:middle line:84%
We said that your world was
going through a restructuring,

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:06.300 align:middle line:84%
and the only difficulty
you would have

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.260 align:middle line:84%
is not understanding
how to navigate it.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And we gave you a
path to navigate

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.112 align:middle line:90%
it, which was a new philosophy.

00:20:12.112 --> 00:20:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And you said, well, why
would it be a new philosophy?

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.840 align:middle line:84%
Because we said,
well, your world

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.440 align:middle line:84%
isn't operating the way that
is conducive for sustaining

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.220 align:middle line:90%
life and happiness.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And so many of you are
suffering because you

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:25.780 align:middle line:90%
don't know who you are.

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:27.490 align:middle line:90%
And so we've given you a plan.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:30.960 align:middle line:84%
So because if more of you
would understand who you were

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.200 align:middle line:84%
and how important you were
and to start to live the lives

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.910 align:middle line:84%
you were meant to
have, then your planet

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:38.140 align:middle line:90%
would start to ascend as well.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:40.870 align:middle line:84%
But the only problem would
be you won't believe that.

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:42.130 align:middle line:90%
And we told you last time.

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:43.630 align:middle line:90%
We told you many, many times.

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:45.640 align:middle line:84%
We said we have
given you everything

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:49.330 align:middle line:84%
that could cause your life
to be magnificent and live

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:50.660 align:middle line:90%
this glorious life.

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And then you would create
this wonderful world.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And we said the only difficulty
would be wouldn't believe it.

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Which is why we said that the
perfect place for us to deliver

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:00.555 align:middle line:84%
this message now would
be "Beyond Belief."

00:21:00.555 --> 00:21:01.360 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Perfect.

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:03.760 align:middle line:90%
Great name.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.770 align:middle line:84%
What do you think of
Wilhelm when you do that?

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:07.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BURNLEY: OK.

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:09.370 align:middle line:84%
So let me tell you
how this happened.

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:11.840 align:middle line:10%
I told you I was reluctant,
George, because I didn't know.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.840 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that
was going to happen.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:18.215 align:middle line:84%
In 2021, it was just
becoming so apparent what

00:21:18.215 --> 00:21:19.340 align:middle line:90%
was happening in the world.

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.453 align:middle line:90%
And I just--

00:21:20.453 --> 00:21:21.370 align:middle line:90%
I said, wait a minute.

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:22.490 align:middle line:90%
I love the world too much.

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:23.870 align:middle line:90%
I got-- we got to do something.

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting on my
bed and Wilhelm saying,

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.267 align:middle line:84%
you've got to start
channeling because I

00:21:27.267 --> 00:21:28.400 align:middle line:90%
didn't do live channeling.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.940 align:middle line:84%
I just only-- I was only
writing for all those years.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:33.890 align:middle line:90%
And so I said, OK, I'll do it.

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:36.400 align:middle line:90%
And then when it started, I--

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.180 align:middle line:84%
I started getting all
this other information.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:43.190 align:middle line:84%
But then when it
was revealed to me

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:45.050 align:middle line:84%
that I was given this
information, I said,

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:46.260 align:middle line:90%
that's not possible.

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.500 align:middle line:84%
So I had to get
more verification.

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And because I was given
the name as well, your life

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:52.890 align:middle line:90%
operating instructions.

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:54.780 align:middle line:90%
So I went to an Akashic.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:58.610 align:middle line:84%
I had two Akashic records
reading done that year in 2021.

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:01.380 align:middle line:84%
The first woman I went to,
she sat there and she did it.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And then at the end
of it, she says,

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:05.470 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm supposed
to be following you.

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:06.270 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, I didn't know
what that meant.

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Then the second woman who did
it, she was really quite good.

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And she's saying things
that I couldn't understand.

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:17.250 align:middle line:84%
She says, listen, you
have this ancient past.

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:18.210 align:middle line:90%
You were in Egypt.

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:19.080 align:middle line:90%
You used to do this.

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.050 align:middle line:84%
You used to-- you were
mummifying people.

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:22.300 align:middle line:90%
Said all these things.

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And I go, I have no memory
or understanding of that,

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.490 align:middle line:84%
she says, but now
in this lifetime,

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:31.860 align:middle line:84%
you're meant to open the
minds of individuals.

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And then she starts to say--
she says, and you were given--

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:36.680 align:middle line:84%
and she's trying
to find the word.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.900 align:middle line:90%
She said operating.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And when she said
that, I just lost it

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:45.340 align:middle line:84%
because it was the verification
that what I had heard

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.060 align:middle line:90%
was actually happening.

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And then I started-- other
things started being revealed.

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:52.300 align:middle line:84%
They said, you have
energetic changes that

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.260 align:middle line:90%
happen at astrological times.

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:56.135 align:middle line:84%
You know, planets
move and all of that.

00:22:56.135 --> 00:22:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And they said, if
you look, we gave you

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.850 align:middle line:84%
messages on those
days that would

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:03.070 align:middle line:84%
help you move through
those energy changes

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:04.310 align:middle line:90%
because they affect us.

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:05.980 align:middle line:90%
We don't always understand that.

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And then I went back,
I didn't know this.

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.880 align:middle line:84%
I go back and I start
looking at the dates and I--

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.710 align:middle line:90%
then I could see it.

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:18.130 align:middle line:84%
I've done-- as I sat there
and thought about it, I go,

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:21.910 align:middle line:84%
I've probably written like
10,000 pages over all these

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:23.740 align:middle line:90%
years of all this information.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.900 align:middle line:84%
They said, we've given
you an encyclopedia.

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're remarkable.

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about the
law of attraction.

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BURNLEY: The law
of attraction is what

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.080 align:middle line:90%
we use to navigate our lives.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.320 align:middle line:84%
People think of it as it's just
about having things come to you.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.550 align:middle line:90%
Not necessarily.

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:39.980 align:middle line:84%
It's about having everything
come to you that's

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:41.350 align:middle line:90%
going to help you evolve.

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:43.100 align:middle line:84%
People think that,
well, if I'm practicing

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.030 align:middle line:84%
the law of attraction,
I'm never going to suffer.

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:46.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm never going to
have any difficulty.

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:49.910 align:middle line:84%
No, you're going to
attract the things to you

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:51.930 align:middle line:90%
that have been problematic.

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:53.940 align:middle line:84%
So if you move
through that, you're

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:56.510 align:middle line:84%
ascending to the next person
that-- you know, the next level

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:58.050 align:middle line:90%
of who you're meant to become.

00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And so that was the difficulty,
I think, a lot of people

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:02.217 align:middle line:90%
had with that.

00:24:02.217 --> 00:24:03.800 align:middle line:84%
Just we're just going
to sit and think

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.425 align:middle line:84%
that we're just going
to-- everything's

00:24:05.425 --> 00:24:07.370 align:middle line:84%
going to come to us--
not understanding

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:10.830 align:middle line:84%
that we have things within
us that might prevent it.

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's all in
our consciousness

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.780 align:middle line:84%
and our thinking that
has-- that we've either

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:18.080 align:middle line:84%
accepted that we
learned in limitations

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.820 align:middle line:84%
or that we inherited in
different ways as well.

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:22.683 align:middle line:84%
So I started to move
through a lot of that.

00:24:22.683 --> 00:24:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
recommend to people

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:26.540 align:middle line:84%
to tap into the
law of attraction?

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BURNLEY: Well, it's just
to understand that what

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:31.290 align:middle line:90%
comes to them is to help them.

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:35.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if people could just
say, OK, whatever experiences--

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:38.360 align:middle line:84%
whatever experience I'm
having it's because I'm

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.350 align:middle line:90%
being guided to my best self.

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And so we could call that
the law of attraction.

00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:45.988 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm willing to
move to that place,

00:24:45.988 --> 00:24:47.780 align:middle line:84%
even when I'm going
through difficult times

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:49.730 align:middle line:84%
because I've been
through so much darkness,

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:52.340 align:middle line:84%
so I do understand
it, but then you

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.470 align:middle line:84%
start to understand
why you had it

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:58.490 align:middle line:84%
because it was a part of
your evolutionary path.

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had mentioned you
had every ailment known to man.

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:04.790 align:middle line:84%
How do our emotions
and thoughts, take

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:05.810 align:middle line:90%
care of our healing?

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:07.602 align:middle line:84%
>>BURNLEY: I-- it's
different for everyone.

00:25:07.602 --> 00:25:09.560 align:middle line:84%
They gave me one message
in 2012 about healing

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.540 align:middle line:84%
and they said, well, all healing
happens on the spiritual level.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.870 align:middle line:84%
So when we-- it's
not going to mean

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:17.193 align:middle line:84%
that our physical
bodies necessarily

00:25:17.193 --> 00:25:18.860 align:middle line:84%
are going to heal
absolutely everything,

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:21.200 align:middle line:90%
but we can heal so much.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.690 align:middle line:84%
I-- I suffered from cluster
headaches for decades.

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Migraines?

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:27.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BURNLEY: They are
worse than migraines.

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:30.630 align:middle line:84%
They're-- they're nicknamed the
suicide headache because you

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:31.430 align:middle line:90%
can't do--

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:32.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Push you to the edge.

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:32.840 align:middle line:90%
>>BURNLEY: Yes.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.540 align:middle line:84%
You-- I-- and there are many
times that I wanted to kill

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.160 align:middle line:90%
myself because I couldn't--

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just to rid
yourself of the pain?

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:41.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BURNLEY: Yes, because
that-- that was easier.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I would bang
my head on the wall

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.140 align:middle line:84%
because the pain
was so-- so intense.

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And then at that
time, the first it

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:51.540 align:middle line:84%
started in 1979, that was
the first ones that I had.

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And then there were
no medications.

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.720 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't take aspirin.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.880 align:middle line:84%
There were nothing that
existed at that time.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:01.030 align:middle line:84%
I do understand that they have
some things now that could help.

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:02.620 align:middle line:90%
But then I did a search.

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:04.770 align:middle line:90%
I said, but is there a cure.

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And everyone says-- every
doctor says there's no cure.

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.330 align:middle line:90%
I cured them.

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:10.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On your own?

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:12.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BURNLEY: Yes, I had help.

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:13.430 align:middle line:90%
Eckhart Tolle helped me.

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:14.820 align:middle line:90%
He didn't know this--

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.060 align:middle line:90%
in a different way.

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Because when I read "The
Power of Now" and he said--

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.520 align:middle line:84%
these may not be
the exact words,

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.950 align:middle line:84%
but there was an idea
that he said there is

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:28.450 align:middle line:90%
no pain in the moment of now.

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, OK, let
me see if I can do this.

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:33.330 align:middle line:84%
But when you're
having the headaches,

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:35.280 align:middle line:90%
you know what's coming.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Because you've done it so
much and so-- here it comes.

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:39.180 align:middle line:90%
And so let me get away from it.

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.750 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm trying to do.

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:43.380 align:middle line:84%
But then I said, what if
I could just stay here?

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.370 align:middle line:84%
What if I could
just remain present?

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:46.990 align:middle line:90%
And so I just kept doing that.

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And I would feel the
headache starting to come.

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm just
going to stay here.

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.180 align:middle line:90%
But then it would take over.

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.050 align:middle line:90%
But I said, OK.

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:56.400 align:middle line:84%
So I would go through it and
every time it would get less--

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.640 align:middle line:84%
the pain would be less,
the duration would be less.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes they
would last for hours or days

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.260 align:middle line:90%
and then they were gone.

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:06.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, over time and
it was a practice of me

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:08.960 align:middle line:90%
not running from myself.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.613 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there anything
that's not incurable?

00:27:11.613 --> 00:27:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BURNLEY: That's
a good question,

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:16.970 align:middle line:84%
because I'm finding
so much I don't know.

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:19.130 align:middle line:84%
I think that we have to
think about possibilities.

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:20.770 align:middle line:90%
I think everything is possible.

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:22.870 align:middle line:90%
First of all, I grew up in--

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:25.960 align:middle line:84%
my earliest days, I
grew up in a family.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.400 align:middle line:84%
My grandmother was a
Christian scientist.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And so that was the
religion that we

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:32.110 align:middle line:84%
didn't do medications
or all that,

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:33.860 align:middle line:90%
even though I had every illness.

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:36.050 align:middle line:90%
But she was so devout.

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:39.370 align:middle line:84%
I only saw her sick
one day in my life

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:41.990 align:middle line:84%
and with a cold or something--
other than that, nothing.

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:44.500 align:middle line:84%
But she would sit every
single day and study.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:48.100 align:middle line:84%
She was studying her Bible
and the science and health.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:49.130 align:middle line:90%
That was the book.

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, there's
something there.

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And one day I asked her, I said,
why am I suffering so much?

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:59.790 align:middle line:84%
She says, you work to the
level of your understanding.

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I started
to put that together,

00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:04.170 align:middle line:84%
understanding of
the consciousness

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:05.350 align:middle line:90%
that we can develop.

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And it all-- it's always
about us connecting

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:13.080 align:middle line:90%
to who we are authentically.

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have a lot
of people you've helped.

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.740 align:middle line:90%
One was a person named Amritha.

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:18.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BURNLEY: Yeah.

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have her
talking about you.

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BURNLEY: OK.

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:23.310 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:28.270 align:middle line:84%
- The amount of encouragement
that Roger gave me was superb.

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:32.190 align:middle line:84%
Like, I would call it like a
very, very transformational

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:34.140 align:middle line:84%
experience for me
because the time

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:37.470 align:middle line:84%
that I met Roger and
started taking his course

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:39.930 align:middle line:84%
was actually a turning
point in my life

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:42.840 align:middle line:84%
because it not just
led me into improving

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:46.890 align:middle line:84%
my singing, but the other
programs that he had to offer,

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:49.350 align:middle line:84%
which was, especially in
terms of the empowerment,

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:52.450 align:middle line:84%
actually guided me towards
my life's purpose also.

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:55.470 align:middle line:84%
So I owe a lot to
Roger in terms of that

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:59.190 align:middle line:84%
because it's just that
one decision to join

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:02.300 align:middle line:84%
his course that changed
my entire life's journey.

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:03.680 align:middle line:90%
I've told this to Roger also.

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:07.510 align:middle line:84%
I used to share whatever I
learned from him to my mother,

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:10.000 align:middle line:84%
and she started
applying it to her life,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.770 align:middle line:84%
and she saw a huge difference
in her life as well.

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:14.990 align:middle line:90%
So there-- I can't--

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:17.860 align:middle line:84%
I feel like words are
less to actually express

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:21.870 align:middle line:84%
my gratitude for the things
that I've learned from him.

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:22.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:27.385 align:middle line:84%
- Why would you recommend
Roger Burnley as a coach?

00:29:27.385 --> 00:29:28.185 align:middle line:90%
- I--

00:29:28.185 --> 00:29:30.170 align:middle line:90%
- How is he different?

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:32.610 align:middle line:84%
- He is different in
terms of his sincerity.

00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:33.650 align:middle line:90%
I would say like the--

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:37.670 align:middle line:84%
I really like his sincerity
where he actually listens to you

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:41.570 align:middle line:84%
and your problems and
guides you without you even

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:46.580 align:middle line:84%
knowing that you are being
taken in a particular direction.

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:47.670 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't compel you.

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:50.340 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't ask you to do
something in a particular way.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.190 align:middle line:84%
He gives you the
freedom to become

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:54.110 align:middle line:84%
your best version,
which is the best

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:55.990 align:middle line:90%
thing that I like about Roger.

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:57.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, he doesn't end--

00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.080 align:middle line:90%
- Guide you, right.

00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.280 align:middle line:90%
He shows you.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.280 align:middle line:90%
- Exactly.

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.080 align:middle line:90%
- Yeah.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.330 align:middle line:90%
- Yeah, and always encouraging.

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:05.430 align:middle line:84%
Like, even if you make
a mistake, he's there.

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:06.990 align:middle line:90%
He keeps telling you, it's OK.

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:08.460 align:middle line:90%
Come on, let's try it again.

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:12.470 align:middle line:84%
So I really like the part where
he encourages and actually

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:15.570 align:middle line:84%
keeps motivating you to--
until you reach your goal.

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And it-- sometimes I've
also noticed that more

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:21.440 align:middle line:84%
than us or more than the
person who's learning,

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:25.450 align:middle line:84%
he takes extra effort in helping
them to get to their goal.

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:26.360 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you get that
kind of feedback a lot?

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BURNLEY: Yes, and
that was years ago.

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And so what she has done
now is even more amazing

00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:36.660 align:middle line:90%
because she's become an author.

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:37.530 align:middle line:90%
She's a bestseller.

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:39.590 align:middle line:90%
She's speaking and touring and--

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:41.802 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All because of you.

00:30:41.802 --> 00:30:42.635 align:middle line:90%
>>BURNLEY: I-- yes--

00:30:42.635 --> 00:30:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You opened
up the door for her.

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:44.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BURNLEY: That was it.

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I want
people to understand.

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:47.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm guiding.

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:51.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving because I truly
believe that greatness

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:53.270 align:middle line:84%
is within each
person, and they just

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:56.270 align:middle line:84%
have to be given the
permission to access it

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:58.430 align:middle line:84%
and the courage to
believe in themselves.

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:01.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is given you,
Rog, the most fulfilling

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:03.490 align:middle line:90%
personal gratitude?

00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BURNLEY: Seeing that--
seeing people like that.

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:10.040 align:middle line:84%
Finally understand who they are
and do really amazing things

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:13.910 align:middle line:84%
and change her-- and what she
said was so perfect because we

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:15.380 align:middle line:90%
can have this ripple effect.

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.990 align:middle line:84%
When she's talking about
giving things to her mother

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:21.750 align:middle line:84%
and then seeing her mother
go off and do things as well,

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:23.990 align:middle line:84%
that's the most
brilliant thing ever--

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:28.610 align:middle line:84%
to take that and press it onto
others so that we continually

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:30.150 align:middle line:90%
uplift everyone.

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:32.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Any disappointments?

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BURNLEY: OK, that's
interesting, George.

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:38.210 align:middle line:84%
The only disappointment--
and I don't

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:41.240 align:middle line:84%
want to call it that because
it feels like a disappointment

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:42.040 align:middle line:90%
or regret.

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.498 align:middle line:84%
It's like, wait a minute--
because everybody would probably

00:31:44.498 --> 00:31:46.790 align:middle line:84%
feel this that I
didn't do it sooner.

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:47.590 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.700 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about Wilhelm.

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:52.120 align:middle line:90%
Who was he?

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BURNLEY: Wilhelm was--

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.200 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.360 align:middle line:90%
When-- it's a collection.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:58.080 align:middle line:84%
They said the reason
that I was supposed

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.990 align:middle line:84%
to do this is that they didn't
want me-- even when I channel,

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:02.970 align:middle line:84%
they said, we don't
want people to think

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:05.400 align:middle line:84%
that they have to be
channeling some archangel

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.460 align:middle line:90%
or something different.

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:09.050 align:middle line:84%
This was something
so much bigger.

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:10.300 align:middle line:90%
This was for the collective.

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:11.880 align:middle line:84%
They want everyone
to understand they

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:16.100 align:middle line:84%
have access to infinite-- this
infinite intelligence and all

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:16.900 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:18.710 align:middle line:84%
They just have to
do it in their way.

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:21.870 align:middle line:84%
When I first started doing
meditation, for instance,

00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:25.770 align:middle line:84%
I put out a meditation course,
a while ago because I couldn't

00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:27.360 align:middle line:90%
do it like other people.

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.950 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't-- I wasn't going
to sit in these positions.

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:32.860 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't going to do all--
it didn't feel natural to me.

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:35.860 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to do something
that felt right for me.

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And so I finally found one
place in my home on a sofa--

00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:42.340 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK, this feels good.

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:44.007 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to be
in a Lotus position.

00:32:44.007 --> 00:32:46.200 align:middle line:84%
That's not who I
am because I want

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.990 align:middle line:84%
to give other people
the permission

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:53.590 align:middle line:84%
to access their authentic selves
in whatever way that shows up.

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:55.840 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to go out
and do something different--

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.220 align:middle line:84%
if it's not organic, if
it doesn't feel, you know,

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:00.700 align:middle line:90%
natural for them.

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
trance channel, Rog?

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:04.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BURNLEY: I just hear.

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:08.070 align:middle line:84%
It's-- the first writing
that I have saved is 1989,

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:11.580 align:middle line:84%
and it said to me that I had
this immense power and I was

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:13.020 align:middle line:90%
also afraid of it.

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought that I was
going to use this ability that I

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:19.410 align:middle line:84%
had to the detriment
of others, that I

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:21.943 align:middle line:84%
would do something and
the ego oriented way.

00:33:21.943 --> 00:33:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And they said-- this is
Wilhelm talking to me.

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And they said, and it's
exactly the opposite for you

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.830 align:middle line:84%
because you give
away everything.

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Says the more you
gain, you give away--

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.800 align:middle line:84%
which is what I would
love for a lot of people.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:36.760 align:middle line:84%
But it took years for
me to accept that.

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I just want everyone
to understand your journey

00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:42.160 align:middle line:84%
is there's timing
in everyone's life.

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:43.762 align:middle line:84%
And it's always
the correct timing.

00:33:43.762 --> 00:33:45.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you be able
to channel Wilhelm for us?

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:46.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BURNLEY: Sure.

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:47.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:47.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's do it.

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:48.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BURNLEY: OK.

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:50.215 align:middle line:90%
(CHANNELING WILHELM VOICE)

00:33:50.215 --> 00:33:52.048 align:middle line:84%
>>WILHELM THROUGH
BURNLEY: Oh, George, we're

00:33:52.048 --> 00:33:53.040 align:middle line:90%
so happy you're here.

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And we have waited for
you your entire life.

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:57.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, we say this to
all of you whenever

00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:01.670 align:middle line:84%
we do this because we're
bringing you cosmic wisdom

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:02.580 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness.

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:05.930 align:middle line:84%
But we're doing it specifically
today because we wanted

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:08.690 align:middle line:84%
to deliver this message to you,
because we gave you a message

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:10.530 align:middle line:84%
on your birthday,
which was June 4th.

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:12.860 align:middle line:84%
But we did it in 2012
because we wanted

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:15.788 align:middle line:84%
you to understand the tremendous
difference that you were making

00:34:15.788 --> 00:34:18.080 align:middle line:84%
in the world that you've been
doing for years and years

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:22.130 align:middle line:84%
by breaking down barriers
of what can be believed.

00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:24.290 align:middle line:84%
The problem with
humans as they come in,

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:27.469 align:middle line:84%
they put up these barriers
of what is possible,

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:31.909 align:middle line:84%
and even the things that
could be developed get limited

00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:34.050 align:middle line:84%
because you can't break
through the barriers.

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And because you
have done this, you

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:38.330 align:middle line:84%
have done such a great
service, especially

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:40.280 align:middle line:84%
for the planet at this
time, because you're

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.405 align:middle line:84%
going to move through things
where people are going

00:34:42.405 --> 00:34:44.500 align:middle line:84%
to be unwilling to move
from their positions,

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.500 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to think
they know everything.

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:49.149 align:middle line:84%
None of you know anything
because consciousness is always

00:34:49.149 --> 00:34:49.949 align:middle line:90%
evolving.

00:34:49.949 --> 00:34:51.040 align:middle line:90%
It's never done.

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And you could go to
higher and higher places

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.300 align:middle line:90%
if you decided to do that.

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And so it's people
like you, George,

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.710 align:middle line:84%
who are bringing in
greater information

00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:00.930 align:middle line:84%
and bringing all these beings
and who are delivering this

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:04.600 align:middle line:84%
and putting out love and
light into the planet.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.570 align:middle line:90%
Do you have another question?

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:08.028 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
always have access?

00:35:08.028 --> 00:35:09.278 align:middle line:90%
>>WILHELM THROUGH BURNLEY: Yes

00:35:09.278 --> 00:35:10.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To Roger?

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WILHELM THROUGH
BURNLEY: Yes, yes.

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:13.330 align:middle line:90%
But we must say this.

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:14.760 align:middle line:90%
He resisted.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:15.760 align:middle line:90%
Many of you do.

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.860 align:middle line:84%
He can come into us
very quickly now.

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:19.060 align:middle line:90%
But it took a while.

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:23.078 align:middle line:84%
As he was about to say earlier,
we had to convince him in 2021

00:35:23.078 --> 00:35:25.120 align:middle line:84%
that he was going to start
doing live channeling.

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.710 align:middle line:90%
And then it started to happen.

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:30.002 align:middle line:84%
Now we will say, and if
anyone sees these videos,

00:35:30.002 --> 00:35:31.710 align:middle line:84%
because we want you
to understand energy,

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:34.290 align:middle line:84%
when he finally broke down and
started to do the channeling,

00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:35.945 align:middle line:84%
there was so much
energy that we were

00:35:35.945 --> 00:35:37.320 align:middle line:84%
sending through
him that he would

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.800 align:middle line:90%
just-- he would just sweat.

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:39.970 align:middle line:90%
He was perspiring.

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And it was just so difficult
for the very first sessions.

00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And then he started to accept
and then it became more natural.

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:47.770 align:middle line:90%
And then it became more even.

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And now he can access
whenever it is appropriate.

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:53.520 align:middle line:84%
But it's always appropriate now
because of the movement that

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.020 align:middle line:84%
is happening in
your world, which

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:58.080 align:middle line:84%
is why we have moved him to take
it much larger because we're

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:00.630 align:middle line:84%
trying to-- we wanted
him to take it to a much

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:03.630 align:middle line:84%
larger audience where people
could understand that they can

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:05.130 align:middle line:84%
let go of their
hatred, they can let

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:07.260 align:middle line:84%
go of their doubt of
themselves and others

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:10.030 align:middle line:84%
and start to find a higher
version of themselves.

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And then you have a
very different planet.

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wilhelm, thank
you for being here.

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:16.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WILHELM THROUGH BURNLEY:
Thank you for having us.

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BURNLEY: What happens is
when I'm connected to someone,

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:21.998 align:middle line:84%
I started changing
things a bit though, too,

00:36:21.998 --> 00:36:24.040 align:middle line:84%
when I started channeling
and answering questions

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:26.050 align:middle line:84%
because I don't want
to know the person.

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:28.870 align:middle line:84%
This is what I do live
channeling because I just want

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:30.380 align:middle line:90%
to connect to their energy.

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:33.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm connecting to their
spirit, their source energy,

00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:35.450 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
I love doing now.

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Because if I hear them or
know their voice or even

00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:40.390 align:middle line:84%
their gender, I don't want to
know that because this work is

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:43.210 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be about bringing
people to the understanding

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:46.730 align:middle line:84%
that all people are equal and
have this purpose in this world.

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't want
to know gender.

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:49.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to know ethnicity.

00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:50.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't-- none of that.

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.570 align:middle line:90%
Just the essence of the soul.

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:54.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you find that soul?

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:54.905 align:middle line:90%
>>BURNLEY: Yeah.

00:36:54.905 --> 00:36:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever found a
soul you didn't want to be with?

00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:59.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BURNLEY: No, no.

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And that was-- now, there are
many people who will say that

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:04.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm--

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:08.160 align:middle line:84%
because it feels like my mission
was a little bit different.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Like, you know, you talk about
toxic people and all of that

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:13.110 align:middle line:90%
and not hanging out with them.

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:15.680 align:middle line:84%
But I was supposed
to see beyond that

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:18.380 align:middle line:90%
because I was want to see the--

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:21.540 align:middle line:84%
the purpose or the value
of even those folks.

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Because see, what
happens is they

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:25.710 align:middle line:84%
are just on a different
evolutionary path.

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:27.960 align:middle line:10%
And so they are helping us.

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:30.740 align:middle line:10%
So when I start to see someone
who is demonstrating something

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:34.440 align:middle line:10%
that's of a lower vibration,
it causes me to light up more.

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.690 align:middle line:10%
And so they're
serving that purpose.

00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:41.660 align:middle line:10%
Now, if their path is about

state of consciousness,
great, because they

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.180 align:middle line:10%
may get some of that.

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:48.110 align:middle line:84%
But I have to also recognize
that not everyone's going

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:49.020 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And I-- been a problem
for me because I think I

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.810 align:middle line:90%
can just help everyone.

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:57.570 align:middle line:84%
But now I've come up with
I'm doing it differently now.

00:37:57.570 --> 00:37:59.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm letting them
do it on their own.

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:01.950 align:middle line:84%
So I don't have to
be that involved.

00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:04.380 align:middle line:84%
I tell people all the time
everything is available,

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:09.920 align:middle line:84%
but you just have to want to
find who you are and succeed.

in a room with him,

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.760 align:middle line:90%
