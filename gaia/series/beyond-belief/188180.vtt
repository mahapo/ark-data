00:00:24.188 --> 00:00:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.410 align:middle line:90%
George Noory with you.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And one of our most requested
guests, Jonny Enoch with us.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Jonny, of course, is a
clinical hypnotherapist.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.170 align:middle line:10%
He's an esoteric researcher.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.560 align:middle line:10%
He's a megalithic investigator
from Vancouver, Canada.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And he is one of the
greatest investigators

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.340 align:middle line:90%
I've ever come across.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Jonny, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>>Jonny ENOCH: Well, thanks
for having me, George.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.270 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be here.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.790 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now, when we call
you an "esoteric researcher,"

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.090 align:middle line:90%
what does that mean?

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.530 align:middle line:10%
>> ENOCH: Well, it's a lifelong
fascination I've had with all

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.830 align:middle line:10%
the strange and mysterious
things in our universe.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.020 align:middle line:84%
I just feel that we
live in a world that's

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.530 align:middle line:84%
so fascinating and filled with
mystery that everywhere we

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.444 align:middle line:84%
look there's a rabbit
hole to go down.

00:01:04.444 --> 00:01:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And many
rabbit holes--

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.550 align:middle line:84%
and when you go down
them, what's in there?

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: I think it just keeps
getting weirder the further we

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.000 align:middle line:90%
go.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.020 align:middle line:90%
It's deeper and deeper.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.420 align:middle line:84%
You think you've found all
the answers in one area,

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.010 align:middle line:84%
and then you find
it just opens up

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.902 align:middle line:84%
into this giant cornucopia
of new surprises.

00:01:20.902 --> 00:01:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now, these aren't
subjects that you wake up

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.290 align:middle line:84%
in the morning and go, this is
what I'm going to investigate.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.180 align:middle line:90%
How did this evolve for you?

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: When I was
very small, George,

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.450 align:middle line:84%
I was having these unexplainable
experiences where I'd be

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.810 align:middle line:84%
hovering above my body
and looking down at myself

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:38.640 align:middle line:90%
peacefully.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.580 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OBEs, right?

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Yes.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And then other times, I
was violently thrusted up

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.050 align:middle line:84%
towards these hollow fractal,
multicolored energies that

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.170 align:middle line:84%
would immerse me into them,
and I'd find myself out

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.940 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the universe.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.490 align:middle line:84%
At other times, my
mom was telling me

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.740 align:middle line:84%
that we would have these
little gray men walking

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.450 align:middle line:84%
through our bedroom windows
and walking through our rooms

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.250 align:middle line:90%
at night.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.143 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:02:02.143 --> 00:02:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: And so when I
wanted to get answers,

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.420 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't because I lived in
a very religious household.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.300 align:middle line:84%
At the dinner table, when
someone said "helicopter,"

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.775 align:middle line:84%
it was changed to
"heavenicopter."

00:02:11.775 --> 00:02:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Uh-huh,
it was that tight.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.040 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Yes, it was.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.760 align:middle line:10%
And so I started to find
myself collecting up

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.690 align:middle line:10%
all the esoteric literature and
books on the unknown I could

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.510 align:middle line:10%
get and traveling
all over the world

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.680 align:middle line:10%
to visit megalithic
temples, sacred sites.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And later, I was using the
tools of clinical hypnotherapy

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.700 align:middle line:84%
to go further into the deeper
layers of the human mind.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, we're going to
talk with you in this program

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.960 align:middle line:84%
today about many different
things you've done.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.540 align:middle line:90%
But let's start with Atlantis.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.970 align:middle line:90%
What do you think Atlantis was?

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.920 align:middle line:90%
Where do you think it was?

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: OK, that's
a very good question.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.390 align:middle line:84%
When we ask ourselves, where
was Atlantis, what was Atlantis,

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.900 align:middle line:84%
we get the story from Plato,
who was a Greek philosopher.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.490 align:middle line:84%
So, many people out
there, they'll say, well,

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.220 align:middle line:90%
it must be a Greek story.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, we know that Plato
learned the story from his Uncle

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Critias, who learned
the story from

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.367 align:middle line:90%
his great-great-grandfather.

00:03:09.367 --> 00:03:10.950 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Hand-me-down
stories, right?

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: Yeah, it came
from Solon 200 years prior.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.620 align:middle line:84%
But Solon, he learned the story
when he traveled to Egypt.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.408 align:middle line:84%
He says, hey, I
want the good stuff.

00:03:19.408 --> 00:03:20.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get
the heck out of here

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.740 align:middle line:84%
and go over to Egypt,
when it was called Sais.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.560 align:middle line:84%
So he meets with
this high priest,

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.180 align:middle line:90%
and his name is Sonchis.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And he takes him aside, and
he says to him, OK, Solon, you

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.900 align:middle line:84%
think you've got all the
answers because you Greeks knew

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.000 align:middle line:84%
there was a flood
story, he says to him.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.430 align:middle line:84%
But there have been
many flood stories,

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.190 align:middle line:84%
many ancient civilizations
that have been wiped off

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.110 align:middle line:84%
the face of the earth by water,
by fire, by natural disasters.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And this place that we call
Atlantis was the last one.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.810 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing, George.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.090 align:middle line:84%
We can accurately
date when Atlantis

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.070 align:middle line:84%
might have been because we're
told that Solon was around 600

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.105 align:middle line:84%
BCE, and the Atlantis
story happened 9,000 years

00:04:05.105 --> 00:04:05.905 align:middle line:90%
before Sonchis.

00:04:05.905 --> 00:04:07.072 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Before that, yeah.

00:04:07.072 --> 00:04:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: Yeah, so that's
around 11,600 years ago.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.260 align:middle line:84%
That brings us to that
12,000-year mark that we always

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.829 align:middle line:84%
hear about from places
like Gobekli Tepe,

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.079 align:middle line:84%
and our Younger
Dryas cataclysms,

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.650 align:middle line:84%
and all these sorts
of incidents on Earth.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.550 align:middle line:84%
But I actually believe
that the Atlantians,

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.590 align:middle line:84%
where we look at
their location, I

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.950 align:middle line:84%
believe they were a global
dissemination of culture.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.200 align:middle line:84%
They weren't just
located in one place.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And why that is is that if
we look at these pyramids,

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.490 align:middle line:84%
the Great Pyramid in Egypt,
the one over in the Yucatan

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.700 align:middle line:84%
with Chichen Itza, Teotihuacan,
Tikal in Guatemala--

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.190 align:middle line:90%
we have a pyramid in China.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They're
all over the place.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.770 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: That's right.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:50.680 align:middle line:90%
They're everywhere.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.880 align:middle line:90%
They're ubiquitous.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.390 align:middle line:90%
We find them all over the world.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.390 align:middle line:84%
So there was a great
civilization that rose up,

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.890 align:middle line:84%
but there's a lot
of people now that

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.010 align:middle line:84%
have these different theories
about where Atlantis was.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.990 align:middle line:84%
The traditional
theory is, they said,

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.750 align:middle line:84%
it was located on
the Atlantic Ridge.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:05.900 align:middle line:90%
And when we look over--

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.330 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And that
would be where?

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.650 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: In the
middle of the Atlantic.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.040 align:middle line:10%
>> ENOCH: OK, so when we go look
over at the Rock of Gibraltar,

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.440 align:middle line:10%
for example, many
people have said, well,

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.400 align:middle line:10%
that could be the Pillars of
Hercules in the Atlantis story.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.680 align:middle line:84%
They look at the Azores
and the Canary Islands.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And they say, well, that
could be the mountain peaks.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.960 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.230 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: And they say--

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.942 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And the
rest is submerged.

00:05:24.942 --> 00:05:25.900 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: That's right.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And the new theory
is that people

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.800 align:middle line:84%
have looked over at what's
called the Eye of Africa

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.090 align:middle line:90%
in Mauritania.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.210 align:middle line:84%
But again, we know the earth
was a much different place

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.160 align:middle line:90%
around 50,000 years ago.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.630 align:middle line:90%
There was higher oxygen levels.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.430 align:middle line:90%
There was less gravity.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.180 align:middle line:84%
We find that, in those times,
that the Mediterranean was just

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.890 align:middle line:90%
a little pond.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.360 align:middle line:84%
The Atlantic was like a
reservoir in the rain forest.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.470 align:middle line:84%
So we have a much different
idea of what happened.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.940 align:middle line:84%
But some people nowadays
have had some great theories

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.600 align:middle line:84%
about what happened to Atlantis
and their great destruction.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.330 align:middle line:84%
Graham Hancock has told us
that at times he believes

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.770 align:middle line:90%
it could be an asteroid.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.000 align:middle line:84%
But I tend to think there was
a great technological means

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.890 align:middle line:90%
for how Atlantis was destroyed.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is it safe to assume
though that it did once exist?

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: I very much
believe it existed.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.830 align:middle line:10%
We have stories
all over the earth

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.240 align:middle line:10%
of these great,
seafaring people.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.170 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Amazing stories.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.970 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: It is.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.190 align:middle line:84%
If I could tell you a story,
when we were in Egypt not too

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.090 align:middle line:84%
long ago, I was there with my
friend, the great hieroglyphics

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.180 align:middle line:84%
expert and Egyptologist,
Muhammad Ibrahim.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And we were at this
temple called Edfu.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.475 align:middle line:10%
Now, the original temple where
the Atlantis story came from

00:06:38.475 --> 00:06:39.275 align:middle line:10%
was known as Nefru.

00:06:39.275 --> 00:06:40.465 align:middle line:90%
It was on the Nile Delta.

00:06:40.465 --> 00:06:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And we're told it was
washed away and destroyed.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.200 align:middle line:84%
The great story was
upon the wall there.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.070 align:middle line:84%
But when we go to Edfu and
you look upon the temple,

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.380 align:middle line:84%
we see a great,
seafaring people.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.170 align:middle line:84%
But what we see above
them is rather alarming.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.690 align:middle line:84%
We see a great serpent come
down from the heavens that

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:56.685 align:middle line:90%
is destroying them.

00:06:56.685 --> 00:06:58.810 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, it looks
like a comet or something?

00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:59.860 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Yes.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.840 align:middle line:84%
But in the mysteries,
the serpent

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.260 align:middle line:84%
always represented energy
or electromagnetic energy.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.888 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, I believe
from what I've seen,

00:07:08.888 --> 00:07:10.930 align:middle line:84%
and I know you've seen
this evidence before too--

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:11.590 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:13.715 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: --that when we
look at the Great Pyramid,

00:07:13.715 --> 00:07:17.080 align:middle line:84%
especially using Chris Dunn's
Giza power plant hypothesis

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.810 align:middle line:84%
on how we see it built
like a Faraday cage,

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.390 align:middle line:84%
we see the granite,
sandstone, limestone.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.190 align:middle line:90%
It's a technology.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.630 align:middle line:90%
It's a power plant.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.760 align:middle line:84%
We see these obelisks acting
like transmitters for energy

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.440 align:middle line:84%
that I believe they
were experimenting

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.140 align:middle line:84%
with electromagnetic
energy and gravity

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.660 align:middle line:84%
much how we're playing
around with [? HARP ?] now.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You had a discussion
with the Egyptologist Muhammad

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.270 align:middle line:90%
Ibrahim about all of this.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: So we're here
with Muhammad Ibrahim,

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:51.820 align:middle line:84%
the most incredible Egyptologist
and hieroglyphics expert ever.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And Muhammad was telling me
that we can find the Atlantis

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.730 align:middle line:90%
story here at Edfu.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we know
that when we go back

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.090 align:middle line:84%
to the story of Atlantis that we
get from Solon that learned it

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:07.680 align:middle line:84%
from Sonchis, the high
priest of Sais, or Egypt,

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.250 align:middle line:84%
he went to a temple
called Nefru.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.406 align:middle line:84%
And here we have the stories
that go back to Zep Tepi.

00:08:13.406 --> 00:08:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, how do we find the
Atlantis story here, Muhammad?

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MUHAMMAD IBRAHIM:
As I explained before,

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.560 align:middle line:84%
the famous story about
Atlantis, that it was civilized,

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.230 align:middle line:90%
advanced destination.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And was a mistake in one
of the experiments-- they--

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:32.440 align:middle line:90%
something major happened.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.770 align:middle line:10%
So they had to
leave their homeland

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:37.150 align:middle line:10%
or their homeland
already disappeared.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:41.160 align:middle line:10%
And some people say that
they came to Egypt by ships.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.730 align:middle line:84%
OK, and that's why
some people may explain

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:51.650 align:middle line:84%
those carvings as
could be of the story

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:56.740 align:middle line:84%
that Lucifer presenting the
powers of Demeter's, being

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.750 align:middle line:90%
presented to the king of Egypt.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.050 align:middle line:90%
[CHATTER]

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:04.810 align:middle line:90%


00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: And when you see
this story that's on the wall

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.680 align:middle line:84%
of a great, seafaring people,
we see that they were very

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.718 align:middle line:90%
advanced.

00:09:12.718 --> 00:09:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>> IBRAHIM: Yeah,
because, of course,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:19.000 align:middle line:84%
we are talking about the highest
levels of the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.642 align:middle line:84%
But I do have quite a different
opinion because my own opinion

00:09:23.642 --> 00:09:26.695 align:middle line:90%
that Atlantis was part of Egypt.

00:09:26.695 --> 00:09:27.570 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Absolutely.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>> IBRAHIM: OK, and not the
sisterly Egypt like nowadays,

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.566 align:middle line:84%
which could be
[? Vigor ?] Egypt,

00:09:32.566 --> 00:09:36.050 align:middle line:84%
[? Vigor ?] Kemet
in the ancient days.

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And we can see Atlantis
not only part of Egypt

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.422 align:middle line:84%
but could be one of the
cycles of ancient Egypt.

00:09:42.422 --> 00:09:44.130 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: Going back
to the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:44.930 align:middle line:90%
>> IBRAHIM: Right.

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:48.100 align:middle line:84%
The dynastic cycle, it was
the last cycle time we knew.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.350 align:middle line:84%
But the precycle,
[INAUDIBLE],, that just

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.605 align:middle line:84%
could be the cycle
where Atlantis existed.

00:09:53.605 --> 00:09:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Incredible.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Can we both agree that
the capital of Atlantis

00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:59.927 align:middle line:90%
would have been Heliopolis?

00:09:59.927 --> 00:10:00.760 align:middle line:90%
>> IBRAHIM: Exactly.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.050 align:middle line:90%
I agree about it.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I don't have
very clear evidence.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.730 align:middle line:84%
But my sense, my
[INAUDIBLE] saying

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.540 align:middle line:84%
On, which is translated by
the Greeks as Heliopolis.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.330 align:middle line:84%
On was the capital
of the [INAUDIBLE],,

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:14.810 align:middle line:90%
which could be Atlantis.

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:15.610 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Amazing.

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:16.410 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:17.643 align:middle line:90%
>> IBRAHIM: No problem.

00:10:17.643 --> 00:10:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Interesting
theory, Jon.

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, my father was born
in Cairo, my late father.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And he was not Egyptian, but
that's where he was born.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And we were fascinated with
things that happened in Egypt.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:31.065 align:middle line:84%
And that's still another
part of the story.

00:10:31.065 --> 00:10:33.690 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: You know, a lot of the
Egyptians know that about you.

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Quoting Mohammad,
he said that they're

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.250 align:middle line:84%
big fans of George
Noory over there.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:39.690 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Perfect.

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:40.800 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: That's amazing.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.380 align:middle line:84%
But you know, what he was
saying, he was talking about--

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.890 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about On,
or Heliopolis, in Egypt.

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:48.690 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Mhm.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:52.150 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: Now, this was a very
important place to the priests.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:53.550 align:middle line:90%
It's the place of light.

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:56.310 align:middle line:84%
But to the mystery
schools, one of the secrets

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:59.755 align:middle line:84%
that we have is this is
why you turn the lights on.

00:10:59.755 --> 00:11:01.380 align:middle line:84%
It's why you have
the name in the Bible

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.900 align:middle line:84%
that was translated
by Sir Francis Bacon's

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:08.250 align:middle line:84%
overseers for King
James to "sol," which

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.230 align:middle line:84%
is the Latin for "the
light," "om," which

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:12.420 align:middle line:84%
is the Hindu for
"the light," and "on"

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.000 align:middle line:84%
or [EGYPTIAN],, which is the
Egyptian for "the light."

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.640 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did Atlantis get
too big for its britches?

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Did they do something
to themselves

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:21.670 align:middle line:90%
because of their technology?

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:23.010 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: I think so, George.

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:25.920 align:middle line:84%
When we go back into what
the great Edgar Cayce said,

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.930 align:middle line:84%
he believed that there
were these flying

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:30.810 align:middle line:90%
machines and submarines there.

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:33.150 align:middle line:84%
Even Rudolf Steiner was
talking about something called

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.850 align:middle line:84%
"anthroposophy" where
he was figuring out

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:39.210 align:middle line:84%
the history and
different ways of looking

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:42.730 align:middle line:84%
at these places using the mind,
sort of like our remote viewers

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:43.530 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And they believed that something
more was going on there.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.440 align:middle line:84%
To the theosophist,
they said that Atlantis

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.080 align:middle line:84%
was being ruled over
by powers of the air,

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.840 align:middle line:84%
by an invisible ruler
named [INAUDIBLE]..

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is how they
became corrupted by abusing

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.110 align:middle line:90%
these technologies.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.830 align:middle line:84%
So you might say that there is
a hidden warning in there for us

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:05.130 align:middle line:84%
today to use our
technologies responsible.

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, look at how
far we've come in 2,000 years.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:12.410 align:middle line:84%
Since the days of Jesus
to where we are now,

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:13.920 align:middle line:90%
we put men on the moon.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.940 align:middle line:84%
We've done all these
incredible technological things

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.290 align:middle line:90%
in 2,000 years.

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Jump-start civilizations
that lasted maybe

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.700 align:middle line:84%
a million years, who knows
what kind of technology

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:27.810 align:middle line:90%
they could have had?

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Absolutely.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And when we look
at Egypt, George,

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.450 align:middle line:84%
we must look at it like the
great layers of an onion.

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:35.040 align:middle line:84%
Today when we look
at it, we have

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.050 align:middle line:90%
an Islamic or an Arabic layer.

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:39.060 align:middle line:84%
We peel back the
layer of the onion.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.360 align:middle line:84%
We go back, and there
is a Jewish layer,

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.050 align:middle line:90%
a Coptic Christian layer.

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:47.740 align:middle line:84%
We peel back again, and
we have a Roman layer.

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.680 align:middle line:84%
Then we go back
to our Greek layer

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.520 align:middle line:84%
with the great Macedonian
conqueror, Alexander the Great.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.170 align:middle line:84%
Before that, it
was the Persians.

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.780 align:middle line:84%
But where we start to
get very interesting

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.450 align:middle line:84%
is we tap into the
dynastic Egyptians.

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:02.160 align:middle line:90%
So we can divide that up.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.930 align:middle line:84%
We had the Old Kingdom,
Middle Kingdom, New Kingdom.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And there was a great
lot of cycles there.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.500 align:middle line:84%
These folks were figuring
things out again.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:15.090 align:middle line:84%
But before that, we're told
there were these predynastics.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:17.130 align:middle line:10%
And these guys were
crawling up from the mud,

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.340 align:middle line:10%
rubbing sticks together, trying
to figure things out again

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:23.100 align:middle line:10%
because they found
the remnants of

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.620 align:middle line:10%
the precataclysmic Egyptians.

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And when we start asking
questions about who they were

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.290 align:middle line:84%
and what they knew,
they built everything

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.780 align:middle line:84%
in the most magnificent
sites in granite

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.160 align:middle line:84%
with no hieroglyphics
whatsoever.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.327 align:middle line:84%
And we believe they very
much might have been giants.

00:13:39.327 --> 00:13:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are we headed
toward the same path

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.480 align:middle line:90%
of the Atlantians' destruction?

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.330 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: I tend to think so, at
times, if we don't smarten up.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.560 align:middle line:84%
There's great things that
are happening on this planet

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:52.370 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:54.690 align:middle line:84%
There's great amounts of
technology being developed,

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.920 align:middle line:84%
which is going to change
us as a whole in the future

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.730 align:middle line:84%
on even how we are
going to live longer,

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:04.970 align:middle line:84%
from unlocking the
mitochondria in our cell,

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:07.400 align:middle line:84%
so we inject it
with nanoparticles

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.880 align:middle line:84%
that are going to draw
hydrogen and nitrogen out

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.900 align:middle line:90%
so that our bodies won't age.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.930 align:middle line:90%
They will sustain themselves.

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:18.180 align:middle line:84%
With creating our own food and
our own water in our bodies,

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.720 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be connected to
great amounts of information.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.428 align:middle line:84%
We're going to move
very forward in a way

00:14:22.428 --> 00:14:24.860 align:middle line:84%
that they did with
our quantum computing

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:28.280 align:middle line:84%
so that the universe and
the everything around us

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.060 align:middle line:90%
becomes our computer.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.690 align:middle line:84%
But if we're not
responsible for this,

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:36.000 align:middle line:84%
we're not responsible with this,
strange things could happen.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.900 align:middle line:84%
We could fall into our own
corruption and downfall

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.100 align:middle line:90%
just like they did.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.740 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: One of the most
fascinating areas in Egypt I

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.450 align:middle line:90%
think is, of course, Abydos.

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:45.250 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Yes.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And there are
some incredible things.

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:49.820 align:middle line:10%
We're looking at
some pictures now.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.610 align:middle line:10%
How old is this, Jonny?

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:54.380 align:middle line:10%
And let's explain
what we're looking at.

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:57.800 align:middle line:10%
>> ENOCH: OK, when you're at
the Abydos Temple and when

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.380 align:middle line:10%
we're looking at these
particular reliefs,

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.900 align:middle line:10%
we're looking at the
dynastic Egyptians.

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.180 align:middle line:10%
The dynastic
Egyptians, by the way,

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:09.110 align:middle line:10%
we're trying to look
at what they had lost,

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.720 align:middle line:10%
and they were trying to put
it together with hieroglyphics

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.310 align:middle line:10%
and pictures as an instruction
manual to say, hey,

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:16.610 align:middle line:10%
if we go down that road
again like the other guys,

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:19.100 align:middle line:10%
we want to figure it out
again a little quicker.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:23.090 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people have looked
at this particular depiction

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.140 align:middle line:84%
on this relief or these
hieroglyphics and said,

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:29.960 align:middle line:84%
hey, up there, we see a
helicopter, a tank, a plane.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.012 align:middle line:10%
And they said-- and all
these shows and people

00:15:32.012 --> 00:15:33.470 align:middle line:10%
that are researchers,
they've said,

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:35.900 align:middle line:10%
this is definitive proof
that they had flying machines

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.220 align:middle line:10%
and all this sort of stuff.

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:41.090 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yeah, who could
create this if it wasn't real?

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:43.190 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: Well, I'll
tell you this, George.

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:47.600 align:middle line:84%
For the longest time, the
opinion of those in this field

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.000 align:middle line:84%
have been that what this
is is that they thought

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.500 align:middle line:84%
it was called a "palimpsest,"
even my friend Mohammad

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:53.300 align:middle line:90%
Ibrahim.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.258 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What is that?

00:15:54.258 --> 00:15:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: Well, palimpsest is
when you have erosion of one

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:00.552 align:middle line:84%
glyph on top of the
other over time.

00:16:00.552 --> 00:16:02.510 align:middle line:10%
And he would say for
years, Mohammad, he'd say,

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:04.578 align:middle line:10%
Jonny, I don't
believe that these

00:16:04.578 --> 00:16:05.870 align:middle line:10%
are the planes and helicopters.

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say, I think
it looks like it.

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:09.570 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's amazing.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And then he and I
made a discovery

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:15.440 align:middle line:84%
there recently when we were
looking up the inscriptions

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.710 align:middle line:84%
on the walls that we believe
that they may have had access

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.990 align:middle line:84%
to a type of technology
that would have allowed

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:22.550 align:middle line:90%
them to see these things.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And now Mohammad
is a great believer

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:26.480 align:middle line:84%
that this was left
there on purpose.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How old is this?

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:29.402 align:middle line:10%
>> ENOCH: Oh, man,
there's so many guesses.

00:16:29.402 --> 00:16:33.020 align:middle line:10%
Some will say 5,000 years.

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:36.360 align:middle line:10%
Others will date it, and
they'll go back 10,000 years.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.540 align:middle line:10%
There's guess-- the
guesses are in the air.

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:39.710 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: What do you think?

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:42.260 align:middle line:10%
>> ENOCH: For me, I think
that I would definitely put it

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.840 align:middle line:10%
somewhere in the
dynastic Egyptian period.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.640 align:middle line:84%
But for what I
think they're trying

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.700 align:middle line:84%
to tell us is they're trying
to tell us, we were there.

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:53.690 align:middle line:84%
We know that there are greater
technologies available to us.

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:55.973 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Clearly, that
looks like a helicopter.

00:16:55.973 --> 00:16:57.140 align:middle line:10%
>> ENOCH: It certainly does.

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:58.290 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Clearly.

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:01.490 align:middle line:10%
And then the one to the right
of it, they say it's a tank.

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:04.450 align:middle line:10%
That looks like a submarine
or some kind of yacht.

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:05.250 align:middle line:10%
Doesn't it?

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:06.417 align:middle line:10%
>> ENOCH: It certainly does.

00:17:06.417 --> 00:17:10.220 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: And then underneath
it looks like a UFO or some kind

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.970 align:middle line:10%
of flying object and then
another one underneath that.

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:14.990 align:middle line:10%
It's bizarre.

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:17.300 align:middle line:10%
>> ENOCH: Well, you know,
George, here's the thing too.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.190 align:middle line:84%
We know in this
temple at Abydos,

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:21.260 align:middle line:84%
there's something
called "The Flying Man."

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like the depiction
that Leonardo da Vinci did when

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.920 align:middle line:90%
we look at the universal man.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.620 align:middle line:84%
But furthermore, in
Saqqara, we found

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.630 align:middle line:90%
a bird that was depicted there.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And we know back in our
ancient Indian texts,

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:36.980 align:middle line:84%
like the "Ramayana,"
and the "Mahabharata,"

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:39.020 align:middle line:84%
and the "Samarangana
Sutradhara,"

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.540 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Vendantic
writings out of India, we

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.240 align:middle line:84%
have these wars depicted, and
there were these vimanas that

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.557 align:middle line:90%
were flying through the skies.

00:17:45.557 --> 00:17:46.640 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Flying machines.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: That's right--

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.690 align:middle line:84%
exuding weapons at each
other like lightning bolts.

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now, you made a
discovery of eating white cakes

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:54.890 align:middle line:90%
of gold.

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:55.310 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Yes.

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:56.900 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What is
that all about?

00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: OK, so this is one of
the most exciting discoveries.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's connected to
that particular temple.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:07.950 align:middle line:84%
But first of all, I have to
take you back to the year 1904.

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.380 align:middle line:84%
There's a a man named Sir
William Flinders Petrie.

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.180 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: 1904.

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:12.138 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: That's right.

00:18:12.138 --> 00:18:14.780 align:middle line:84%
So William Flinders Petrie with
the British Royal Geography

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Society, and he's going
on a great expedition

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:19.370 align:middle line:90%
into the Sinai.

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And he's looking for what's
known as the Moses Mountain.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, this Moses Mountain
has been called Mount Horeb.

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Today we call it
Serabit el-Khadim,

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:30.370 align:middle line:90%
the Mountain of Secrets.

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:31.640 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Serabit el-Khadim.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Yes.

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:32.750 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:34.000 align:middle line:84%
You say it even
better than I do.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.330 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, you
know, I'm from that area.

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:36.650 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Ah, I love it.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And he goes up
into that mountain

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:40.450 align:middle line:84%
and makes an
accidental discovery.

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:42.190 align:middle line:90%
They discover a cave.

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:44.100 align:middle line:90%
It's in the Moses Mountain.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's very significant
about this, this cave,

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.310 align:middle line:84%
is that it's dedicated to
a goddess named Hathor.

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:53.320 align:middle line:84%
But as they go
further into the cave,

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.990 align:middle line:84%
they find these
hermetically sealed chambers

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:57.072 align:middle line:90%
that are in there.

00:18:57.072 --> 00:18:58.030 align:middle line:90%
And they slide it open.

00:18:58.030 --> 00:18:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: This is
real or a myth?

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: This is
absolute truth.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: This is out of the
diaries of Sir William Flinders

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:02.970 align:middle line:90%
Petrie.

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.430 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: They open up these
hermetically sealed chambers,

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:09.130 align:middle line:84%
and they find they're
filled with a white powder.

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And this white
powder, at first, they

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.670 align:middle line:84%
think maybe it's just aluminum,
or "aluminium" as the British

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:14.470 align:middle line:90%
say.

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:15.755 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Mhm, or
limestone or whatever.

00:19:15.755 --> 00:19:17.005 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Yes, or bone powder.

00:19:17.005 --> 00:19:19.900 align:middle line:84%
They let it blow all over the
place and get adulterants.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:21.520 align:middle line:84%
They soon discover
that they've tapped

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.110 align:middle line:90%
into something much more.

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Because what they find
is that on the walls,

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:29.420 align:middle line:84%
the inscriptions say that
from the Fourth Dynasty,

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.420 align:middle line:84%
which is interesting
because everything in Egypt

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.760 align:middle line:84%
shot through the roof, and their
discoveries, and buildings,

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:34.210 align:middle line:90%
and everything--

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: At that time period.

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: Yes, all the way
up to the 19th dynasty.

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:40.540 align:middle line:84%
They found that there
was rituals taking place

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:41.810 align:middle line:90%
using this material.

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:44.170 align:middle line:84%
They were cooking, and
preparing, and getting it

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:45.520 align:middle line:90%
from certain places.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And we call it "white
gold" or "white cakes."

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And in the Bible we
have stories of Amarna.

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.830 align:middle line:84%
In the Greek
Septuagint Bible, they

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:55.690 align:middle line:84%
call it the "bread
of the Presence."

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:57.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's the
interesting thing, George,

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.700 align:middle line:84%
that we find that when we
find this material, which

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:04.570 align:middle line:84%
has been called "mfkzt" in the
Fifth Dynasty pyramid texts,

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:06.550 align:middle line:84%
they talk about a
secret inscription

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:10.360 align:middle line:84%
that there is a field of mfkzt,
another dimension that we've

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.150 align:middle line:84%
called the Plain of Sharon
that not only could they

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:15.490 align:middle line:84%
regenerate their bodies
with this material,

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:20.470 align:middle line:84%
and have an upgrade, and have
multidimensional capacities,

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:22.600 align:middle line:84%
and psychic abilities,
and strength,

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.940 align:middle line:84%
but this stuff unlocked
all kinds of powers,

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:27.140 align:middle line:90%
which is interesting.

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And so we find that that
stuff was over there.

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And its inscriptions are
used on certain temples

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.960 align:middle line:84%
that certain guys
had access to it.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you picture what's
in that Abydos Temple,

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:40.780 align:middle line:90%
we were amazed at what we found.

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And Mohammad was amazed
because I'd been working

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.320 align:middle line:90%
on him for years on this stuff.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.850 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no, my friend.

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:49.180 align:middle line:84%
He said, I don't think
there's anything to it.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.070 align:middle line:90%
After he started to--

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He used the
word Effendi, right?

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.280 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Yeah, he was amazed.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.380 align:middle line:90%
He started translating it.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, we don't have
any white cakes like this.

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And we started to see the
inscriptions on the wall.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, just to paint the
picture for you, George,

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:08.560 align:middle line:84%
and for the viewers, in
this temple in Abydos,

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.510 align:middle line:84%
there's seven rooms
there, and they're

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:12.460 align:middle line:90%
called the Holy of Holies.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And they have a door
in the back of them,

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:17.715 align:middle line:84%
and the door is a door to
the neters, or to the gods.

00:21:17.715 --> 00:21:19.520 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't go anywhere.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.610 align:middle line:84%
But each of these
rooms has inscriptions.

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:23.920 align:middle line:84%
It says it's a stargate,
that you step through it--

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: A stargate.

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: --and you
go to somewhere.

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, on the wall,
the instructions

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.450 align:middle line:84%
are, to access the stargates,
you had to have the mfktz,

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:34.360 align:middle line:84%
this material that was
prepared, being fed to you.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.570 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: In order to travel.

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:36.370 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Yes.

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:37.360 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well,
you were at Abydos.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.160 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Yes.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.460 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Let's take a look.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: We clearly see the
mfktz being given in this

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:42.850 align:middle line:90%
temple.

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:44.990 align:middle line:84%
So tell me what you
saw, intuitively.

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:50.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MAN: Intuitively, I saw that
the mfktz would be heated.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.450 align:middle line:90%
The cakes were being prepared.

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think we have
physical evidence

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:57.970 align:middle line:84%
on the ceilings of smoke, a
bit on the walls, as confirmed

00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:59.006 align:middle line:90%
by Mohammad.

00:21:59.006 --> 00:22:02.500 align:middle line:84%
There's a chimney or a chimney
stack space in the roof.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: So this is where
the mfktz was being cooked?

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MAN: That's what I was
being shown in this room.

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And then a priest in flowing,
quite wide-berth robes

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:16.090 align:middle line:84%
came out with the
finished product

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:19.690 align:middle line:84%
and was administering it
in a very private ceremony

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:21.280 align:middle line:90%
with about three people.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.540 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That is dramatic.

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:23.603 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:22:23.603 --> 00:22:26.020 align:middle line:10%
>> ENOCH: And this is a-- that
was a British lawyer friend

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:28.120 align:middle line:10%
of mine, who's
also a researcher.

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.560 align:middle line:10%
And he was there with me.

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.990 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden,
he was overcome

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:34.900 align:middle line:10%
with a sort of clairvoyant
vision that he saw.

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:37.030 align:middle line:84%
We entered the back room
where all the instructions

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:40.030 align:middle line:84%
lead up to that he says,
I'm being shown priests

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:42.520 align:middle line:84%
in white gowns flowing
around, that they're

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.200 align:middle line:90%
cooking these materials.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.485 align:middle line:84%
And as we look up,
there is the area

00:22:46.485 --> 00:22:47.860 align:middle line:84%
that was blackened
on the ceiling

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:50.050 align:middle line:84%
with the chimney
leading up to the rooms

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:51.670 align:middle line:90%
where they're administrating it.

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, George, before
this, everyone said, oh, this

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:56.080 align:middle line:90%
must be a healing temple.

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.700 align:middle line:90%
Ah, it's nothing.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.940 align:middle line:84%
When I'd walk up to
it, I saw three sets

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:03.290 align:middle line:84%
of platforms, three
sets of stairs

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:07.630 align:middle line:84%
just like the three entrances
to the Great Pyramid, the three

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:10.240 align:middle line:84%
directions that you
find in Freemasonry,

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.220 align:middle line:90%
the initiation aspects of it.

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And they had 42
steps each, which is

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:16.210 align:middle line:90%
very sacred to the mysteries.

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:17.800 align:middle line:90%
This was an ascension temple.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.210 align:middle line:90%
They were going somewhere.

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:21.340 align:middle line:84%
There was a type of
technology there.

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you right
now that this stuff is

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.833 align:middle line:84%
taken very seriously by
people in high places.

00:23:27.833 --> 00:23:29.000 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Well, they should.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, didn't the late
Laurence Gardner

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:32.678 align:middle line:84%
talk about the white
powders of gold?

00:23:32.678 --> 00:23:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: I'm very glad
you're talking about him,

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.700 align:middle line:90%
the great Laurence Gardner.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:39.470 align:middle line:84%
He was a fantastic
researcher, and he was

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:40.880 align:middle line:90%
talking about this for certain.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.870 align:middle line:84%
He was linking it to
the Ark of the Covenant,

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:45.080 align:middle line:90%
linking it to great mysteries.

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.420 align:middle line:10%
And what's really interesting
about this, George,

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:51.710 align:middle line:10%
as you've probably heard before,
having the connection to Cairo,

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:54.730 align:middle line:10%
is that the ancient name for
"Egypt" was never "Egypt."

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:55.760 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Mars.

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: Yeah, there's a
connection there to the Mars

00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:00.020 align:middle line:84%
too and a connection
to Sirius also.

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.720 align:middle line:84%
But what they would call
one of the names for "Egypt"

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.690 align:middle line:84%
was, if you went
back to where we

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:08.060 align:middle line:84%
get the name, "Aegyptos"
from the Greeks,

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:11.060 align:middle line:84%
and go back beyond
Memphis, the name

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:12.950 align:middle line:84%
that we find before
that was "Kem"

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:16.233 align:middle line:84%
or "Kemet" where we get the name
"chemistry" or "alchemy" from.

00:24:16.233 --> 00:24:17.150 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Interesting.

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:19.567 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: If you go look at
what the name "Kem" or "Kemet"

00:24:19.567 --> 00:24:22.220 align:middle line:84%
meant, it meant
the "black land."

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for that
is these black soils

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.690 align:middle line:84%
would flood up from
the Nile, and they

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:28.970 align:middle line:84%
would go through a
chemistry process with it.

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:32.510 align:middle line:84%
So fast-forward, George,
into the '70s and '80s

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:33.980 align:middle line:90%
right here in America.

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.990 align:middle line:90%
We get a guy named David Hudson.

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:38.600 align:middle line:84%
David Hudson, he's
over in the Yuma Valley

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.130 align:middle line:90%
of Phoenix, Arizona.

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And he is a guy that's
trying to grow cotton crops,

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:45.530 align:middle line:84%
but he's also an amateur
that's interested in gold

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:46.890 align:middle line:90%
and minerals.

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:50.810 align:middle line:84%
So he starts getting
this 93% sulfuric acid

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:55.910 align:middle line:84%
and dumping it on his black,
sodium-filled, alkali soil.

00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:56.717 align:middle line:90%
Sound familiar?

00:24:56.717 --> 00:24:57.800 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sounds familiar.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.110 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: All of a sudden,
it turns white and frothy,

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.800 align:middle line:90%
water soluble.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: A strange
material starts to show up.

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:06.500 align:middle line:84%
It's bright red at first,
and then it goes black.

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, I need to
get this stuff tested.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:10.820 align:middle line:84%
This guy had about
$8 million to work

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:13.190 align:middle line:90%
with because he was a farmer.

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:14.780 align:middle line:90%
And he goes and gets it tested.

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.238 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
they do is they

00:25:16.238 --> 00:25:19.075 align:middle line:84%
use something called an
"electron spectrum microscope."

00:25:19.075 --> 00:25:20.450 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't test
it for very long.

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:22.700 align:middle line:84%
Only 15 seconds was the
American method at that time.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That's
all they needed.

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:24.860 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: That's
all they needed.

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:26.720 align:middle line:84%
But all he pulled
out at that time

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.602 align:middle line:84%
was iron, and silica, and
a couple other things.

00:25:29.602 --> 00:25:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And they said, ah,
there's nothing there.

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:32.720 align:middle line:90%
But it's still acting strange.

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.640 align:middle line:90%
It's acting like a noble metal.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Long story short,
he has a friend

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:40.670 align:middle line:84%
that's involved with the
Soviet Academy of Sciences.

00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:42.950 align:middle line:90%
They test it for 300 seconds.

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:46.190 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, he finds out
that all these other things

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:49.100 align:middle line:84%
start showing up in the
platinum group of metals--

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.510 align:middle line:90%
palladium, iridium, ruthenium--

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Wow.

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:53.210 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: --rhodium.

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:54.710 align:middle line:90%
But they act differently.

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:57.510 align:middle line:84%
There's a special way
that they're acting.

00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And he starts labeling
them, orbitally

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.180 align:middle line:90%
rearranged monoatomic elements.

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Because, really quickly, to
go back to science class,

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:09.350 align:middle line:84%
if we take the atom, the atom
that we traditionally see

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:11.030 align:middle line:84%
has these electrons
whizzing around it.

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:12.020 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:15.200 align:middle line:10%
Well, underneath the
atom, we have a nuclei.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.720 align:middle line:10%
But if this substance
acts a little different

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.850 align:middle line:10%
because there's these
anti-electrons that

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:21.920 align:middle line:10%
are bonding with
electrons, so instead

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.770 align:middle line:10%
of it hugging that
area, it's pushing away

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:27.140 align:middle line:10%
in a toroidal
field like our DNA.

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And he starts finding that this
stuff not only has the ability

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:33.428 align:middle line:84%
to have antigravitational
properties when it's exposed--

00:26:33.428 --> 00:26:34.470 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Levitation too.

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:35.855 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Absolutely.

00:26:35.855 --> 00:26:36.655 align:middle line:90%
And it--

00:26:36.655 --> 00:26:38.363 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yeah, I've
read your work, Jon.

00:26:38.363 --> 00:26:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: Ah, I
love that about you.

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:43.640 align:middle line:84%
It starts to act very funny,
and it can regenerate the body.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.590 align:middle line:84%
So, George, what
happened is is that this

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:47.870 align:middle line:84%
got the attention of the
pharmaceutical companies,

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:49.820 align:middle line:90%
the energy departments.

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Because just to break it down
for everybody really quick,

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:55.820 align:middle line:84%
once you go to subatomic level
and once you've figured this

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:58.703 align:middle line:84%
out like the Egyptians did when
they were putting this stuff

00:26:58.703 --> 00:27:00.620 align:middle line:84%
into the Ark of the
Covenant, which, remember,

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:05.330 align:middle line:84%
was a weapon, once you find
that out, we go down quarks,

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:08.840 align:middle line:90%
neutrinos, hadrons, leptons.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Once we go down to
gluons and bosons,

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:14.130 align:middle line:84%
we're told now that you
can fit an entire galaxy

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:14.930 align:middle line:90%
in one of those.

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:15.730 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Jeez.

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: They're pure
photonic energy, no mass,

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.840 align:middle line:90%
going outside of spacetime.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.510 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How did Laurence
Gardner know this stuff?

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:25.070 align:middle line:90%
He was a great researcher--

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:26.070 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: He really was.

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:27.028 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: --and missed.

00:27:27.028 --> 00:27:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: He really was,
and he went much too soon,

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.810 align:middle line:90%
just incredible work.

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:34.482 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are we using this
white powder of gold today?

00:27:34.482 --> 00:27:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: Well, here's
the thing, George.

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:39.400 align:middle line:84%
After David Hudson came out
with his experiments, what

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:42.790 align:middle line:84%
happened with him is he
was told that his patents

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:45.640 align:middle line:84%
had to be seized in the
name of national security.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And he was told
to stop his work.

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:51.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of people on the
internet, they went out there,

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:54.460 align:middle line:84%
and they said, well,
Laurence Gardener, he

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:55.690 align:middle line:90%
amounted to nothing.

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:56.710 align:middle line:90%
He was a flake.

00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:57.700 align:middle line:90%
He just disappeared.

00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:58.500 align:middle line:90%
He gave up.

00:27:58.500 --> 00:27:59.800 align:middle line:90%
He threw his hands in the air.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.740 align:middle line:84%
I have information that
indicates otherwise.

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And I also would like to remind
people of a very famous story

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:08.260 align:middle line:90%
we have connected to Area 51.

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:10.450 align:middle line:84%
If you go back to the
story of Bob Lazar--

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:11.250 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: --and who a lot of
people are talking about now,

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:14.220 align:middle line:90%
with his--

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Documentaries made
on him and everything else.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: Yeah,
documentaries, interviews.

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:18.460 align:middle line:90%
Remember the story.

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:21.240 align:middle line:84%
We go back with John
Lear, Gene Huff.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.580 align:middle line:84%
He's going back into Rachel,
Nevada, there, S4, Groom Lake.

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:27.340 align:middle line:84%
He tells us that
when he was on--

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:31.180 align:middle line:84%
when he was over at Area 51, he
tells us an interesting story.

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:32.548 align:middle line:90%
He says, there's nine hangars.

00:28:32.548 --> 00:28:34.090 align:middle line:84%
In one of the hangars,
he said, there

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:36.800 align:middle line:84%
was a vimana that came
from an archaeological dig.

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:37.600 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Wow.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.190 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Incredible stuff.

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:41.500 align:middle line:84%
But he says the hangar
he was allowed to go in

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:43.630 align:middle line:90%
had this saucer-like craft.

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And he got in trouble
for running his hand

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:46.370 align:middle line:90%
down the side of it.

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:47.050 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And he touched it.

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:48.375 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: He certainly did.

00:28:48.375 --> 00:28:49.750 align:middle line:84%
He goes in there,
and he said, it

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:53.372 align:middle line:84%
was ominous because there
was no right angles.

00:28:53.372 --> 00:28:54.580 align:middle line:90%
But do you know what he said?

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:56.720 align:middle line:84%
He said something
very interesting.

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:59.680 align:middle line:84%
He said that in the
bottom of this thing,

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.230 align:middle line:84%
there was a particle
accelerator.

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:04.332 align:middle line:84%
And he said that it had
this strange substance.

00:29:04.332 --> 00:29:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That was
the propulsion system.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:06.998 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: That's right.

00:29:06.998 --> 00:29:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And he said the substance
was called Element 115.

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:11.650 align:middle line:90%
It was a heavy element.

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And he said it acted
very different.

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:16.540 align:middle line:84%
When you exposed it to
heat or radioactive fields,

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:19.970 align:middle line:84%
it starts to have this
electromagnetic feel to it.

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:22.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's interesting
to me about that

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:24.100 align:middle line:84%
is that we start
to see our friend

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.290 align:middle line:84%
David Hudson go missing
about the same time.

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Go missing?

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: Yeah, he missed--
he went out of the scene.

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.050 align:middle line:90%
He just disappeared--

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: --and told
people he gave up.

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:34.680 align:middle line:90%
And so he'd figured out--

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Hudson had figured out,
much like the Egyptians did,

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:39.310 align:middle line:84%
how to get the protons,
electrons, and neutrons

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:42.910 align:middle line:84%
in a particular sequence
so that this substance had

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:44.470 align:middle line:90%
a bit of an upgrade.

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I would say that there's
a type of alien alchemy going

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:48.140 align:middle line:90%
on here.

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, you talk
about alien alchemy.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.960 align:middle line:10%
Walter Sullivan, who used to
be "The New York Times" science

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:56.770 align:middle line:10%
writer, wrote a book
called "We Are Not Alone."

00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:59.210 align:middle line:10%
Are you convinced
we are not alone?

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: I'm absolutely
convinced we're not alone.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.640 align:middle line:90%
We never have been.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is a
universe full of life.

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.983 align:middle line:84%
I think, George,
let's put it this way.

00:30:07.983 --> 00:30:09.400 align:middle line:84%
We were told
recently that there's

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.130 align:middle line:90%
tardigrades on the moon.

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:15.790 align:middle line:10%
These are these little
microscopic water animals.

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:18.220 align:middle line:84%
Some say, hey, maybe
they came from Earth.

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:21.190 align:middle line:84%
But when we also
look at this, I've

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:26.260 align:middle line:84%
been told by some of my
contacts that on Europa

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:30.970 align:middle line:84%
that we find these 25-foot
whale-like creatures

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:32.950 align:middle line:90%
swimming on the surface.

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:36.580 align:middle line:84%
I've been told that we have
life all over our galaxy, all

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:37.600 align:middle line:90%
over our solar system.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:39.127 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: But most
certainly here,

00:30:39.127 --> 00:30:42.640 align:middle line:84%
we know from all of our
ancient civilizations,

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.470 align:middle line:84%
all of our religions are telling
us that we've had visitors

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:46.270 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:48.567 align:middle line:84%
And they played a great
role in our development.

00:30:48.567 --> 00:30:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Have we've been
seeded, in your opinion,

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:54.340 align:middle line:84%
the theory of Zecharia
Sitchin and the Annunaki?

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Yes.

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.400 align:middle line:84%
I very much believe
there's a lot to that.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:01.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even when we look at the
Book of Genesis in the Bible,

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.120 align:middle line:84%
which we know comes from
the Sumerian "Enuma Elish,"

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:07.720 align:middle line:84%
it was written about the
fourth and sixth centuries BCE,

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.160 align:middle line:84%
and it has events in there
that are going on from hundreds

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.248 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of years--

00:31:11.248 --> 00:31:12.290 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Very well said.

00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:14.050 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: --yeah,
that are taking place.

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:15.880 align:middle line:90%
It talks about that.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:20.460 align:middle line:84%
It's telling us a story
that where we came from.

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And the Egyptians believed
the same thing, to the Greeks,

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:27.250 align:middle line:84%
and to the ancient
Sumerians, the Chadeans,

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:29.800 align:middle line:90%
to the Assyrians, the Akkadians.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:32.260 align:middle line:84%
All these legends start
talking that we've

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:34.660 align:middle line:90%
been seeded from somewhere.

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Isn't it amazing
though that all cultures

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:41.770 align:middle line:84%
and civilizations all seem to
lead toward the same answer?

00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, you talk about the Bible
in Genesis and other stories.

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:48.760 align:middle line:84%
They all talk about
these genetically altered

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:51.110 align:middle line:84%
fallen angels and
everything like that.

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.910 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:53.202 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: That's right, George.

00:31:53.202 --> 00:31:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And actually what Plutarch
tells us, he said,

00:31:55.300 --> 00:32:00.280 align:middle line:84%
the gods of ancient Egypt were
the antediluvian, or preflood,

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.130 align:middle line:84%
precataclysmic kings
who were deified.

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:05.530 align:middle line:84%
They were made into
gods after death.

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:07.230 align:middle line:90%
So who were they?

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:09.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you go into
the Cairo Museum,

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:13.000 align:middle line:84%
we find these 15- to
20-foot sarcophagi

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.490 align:middle line:84%
that says "enormous coffin"
on the outside of it.

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:18.100 align:middle line:84%
We find all sorts of
inscriptions around Egypt,

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:20.230 align:middle line:84%
and reliefs, and
hieroglyphics that allude

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:22.360 align:middle line:84%
to the fact that there's
these giants among us.

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:23.800 align:middle line:90%
We have legends of it.

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:28.420 align:middle line:84%
But Osiris, who is one of the
great progenitor gods of Egypt,

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.210 align:middle line:84%
he's a giant within
an elongated skull.

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And we have
connections even there

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:37.240 align:middle line:84%
that if we go further into the
land of Bu Wizzer or Abusir,

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.032 align:middle line:84%
this land of Osiris was
appointed to the fact

00:32:40.032 --> 00:32:41.740 align:middle line:84%
that these were the
beings that came here

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:44.140 align:middle line:90%
from Sirius, the Dog Star.

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:47.110 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's one of
the kingly titles we

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:49.180 align:middle line:84%
had during the Middle
Ages was "sire,"

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:51.260 align:middle line:84%
and that's why you and
I call each other "sir."

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What about the
story of David and Goliath?

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:54.070 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: That's right.

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:55.153 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Who was Goliath?

00:32:55.153 --> 00:32:56.020 align:middle line:90%
What was Goliath?

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:58.312 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: That comes from
the story of the Philistines.

00:32:58.312 --> 00:33:02.830 align:middle line:84%
If you go into the Book of Enoch
in Watchers 6, 7 through 8,

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:06.130 align:middle line:84%
it said that these
Watchers came to Earth,

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:08.163 align:middle line:84%
and they saw the
daughters of man.

00:33:08.163 --> 00:33:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And they decided
to lay with them.

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:11.310 align:middle line:84%
And they produced an
offspring of giants where--

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:12.268 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: The Nephilim.

00:33:12.268 --> 00:33:13.360 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: That's right.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.940 align:middle line:84%
We're told in the Book of
Numbers and other places

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.620 align:middle line:84%
that we look like
grasshoppers to them.

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:19.420 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Ha.

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:22.030 align:middle line:84%
"Beyond the Legend" was a
program with Erich von Daniken

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:23.320 align:middle line:90%
for the Gaia series.

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And he, of course,
talks about his thoughts

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:28.690 align:middle line:90%
on the history of ETs on Earth.

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:31.600 align:middle line:10%
>>ERICH VON DANIKEN: Evolution
did not start on this planet.

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.710 align:middle line:10%
When I was a student, I
learned in Switzerland

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:38.200 align:middle line:10%
they all started on Earth.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.990 align:middle line:10%
The atoms came together
and formed molecules,

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:43.270 align:middle line:10%
and the molecules formed
together bigger molecules,

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:44.740 align:middle line:10%
and so on.

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:49.240 align:middle line:10%
In the meantime, modern science
says, no, the starting point

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:51.130 align:middle line:10%
came from outside.

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:55.000 align:middle line:10%
Evolution, yes, on this planet,
but the information of life

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.070 align:middle line:10%
has came from outside.

00:33:57.070 --> 00:34:01.540 align:middle line:10%
And this, again, is mentioned
in many of the old holy books,

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:04.160 align:middle line:10%
including our Bible.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:08.570 align:middle line:10%
And the gods created human
according their own image.

00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:10.790 align:middle line:10%
I say "the gods."

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:13.969 align:middle line:10%
Every critic will say, in
the Bible is only one god.

00:34:13.969 --> 00:34:16.429 align:middle line:10%
And God made human
after his own image.

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:17.630 align:middle line:10%
It's not true.

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:20.150 align:middle line:84%
Soon as you speak
or you read Hebrew,

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:24.290 align:middle line:84%
you know that the word in old
Hebrew for "god" is "Elohim."

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:26.090 align:middle line:90%
Now, Elohim is a plural.

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:28.370 align:middle line:84%
It does not exist
in the singular.

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:31.670 align:middle line:84%
The correct translations would
be "and the gods created humans

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:33.530 align:middle line:90%
according to their own image."

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:36.110 align:middle line:10%
Soon as you see this
way, you realize

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:38.870 align:middle line:10%
we are the offsprings of them.

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:42.469 align:middle line:10%
Now, I have been asked, why have
these extraterrestrials arrived

00:34:42.469 --> 00:34:43.610 align:middle line:10%
here?

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:48.170 align:middle line:10%
They knew, of course,
exactly on which planets

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:50.480 align:middle line:10%
this seed was growing.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.940 align:middle line:10%
They came here not
by coincidence.

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:54.540 align:middle line:10%
They have their astronomy.

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:57.230 align:middle line:10%
They know there are solar
systems which planets are

00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:59.270 align:middle line:10%
similar than our own planet.

00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:01.277 align:middle line:90%
It was not a coincidence.

00:35:01.277 --> 00:35:03.485 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I just love
listening to Erich von Daniken.

00:35:03.485 --> 00:35:03.740 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Yeah.

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I run into him,
Jonny, every year at Contact

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:09.340 align:middle line:84%
in the Desert, and he is
just such a delightful guy.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.662 align:middle line:84%
But what a wealth
of knowledge he has.

00:35:11.662 --> 00:35:12.620 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: He really is.

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And you know, when
he first came out

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.640 align:middle line:84%
with that "Chariots of the
Gods," he had his critics.

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.790 align:middle line:84%
But now he's being proven
right more and more.

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:19.250 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:20.210 align:middle line:90%
He could be a hero.

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:20.810 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: And I think so.

00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:23.102 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I remember when
you look at those Nazca Lines

00:35:23.102 --> 00:35:25.410 align:middle line:84%
in Peru, you can, one, only
decide what they are from

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:26.210 align:middle line:90%
above.

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:28.043 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what
they are walking around.

00:35:28.043 --> 00:35:29.025 align:middle line:90%
You can't see them.

00:35:29.025 --> 00:35:29.300 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: That's right.

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But you go above, you
can see spiders and all these

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:32.660 align:middle line:90%
other things.

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: And we find things
like that in other parts

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:36.443 align:middle line:84%
of the world that are
very interesting also.

00:35:36.443 --> 00:35:39.395 align:middle line:84%
But speaking of natural
disasters in Peru,

00:35:39.395 --> 00:35:43.260 align:middle line:84%
if you go 12,000 feet above sea
level, we find Lake Titicaca.

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:47.930 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: And Lake Titicaca
somehow has these fossilized

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:49.250 align:middle line:90%
sea shells up there.

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And they managed to build walls
around that place very quickly.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:54.830 align:middle line:84%
The Andes are relatively
new mountains.

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:57.500 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to start scratching
our heads and asking ourselves,

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:58.460 align:middle line:90%
what really happened?

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How many ETs in
groups do you think there are?

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:03.950 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: I think
it's countless.

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:07.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, we've had the likes
of the great Clifford Stone.

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:10.237 align:middle line:84%
He came out and said there's
57 types of extraterrestrials.

00:36:10.237 --> 00:36:11.570 align:middle line:90%
He said some are like the Grays.

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Heinz 57, right?

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:13.330 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Exactly.

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:16.580 align:middle line:84%
He said, that's when he
got out of the military.

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:18.710 align:middle line:84%
He said, are what
we call the "Grays."

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:20.787 align:middle line:84%
But most of them look
just like you and I,

00:36:20.787 --> 00:36:23.120 align:middle line:84%
and you wouldn't even know
if they're walking amongst us

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:24.450 align:middle line:90%
because they're identical.

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:25.250 align:middle line:90%
They only--

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:26.520 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: well, the
seed's the same.

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:27.478 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: That's right.

00:36:27.478 --> 00:36:29.925 align:middle line:84%
The only difference is they
could walk into a room that

00:36:29.925 --> 00:36:30.800 align:middle line:90%
might be a dark room.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.645 align:middle line:84%
They'd know what color
an object is without even

00:36:33.645 --> 00:36:34.520 align:middle line:90%
having to look at it.

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:35.760 align:middle line:90%
They could just touch it.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:38.390 align:middle line:84%
They might have a heightened
sense of smell or taste.

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:41.230 align:middle line:84%
But they're already
here, George.

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:43.280 align:middle line:84%
They're walking
amongst us every day.

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's an incredible thought
and when we think about it.

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:51.170 align:middle line:84%
Von Daniken was talking about
these particles, and atoms,

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:54.310 align:middle line:84%
and everything that
comes from the universe.

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:57.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, right now inside of
you and everyone watching,

00:36:57.650 --> 00:37:00.950 align:middle line:84%
when we think about
how profound this is,

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:03.680 align:middle line:84%
you have 100 trillion
cells in your body.

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.230 align:middle line:84%
There's 100 trillion
atoms in a cell

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:07.380 align:middle line:84%
and 100 trillion
cells in an atom.

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Atoms are made of
mostly blank spaces.

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:12.800 align:middle line:84%
So we can actually fit
everybody, all 8 billion

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.820 align:middle line:84%
of them on this planet, at
the end of our pinky finger,

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:18.200 align:middle line:84%
and we know that there's
very little space

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.720 align:middle line:84%
in between our universe,
which is mostly

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:23.450 align:middle line:84%
composed of dark matter,
in between our universe

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:27.320 align:middle line:84%
and other universes, so we are
all so intrinsically connected.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And one day, we're
going to realize

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:32.450 align:middle line:84%
that those folks that we
call "extraterrestrials,"

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:34.250 align:middle line:84%
we're not that much
different than them,

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:35.542 align:middle line:90%
and we're intimately connected.

00:37:35.542 --> 00:37:36.917 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What
drives you, Jonny?

00:37:36.917 --> 00:37:37.985 align:middle line:90%
What keeps pushing you?

00:37:37.985 --> 00:37:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: It's that fascination
with the unknown, George.

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:43.040 align:middle line:84%
Every time-- you
know, every time

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:45.740 align:middle line:84%
I think I have the
answer to something,

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:48.320 align:middle line:84%
it turns out there's more
questions waiting inside

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:51.260 align:middle line:84%
of it and another great
adventure somewhere to look,

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:53.070 align:middle line:90%
somewhere to go further in.

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:57.080 align:middle line:84%
So I find that a lot of my work
in the clinical hypnotherapy

00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:00.440 align:middle line:84%
field, looking into people's
minds and the type of memories,

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:03.230 align:middle line:84%
that somehow that people
that consider themselves

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:06.480 align:middle line:84%
to be ordinary folks, they
have extraordinary memories.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: 68% of the
Americans surveyed,

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:12.380 align:middle line:84%
68% believe that
there's a UFO cover-up.

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:13.850 align:middle line:90%
You agree with that?

00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:15.260 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Yes, of course.

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:17.270 align:middle line:84%
There's been a UFO
cover-up on this planet

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:18.240 align:middle line:90%
for a very long time.

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:19.040 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Why?

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:22.400 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: Well, look, if we
go back to Giordano Bruno.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:26.540 align:middle line:84%
He was a contemporary of Galileo
Galilei, who, by the way,

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:28.850 align:middle line:84%
gave us the telescope out
of his little observatory

00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:30.680 align:middle line:90%
in Civitavecchia in 1610.

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And we have him to thank
for our modern discoveries.

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:34.730 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They still
have his first telescope.

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:35.270 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: They do.

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And I think
it's at the Vatican.

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:37.340 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Yes, they do.

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:38.910 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely amazing.

00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:40.820 align:middle line:90%
But look at Giordano Bruno.

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:42.380 align:middle line:90%
He tried to tell us, George.

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:44.780 align:middle line:84%
He said-- he went
right out, and he said,

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:50.000 align:middle line:84%
there are innumerable worlds
with life on them that exist.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.190 align:middle line:84%
We've had people telling
us this for a long time.

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:53.240 align:middle line:90%
But what did they do?

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.225 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, this
disrupts our narrative.

00:38:55.225 --> 00:38:56.600 align:middle line:84%
We don't like what
you're saying.

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.558 align:middle line:84%
It takes away from our
great story that we had.

00:38:58.558 --> 00:39:00.050 align:middle line:90%
They said, kill him.

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:01.580 align:middle line:90%
And that was the end to him.

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:05.420 align:middle line:84%
I think we're getting to a point
where we can no longer hide

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:06.230 align:middle line:90%
these things.

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:07.000 align:middle line:90%
It's just like--

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And you can't
keep killing these people.

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:09.920 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: That's right.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.320 align:middle line:84%
But the one enemy
of the darkness--

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:15.320 align:middle line:84%
we can look out in the darkest
room, in the darkest room

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:17.300 align:middle line:84%
out there, and it
just takes one light,

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:19.190 align:middle line:84%
for you to show
one light, and that

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.840 align:middle line:90%
will just burn up the darkness.

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What's the next step?

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:24.180 align:middle line:90%
What's the next plateau?

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:26.180 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: Well, for me,
I'm seeing that there is

00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:30.008 align:middle line:84%
an evolution of our sciences
and spirituality right now.

00:39:30.008 --> 00:39:31.550 align:middle line:10%
The things that used
to be considered

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:33.860 align:middle line:10%
the matters of quacks
and charlatans,

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:37.790 align:middle line:10%
they are now being
verified by science.

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:41.630 align:middle line:84%
So for example, we
get the idea right now

00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:44.840 align:middle line:84%
that we're injecting
the nanoparticles

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:48.560 align:middle line:84%
into the eyeballs of rats so
they can see night vision.

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.550 align:middle line:84%
We know they've taken
it a step further,

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:52.430 align:middle line:84%
so they've gone into
the infrared spectrum.

00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:56.000 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: They're seeing things
in a multidimensional capacity.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.702 align:middle line:84%
We know that what
we used to call

00:39:57.702 --> 00:39:59.660 align:middle line:84%
in, perhaps, situations,
what people would call

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:04.880 align:middle line:84%
"jinn" or "demons" in places,
that these are perhaps

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.460 align:middle line:84%
multidimensional intelligences
that are existing

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:10.460 align:middle line:84%
outside of the human light
spectrum that we're now being--

00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:11.720 align:middle line:90%
that are now being perceived.

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:13.370 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
a science of that.

00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And what excites me
the most, George, is

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:19.400 align:middle line:84%
the hope we can give people
through this by bridging

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:21.770 align:middle line:84%
the spirituality
with the quantum

00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:24.350 align:middle line:84%
so that we can look at things
like life after death and say,

00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:25.460 align:middle line:90%
there's a lot more to it.

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: There is
a lot more to it.

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think through a
extraterrestrial investigation,

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:32.910 align:middle line:84%
you will give a lot
of these answers.

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:34.190 align:middle line:90%
Don't you?

00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:34.990 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Yes.

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:37.780 align:middle line:84%
There's definitely a tie-in
with the extraterrestrials

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:39.650 align:middle line:90%
and our spiritual capacity.

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Because we know that
in these ET encounters,

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:46.280 align:middle line:84%
people are getting metamorphic
and telepathic communications.

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.290 align:middle line:90%
Time-space is shifting for them.

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:50.290 align:middle line:84%
There's a greater
understanding of our universe,

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:52.050 align:middle line:84%
and we're getting
there ourselves.

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, and another
way to look at the expansion

00:40:56.010 --> 00:40:59.310 align:middle line:84%
of the universe is to try
to come up with the theories

00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:00.150 align:middle line:90%
of, who are we?

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:01.140 align:middle line:90%
What are we?

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:03.073 align:middle line:90%
Is there life after death?

00:41:03.073 --> 00:41:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
the complexity of all

00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:08.580 align:middle line:84%
of this at one time, you have
to come to the conclusion

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:11.430 align:middle line:84%
that this exists far
beyond this reality.

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:12.230 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Yes.

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:13.560 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: There is
life after death.

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:14.220 align:middle line:90%
Isn't there?

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: There
most certainly is,

00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:18.810 align:middle line:84%
and I've spent a lot of time
investigating this subject.

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:20.670 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with
people that have

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:22.500 align:middle line:90%
had near-death experiences.

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.900 align:middle line:84%
I've done the clinical
hypnotherapy protocols

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:26.640 align:middle line:84%
on people that
remember what it's

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:30.720 align:middle line:84%
like to pick their bodies
before they got here, that they

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:32.610 align:middle line:84%
saw the people in
soul groups that they

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:33.750 align:middle line:90%
were going to work with.

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And that started
to fascinate me.

00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:38.190 align:middle line:84%
But, George, for many
years, the skeptics

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:41.310 align:middle line:84%
would always say that these
near-death experiences were

00:41:41.310 --> 00:41:43.650 align:middle line:84%
a product of something
called "hypoxia,"

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:45.000 align:middle line:90%
which is a lack of oxygen.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: To the brain,
as the brain dies.

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Right.

00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And what we found is that
those type of hallucinations,

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:53.830 align:middle line:84%
especially when we recreate
them, they're very fleeting.

00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:54.630 align:middle line:90%
They're short.

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:58.290 align:middle line:84%
They're not these profound,
long-lasting experiences

00:41:58.290 --> 00:42:00.870 align:middle line:84%
such as we saw in the case
of the great neurologist

00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:03.570 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Eben Alexander,
who, by the way,

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:05.530 align:middle line:84%
had a case of
bacterial meningitis.

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:06.330 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:07.860 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And he was a skeptic--

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Yes.

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:10.950 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: --until his
near-death experience occurred.

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:12.880 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:15.880 align:middle line:10%
EBEN ALEXANDER: I was very
skeptical before my NDE.

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:18.940 align:middle line:10%
So having that personal
experience and evidence,

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:22.240 align:middle line:10%
like millions of
others have, helps us

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:24.780 align:middle line:10%
to wake up to a bigger reality.

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:27.210 align:middle line:10%
And I think as a
scientist, I'm--

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:29.830 align:middle line:10%
and one who is fascinated
by consciousness, and brain,

00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:32.770 align:middle line:10%
and mind, this is a very
natural thing for me

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:33.610 align:middle line:10%
to be going through.

00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:36.310 align:middle line:10%
And my NDE, when I
look back on my life,

00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:38.200 align:middle line:10%
makes perfect sense
that that is what

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:41.530 align:middle line:10%
would happen when I was
54 years old and trying

00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:44.050 align:middle line:10%
to find out some deeper
answers about the universe.

00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:46.930 align:middle line:10%
And the good news is a lot
of what I've discovered

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:49.030 align:middle line:10%
and in work with fellow
scientists studying

00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:51.130 align:middle line:10%
consciousness is
something that rings

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:53.627 align:middle line:10%
true with many, many souls.

00:42:53.627 --> 00:42:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So what do you tell
people, skeptics, who say,

00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:57.760 align:middle line:90%
there is no life after death.

00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.980 align:middle line:90%
When you die, that's it.

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: What's really great
about this is that when we go

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:06.040 align:middle line:84%
in the work that's been done
on quantum consciousness,

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:10.650 align:middle line:84%
that we see over with an
anesthesiologist that's name is

00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:13.780 align:middle line:84%
Stuart Hameroff over at
the University of Tucson

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:18.460 align:middle line:84%
in Arizona, he's looked at the
idea that our brain works with

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:20.710 align:middle line:84%
these things called
"microtubules"

00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:24.880 align:middle line:84%
that are so well designed as
computational devices that they

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:28.660 align:middle line:84%
hold consciousness in
there like a cockpit.

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:31.563 align:middle line:84%
And when it works in this
way, our consciousness

00:43:31.563 --> 00:43:32.980 align:middle line:84%
is held together
through something

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:36.100 align:middle line:84%
called "superpositioning"
or "quantum cohesion."

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:39.920 align:middle line:84%
So you have an IP address
that's very unique to you.

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And not only is this how
we look at the science

00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:45.440 align:middle line:84%
of near-death
experiences nowadays,

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.800 align:middle line:84%
but we actually
look at this concept

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:50.740 align:middle line:84%
as how our future
communications on the quantum

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:51.860 align:middle line:90%
is going to work.

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:55.780 align:middle line:84%
So with this incredible
science backing up

00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:58.060 align:middle line:84%
what we've looked
at here, then we

00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:00.970 align:middle line:84%
start to ask ourselves,
what happens after we die?

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:02.297 align:middle line:90%
Where do we go?

00:44:02.297 --> 00:44:03.255 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:44:03.255 --> 00:44:05.463 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: So what I've found
with this and the people

00:44:05.463 --> 00:44:07.900 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed and work
with in these procedures,

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:12.130 align:middle line:84%
that some of us when we die,
we come out of the body,

00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:15.070 align:middle line:84%
and we'll stick around
for a couple of weeks.

00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:16.810 align:middle line:84%
We'll communicate
with our loved ones.

00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:18.280 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Do we know we're dead?

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:21.000 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: Sometimes, at first,
it's a little perplexing.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever seen
that movie "What Dreams

00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:23.770 align:middle line:90%
May Come" with Robin Williams?

00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:24.810 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Oh, yeah,
with Robin Williams.

00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: You know,
he goes through that.

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:26.500 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah, a classic.

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:27.430 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Exactly.

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And there's an area
just above that where

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:32.350 align:middle line:84%
we've kind of colloquially
called the "astral," where

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:34.750 align:middle line:84%
we go when we dream, that you
can kind of create at first

00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:36.333 align:middle line:84%
what you're going
to anticipate you're

00:44:36.333 --> 00:44:38.920 align:middle line:84%
going to see before you want
to move out of that area.

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And in that movie,
Robin Williams

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.408 align:middle line:84%
was sliding around
with Cuba Gooding, Jr.

00:44:42.408 --> 00:44:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And there was paint and
everything until he was--

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:46.420 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Stepping on heads
in Hell, remember that?

00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:47.280 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Yes.

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:48.730 align:middle line:90%
That was scary.

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:51.250 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting
part about this

00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:55.660 align:middle line:84%
is that then we go up into this
space where we do a 360 degree

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:59.860 align:middle line:84%
panoramic life review where
we experience our life not

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:02.680 align:middle line:84%
only from our perspective
but as of everybody

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:04.450 align:middle line:90%
we've ever encountered.

00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And that can be a
little disturbing,

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:09.300 align:middle line:84%
or it could be a
pleasant experience.

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And from that point on, we
get a choice to move forward,

00:45:12.490 --> 00:45:16.690 align:middle line:84%
and we're reunited with the
folks that we've grown to love.

00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:21.130 align:middle line:84%
But in this experience, it's
very transformative for those

00:45:21.130 --> 00:45:22.570 align:middle line:90%
that have gone through it.

00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:25.187 align:middle line:84%
Our mutual friend, Dannion
Brinkley, he's got a very--

00:45:25.187 --> 00:45:26.770 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He's been
there three times.

00:45:26.770 --> 00:45:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: He has.

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:29.230 align:middle line:90%
And it transformed him.

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:30.490 align:middle line:90%
But he always reminds me.

00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:33.560 align:middle line:84%
He says, Jonny, when I was
over there, I was told,

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:36.550 align:middle line:84%
you're a great and mighty,
powerful, spiritual people

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:39.190 align:middle line:84%
with dignity,
direction, and purpose.

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And that message is very
encouraging for all of us

00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:43.920 align:middle line:84%
to remind us that
there's more to all this.

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, he was
right and is right.

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: It is.

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:47.018 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And is right.

00:45:47.018 --> 00:45:48.490 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Yes.

00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:51.220 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: These near-death
experiences that you were

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:53.830 align:middle line:84%
talking about, the
dying of the brain,

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:56.740 align:middle line:90%
that is a medical condition.

00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:57.740 align:middle line:90%
That does happen.

00:45:57.740 --> 00:45:58.870 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:45:58.870 --> 00:46:00.010 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Yes.

00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:03.850 align:middle line:84%
So we've had various medical
conditions linked to that.

00:46:03.850 --> 00:46:05.500 align:middle line:90%
But I mean, they don't produce--

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:09.290 align:middle line:84%
they don't produce these results
always that we would expect.

00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:12.460 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of different
near-death experience reports

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:15.640 align:middle line:84%
and what people go through,
what they experience,

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:17.300 align:middle line:90%
anomalies in the brain.

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:19.210 align:middle line:10%
But I think it's
incredible, especially

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:22.570 align:middle line:10%
when we look at the work of
the great Dr. Raymond Moody,

00:46:22.570 --> 00:46:24.287 align:middle line:10%
who I know you've
had on the show.

00:46:24.287 --> 00:46:25.120 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Great guy.

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:25.810 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Great guy.

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:27.640 align:middle line:84%
He was really the
pioneer in this area that

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:29.860 align:middle line:84%
started to sift
through these cases

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:32.830 align:middle line:90%
and define life after life.

00:46:32.830 --> 00:46:35.915 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is there a dark
side to some of this, Jonny?

00:46:35.915 --> 00:46:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: In the near-death
experience world?

00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yes, is there a hell?

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: I think that people
are going to experience what

00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:44.600 align:middle line:84%
they expect or what
they anticipate,

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:48.080 align:middle line:84%
whatever the belief of their
childhood understanding is

00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:50.510 align:middle line:84%
in that level where
we go when we dream.

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:53.450 align:middle line:84%
It's just one level to the
multidimensional capacity

00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:54.740 align:middle line:90%
of who we are.

00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:57.260 align:middle line:84%
Interesting story
for you, when I

00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:59.840 align:middle line:84%
was doing my interviews
of people in these cases,

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:03.780 align:middle line:84%
I came across a Canadian
corporate lawyer of 34 years.

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:05.750 align:middle line:90%
His name was Garnet Schulhauser.

00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And he told me a
fascinating story

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:11.180 align:middle line:84%
because he was a skeptic before,
much like these other folks.

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:14.630 align:middle line:84%
He starts having these profound,
life-changing, out-of-body

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:17.060 align:middle line:84%
experiences where
he was taken up

00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:20.240 align:middle line:84%
out of the body at a very
pivotal point of his life.

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:21.680 align:middle line:90%
He goes on to write about it.

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:24.410 align:middle line:84%
He says that he was shown
aspects of our universe,

00:47:24.410 --> 00:47:25.660 align:middle line:90%
you know, the usual questions.

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Wow.

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:28.557 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: What is a soul?

00:47:28.557 --> 00:47:29.890 align:middle line:90%
What happens to us after we die?

00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We was
given these answers.

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:32.240 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Absolutely.

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:35.540 align:middle line:84%
He's taken up above our
Earth, and he finds this place

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:37.310 align:middle line:90%
where he calls Heaven.

00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And he says that it's
called "Aglaia" over there.

00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And he said it's got
all the architecture

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:44.870 align:middle line:84%
from different time periods on
Earth and different costumes

00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:46.670 align:middle line:90%
from people that are here.

00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And, he says,
people get together,

00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:51.920 align:middle line:84%
and you can be there for
thousands of years if you want,

00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:53.810 align:middle line:84%
which is only like
a second over there.

00:47:53.810 --> 00:47:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Or you can choose
to go and visit

00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.530 align:middle line:84%
with different councils
or Akashic records.

00:47:57.530 --> 00:48:01.457 align:middle line:84%
You can choose to incarnate
here in this Aglaia place.

00:48:01.457 --> 00:48:03.040 align:middle line:84%
He says, over there,
there's concerts.

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:04.463 align:middle line:84%
He said, the Beatles
are up there.

00:48:04.463 --> 00:48:05.630 align:middle line:90%
Freddie Mercury is up there.

00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's enjoying
these incredible concerts

00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:08.760 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:09.890 align:middle line:90%
And they're always happy.

00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:13.310 align:middle line:84%
But, he said, that place there,
Aglaia, is connected to Earth.

00:48:13.310 --> 00:48:16.640 align:middle line:84%
But he said that there is a
heaven-like place above all

00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:20.300 align:middle line:84%
of the planets out there
that is sort of custom fit

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:22.490 align:middle line:84%
to their architecture,
their time periods--

00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:22.580 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Interesting.

00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: --and their people.

00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:24.560 align:middle line:84%
But, he said, they're
all connected.

00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:27.620 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, no,
there is no hell.

00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:31.220 align:middle line:84%
It's my opinion that hell was
designed by the early church

00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:32.420 align:middle line:90%
from the "Divine Comedy."

00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:34.030 align:middle line:90%
It comes from Virgil.

00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:34.830 align:middle line:90%
We go--

00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:35.913 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It teaches fear.

00:48:35.913 --> 00:48:37.640 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: That's it,
Dante's "Inferno."

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:40.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, George, to
the ancient Buddhists,

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.548 align:middle line:84%
they believed hell
was a state of mind.

00:48:42.548 --> 00:48:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that might be
something you see at first.

00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:47.990 align:middle line:84%
But just like our
haunted houses,

00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:50.738 align:middle line:84%
when we see a haunted
house or an old haunted

00:48:50.738 --> 00:48:52.280 align:middle line:84%
castle in England,
it might have been

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:54.740 align:middle line:90%
haunted for 300 or 400 years.

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:57.020 align:middle line:84%
That's only a second
on the spirit side.

00:48:57.020 --> 00:49:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Usually, the spirit guides
and those of those beings

00:49:00.290 --> 00:49:02.690 align:middle line:84%
are trying to send
messages to those beings

00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:03.980 align:middle line:90%
to get them to come over.

00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:06.350 align:middle line:84%
But they are so afraid of
doing that life review,

00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:07.790 align:middle line:84%
some folks just
don't want to move

00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:10.910 align:middle line:84%
to see what's coming because
that's the troubling part.

00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:13.767 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What's next for you
in your area of research, Jonny?

00:49:13.767 --> 00:49:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: It never
stops here, George.

00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:16.040 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It never stops.

00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:18.248 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: Right now, Brien
Foerster and I are looking

00:49:18.248 --> 00:49:21.063 align:middle line:84%
at new evidence for
these elongated skulls,

00:49:21.063 --> 00:49:22.355 align:middle line:90%
other places they're connected.

00:49:22.355 --> 00:49:23.188 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Whoa, yep.

00:49:23.188 --> 00:49:25.880 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: We're going in a month
up to Paracas, and Bolivia,

00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:26.930 align:middle line:90%
and Peru.

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm back up with
some new permissions in Egypt

00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:32.930 align:middle line:84%
looking at some secret
temples and inscriptions

00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:36.050 align:middle line:84%
that might unlock even
greater fields of information.

00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:37.610 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I miss
the late Lloyd Pye.

00:49:37.610 --> 00:49:38.410 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Yes.

00:49:38.410 --> 00:49:40.432 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He would
have loved your work.

00:49:40.432 --> 00:49:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: Oh, that's
great of you to say.

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Lloyd Pye was such a pioneer
with what he did there--

00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:45.470 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: He was.

00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:46.420 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: --the Starchild skull.

00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:48.753 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Oh, my gosh, he was
way ahead of his time too.

00:49:48.753 --> 00:49:50.150 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Incredible stuff.

00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:54.490 align:middle line:84%
But you know, George, I think
one of the greatest secrets

00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:56.990 align:middle line:84%
and one of the greatest places
full of mystery on this Earth

00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:59.390 align:middle line:84%
that people haven't
even begun to look

00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:02.290 align:middle line:84%
is going up into this place
called the Ural Mountains.

00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:04.040 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever heard
of the Eurasian areas?

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:05.360 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yes, in Russia.

00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:06.200 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: That's it.

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.450 align:middle line:90%
Well, when you look up there--

00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is that where
the Dyatlov Pass was?

00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:10.410 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Yes.

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:10.940 align:middle line:90%
And we have some--

00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:12.232 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's a scary story.

00:50:12.232 --> 00:50:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: What's strange
here too is that if you look

00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:17.720 align:middle line:84%
at where these elongated skulls
from Paracas are connected--

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:18.940 align:middle line:90%
and they're very particular.

00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:19.190 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yes.

00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:20.690 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: They're
not bound-up ones.

00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:22.857 align:middle line:84%
We find that they're connected
to the Northern Black

00:50:22.857 --> 00:50:23.899 align:middle line:90%
Sea, Crimea, Scandinavia.

00:50:23.899 --> 00:50:24.815 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Interesting.

00:50:24.815 --> 00:50:26.330 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: But up
there in the Ural,

00:50:26.330 --> 00:50:28.610 align:middle line:84%
we have something called
the "Dashka stone,"

00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:31.490 align:middle line:84%
which is a 1 megaton
relief that has an ancient,

00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:35.090 align:middle line:84%
3D topographical map of the
Earth that's available and can

00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:38.390 align:middle line:84%
be seen up from space
in our atmosphere.

00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:41.150 align:middle line:84%
It was a part of
a 30-ton relief.

00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is an extraterrestrial
map from the heavens

00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:45.600 align:middle line:90%
that they could use.

00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And we also find
that the Russians

00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:51.330 align:middle line:84%
had discovered these little
gold wires, nano-like microchip

00:50:51.330 --> 00:50:53.300 align:middle line:84%
structures that are at
least, they're saying,

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:54.250 align:middle line:90%
on the minimum, 20,000 years.

00:50:54.250 --> 00:50:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Where
did they come from?

00:50:55.770 --> 00:50:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Well--

00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:57.677 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: 20,000-year-old wires?

00:50:57.677 --> 00:50:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: Yes, ancient
civilizations had it.

00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:01.760 align:middle line:84%
We have glyphs up there that
can be viewed from space,

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:04.160 align:middle line:84%
just like the ones you talked
about with the Nazca Lines,

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:07.040 align:middle line:84%
and caves full of these
inscriptions of what

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:09.230 align:middle line:90%
looks like complex amino acids.

00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:12.260 align:middle line:84%
We have a great and
advanced civilization

00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:15.127 align:middle line:84%
that rose up and came out
of those Uralic areas.

00:51:15.127 --> 00:51:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It is these
incredible mysteries, Jonny,

00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:20.750 align:middle line:84%
that keep you and people
like me just keep going.

00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:22.263 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: Yes, and
they never stop.

00:51:22.263 --> 00:51:24.680 align:middle line:84%
That's why the world needs
"Beyond Belief" because there's

00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:26.960 align:middle line:84%
so much that's
beyond our beliefs

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:29.180 align:middle line:84%
that will one day
become our beliefs.

00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:32.610 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: As you
look at the future,

00:51:32.610 --> 00:51:36.390 align:middle line:84%
will mankind really get the
definitive answers about life

00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:38.850 align:middle line:90%
after death, extraterrestrials?

00:51:38.850 --> 00:51:40.405 align:middle line:90%
Are we alone?

00:51:40.405 --> 00:51:42.780 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: Well, not only are
we going to get the answers,

00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:45.780 align:middle line:84%
but we might get more
than what we're seeking.

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:48.330 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you look at
where our computers are going,

00:51:48.330 --> 00:51:50.970 align:middle line:84%
right now, if you
take the computer,

00:51:50.970 --> 00:51:53.940 align:middle line:84%
the computer that we have
right now is operating linear.

00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:56.807 align:middle line:84%
It uses what we call "binary,"
you know, ones and zeros.

00:51:56.807 --> 00:51:58.140 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Ones and zeros, right.

00:51:58.140 --> 00:51:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Right.

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:01.890 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I want you to
picture for me for a moment

00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:03.540 align:middle line:90%
the old Torahs, the scrolls.

00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:05.310 align:middle line:84%
Or the-- you know how
the Sumerians would

00:52:05.310 --> 00:52:07.145 align:middle line:84%
use those tablets where
they would roll out?

00:52:07.145 --> 00:52:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Uh-huh, cuneiforms.

00:52:08.310 --> 00:52:08.980 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Exactly.

00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:10.855 align:middle line:84%
So instead of rolling
things out into linear,

00:52:10.855 --> 00:52:12.870 align:middle line:84%
let's keep it in a
spherical structure.

00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:14.760 align:middle line:84%
We put the one on
top of the circle,

00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:16.890 align:middle line:90%
and put the zero on the bottom.

00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:19.140 align:middle line:84%
We could put infinite
information in the middle--

00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: In the middle.

00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: --the
nexus to time-space.

00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:23.160 align:middle line:84%
But one over here,
a zero over here,

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:27.660 align:middle line:84%
we have infinite information in
all directions in the quantum.

00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:31.230 align:middle line:84%
When we can get that, we can
calculate every single particle

00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:32.610 align:middle line:90%
in our universe.

00:52:32.610 --> 00:52:35.618 align:middle line:84%
And at that level, we know
what little Julius Caesar

00:52:35.618 --> 00:52:38.160 align:middle line:84%
had for breakfast on his name
day when he was eight years old

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:39.743 align:middle line:84%
and what he was
thinking that morning.

00:52:39.743 --> 00:52:42.480 align:middle line:84%
We know everything that's going
to come in just our universe.

00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, what if I were to tell
you, George, that just maybe we

00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:48.870 align:middle line:84%
had a basic version
of this that existed

00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:51.450 align:middle line:84%
in an underground
facility near Utah?

00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:54.110 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of interesting
places that we're going in,

00:52:54.110 --> 00:52:54.910 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:52:54.910 --> 00:52:55.827 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Stored away.

00:52:55.827 --> 00:52:56.627 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Yes.

00:52:56.627 --> 00:52:58.800 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of
interesting places we're going.

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:01.170 align:middle line:84%
But you might also
ask yourself, what

00:53:01.170 --> 00:53:04.438 align:middle line:84%
about things like AI,
Artificial Intelligence?

00:53:04.438 --> 00:53:05.730 align:middle line:90%
What are your thoughts on that?

00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Would you not love
to look and tour Noah's Ark?

00:53:10.410 --> 00:53:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Oh, I'd love to.

00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:12.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, there's--

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:14.765 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Just walking through
there would be unbelievable.

00:53:14.765 --> 00:53:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: It would
be incredible.

00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:19.840 align:middle line:84%
Noah's Ark, you might say, has
more truth to it than possible.

00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:22.770 align:middle line:84%
I've been told by
folks in certain places

00:53:22.770 --> 00:53:25.950 align:middle line:84%
that have special knowledge
that they said that they were

00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:29.580 align:middle line:84%
absolutely amazed in some of
our off-world explorations

00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:32.880 align:middle line:84%
that there is a planet
not too far from here

00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:37.290 align:middle line:84%
that has what looks like
replicas of all the dinosaurs.

00:53:37.290 --> 00:53:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And remember, nothing
goes extinct on our planet

00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:40.732 align:middle line:90%
by accident.

00:53:40.732 --> 00:53:42.690 align:middle line:84%
If the dinosaurs were to
be brought back today,

00:53:42.690 --> 00:53:46.680 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't be able to
survive because, again, we

00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:49.600 align:middle line:84%
have less oxygen on the planet
and more gravity than we did.

00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:50.400 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: So true.

00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:53.120 align:middle line:90%
Jonny, do you Ouija?

00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:54.330 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Do I Ouija?

00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:56.730 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you, George,
I've spent a lot of time

00:53:56.730 --> 00:53:59.470 align:middle line:84%
looking at Ouija boards
and talking about them.

00:53:59.470 --> 00:54:00.840 align:middle line:90%
They're fascinating.

00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that they
reveal a lot about our mind.

00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:08.670 align:middle line:84%
Because, George, as you
know, I have a background

00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:10.033 align:middle line:90%
working in psychology--

00:54:10.033 --> 00:54:10.950 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yes, you do.

00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: --and pharmacology,
and addiction models.

00:54:13.170 --> 00:54:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that we've
seen in psychological models

00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:17.800 align:middle line:90%
is using the pendulum.

00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And so the pendulum that people
hold has this autonomic--

00:54:21.850 --> 00:54:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You could hold it
over a map and everything.

00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>> ENOCH: Yes, yes.

00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:27.660 align:middle line:84%
You get this result from the
body from the subconscious

00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:28.690 align:middle line:90%
mind.

00:54:28.690 --> 00:54:32.070 align:middle line:84%
So we know that there are these
intelligences communicating

00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:32.880 align:middle line:90%
to us.

00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:35.220 align:middle line:84%
We've had great
cases that have been

00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:37.470 align:middle line:90%
documented about telepathy.

00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:40.380 align:middle line:10%
I mean, look at the work of
the great Dr. Jeffrey Mishlove

00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:42.510 align:middle line:10%
that's over at Stanford
that is doing work

00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:44.310 align:middle line:10%
on these sorts of things.

00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:46.470 align:middle line:10%
People have looked at
it in different scans

00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:47.400 align:middle line:10%
of how it exists.

00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:49.650 align:middle line:90%
So we have these communications.

00:54:49.650 --> 00:54:53.520 align:middle line:84%
So the Ouija, which we go
back to William Fuld with,

00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:54.572 align:middle line:90%
has a huge history.

00:54:54.572 --> 00:54:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But you don't think
the Ouija board brings in bad

00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:58.060 align:middle line:90%
spirits?

00:54:58.060 --> 00:55:00.450 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: Well, I think people
can bring in anything they

00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:01.250 align:middle line:90%
want.

00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:03.480 align:middle line:84%
This is the truth, George,
is that a lot of what

00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:05.430 align:middle line:84%
we're calling "haunted
houses" today,

00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:07.380 align:middle line:84%
we are going to
discover one day-- just

00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:11.260 align:middle line:84%
as guys like the Gnostics, they
called beings on this planet

00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:12.630 align:middle line:90%
"Archons."

00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:14.310 align:middle line:84%
Rudolf Steiner's
talked about beings

00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:15.630 align:middle line:90%
that would take loosh from us.

00:55:15.630 --> 00:55:17.047 align:middle line:10%
We're going to
find that there are

00:55:17.047 --> 00:55:21.030 align:middle line:10%
these multidimensional lifeforms
all around us, out in space

00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:23.160 align:middle line:10%
even, that come here,
that are observing us,

00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:25.560 align:middle line:10%
and they feed off
of different things.

00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
part about that

00:55:27.330 --> 00:55:30.720 align:middle line:84%
is that, sure, it's like
putting a calling card out there

00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:31.650 align:middle line:90%
on the internet.

00:55:31.650 --> 00:55:34.200 align:middle line:84%
You're asking for someone you
don't know in an anonymous room

00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:35.040 align:middle line:90%
to talk to you.

00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:36.457 align:middle line:84%
You don't know who
you're getting.

00:55:36.457 --> 00:55:38.530 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what you
might be tapping into.

00:55:38.530 --> 00:55:40.470 align:middle line:84%
But it's a tool to
the subconscious mind

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:42.412 align:middle line:90%
just like the pendulum.

00:55:42.412 --> 00:55:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Jonny, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>> ENOCH: Thanks so much
for having me, George.

00:55:46.070 --> 00:55:46.930 align:middle line:90%
It's been a pleasure.

00:55:46.930 --> 00:55:48.347 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: You're
an amazing guest,

00:55:48.347 --> 00:55:52.030 align:middle line:10%
and what incredible theories
from Jonny Enoch that come

00:55:52.030 --> 00:55:55.690 align:middle line:10%
right down to the point
that we are not alone.

00:55:55.690 --> 00:55:58.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
