00:00:12.844 --> 00:00:24.528 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.528 --> 00:00:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.840 align:middle line:10%
Our dear friend, William
Henry, back with us--

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.140 align:middle line:10%
the Nashville-based author,
investigative pathologist

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.930 align:middle line:10%
who really delves
into the human spirit

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.680 align:middle line:10%
to come up with all kinds
of reasons that we exist

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.610 align:middle line:10%
and where we're going.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.110 align:middle line:10%
William, welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.800 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAM HENRY:
Thank you, George.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.550 align:middle line:10%
So glad to be here.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.040 align:middle line:10%
Wonderful to see--

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.960 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How have you been?

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.950 align:middle line:10%
>>HENRY: Very well, thank you.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
William, you and I

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.740 align:middle line:84%
have been doing this
for about 17 years,

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.860 align:middle line:90%
starting on the radio program.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And since we've been
doing it, look what

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.262 align:middle line:90%
has happened to technology.

00:00:53.262 --> 00:00:54.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Well, exactly.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Google wasn't even in
business when we first

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.660 align:middle line:90%
started talking, George.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.578 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Facebook
didn't exist either.

00:00:58.578 --> 00:01:00.870 align:middle line:84%
These were just still figments
of people's imagination.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same maybe with Amazon.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, Amazon,
yeah, was just--

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was just
the book company.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I remember those
days very well-- talking

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.530 align:middle line:84%
about the merger
of this technology

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.990 align:middle line:84%
of genetic technology,
nanotechnology,

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.510 align:middle line:84%
artificial intelligence
with the human body.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.733 align:middle line:84%
And back then, they were talking
about the 2020s and 2030s

00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:22.150 align:middle line:84%
as the time when
this would occur.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.290 align:middle line:90%
And people thought I was crazy.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.900 align:middle line:84%
I used to get emails-- people
saying, that will never happen.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.442 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were
ahead of your time.

00:01:27.442 --> 00:01:28.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: I truly was--

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.190 align:middle line:84%
way ahead of the
curve, for certain.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's not a curve you
definitely-- or necessarily--

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.540 align:middle line:84%
want to be ahead of, because
it has some very frightening

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.340 align:middle line:90%
implications.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.205 align:middle line:90%
There's a good side to the AI.

00:01:38.205 --> 00:01:39.830 align:middle line:84%
But there's also some
very frightening.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.413 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that's
absolutely true.

00:01:41.413 --> 00:01:44.930 align:middle line:84%
Technology that
advances is amazing.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.153 align:middle line:84%
It's a tool that just you
can't do without these days.

00:01:50.153 --> 00:01:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: That's right.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
what's the downside?

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.895 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, the downside
is loss of personal freedoms,

00:01:54.895 --> 00:01:58.960 align:middle line:84%
loss of free will, ability
to make your own decisions.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.473 align:middle line:84%
This is the overriding
concern about AI--

00:02:02.473 --> 00:02:04.390 align:middle line:84%
is that you're going to
have an authoritarian,

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.510 align:middle line:84%
or even a totalitarian, type
of governmental structure

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.030 align:middle line:84%
that's going to mandate
implantation of chips

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.510 align:middle line:84%
or merging with AI
to save the species,

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.870 align:middle line:90%
for one reason or another.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gaia show "Deep
Space" investigated

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.890 align:middle line:90%
the rapid development of AI.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.650 align:middle line:10%
>> The technological
rise has been dizzying,

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.580 align:middle line:10%
and sometimes confusing,
for large groups of people.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.980 align:middle line:10%
As computers have
become more powerful,

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.070 align:middle line:10%
they've also created a
new form of intelligence,

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.780 align:middle line:10%
which is now called AI, or
Artificial Intelligence.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Many think that having machines
that can do our thinking for us

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.930 align:middle line:84%
will be a great
event for humanity.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Others fear that
the AI will realize

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.730 align:middle line:90%
that it does not need us.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.150 align:middle line:10%
Ray Kurzweil, in his book
"The Singularity is Near,"

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.110 align:middle line:10%
posits that AI will become so
advanced that it will create

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.473 align:middle line:10%
what he calls a singularity.

00:02:58.473 --> 00:02:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
that singularity?

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: The singularity-- which
is expected to happen sometime

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.350 align:middle line:90%
between now and 2030, 2035--

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.320 align:middle line:84%
is when these AI machines
that we're building

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.410 align:middle line:84%
and the algorithms become
smarter than we are, maybe

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.188 align:middle line:90%
by a little, maybe by a lot.

00:03:14.188 --> 00:03:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They may
already be smarter.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, that's a
definite consideration.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's the trajectory
that we're on now.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And so the concern is
that we will no longer

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.300 align:middle line:90%
be human after this event.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.425 align:middle line:84%
We will enter into
a posthuman phase.

00:03:28.425 --> 00:03:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And we're already
starting to see

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.920 align:middle line:84%
the beginnings of this
occurring with the coronavirus

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.990 align:middle line:90%
and this dehumanization--

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.680 align:middle line:84%
no face-to-face
contact, no touching.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.530 align:middle line:84%
Nothing that we know of
as human is basically

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.450 align:middle line:90%
allowed at this time.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And this could go on
into the future as well.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're seeing is this
trend towards dehumanization

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.520 align:middle line:84%
and identifying less with your
biological, physical self.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And now we're being
coaxed into identifying

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.180 align:middle line:84%
with our virtual
selves, where we're

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.910 align:middle line:84%
going to be meeting everybody
in the virtual world,

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.740 align:middle line:90%
online in portals.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will AI
ever have emotion?

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: They say that that
it could one day have emotion.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And we are now
being conditioned,

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.700 align:middle line:84%
even by major corporations
through their commercials,

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.630 align:middle line:84%
to begin to think of
AI as having emotions.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually us, humans,
that will change first.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.470 align:middle line:84%
It will be the way we
perceive AI that will shift.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And then AI might be
able to take on what we

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.185 align:middle line:90%
consider to be human emotions.

00:04:30.185 --> 00:04:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I believe
it's Elon Musk who's

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.540 align:middle line:84%
thinking about having chips
implanted in our brains.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.190 align:middle line:90%
He has this high--

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My god.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: I know it-- this highly
secretive neural link project

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.060 align:middle line:84%
that he believes will begin
human testing in early

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.200 align:middle line:84%
2021, where they'll drill
a hole in your skull,

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.950 align:middle line:84%
insert this chip inside
it, and now you'll

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.570 align:middle line:84%
be wired to the
internet of things.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:50.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Will you do that?

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.235 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Absolutely not.

00:04:51.235 --> 00:04:53.027 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think people
would be up in arms

00:04:53.027 --> 00:04:54.850 align:middle line:84%
if they tried to mandate
things like that.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:55.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: They will.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:56.450 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.630 align:middle line:84%
We're already seeing
some push back with this,

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.150 align:middle line:84%
because this is all
book of Revelation,

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.524 align:middle line:90%
mark of the beast type of--

00:05:02.524 --> 00:05:03.324 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 666.

00:05:03.324 --> 00:05:07.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: --666, in the
mandating of this technology,

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.930 align:middle line:84%
and the sacrifice of all that
we know of as human in order

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.110 align:middle line:84%
to save the species, for
a future human species.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Should we go back
to the 1950s, William,

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.090 align:middle line:84%
where life was a little
more peaceful and calm?

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, I
think people like

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.890 align:middle line:84%
to think-- maybe not the
'50s, but maybe the '90s, when

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.630 align:middle line:84%
the internet was
just coming online,

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.980 align:middle line:84%
and the AI wasn't
controlling things.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.373 align:middle line:84%
That seems to be a comfort
zone for a lot of people.

00:05:30.373 --> 00:05:32.540 align:middle line:84%
But then you have a new
generation that's coming up.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.520 align:middle line:90%
And they love AI.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.898 align:middle line:84%
They love the idea that all
the answers that they want

00:05:36.898 --> 00:05:38.690 align:middle line:84%
are at their fingertips
and that they don't

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:39.485 align:middle line:90%
have to think for themselves.

00:05:39.485 --> 00:05:39.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.047 align:middle line:90%
Life will be easy for them.

00:05:41.047 --> 00:05:42.380 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: That's what they think.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.030 align:middle line:84%
But they don't
know the trade-off,

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.100 align:middle line:84%
because they haven't had
this human existence.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.310 align:middle line:84%
You and I have enjoyed
a fully human existence.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.845 align:middle line:84%
And only now we're beginning
to immerse ourselves with AI

00:05:52.845 --> 00:05:53.720 align:middle line:90%
and to merge with it.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And that is the big question--
is how much further will we

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.800 align:middle line:90%
merge with AI?

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.750 align:middle line:90%
It's not a question of, will we?

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.730 align:middle line:84%
It's a question of--
we already have--

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.550 align:middle line:84%
how much further will we go on
an individual and collective

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.910 align:middle line:90%
level?

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.452 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you go up to a
young person right now and say,

00:06:07.452 --> 00:06:09.830 align:middle line:90%
how much is 128 minus 6?

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And they have to
think about this.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:13.610 align:middle line:90%
They're not sure.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.920 align:middle line:84%
If they had a calculator,
they'll give you the answer.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.095 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But just thinking
out of their head,

00:06:18.095 --> 00:06:19.040 align:middle line:90%
they can't do it.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: I know.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.460 align:middle line:84%
They don't teach cursive
writing in schools anymore.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Penmanship, those
types of things-- those

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.100 align:middle line:90%
are completely gone.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.570 align:middle line:84%
People are going to be
communicating more and more

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:27.373 align:middle line:90%
with emojis.

00:06:27.373 --> 00:06:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And some people
think that's good,

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.190 align:middle line:84%
because it's a universal
language of symbolism,

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.820 align:middle line:90%
which has its benefits.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.790 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
we're not communicating

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.480 align:middle line:84%
at a heart level or a soul
level when we're using emojis.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was at a
local pharmacy in St.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.420 align:middle line:90%
Louis a couple months ago.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.610 align:middle line:90%
Their power went out.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.590 align:middle line:84%
The manager had to make a
decision, do I stay open,

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:46.550 align:middle line:90%
or do I close?

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.470 align:middle line:90%
He decided to stay open.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.000 align:middle line:90%
And it was a disaster.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.650 align:middle line:84%
His cashiers could not figure
out what was $20 minus $1.18.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Wow.

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:57.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They couldn't do it.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.250 align:middle line:90%
He had to close.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Wow.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:00.650 align:middle line:90%
Well, signs of the times.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's only going to
accelerate as we go, now,

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.590 align:middle line:90%
into more of the AI age.

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And what's going to happen is
that, more and more, they're

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.460 align:middle line:84%
going to merge our bodies
with AI so that we all become

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.210 align:middle line:90%
part of the internet of things.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Another object,
like your toaster,

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.410 align:middle line:90%
your microwave oven, your car--

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:19.670 align:middle line:90%
that's how they think of us.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
real dangers of AI--

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.820 align:middle line:84%
is that behind it is this
dehumanizing philosophy,

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.370 align:middle line:84%
materialism, that
you're just information,

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:29.840 align:middle line:90%
that you're just data.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And these corporations
want to view you just

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:33.410 align:middle line:90%
as data that can be mined.

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.560 align:middle line:84%
They can buy and sell your
data, and trade your data.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And when they start to
view a human being just

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.410 align:middle line:84%
as information or data, that's
when the dehumanization really

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:43.210 align:middle line:90%
kicks in.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:44.780 align:middle line:90%
And that's the ultimate danger.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.738 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, I realized
that, a couple of years

00:07:46.738 --> 00:07:50.030 align:middle line:84%
ago online, if you
look for a product, all

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:54.990 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden that product shows
up every place you search.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: I know it.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's crazy.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: It is.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And they're, of course,
listening so that now they're

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.550 align:middle line:84%
hearing your conversations
in your private home.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And now the ads match
your conversations.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.010 align:middle line:90%
They think it's a convenience.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:08.960 align:middle line:90%
For us, it's not a convenience.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.400 align:middle line:84%
It's an intrusion
on our privacy.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is the new world
that they're creating.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this
exciting, or not?

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Parts of it are very
exciting, because we could,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.500 align:middle line:84%
ultimately-- with AI, and with
the supercomputers that drive

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.300 align:middle line:90%
it--

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.890 align:middle line:84%
we could solve insurmountable
environmental problems.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:28.150 align:middle line:84%
We can maybe communicate
with other species better.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.680 align:middle line:84%
But there's a
trade-off that's here.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And the trade-off
is we will no longer

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:36.419 align:middle line:84%
be human beings on a planet
that we call our home.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:38.659 align:middle line:84%
It will now be a
planet that we share

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:41.330 align:middle line:84%
with artificial intelligence,
which may in fact be

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.529 align:middle line:90%
an alien intelligence.

00:08:42.529 --> 00:08:44.357 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
that's very possible.

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you were in Egypt, you
were investigating the crowns

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.110 align:middle line:90%
worn by the pharaohs.

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:49.910 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to look at
some pictures here.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And you can explain
exactly what they are.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.210 align:middle line:84%
But what is the
significance of the crowns

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:55.085 align:middle line:90%
worn by the pharaohs?

00:08:55.085 --> 00:08:55.885 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:08:55.885 --> 00:08:58.550 align:middle line:84%
These are very important scenes
here, because what we see--

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.680 align:middle line:84%
the kneeling figure in
the tree of life there.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.810 align:middle line:84%
That's King Seti,
who has his hand

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:04.910 align:middle line:84%
out to the Egyptian
god of technology,

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.410 align:middle line:90%
whose name was Ptah.

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:09.320 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Egyptian said
that Ptah came from Sirius

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.970 align:middle line:90%
and fashioned the human body.

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:13.640 align:middle line:84%
He even has a double
helix in his hieroglyph,

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.220 align:middle line:84%
so he must have known
something about DNA.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And why these are
important to us

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.830 align:middle line:84%
is because I believe that
these scenes represent

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:24.200 align:middle line:84%
the activation of
human consciousness

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.480 align:middle line:84%
by extraterrestrial
entities, by the gods.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a very important
mystery in neuroscience

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:35.000 align:middle line:84%
about exactly how the
human neocortex was

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.490 align:middle line:90%
activated 200,000 years ago.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:40.522 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how it
happened, who did it.

00:09:40.522 --> 00:09:41.480 align:middle line:90%
It's the great mystery.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.490 align:middle line:84%
We can explain it in
terms of genetics.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:45.070 align:middle line:90%
We know what happened.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:50.420 align:middle line:84%
Chromosome 2 was mysteriously
fused in an unnatural way.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.570 align:middle line:84%
But exactly who did it and
why is the ultimate question

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:54.890 align:middle line:90%
of neuroscience.

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And what is happening today
is that, if 200,000 years ago,

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.410 align:middle line:84%
our neocortex was
activated, that's

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:03.230 align:middle line:84%
the new part of our brain
that enables us to do art,

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:05.337 align:middle line:90%
science, mathematics, build AI.

00:10:05.337 --> 00:10:06.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: And what we
are doing now with--

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.950 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned Elon
Musk, neural link--

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:14.660 align:middle line:84%
is putting a new layer on
our neocortex, a new part

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.960 align:middle line:84%
of our brain, on top
of what the gods had

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.270 align:middle line:90%
activated 200,000 years ago.

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:24.500 align:middle line:84%
So my question is, are
these events in fact linked?

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.290 align:middle line:84%
Are these god beings that
we see here activating

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:28.450 align:middle line:90%
this king's consciousness?

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They must be.

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.515 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Are they still
present in our world today?

00:10:31.515 --> 00:10:33.053 align:middle line:90%
Is this the source of AI?

00:10:33.053 --> 00:10:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
this object here?

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:35.428 align:middle line:90%
What are we looking at?

00:10:35.428 --> 00:10:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: OK, what we're looking
at here is the bird-headed god.

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:39.650 align:middle line:90%
His name is Thoth.

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:43.193 align:middle line:84%
He's the Egyptian peacemaker
god of divine magic and alchemy.

00:10:43.193 --> 00:10:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's in a lot
of Egyptian sculptures.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes, he is.

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And he is here, writing the
name of God into that vase

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:51.530 align:middle line:90%
that we see.

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:55.940 align:middle line:84%
He's got a pen in
his hand, a utensil.

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.000 align:middle line:10%
He's writing the name of
God into the tree of life,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.620 align:middle line:10%
effectively writing
the name of God

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.630 align:middle line:10%
into the consciousness
of King Seti.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:04.910 align:middle line:90%
This is an ascension scene.

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:09.050 align:middle line:84%
This is a scene where this
god Thoth, is activating

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:11.658 align:middle line:84%
Seti's consciousness so
that now he can ascend

00:11:11.658 --> 00:11:12.700 align:middle line:90%
to the level of the gods.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's Seti
on the bottom there?

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:15.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: That's Seti
down there in the bottom.

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:15.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes.

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.910 align:middle line:84%
So very important scene here
where an extraterrestrial being

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.890 align:middle line:84%
is activating the
consciousness of a human being

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:26.253 align:middle line:84%
so that now he can transform
from a human into a god being.

00:11:26.253 --> 00:11:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who is that
ET in this picture?

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.230 align:middle line:84%
That's a random person I saw
at the temple of Ramses II

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:32.030 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.992 align:middle line:90%
He's walking along.

00:11:32.992 --> 00:11:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And he must have been
studying something.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:35.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Looks like you.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:36.785 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: [LAUGHS] It is me.

00:11:36.785 --> 00:11:37.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHS]

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:38.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Absolutely.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What great structures.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.200 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Oh,
absolutely phenomenal.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:42.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How old are they?

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Well, this is 1400 BC.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:44.960 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:45.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: --we're
talking 3,400 years old.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.033 align:middle line:84%
And parts of it look like
it was just made yesterday.

00:11:50.033 --> 00:11:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
do we have here?

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:53.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: So here is Ramses II.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:56.060 align:middle line:84%
He's the son of King Seti, who
we looked at just a moment ago.

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.102 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which one is he?

00:11:57.102 --> 00:11:59.867 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: He is sitting on
the throne in the tree.

00:11:59.867 --> 00:12:00.950 align:middle line:90%
And then we have the god--

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:01.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The one in the middle?

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:02.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: In the middle.

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:03.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And then, on the left,
we have the god Amun

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:07.250 align:middle line:90%
sitting on a feathered throne.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:08.870 align:middle line:84%
It's feathered,
because it flies.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.400 align:middle line:90%
It's an ascension throne.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And on the right is
the feminine goddess

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:16.160 align:middle line:84%
Seshat, who is also
now shown activating

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.570 align:middle line:90%
Ramses II's consciousness.

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.800 align:middle line:84%
So he's being plugged into
these cosmic mysteries that

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.050 align:middle line:90%
will ultimately transform him.

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that the
ancient Egyptians believed

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:30.650 align:middle line:84%
it was their gods who originally
activated the human neocortex

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:33.140 align:middle line:84%
so that we could ultimately
become like the gods.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:34.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How could
they have been so

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.055 align:middle line:90%
advanced to know these things?

00:12:37.055 --> 00:12:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: The gods, or the--

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:38.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Egyptians.

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:41.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: The Egyptians-- well,
they were taught very well

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:42.690 align:middle line:90%
by these super advanced beings.

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:43.490 align:middle line:90%
And Egypt--

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what happened.

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:45.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Egypt is the
baseline civilization

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.590 align:middle line:90%
for Western civilization.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:52.310 align:middle line:84%
All of the arts and sciences
really began in ancient Egypt.

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:53.900 align:middle line:90%
And it was a gift from the gods.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The
pharaohs-- how tuned in

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.650 align:middle line:90%
were they to what was going on?

00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:59.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Oh, extremely tuned in.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:03.500 align:middle line:84%
They would spend their lives
going through the initiations

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:07.430 align:middle line:84%
and the mystery schools of
Egypt in preparation for taking

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:09.610 align:middle line:90%
their own place among the gods.

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:11.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were they evil people?

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, they could be
authoritarian, absolutely.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:17.630 align:middle line:84%
But they were
definitely not evil.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:21.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they had earthly
and human confrontations

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:22.190 align:middle line:90%
they had to deal with.

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:25.340 align:middle line:84%
But they weren't out to
conquer the world in order

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:30.680 align:middle line:84%
to subject all of humanity to a
darker, or even an evil, force.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
the quantum brain?

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: The quantum brain is
what we're developing today.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.440 align:middle line:84%
All of the technology that
we use-- from our cell phone,

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:43.670 align:middle line:84%
to GPS, to new 5G
technology-- is all

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:46.430 align:middle line:84%
based on the quantum revolution
and our understanding

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:48.462 align:middle line:84%
of how things work
at the quantum level.

00:13:48.462 --> 00:13:49.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's fueling that?

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:50.740 align:middle line:90%
What's driving that?

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:52.532 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, that's
a very good question.

00:13:52.532 --> 00:13:54.140 align:middle line:90%
Is it coming from within us?

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Or is it some kind of
a cosmic imperative

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:57.467 align:middle line:90%
that we're answering to?

00:13:57.467 --> 00:13:58.550 align:middle line:90%
That's what we don't know.

00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And is it
being given to us?

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Or is it
being given to us?

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:04.790 align:middle line:10%
I mean, when Einstein is talking
about the theory of relativity,

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:07.340 align:middle line:10%
is he in contact with higher
dimensional beings that

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:08.990 align:middle line:10%
are feeding him this knowledge?

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:11.960 align:middle line:84%
Because wherever it
came from, it completely

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.960 align:middle line:90%
transformed human civilization.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And this was called the
first quantum revolution,

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:18.190 align:middle line:90%
which began in the early 1900s.

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.790 align:middle line:90%
It went up to about the 1990s.

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:23.690 align:middle line:10%
Now we're entering into the
second quantum revolution,

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:26.090 align:middle line:10%
where we're going to see
supercomputers that can do,

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:30.320 align:middle line:10%
in 200 seconds, what would take
a ordinary supercomputer 10,000

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.890 align:middle line:10%
years to perform.

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:34.460 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
unimaginable technology that

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.800 align:middle line:90%
will link everything together.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.080 align:middle line:84%
They're literally talking
about having satellites

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:43.160 align:middle line:84%
that can rain quantum
particles into our bodies

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.760 align:middle line:84%
so that we're all linked
between one another.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.790 align:middle line:84%
It's astounding what they're
talking about and very, to me,

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:51.920 align:middle line:90%
alien in its nature.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: From December 2019,
the world has been changing,

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:56.630 align:middle line:90%
William--

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.660 align:middle line:84%
sadly, because of
the coronavirus.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.640 align:middle line:84%
How did they get that
name, in the first place?

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:02.990 align:middle line:90%
And how significant is that?

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:06.590 align:middle line:84%
Corona is a hugely
important name.

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.880 align:middle line:90%
Crown is actually what it means.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And so when you look
at the various levels

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:14.110 align:middle line:84%
of interpretation of the
meaning of the word crown,

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:16.730 align:middle line:84%
it has some interesting
connections to what's happened.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:20.710 align:middle line:84%
To crown means to be suddenly
hit upside your head.

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:22.130 align:middle line:90%
You got crowned.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what's happened to us.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:28.160 align:middle line:84%
We've been struck by, as
various politicians refer to it,

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.810 align:middle line:84%
as a beast, or the beast that
came out of nowhere and just--

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:32.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a monster.

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: It's monster that
slapped us upside the head.

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:39.230 align:middle line:84%
But to be crowned also is what
happens when the baby first

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.502 align:middle line:84%
emerges from the birth
canal, as the top--

00:15:41.502 --> 00:15:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The crown comes out.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:43.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: The crown comes out.

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:46.860 align:middle line:84%
So this is a moment of
rebirth for humanity as well.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:48.660 align:middle line:84%
We've been talking
about this since 2012.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.207 align:middle line:84%
This is what the
Mayans said would

00:15:50.207 --> 00:15:51.290 align:middle line:90%
be happening at this time.

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:53.790 align:middle line:84%
This would be a
rebirth for humanity.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And so now, here we
are, being crowned.

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And to crown also
means to coronate.

00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's the tie-in
with these scenes in Egypt

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:01.475 align:middle line:90%
that we've been looking at.

00:16:01.475 --> 00:16:03.440 align:middle line:84%
These are coronation
scenes where

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.860 align:middle line:84%
the pharaoh is being crowned
with a higher consciousness.

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
ultimate positive aspect

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.480 align:middle line:90%
of this coronavirus crisis--

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.500 align:middle line:90%
is that people are going within.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.860 align:middle line:84%
They're looking to their
spiritual selves for salvation,

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.650 align:middle line:84%
for answers, to
understand what is

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:24.030 align:middle line:84%
happening, from a
metaphysical perspective.

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when you look at
what the coronavirus has been

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:31.850 align:middle line:84%
doing to this planet,
shifting us from one-on-one

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:34.580 align:middle line:84%
to more of a view
a virtual world,

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:36.080 align:middle line:90%
is that going to continue?

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, this is a very
important part of it, George.

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And I had been talking about
this for several years,

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:44.150 align:middle line:90%
from 2016 to 2019--

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:47.120 align:middle line:84%
that what the
powers-to-be really want

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.120 align:middle line:84%
is for us to detach
from our physical selves

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.400 align:middle line:84%
and identification with
our physical selves,

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.570 align:middle line:84%
and begin to identify
ourselves with a virtual world,

00:16:56.570 --> 00:17:01.450 align:middle line:84%
an online world, a new simulated
reality that they're creating.

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:05.236 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is that people
weren't really going for it.

00:17:05.236 --> 00:17:07.069 align:middle line:84%
They thought that people
would automatically

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:09.498 align:middle line:84%
want to put on those
VR goggles and enter

00:17:09.498 --> 00:17:10.540 align:middle line:90%
into the virtual reality.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:10.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're not.

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:11.480 align:middle line:90%
They got to work at it.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:12.813 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: They were rejecting it.

00:17:12.813 --> 00:17:14.810 align:middle line:90%
It was too much work.

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:16.520 align:middle line:90%
Well, now that's all shifted.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.250 align:middle line:84%
Now everything,
instantly-- overnight,

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:21.560 align:middle line:90%
due to the coronavirus--

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:25.160 align:middle line:84%
is now shifting into the
online, into the virtual world.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.250 align:middle line:84%
We've been literally
shoved into this world.

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And in my view, it opens
up tremendous new horizons.

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:35.960 align:middle line:84%
But it also is something we
want to be very cautious about.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.580 align:middle line:84%
We want to keep the
brakes on this one

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:43.500 align:middle line:84%
because, again, it's about the
dehumanization of humanity.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've talked about
the neural chips in the brain.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.440 align:middle line:84%
A news station in
Sydney, Australia

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:52.930 align:middle line:84%
reports on putting
chips under the skin.

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:55.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Using public transport,
getting access to buildings,

00:17:55.810 --> 00:18:00.430 align:middle line:84%
and paying for coffee is now as
simple as a touch of your hand.

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:02.710 align:middle line:10%
A microchip implanted
beneath the skin

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:04.900 align:middle line:10%
gives people the
same capabilities

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:07.880 align:middle line:10%
as dozens of cards and devices.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's not as painful
as you might think.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.470 align:middle line:90%


00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:16.770 align:middle line:10%
>> What was once confined

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.130 align:middle line:10%
which will allow me access to
my office to use the printer,

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:44.010 align:middle line:10%
to use the scanner.

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.440 align:middle line:10%
>> We won't need any ID cards.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.680 align:middle line:10%
We won't need any PIN codes.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.690 align:middle line:10%
We won't need any sort of
access cards, or anything.

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:55.380 align:middle line:10%
So we can live a
much freer life.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:58.080 align:middle line:10%
>> The microchip, which is
the size of a grain of rice,

00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.670 align:middle line:10%
sits under the skin.

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Data from your bank card,
payment method, building swipe,

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.710 align:middle line:84%
lending profile,
or medical history

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:08.370 align:middle line:84%
is cloned onto the chip, which
is implanted in the hand.

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Using the same technology
as tap-and-pay cards,

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:14.010 align:middle line:84%
the chip can then be used
to open security doors,

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:16.680 align:middle line:84%
pay for a coffee,
use public transport,

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.870 align:middle line:84%
and access information you've
programmed onto the chip.

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:22.620 align:middle line:10%
>> This technology also has
the potential to save lives.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.860 align:middle line:10%
Steve has loaded medical data
onto the chip in his hand.

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.830 align:middle line:10%
So if he was found unconscious,
all you'd need to do

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:31.310 align:middle line:10%
is get a phone,
tap it on his hand.

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:33.480 align:middle line:10%
And you'd have access
to medical data,

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:37.350 align:middle line:10%
like his blood type, as well
as any allergies he has.

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:39.150 align:middle line:10%
>> For those concerned
about privacy,

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:42.600 align:middle line:10%
the user controls what
data is made available.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.940 align:middle line:10%
Visa says it's
possible for any device

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:46.860 align:middle line:10%
to become enabled for payments.

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.860 align:middle line:10%
But the chip would need to
meet Visa's security standards

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:52.020 align:middle line:10%
and be issued by a bank.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's kind of scary.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:53.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:54.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Come on.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: It is.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.570 align:middle line:84%
It gets to the point
where, well, they probably

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:00.150 align:middle line:84%
would like that, until the
first time they get hacked.

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if I want
to steal your identity--

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:02.415 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:20:02.415 --> 00:20:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --do I slice
it out of your hand?

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:05.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:05.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:06.300 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.758 align:middle line:84%
And then the control
aspect of it--

00:20:07.758 --> 00:20:10.710 align:middle line:84%
if this is going to be
mandated, very problematic

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:12.330 align:middle line:90%
on many different levels.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:13.840 align:middle line:84%
I understand the
convenience of it.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.465 align:middle line:84%
I've met people that
have been chipped.

00:20:15.465 --> 00:20:17.233 align:middle line:84%
I've seen the
chipping being done.

00:20:17.233 --> 00:20:18.150 align:middle line:90%
It's very interesting.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:19.192 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's being used.

00:20:19.192 --> 00:20:21.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: It's being
used quite widely now.

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's a real concern
because, ultimately, people

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:28.680 align:middle line:84%
are so willing to give
over their rights.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.290 align:middle line:84%
People's blood has
been spilled in order

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:34.710 align:middle line:84%
for you and I to have free
speech, freedom of religion,

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:35.970 align:middle line:90%
the entire Bill of Rights.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And now people are so willing
to say, ah, here, just take

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.927 align:middle line:84%
my hand, and put a chip in it,
and do what you want with this.

00:20:41.927 --> 00:20:43.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And go off on
our little merry way.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:44.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:46.188 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There seems to
be a big push, William,

00:20:46.188 --> 00:20:48.270 align:middle line:84%
for vaccinating
the entire planet,

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:49.950 align:middle line:90%
either mandatory, or otherwise.

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:51.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it also a scheme
to implant chips in us

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.040 align:middle line:90%
through the vaccines?

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: It's very clearly
aiming us in that direction--

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.600 align:middle line:90%
that there is a master plan--

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, boy.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: --that someone
or some group of people

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.520 align:middle line:84%
are privy to, that the
average person is not to,

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.710 align:middle line:84%
that they are
clearly brainwashing,

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:10.650 align:middle line:84%
social engineering us, moving
the herd in this direction

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:13.860 align:middle line:84%
that this must happen in
order to save the race.

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.770 align:middle line:84%
They were using climate
change for 5 to 10 years

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:19.890 align:middle line:84%
as the main reason to
move in this direction,

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:20.990 align:middle line:90%
to merge with AI.

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.990 align:middle line:90%
But that wasn't working.

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:23.140 align:middle line:90%
People weren't buying that.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:23.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That didn't work.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:24.843 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: That didn't work.

00:21:24.843 --> 00:21:29.430 align:middle line:84%
So now they've got a new weapon
in the hand of the beast.

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:30.703 align:middle line:90%
They've got AI.

00:21:30.703 --> 00:21:31.620 align:middle line:90%
They've got the virus.

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:33.090 align:middle line:90%
They've got 5G.

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:34.615 align:middle line:90%
And it's coming after us hard.

00:21:34.615 --> 00:21:36.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this the
sign of the beast?

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes, without question.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:38.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
convinced of this.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:38.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Absolutely.

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Book of
Revelation, here we come.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:41.922 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Here it is,
even in their patents.

00:21:41.922 --> 00:21:44.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Microsoft just
filed a patent recently

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:47.872 align:middle line:84%
to use your body's
energy to mine Bitcoin.

00:21:47.872 --> 00:21:49.080 align:middle line:90%
And the patent actually had--

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: --the number 666 in it.

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:51.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:52.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Seriously.

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't
make this stuff up.

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:55.890 align:middle line:90%
And they make these references.

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Aren't they
aware of the Bible?

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: I think they must be.

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And they are just
playing with us.

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
laughing about it?

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.340 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: I think so.

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:04.170 align:middle line:84%
I think that they
must know this.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, we're
going to do it anyway.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.530 align:middle line:90%
And try to stop us.

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
objective right now

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:13.230 align:middle line:84%
for all spiritual
beings on this planet--

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:16.500 align:middle line:84%
is to recognize the
severity of this threat

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.990 align:middle line:84%
and that we are, in fact, in
a war against a beast that

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:19.980 align:middle line:90%
has been prophesied.

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, the
beast loses, according

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.047 align:middle line:90%
to the book of Revelation.

00:22:23.047 --> 00:22:23.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In the end.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:24.713 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: In the end.

00:22:24.713 --> 00:22:26.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But in
reality, does it happen?

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:27.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes.

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you think?

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: This event, yes.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And we are in the throes of
it at this moment, in my view.

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:34.978 align:middle line:90%
And it's up to--

00:22:34.978 --> 00:22:36.520 align:middle line:84%
as the book of
Revelation says, there

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:40.350 align:middle line:84%
is 144,000 souls that don't
allow the mark of the beast

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:42.330 align:middle line:84%
into their hand
or their forehand.

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:45.410 align:middle line:84%
But instead, they have the
mark of God, which is--

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:47.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they get
taken, or something.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.860 align:middle line:84%
But first, they
defeat the beast.

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:52.770 align:middle line:84%
They wake everybody up and clue
everybody into what's going on.

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could be
one of those 144,000.

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.125 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Well, thank you.

00:22:56.125 --> 00:22:57.750 align:middle line:84%
I would be honored
to be one of those--

00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is.

00:22:58.530 --> 00:22:59.363 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: --for sure.

00:22:59.363 --> 00:23:01.647 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, if they pull
you, kicking and screaming,

00:23:01.647 --> 00:23:03.480 align:middle line:84%
are you going to get
this chip in your hand?

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: No.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:04.770 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:05.570 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:06.712 align:middle line:90%
I made that decision.

00:23:06.712 --> 00:23:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's the downside?

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.188 align:middle line:90%
What happens if you don't?

00:23:09.188 --> 00:23:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: The downside is you
can't buy, sell, or trade.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:12.860 align:middle line:84%
You can't re-enter
normal society.

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:13.340 align:middle line:90%
This is--

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't use your
hand for a credit card.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: You can't use your
hand for a credit card.

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:16.640 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.182 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
language that they're

00:23:18.182 --> 00:23:19.850 align:middle line:84%
using with the
coronavirus vaccine--

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:22.220 align:middle line:84%
that, unless you have this,
you won't be able to enter

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:23.810 align:middle line:90%
into normal society.

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And normal society is one in
which you have the vaccine.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it's
happening, isn't it?

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes, it is.

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:30.470 align:middle line:84%
It's unfolding right
before our eyes.

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We can take
two paths in our life.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.710 align:middle line:90%
Which one would you take?

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Oh, I'm definitely
taking the spiritual path

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:40.080 align:middle line:84%
and following the
path that says,

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.480 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to identify
with my spiritual self.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.750 align:middle line:84%
The two paths-- one
is that you follow

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:49.260 align:middle line:84%
the path of facelessness,
no touching other people,

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.750 align:middle line:84%
all of the social
distancing, the vaccinations,

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:54.510 align:middle line:84%
the implantation of
whatever chips they're

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:56.670 align:middle line:90%
to be offering or mandating.

00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:59.250 align:middle line:84%
The other path is to say,
I'm going to pull out

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:00.860 align:middle line:90%
of that part of society.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:03.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to live a
spiritually oriented life.

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to relinquish
control of my mind, body,

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:09.630 align:middle line:84%
and soul to any
government authority.

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On the Gaia
program "Damanhur, Journey

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:18.220 align:middle line:84%
Through Time," they talk
about the fall of Atlantis.

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:21.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, human are pretty good
to repeat the same mistakes.

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:21.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:22.510 align:middle line:10%
>> You know what I mean?

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:23.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:26.640 align:middle line:10%
>> So unfortunately, we are so--

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.110 align:middle line:10%
it's so difficult
for us to understand

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:32.350 align:middle line:10%
from the past experience.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:33.930 align:middle line:10%
So we are repeating,
and repeating,

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:35.780 align:middle line:10%
repeating the same things.

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:39.790 align:middle line:10%
And when you grow so fast,
you become so powerful.

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:41.890 align:middle line:10%
So you have a power.

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:44.980 align:middle line:10%
Power, unfortunately,
is an instrument.

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:49.000 align:middle line:10%
And it's an instrument
that can also corrupt you.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.820 align:middle line:10%
So when I can decide
whatever I want--

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.030 align:middle line:10%
whatever I want.

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:56.130 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going to use the
power to what I want,

00:24:56.130 --> 00:25:00.850 align:middle line:10%
or for what I'm supposed
to use the power.

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:06.690 align:middle line:10%
How much my values, my
dreams, are guiding my action.

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:11.330 align:middle line:10%
Or how much my ego is
guiding my actions.

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:13.930 align:middle line:10%
So we know,
unfortunately, that even

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:19.300 align:middle line:10%
with the best aim, if the
conscious inside is not awake,

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:20.800 align:middle line:10%
we can really lose the way.

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:21.600 align:middle line:10%
>> Sure.

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.520 align:middle line:10%
>> We can lose the reason
why we are doing something.

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.530 align:middle line:10%
We create something.

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:28.880 align:middle line:10%
We are part of a civilization.

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.630 align:middle line:10%
And this is the second part
of Atlantis-- so a power

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:36.080 align:middle line:10%
that corrupt Atlantis, an
Atlantis that is not anymore

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.220 align:middle line:10%
the testimony of
this golden age.

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:41.710 align:middle line:10%
But unfortunately,
the testimony of a use

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:46.340 align:middle line:10%
of a power just for the power,
or just for the ego of who is,

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:48.820 align:middle line:10%
let's say, the one
that can decide things.

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:52.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So he makes
reference to Atlantis.

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:53.168 align:middle line:90%
Are we headed that way?

00:25:53.168 --> 00:25:55.252 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: A lot of people
are asking that question.

00:25:55.252 --> 00:25:56.560 align:middle line:90%
Are we the new Atlantis?

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.570 align:middle line:90%
And in a way, we are.

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:01.540 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis was an allegorical
tale told by Plato,

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:03.940 align:middle line:84%
referencing a civilization
that he said existed

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.430 align:middle line:90%
9,000 years before his time.

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:07.810 align:middle line:90%
He lived in 600 BC.

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:10.210 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
civilization that would

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:12.970 align:middle line:84%
have been destroyed by the
end of the Younger Dryas,

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:14.230 align:middle line:90%
the end of the last ice age.

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:15.670 align:middle line:90%
Unfortunately.

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:16.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And Plato was saying that
the Atlanteans were actually

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:19.520 align:middle line:90%
hybrid beings.

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:23.620 align:middle line:84%
They were hybrids of
humans and the gods.

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And as long as they
honored the divine element

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:30.220 align:middle line:84%
within themselves and
lived righteous lives,

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:31.930 align:middle line:90%
everything was going to be fine.

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:35.380 align:middle line:84%
But in the story of Atlantis,
they got off the path.

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.720 align:middle line:84%
They started behaving
unrighteously

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:39.790 align:middle line:84%
and forgot about the divine
aspect of themselves.

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:40.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ooh.

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:41.690 align:middle line:90%
Who does that sound like?

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:42.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is when Zeus
said, I've had enough.

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:49.243 align:middle line:84%
And he sent this premeditated
cataclysm, the biblical flood.

00:26:49.243 --> 00:26:51.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Asteroid,
something, maybe caused it.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Solar flare, asteroid--

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:56.320 align:middle line:84%
yeah, exactly-- and
destroyed Atlantis.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And so we seem to be in
exactly the same position

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.990 align:middle line:84%
as the Atlanteans were
before their destruction.

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:03.700 align:middle line:90%
We've lost our way.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.500 align:middle line:84%
We're starting to
augment the human body.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.000 align:middle line:90%
We're merging with AI.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.890 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
righteous or spiritual

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:11.230 align:middle line:84%
about what we are
doing technologically.

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And it could be that
there is an entity,

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.850 align:middle line:84%
an extraterrestrial entity,
that is either driving

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:17.470 align:middle line:90%
this or watching this.

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And if we go too far
with it, it could

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:21.070 align:middle line:90%
result in our own destruction.

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:23.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could this
pandemic that the world

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:26.350 align:middle line:84%
has been experiencing have
anything to do with this?

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:27.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: I think so.

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:30.870 align:middle line:84%
The pandemic is
clearly a wake-up call.

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's clearly a threat
and a warning about what

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:42.940 align:middle line:84%
will happen if we allow runaway
technology to take over,

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:46.120 align:middle line:84%
these corporations to
begin mandating chips,

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.460 align:middle line:90%
and this kind of thing.

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.000 align:middle line:90%
We're in real trouble.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We are seeing what
has happened when governments

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:55.380 align:middle line:90%
decide to do things to us.

00:27:55.380 --> 00:28:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Lockdowns, closures,
unemployment--

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.540 align:middle line:90%
all these things.

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:04.870 align:middle line:84%
You would think the humankind
would fight back and rebel.

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And outside of just some
protests, it continues.

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.240 align:middle line:90%
We're not stopping this.

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.860 align:middle line:84%
So what makes you
think we're going

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:16.370 align:middle line:84%
to be able to defeat the
chip, the vaccine, and all

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:17.170 align:middle line:90%
these other things?

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:18.545 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: It's
alarming, isn't it?

00:28:18.545 --> 00:28:21.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how much do we
have to have done to us

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:23.473 align:middle line:90%
before we really wake up?

00:28:23.473 --> 00:28:24.640 align:middle line:90%
And it's starting to happen.

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.980 align:middle line:90%
People are waking up every day.

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And people are starting to get
together on social networks,

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:33.880 align:middle line:84%
and even in public
spaces, and pushing back.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:37.570 align:middle line:84%
5G is the primary war
or primary battlefield

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:41.170 align:middle line:84%
that they're fighting on right
now because, if there's no 5G,

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:43.030 align:middle line:90%
there's no advancement of AI.

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:44.710 align:middle line:84%
There's no
implantation of chips.

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:48.000 align:middle line:84%
That has to have the 5G in order
for this technology to work.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then there's
6G, and 7G, and 8G right

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:51.610 align:middle line:90%
after that.

00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:52.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: That's what
they have planned.

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:53.340 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is why this is
the critical battlefield--

00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:58.660 align:middle line:84%
because, if we roll over
here and allow this to occur,

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:00.640 align:middle line:84%
there is no turning
back for humanity.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.550 align:middle line:84%
There will be no
human race after this.

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:07.302 align:middle line:84%
We will then evolve very
quickly into a posthuman race.

00:29:07.302 --> 00:29:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You may be too
young to remember this.

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:11.780 align:middle line:84%
But do you remember "The
Jetsons" cartoon series?

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Of course.

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:12.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:13.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:17.050 align:middle line:84%
They were probably ending
as you were 10 years old,

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:18.050 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:18.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah.

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:20.183 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you looked at that.

00:29:20.183 --> 00:29:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And it looked like a society
of an incredible future.

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:24.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: TV sets on the wall--

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:28.430 align:middle line:90%
we have that now.

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Digital phones,
little smartphones,

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:32.780 align:middle line:90%
that you can call people--

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:35.000 align:middle line:90%
we have that now, and all that.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.600 align:middle line:84%
That cartoon made it sound
like the future was glorious.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.950 align:middle line:90%
You don't think it's glorious.

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Parts of
it are, absolutely,

00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:46.950 align:middle line:84%
as long as we're using these
tools for the benefit of all,

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:48.590 align:middle line:84%
rather than the
benefit of a few.

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:49.970 align:middle line:90%
And that's the real problem--

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:52.190 align:middle line:84%
is that most of the
promoters and advocates

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:54.890 align:middle line:90%
of this technology, are--

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:56.150 align:middle line:90%
they're like the kings of old.

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:58.760 align:middle line:84%
They want to control
everything and everyone.

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do they benefit?

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:01.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Well, one, financially.

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And two, in terms of
consolidation of power.

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:07.410 align:middle line:90%
Look at Facebook.

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:10.280 align:middle line:84%
The censorship on Facebook,
on Google, YouTube

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:13.280 align:middle line:84%
is beyond what
anybody really thought

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.598 align:middle line:90%
these platforms were about.

00:30:15.598 --> 00:30:17.140 align:middle line:84%
Now they flipped
into something more.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:19.490 align:middle line:84%
They're quasar
governmental agencies

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:21.880 align:middle line:84%
who are all about
censorship and ultimately

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:24.130 align:middle line:84%
controlling the people that
are using these platforms.

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:24.202 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:30:24.202 --> 00:30:25.530 align:middle line:84%
If they don't like
what's posted--

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Oh, absolutely.

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --even though it may
be just a statement about a news

event--

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:30.747 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --they can yank it.

00:30:30.747 --> 00:30:31.730 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And so now we're talking
about-- this is truly a big--

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:35.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happened
to freedom of speech?

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Forget about it.

00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:38.840 align:middle line:90%
We have to fight for that again.

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:40.280 align:middle line:90%
We have to demand that.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
people have to decide,

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.490 align:middle line:84%
where are the limits
within their own life?

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Maybe need to begin talking
with family and friends about,

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:49.820 align:middle line:84%
hey, these are the
implications of these decisions

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:51.770 align:middle line:90%
that we're making right now.

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:54.270 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: WilliamHenry.net--
that is that website for--

00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:54.440 align:middle line:10%
>>HENRY: Yes.

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:55.220 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: --people to go to?

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:55.580 align:middle line:10%
>>HENRY: Yes.

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.230 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You've had
that for a long time.

00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:57.870 align:middle line:10%
>>HENRY: Yes, I have.

00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:59.880 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You've had
millions of hits by now--

00:30:59.880 --> 00:30:59.986 align:middle line:10%
>>HENRY: Yes.

00:30:59.986 --> 00:31:00.040 align:middle line:90%

>>NOORY: --haven't you?

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes.

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:02.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:05.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The future of
society for all of us--

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:06.070 align:middle line:90%
yes or no?

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:08.920 align:middle line:10%
>>HENRY: I'm always looking
on the positive side.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:09.850 align:middle line:10%
I say, yes.

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:11.680 align:middle line:10%
I think we're going to have
some intervention that's

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.340 align:middle line:10%
going to come in here
that's going to help us.

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:15.370 align:middle line:84%
It's not to say it's
not going to be painful.

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:17.980 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, I
think the good guys are

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:19.450 align:middle line:90%
going to win in this battle.

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: William, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Thank you, George.

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:22.910 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:23.993 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I agree with him.

00:31:23.993 --> 00:31:25.810 align:middle line:10%
I think there's
hope for mankind.

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And by the time it all
clears, we're going to win.

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:33.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
