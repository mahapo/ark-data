00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.970 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to another edition

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.770 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.840 align:middle line:10%
I am George Noory and our
special guest is Freddy Silva.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Freddy is a researcher of
ancient history and a noted

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.500 align:middle line:90%
author.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.310 align:middle line:84%
His latest book is called "The
Lost Art of Resurrection."

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.910 align:middle line:90%
Freddy, welcome to the program.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY SILVA:
Thank you, George.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's good to see you.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I like what you've
done with the place, by the way.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's been
a while, my friend.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.531 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now tell me
about being an author.

00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:43.720 align:middle line:84%
How did you get involved in
investigating ancient history?

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.340 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: In authorship--

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.230 align:middle line:10%
I am of the opinion
that people kind of

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.784 align:middle line:10%
are born to do something.

00:00:48.784 --> 00:00:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes,
they are very lucky

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.854 align:middle line:84%
and they learned about
it early on in life.

00:00:52.854 --> 00:00:54.520 align:middle line:84%
I was drawing pyramids
when I was three.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.644 align:middle line:84%
And then I got sidetracked
into the material world.

00:00:56.644 --> 00:00:58.810 align:middle line:90%
I tried to become a rock star.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.480 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize it was
going to be learning

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.430 align:middle line:90%
about large, upright rocks.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.070 align:middle line:84%
So, after years of living
in the material world,

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.800 align:middle line:84%
I decided to get a life and
actually go and investigate

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.690 align:middle line:84%
the things that matter
most about life.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You love
what you're doing.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: I adore what I do.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.176 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, you
have been to Egypt.

00:01:15.176 --> 00:01:16.850 align:middle line:90%
You have been everywhere.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.480 align:middle line:84%
What's been the most
fascinating place for you?

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, god.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.190 align:middle line:84%
I just came back from Peru,
Saksaywaman, the places in Peru

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.580 align:middle line:90%
which far outdate the Inca.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And they used megalithic
construction methods

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.780 align:middle line:84%
which are beyond anything
you've ever seen.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you convinced that
the ancients had more knowledge

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.690 align:middle line:90%
than we think they had?

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They certainly managed
to lift a lot of big rocks

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.485 align:middle line:90%
without the aid of cranes.

00:01:42.485 --> 00:01:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So I say
they knew something

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.500 align:middle line:84%
about the laws of nature, which
they had the complete power of.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did we
lose that knowledge?

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I think we go
through these cycles,

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.280 align:middle line:84%
where we sort of learn a
few things about nature,

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.400 align:middle line:84%
and then we basically
undo ourselves as usual,

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.100 align:middle line:84%
pull the rug from under our own
feet, and then we start again.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.630 align:middle line:84%
It's like each cycle has its
own particular peculiarity,

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.540 align:middle line:90%
if you like.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.581 align:middle line:84%
And then we're supposed
to master certain things,

00:02:06.581 --> 00:02:08.685 align:middle line:84%
forget about them, and
move on to another subject.

00:02:08.685 --> 00:02:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Freddy,
your latest work

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.610 align:middle line:84%
is called "The Lost
Art of Resurrection."

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.902 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:02:13.902 --> 00:02:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, there
was a fun little thing

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.860 align:middle line:84%
I was working on while I
was researching temples.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.780 align:middle line:84%
I kept coming across
these phrases, where

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.490 align:middle line:84%
there were initiates
who were declared

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.200 align:middle line:84%
risen or risen from the dead, or
people who were declared living

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.000 align:middle line:90%
and the dead.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.749 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, this
sounds very Christian,

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:30.160 align:middle line:84%
except these sites had nothing
to do with Christianity.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.970 align:middle line:90%
So where's all this coming from?

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And I began to research the
concept of the [NON-ENGLISH]

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.800 align:middle line:84%
and recognized that the concept
of the living, or the risen,

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.350 align:middle line:90%
goes back to at least 3000 BC.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And in one case, in the Indus
Valley, to 6000 BC to a god-man

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.949 align:middle line:84%
called Mithras upon whose
story Jesus was crafted.

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Much older
than most people think.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: A lot older and
much more empowering.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And it has nothing to
do with dead people,

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.530 align:middle line:84%
at least physically,
and certainly no

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.000 align:middle line:90%
one ever got nailed to a cross.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And nobody ever got back
from a physical death

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.660 align:middle line:90%
and came back to life.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.250 align:middle line:90%
It was all metaphorical.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You just
mentioned initiates.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.882 align:middle line:90%
Initiation-- what is that?

00:03:06.882 --> 00:03:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, initiation
to most people,

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.570 align:middle line:84%
when you bring up the
word, is something

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.790 align:middle line:84%
that happens to you when
you bend over backwards

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.082 align:middle line:84%
and you get hit
with a baseball bat,

00:03:15.082 --> 00:03:16.540 align:middle line:84%
but no, it's actually
very serious.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.914 align:middle line:84%
It's actually
about-- it actually

00:03:17.914 --> 00:03:19.750 align:middle line:90%
means becoming conscious.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And when you understand
that, there's

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.430 align:middle line:84%
obviously big spiritual
components to the actual word.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was
that certain people who

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.750 align:middle line:84%
were very curious
about becoming much

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.670 align:middle line:84%
bigger than the
sum of their parts

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.820 align:middle line:84%
were taken aside into mystery
schools and were actually--

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.610 align:middle line:84%
went through a process
where, let's say,

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.920 align:middle line:84%
their electrical system
was raised bit by bit

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.100 align:middle line:84%
by bit by bit, which was
part of a secret techniques

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.920 align:middle line:84%
of essentially
extending the awareness

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.155 align:middle line:90%
of your physical body.

00:03:46.155 --> 00:03:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And when they did this,
they became much more aware

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.320 align:middle line:84%
of the subtle world
and to a point

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.320 align:middle line:84%
where they could actually see
through different realities

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.610 align:middle line:84%
and bring back information
into the real world.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.060 align:middle line:84%
So that was part of the
secrets of why initiation

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.920 align:middle line:90%
was so well maintained.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then when you
bring in the word resurrection,

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.750 align:middle line:84%
most people will think
we're talking about Jesus.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:06.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But you're not.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: No.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.801 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
one thing that I was

00:04:09.801 --> 00:04:11.560 align:middle line:90%
particularly interested about--

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.600 align:middle line:90%
was the story of Jesus unique?

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.250 align:middle line:84%
Was it considered
to be a metaphor?

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.124 align:middle line:84%
Because the one thing
I learned very quickly,

00:04:17.124 --> 00:04:19.810 align:middle line:84%
and having been raised
as a Catholic initially,

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.780 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to ask why was the
Catholic church exterminating

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.410 align:middle line:90%
all the gnostic Christians?

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.910 align:middle line:84%
In fact, why were
they exterminating

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.870 align:middle line:84%
everybody the time of Jesus,
and what did these people

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:29.990 align:middle line:90%
have in common?

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.250 align:middle line:84%
So once you study what all these
different sects had in common,

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.760 align:middle line:84%
they all agreed, including
the later Muslim community,

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.980 align:middle line:84%
that the whole story of
Jesus had been made up

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.160 align:middle line:84%
from earlier heroes who had
gone through the same ritual.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And it was exactly that--
a ritual-- no one ever got

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.090 align:middle line:90%
nailed to a cross physically.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.160 align:middle line:84%
No one ever physically
came back from the dead.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.120 align:middle line:90%
It's impossible.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.624 align:middle line:84%
They said the whole
story was a metaphor.

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And there was one of the
famous gospels, which

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.600 align:middle line:84%
was the Gospel of Thomas,
which the Church went

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.230 align:middle line:84%
through huge expense to
make sure it never came out.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.660 align:middle line:84%
It actually talks about the
fact that if anyone actually

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.360 align:middle line:84%
believes in the resurrection,
the crucifixion,

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.300 align:middle line:84%
they're confusing a spiritual
truth with an actual event.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And Thomas goes
as far as to say,

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.980 align:middle line:84%
and I quote, that
fundamental Christianity

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.750 align:middle line:90%
is a faith of fools.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.050 align:middle line:90%
It was all a metaphor.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.750 align:middle line:84%
It was all a symbol
of people who

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.790 align:middle line:84%
underwent this strange
initiation process.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What an amazing way
though to keep us baffled--

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --by coming
with that story.

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:26.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And Constantine, the
emperor, who was basically

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.430 align:middle line:84%
a follower of the
god-man Mithras,

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.110 align:middle line:90%
he was badgered by the Church.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And he eventually said, all
right, I've had enough now.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we just take the
word Mithra out of the story

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.950 align:middle line:84%
and put Jesus in
there and we're done?

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's how this
Catholicism was created.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.702 align:middle line:84%
But even so, the story
is over 8,000 years old.

00:05:47.702 --> 00:05:49.910 align:middle line:84%
But it does make Jesus a
much more interesting person

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:50.930 align:middle line:90%
in my opinion.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In Egypt, Freddy,
where you have visited,

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.460 align:middle line:84%
they have found a
pit of severed hands.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.420 align:middle line:90%
They just found it.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.770 align:middle line:90%
And they are gigantic hands.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.260 align:middle line:90%
All from the right hand.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And they think that it was
either some kind of punishment

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.270 align:middle line:90%
or some kind of ritual.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.760 align:middle line:84%
But what kind of
horrendous things

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.590 align:middle line:90%
did they do in those days?

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.390 align:middle line:90%
My gosh.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: The right hand of God.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.500 align:middle line:84%
It does put a different
spin on it, doesn't it?

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Strange.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:24.712 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It is very strange.

00:06:24.712 --> 00:06:26.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, from my
experience, nothing

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.730 align:middle line:90%
like that ever really happened.

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.155 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was--

00:06:29.155 --> 00:06:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A whole pit.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a pit of hands,
right hands, of what they

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:34.954 align:middle line:90%
said could be giants.

00:06:34.954 --> 00:06:36.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Now, that
is interesting.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:37.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:37.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: And we're talking--

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that comes
up a lot in the myths

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.336 align:middle line:84%
of the pre-civilizations
that talk about people

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:44.460 align:middle line:90%
that escaped the big flood.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.810 align:middle line:84%
They were very,
very much taller.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And they brought the
seeds of civilization

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.110 align:middle line:84%
to humanity after the flood,
which was about 9703 BC.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And they do talk
about-- in fact,

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.940 align:middle line:84%
in the Temple of Edfu in Egypt,
there's actually a mural that

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.540 align:middle line:84%
talks about the [NON-ENGLISH],,
which is the nickname

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.340 align:middle line:84%
for the teacher, the
spiritual teachers.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's said that the
initiates should stand up with

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.270 align:middle line:90%
the [NON-ENGLISH] in the temple.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And they gave the measurements
as three cubits tall.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.950 align:middle line:90%
No, it's five cubits tall--

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:12.880 align:middle line:90%
I beg your pardon--

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.470 align:middle line:84%
which puts these tall
people at 15 feet.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Makes me
wonder sometimes

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.476 align:middle line:84%
whether the statues are
actually not depicting

00:07:19.476 --> 00:07:22.260 align:middle line:84%
something that is actually
a true depiction of life.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the Bible
makes reference to giants.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.967 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there's got
to be some truth here.

00:07:27.967 --> 00:07:28.966 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, I think so.

00:07:28.966 --> 00:07:31.180 align:middle line:10%
And I'm working on a new
project to actually find out

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.120 align:middle line:10%
where these people come
from, where were they living,

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.800 align:middle line:10%
why is it that all the stories--

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.990 align:middle line:10%
and you've got to remember
as well that history

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.420 align:middle line:10%
and archeology is
most of all framed

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.120 align:middle line:10%
by a northern European
point of view,

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.630 align:middle line:10%
a Victorian European
point of view,

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.950 align:middle line:10%
which holds that white Europeans
are the end of everything,

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.020 align:middle line:10%
the all and be
all of everything.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.630 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that the people
from the indigenous cultures

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:55.610 align:middle line:84%
are actually much more savvy
about the ancient world,

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:56.777 align:middle line:90%
the prehistoric world.

00:07:56.777 --> 00:07:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And once you start
looking at the view

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.330 align:middle line:84%
from their point of view,
the world before the flood

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.710 align:middle line:84%
and after the flood
is much more coherent.

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:05.830 align:middle line:84%
They all agree, even
from the Pacific,

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:08.620 align:middle line:84%
from the Indus Valley,
Australia, New Zealand, which

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.680 align:middle line:84%
I've just discovered the
pre-history of New Zealand,

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.910 align:middle line:84%
they all talk about there's
another civilization here

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.352 align:middle line:84%
of people who were much
more advanced in terms

00:08:16.352 --> 00:08:17.560 align:middle line:90%
of their knowledge of nature.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.850 align:middle line:84%
They could harness
the laws of nature.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.142 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about technology?

00:08:20.142 --> 00:08:21.058 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Same concept.

00:08:21.058 --> 00:08:22.360 align:middle line:90%
There's a natural technology.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.570 align:middle line:84%
They could make things
move through the air.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.860 align:middle line:10%
I mean, some of the
temples in the Yucatan

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.830 align:middle line:10%
and in Peru and in Egypt-- they
talk about the stones flying

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:31.450 align:middle line:10%
through the air with ease.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:34.231 align:middle line:10%
Temples were built in the blink
of an eye, literally overnight.

00:08:34.231 --> 00:08:35.230 align:middle line:90%
Now, either that story--

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:35.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:37.179 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --gets
around by diffusion,

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:39.490 align:middle line:84%
or they are all
experiencing the same thing.

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And when they happen in
opposite sides of the world,

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:43.299 align:middle line:84%
there's no way they
could have made this up.

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:43.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:44.030 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:44.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something dramatic
happened on this planet.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And they all talk
about them being tall.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.770 align:middle line:84%
For example, in Peru,
or in the Andes,

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:54.160 align:middle line:84%
they talk about the bearded
giants who were white skins.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And that does not describe
people who are indigenous.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:57.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.584 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And they all said
they came from the ocean

00:08:59.584 --> 00:09:02.820 align:middle line:84%
after their island homes
were swamped by a big flood.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.490 align:middle line:84%
So it seems to me that all of
these people lived on islands.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:09.670 align:middle line:84%
They were a race set
aside from everybody else.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:12.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you and I are going
to Borneo on an expedition

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.120 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly, by accident,
bump into a tribe

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.760 align:middle line:84%
of people who were minding
their own business, completely

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.404 align:middle line:90%
naked, as we'd know--

00:09:20.404 --> 00:09:22.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Haven't changed,
let's say, over the years.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:23.945 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: For
thousands of years--

00:09:23.945 --> 00:09:26.230 align:middle line:84%
we irreversibly changed
their direction.

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:29.260 align:middle line:84%
It's called a prime directive
in Star Trek, by the way.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think Gene Roddenberg
picked up on this concept.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.370 align:middle line:84%
So basically, I think that
these people basically

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:38.890 align:middle line:84%
were forced onto the
mainland after they

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:40.180 align:middle line:90%
lost all their island homes.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we start to get,

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:45.040 align:middle line:84%
around 8000 BC, agriculture,
megalithic building

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.270 align:middle line:84%
technology, understanding
of astronomy and astrology,

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.760 align:middle line:84%
mathematics suddenly, in the
blink of an evolutionary eye.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.632 align:middle line:84%
So it seems to be more
than idle conjecture

00:09:54.632 --> 00:09:56.590 align:middle line:84%
that all the indigenous
people around the world

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:59.890 align:middle line:84%
hold the knowledge and the
kernel of the real truth

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:02.320 align:middle line:84%
of this ancient civilization,
which we can't find

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.150 align:middle line:84%
many traces of, because it's now
way under the ocean and buried.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:07.600 align:middle line:84%
But we hear the
echoes everywhere.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Atlantis?

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Atlantis, Lemuria.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.890 align:middle line:84%
I was just with a guide
in Peru, by the way.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:13.240 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about Lemuria.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.830 align:middle line:90%
He volunteered the conversation.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:19.540 align:middle line:10%
He said, yes, the Puquina tribe,
which are beyond the Aymara.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.430 align:middle line:90%
They're older than the Aymara.

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:23.890 align:middle line:84%
The Puquina is
actually a culture

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:26.391 align:middle line:84%
and the language which are the
remnants of Lemuria, he said.

00:10:26.391 --> 00:10:27.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:29.575 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: For them, Lemuria
is not an abstract concept.

00:10:29.575 --> 00:10:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fantastic.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's a real talking
point, as it is in the Yucatan.

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I love these
ancient stories.

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:35.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where does Freemasonry
fit into any of this?

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, Freemasonry
goes into two boxes.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.750 align:middle line:84%
You have London Rite
Freemasonry, which

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:46.210 align:middle line:90%
is fairly recent, 18th century.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:48.250 align:middle line:84%
But then there's the
original Freemasonry,

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:49.620 align:middle line:90%
which is 14th century.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's Scottish
Rite Freemasonry.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.640 align:middle line:84%
They essentially are the
progeny of the Knights Templar.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.200 align:middle line:84%
So essentially,
the Knights Templar

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.330 align:middle line:84%
were up against a
bit of a problem.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:10:59.620 align:middle line:90%
The Church was after them.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.550 align:middle line:90%
Philip of France was after them.

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:05.260 align:middle line:84%
They had resources of money,
but they couldn't basically

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.720 align:middle line:90%
outgun these two big forces.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.400 align:middle line:90%
So they did the next best thing.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.350 align:middle line:90%
They fled France and Europe.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.757 align:middle line:84%
They went to Portugal
and Scotland.

00:11:13.757 --> 00:11:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And they basically
changed their name.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.520 align:middle line:84%
It was a public
relations exercise.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.740 align:middle line:84%
They became Scottish
Rite Freemasonry.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And they basically
had been picking up

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.730 align:middle line:84%
on the mysteries teachings
and the initiation

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.850 align:middle line:84%
practices of people like
the Essenes, the Mandaeans,

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:27.870 align:middle line:90%
the Manicheans.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:28.970 align:middle line:90%
Same people, essentially.

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:30.570 align:middle line:84%
They just keep
changing their names

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:32.340 align:middle line:90%
to survive to another era.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Freemasons
did a simulated murder

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:37.115 align:middle line:90%
as part of their initiation.

00:11:37.115 --> 00:11:38.115 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, absolutely.

00:11:38.115 --> 00:11:41.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:45.700 align:middle line:10%
>> But there is Hiram Abiff, a
minor biblical figure mentioned

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.400 align:middle line:10%
in a single line of
the Book of Chronicles,

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.580 align:middle line:10%
transformed into the central
character of Masonic legend

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:54.450 align:middle line:10%
and ritual.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.670 align:middle line:10%
>> It's purely Masonic myth.

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.160 align:middle line:10%
And it's a Masonic myth
that we can trace back

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.660 align:middle line:10%
quite a long way.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:06.540 align:middle line:10%
So he's a personification
of a belief system.

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:11.480 align:middle line:90%


00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:16.180 align:middle line:10%
>> The mythical architect
suffers a painful death,

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.890 align:middle line:10%
a killing that remains the
nucleus of the most important

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:22.430 align:middle line:10%
of all Masonic rituals and
a popular term for intense

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:26.770 align:middle line:10%
interrogation, the third degree.

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:29.500 align:middle line:10%
Now, word reaches King
Solomon that his Master

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.700 align:middle line:10%
Mason has been murdered.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.410 align:middle line:10%


00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:35.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Alas, I fear the
master's word is lost,

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:38.620 align:middle line:10%
for you will remember that it
was agreed between yourself,

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:42.100 align:middle line:10%
myself, and Grandmaster Hiram
Abiff that the secret word

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.860 align:middle line:10%
of a Master Mason would not
be given unless we three were

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.450 align:middle line:10%
present and agreed.

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:50.140 align:middle line:10%
One of our number is no more.

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:53.140 align:middle line:10%
>> And Hiram Abiff
represents the ego.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:58.360 align:middle line:10%
And the ego has to be
slain before the spirit can

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.350 align:middle line:10%
rise free.

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:01.450 align:middle line:10%
So you've got to learn
to control your ego.

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:03.620 align:middle line:10%
And that's what the third
degree is all about.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.850 align:middle line:90%
And it's a very dramatic ritual.

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:07.864 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: There's some
very dodgy beards in that.

00:13:07.864 --> 00:13:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was
going to say, those

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:12.782 align:middle line:84%
could be the worst beards I
have ever seen in my life.

00:13:12.782 --> 00:13:13.740 align:middle line:90%
Well, what's the point?

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:14.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: But they're right.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was
the point of that?

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.411 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The point was,
they were enshrined

00:13:17.411 --> 00:13:19.030 align:middle line:84%
in this very old
and very important

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.610 align:middle line:84%
portion of the ritual,
which was the ritual

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:23.080 align:middle line:90%
resurrection of the individual.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.930 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, in
Scottish Rite Freemasonry,

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:27.700 align:middle line:84%
the initiates-- and
this was basically

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:31.480 align:middle line:84%
given to women and men,
not just a male thing.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.440 align:middle line:84%
They were basically made to
lie down in a figurative grave.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.220 align:middle line:10%
And then they were administered
certain important information.

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.730 align:middle line:10%
And then they were given the
hand by the Master Mason.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:46.900 align:middle line:84%
They used to be taken upright,
declared risen from the dead.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And the blindfold was removed,
and now they can see the light.

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:50.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:52.973 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So, it's all about that
certain facet of information,

00:13:52.973 --> 00:13:56.590 align:middle line:84%
which leaves them, as the
gentleman correctly said--

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:57.470 align:middle line:90%
I forgot his name.

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:58.270 align:middle line:90%
I've got his book.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.160 align:middle line:90%
It's a wonderful book, actually.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And basically, you do declare
your governance over your ego,

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:08.410 align:middle line:84%
because you have to basically
destroy your physical self.

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:10.900 align:middle line:84%
You have to de-flesh
your old self in order

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.829 align:middle line:84%
to be born anew or
risen from the dead.

00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:15.370 align:middle line:84%
So they're literally
saying that this

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:18.310 align:middle line:84%
is following a very, very old
recipe that can be traced back

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:23.290 align:middle line:84%
to Sumeria, ancient China, and
the Indus culture in 8000 BC.

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:27.640 align:middle line:84%
So, the Scottish Rite Freemasons
are following a very, very old

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:28.750 align:middle line:90%
prescription.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:30.940 align:middle line:84%
The trick is-- and I
don't think they actually

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.560 align:middle line:84%
do the actual out
of body ceremony,

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.960 align:middle line:84%
again because I think most
lawyers would jump over that.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:35.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:36.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Because the
whole point of initiation

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:38.860 align:middle line:84%
was to have an induced
near-death experience,

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.680 align:middle line:84%
which was harrowing from
the accounts that I've read,

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.500 align:middle line:84%
and yet everybody
wanted to do it.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras did it three
to five times, I believe.

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:47.260 align:middle line:90%
Plato did it.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:48.280 align:middle line:90%
Isaac Newton did it.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And they said it's the highest
level of spiritual development

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:53.020 align:middle line:90%
we could possibly experience.

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.400 align:middle line:90%
So they do it figuratively now.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.382 align:middle line:84%
They're the last keepers of that
knowledge in the Western world.

00:14:57.382 --> 00:14:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why does
it seem that they

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:03.060 align:middle line:84%
do all of this in the
kind of mythological way,

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:05.740 align:middle line:90%
where they kind of play act it?

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And what are they
trying to accomplish?

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, it was
actually quite clever,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.920 align:middle line:90%
because in the old days--

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:12.829 align:middle line:90%
even today, I think--

00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:14.620 align:middle line:84%
there are people who
want to use this stuff

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:17.210 align:middle line:90%
for nefarious purposes.

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:19.870 align:middle line:84%
So what they did was-- it
was actually quite clever.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:22.360 align:middle line:84%
They would do passion
plays in public areas.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.810 align:middle line:90%
Or they'd talk fables in a pub.

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And most of the
people, 99% of people,

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:29.750 align:middle line:84%
would say, well, that was
a lovely little story.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:30.610 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:33.490 align:middle line:84%
But there'll be the few who
would go, wait a minute.

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:36.294 align:middle line:84%
Reading between the lines
of what you just said,

00:15:36.294 --> 00:15:38.710 align:middle line:84%
it seems like you're telling
me a different kind of story.

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the deps
would say, why don't you

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:42.070 align:middle line:90%
come with me?

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:43.690 align:middle line:84%
We want to teach
you something else.

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:45.692 align:middle line:84%
So they let you into
the mysteries teachings,

00:15:45.692 --> 00:15:47.650 align:middle line:84%
and they will give you
some basic understanding

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:49.990 align:middle line:84%
of the big picture, but
they would observe you

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:53.110 align:middle line:84%
for a whole year to make sure
that you were, A, responsible

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:55.600 align:middle line:84%
and, B, someone who could be
trusted with this information.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.141 align:middle line:84%
You would use it
for the highest good

00:15:57.141 --> 00:15:58.660 align:middle line:84%
and for your
personal development

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:00.920 align:middle line:90%
and for the best good of others.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And then they started the
process of the bigger mysteries

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:04.720 align:middle line:90%
in your second year.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And in your third
year, once you learn

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:09.896 align:middle line:84%
to harmonize your
dual opposites,

00:16:09.896 --> 00:16:11.770 align:middle line:84%
and you learned the
bigger mysteries of life,

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:14.050 align:middle line:84%
then you'd undergo the
big initiation, which

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:16.180 align:middle line:84%
is the induced
near-death experience.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.970 align:middle line:84%
You took the narcotic, you
left your body between three

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:20.860 align:middle line:90%
to seven days in one case.

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:24.460 align:middle line:84%
How many people
actually died from this?

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: That's what I
really wanted to know.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:27.459 align:middle line:90%
And I never heard that.

00:16:27.459 --> 00:16:29.166 align:middle line:84%
Nothing has ever been
written about this,

00:16:29.166 --> 00:16:30.010 align:middle line:90%
or nothing survives.

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:33.190 align:middle line:84%
But they must have tried
this out at some point,

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:35.710 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of the
narcotics that they took

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:36.709 align:middle line:90%
were serious poisons.

00:16:36.709 --> 00:16:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god, yeah.

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: So for example--

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you're knocked
out for three or five days,

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.460 align:middle line:84%
you may be knocked
out permanently.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.918 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And this was different
from shamanism, by the way.

00:16:44.918 --> 00:16:47.030 align:middle line:84%
This was actually a
medically induced experience.

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:48.800 align:middle line:84%
So let's say, for
example, with arsenic--

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.860 align:middle line:84%
if you take a 4%
dilution of arsenic,

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.260 align:middle line:84%
it can be beneficial under
certain circumstances.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: 10% is deadly.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.410 align:middle line:84%
They figured out the same
thing with the [NON-ENGLISH]

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:59.230 align:middle line:90%
and other essences.

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:01.480 align:middle line:84%
In Central America, it's
called [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.130 align:middle line:90%
They still do it today.

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And again, how did
they figure out

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.050 align:middle line:84%
how much of this actual narcotic
to take before it actually

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:08.595 align:middle line:90%
became beneficial?

00:17:08.595 --> 00:17:09.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Trial and
error for this.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:10.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.740 align:middle line:90%
Bring in another volunteer.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.459 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Woop, that
one didn't work.

00:17:13.459 --> 00:17:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Take it down 5%.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gave him a
little bit too much.

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:17.980 align:middle line:90%
No, you're right.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:21.879 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder if they weighed
the weight of the individual

00:17:21.879 --> 00:17:23.170 align:middle line:90%
with the amount that they gave.

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It was a very
careful consideration.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.970 align:middle line:84%
I learned from the
Sumerian scriptures

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:31.360 align:middle line:84%
that apparently it was the
highest level of responsibility

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:32.230 align:middle line:90%
in the temple--

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:35.010 align:middle line:84%
was the person administering
the actual narcotics.

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And it was usually
women, by the way.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.340 align:middle line:84%
They held the highest level
of physician in the temple.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did they do to
those people if somebody died?

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Apparently, if
they had a mild death

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:49.450 align:middle line:84%
or they had an actual really,
really near-death experience,

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:51.370 align:middle line:84%
they basically were made
to atone for a year.

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:52.619 align:middle line:90%
They had to go for retraining.

00:17:52.619 --> 00:17:54.610 align:middle line:84%
But in serious cases,
they would actually

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:56.682 align:middle line:84%
be excommunicated
from the temple.

00:17:56.682 --> 00:17:58.765 align:middle line:84%
But there's not enough
information that survives--

00:17:58.765 --> 00:17:59.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:00.859 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --that says
that anybody actually

00:18:00.859 --> 00:18:01.810 align:middle line:90%
died in the process.

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:04.202 align:middle line:84%
So that brings up the
question, of course,

00:18:04.202 --> 00:18:06.410 align:middle line:84%
that if the women were the
highest level of initiate,

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:09.480 align:middle line:84%
and this is in
Sumeria in 3000 BC,

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.060 align:middle line:84%
where the women were
called [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.511 align:middle line:84%
They wore a red robe
or a crimson robe,

00:18:14.511 --> 00:18:17.010 align:middle line:84%
which is called [NON-ENGLISH],,
where we get the word ritual

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:17.120 align:middle line:90%
from--

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:17.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Rituals.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: --which means truth.

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:21.150 align:middle line:90%
So they wore the robe of truth.

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And they were part of
this divine bloodline that

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.050 align:middle line:84%
came down from
hallowed appointments,

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:28.050 align:middle line:90%
came down from a time of gods.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And the women maintained that
lineage, the sacred bloodline

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.300 align:middle line:84%
lineage, which
eventually ends up

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.660 align:middle line:84%
with the historical
tradition of Mary Magdalene.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was this a form of
recreation for these people?

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: No.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:41.970 align:middle line:90%
They took it really seriously.

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:42.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They did.

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:44.181 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They were very
serious about this,

00:18:44.181 --> 00:18:45.810 align:middle line:90%
because the whole point was--

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:48.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you take three years
of your life, for one thing.

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.310 align:middle line:84%
That's a lot of time
to certainly set aside

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:51.385 align:middle line:90%
to teachings.

00:18:51.385 --> 00:18:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to give
this harrowing near-death

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:54.900 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.840 align:middle line:84%
But then you come back, and
you are totally self-empowered.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.330 align:middle line:84%
You see how the big
picture really is.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.310 align:middle line:84%
You've seen the
purpose of your soul.

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.775 align:middle line:84%
You know the mechanics of nature
and how to work with them.

00:19:04.775 --> 00:19:06.150 align:middle line:84%
That's a lot of
self-empowerment,

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:06.990 align:middle line:90%
a lot of power right there.

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So it was a
very serious thing,

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.800 align:middle line:84%
but they applied
it in their lives.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And these people became model
citizens, writers, architects,

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.530 align:middle line:90%
healers, seers.

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:17.580 align:middle line:90%
People like I said--

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Plato and Pythagoras were
very renowned for it.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.070 align:middle line:84%
A lot of Egyptian
pharaohs did it.

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And they would basically
set themselves up

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.547 align:middle line:90%
as the example to follow.

00:19:25.547 --> 00:19:27.630 align:middle line:84%
You were only declared to
be a really good pharaoh

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:31.020 align:middle line:84%
on your deathbed depending on
how the level of the people

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:34.080 align:middle line:84%
has come up relative
to your own experience.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.904 align:middle line:84%
They became the
light for others.

00:19:35.904 --> 00:19:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
that gets corrupted

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.650 align:middle line:84%
as well as we get into
the historical era.

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did they
want to accomplish, Freddy,

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:43.830 align:middle line:90%
with the near-death experience?

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Self-empowerment.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Literally, the
self-development of the self.

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:50.700 align:middle line:84%
I think they recognized very
early on that we're here

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.330 align:middle line:90%
to have an experience as a soul.

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:55.230 align:middle line:84%
We're all individuals having
a collective experience,

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:58.530 align:middle line:84%
but fundamentally, we're here
to have a personal experience.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:01.727 align:middle line:84%
Now, think about your own
life for a second, George,

00:20:01.727 --> 00:20:03.810 align:middle line:84%
where you spend so much
of your time reading books

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:05.560 align:middle line:84%
and going to conferences
and figuring out,

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.140 align:middle line:90%
how can I do this better?

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you have
a certain shortcut,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.730 align:middle line:84%
where you can actually
access the other world,

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:14.940 align:middle line:84%
even if for a few minutes
and if not for a few days,

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.899 align:middle line:84%
come back with important
information about what

00:20:16.899 --> 00:20:19.314 align:middle line:84%
you are here to do, well, that
gives you a bit of an edge,

00:20:19.314 --> 00:20:20.130 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:21.330 align:middle line:90%
You're much more in control.

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:24.120 align:middle line:84%
You are now considered to
be living rather than dead,

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.579 align:middle line:84%
because you're much more aware
of the spiritual environment

00:20:26.579 --> 00:20:27.378 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:20:27.378 --> 00:20:29.370 align:middle line:84%
You're much more aware
of the facts of life,

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:31.060 align:middle line:84%
and you have the
degree of control,

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.720 align:middle line:84%
which means to a certain
degree you can actually

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.396 align:middle line:84%
do a lot of
manifestation around you.

00:20:36.396 --> 00:20:37.770 align:middle line:84%
So that's a very
important thing.

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:39.271 align:middle line:84%
That's a very
self-empowering thing.

00:20:39.271 --> 00:20:41.561 align:middle line:84%
I can't think of anything
more self-empowering actually

00:20:41.561 --> 00:20:43.877 align:middle line:84%
than to do that, to have
access to that information.

00:20:43.877 --> 00:20:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did everybody go
through these programs--

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.760 align:middle line:90%
children, adults--

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:48.672 align:middle line:90%
in these days?

00:20:48.672 --> 00:20:50.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Mostly adults from
the surviving information

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.980 align:middle line:84%
that I've read, but it
was open to everybody.

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.350 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't an elitist thing.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:58.490 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was part of an
elite until I discovered--

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:00.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like the Illuminati
or something like that?

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:03.100 align:middle line:84%
But the only reason
why it was an elite

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.980 align:middle line:84%
was because they didn't
want nefarious people

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.590 align:middle line:84%
to have control of the
information, like popes

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:09.540 align:middle line:84%
and despots and people
like that, because you

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:13.320 align:middle line:84%
can use it for the dark side,
as "Star Wars" reminds us.

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:17.690 align:middle line:84%
But I found on one of the doors
of one of the so-called tombs

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:20.700 align:middle line:84%
where no one's buried in Egypt,
there is an actual inscription

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:24.630 align:middle line:84%
by a servant in the household
of Pharaoh Teti that describes

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:27.180 align:middle line:84%
his amazement, and
I quote, of being

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:30.210 align:middle line:84%
allowed into the secret
teachings of the pharaoh.

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And my master
allowed me to enter

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.860 align:middle line:90%
the room of restricted access.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.330 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't describe
the experience

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:38.790 align:middle line:84%
because that was secret,
absolutely secret.

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And then at the end,
he says, and I came out

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:42.650 align:middle line:90%
and I found the way.

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, the way is the
actual description

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:46.410 align:middle line:84%
of the teaching
of the initiation

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:49.050 align:middle line:84%
that they mention in
China in 3000 BC, which

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:52.280 align:middle line:84%
eventually ends up in the
Middle East with the Essenes.

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.802 align:middle line:84%
And so when Jesus
says, I am the way,

00:21:54.802 --> 00:21:56.760 align:middle line:84%
he's revealing the fact
that he's actually part

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.620 align:middle line:90%
of that initiation tradition.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So, you're
convinced there was a Jesus.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:01.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, absolutely.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.399 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're not convinced
there was a resurrection.

00:22:04.399 --> 00:22:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Not a
physical resurrection.

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:08.398 align:middle line:84%
And the early Christians made
a very good point about that,

00:22:08.398 --> 00:22:09.960 align:middle line:90%
that it was all metaphorical.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.390 align:middle line:84%
The fundamental Christians
took everything very literally,

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:14.779 align:middle line:90%
as fundamentalists tend to do.

00:22:14.779 --> 00:22:16.320 align:middle line:84%
They're very mental
and not much fun.

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.695 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But that's
the whole key

00:22:17.695 --> 00:22:19.450 align:middle line:84%
to Christianity, the
Resurrection, right?

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:20.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes.

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:22.000 align:middle line:84%
But except the gnostic
Christians said,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.370 align:middle line:84%
it's all about a
personal experience.

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:25.540 align:middle line:90%
It's a spiritual experience.

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.420 align:middle line:84%
No one actually
dies in the process,

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:30.600 align:middle line:84%
which is where I actually found,
well, how do you reconcile this

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.450 align:middle line:84%
now with the historically
accepted version,

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:35.554 align:middle line:84%
or the generally accepted
version, of a guy

00:22:35.554 --> 00:22:36.720 align:middle line:90%
that gets nailed to a cross?

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.053 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is where the work
of the late Michael Baigent

00:22:39.053 --> 00:22:42.100 align:middle line:84%
comes in, a man
who I respect a lot

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:44.910 align:middle line:84%
and I wish I'd met
before he died.

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And I've read his dissertation
on this conundrum.

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
basically, I had access

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.340 align:middle line:84%
to much more
restricted information.

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.350 align:middle line:84%
I was able to piece
together the actual events,

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:59.280 align:middle line:84%
because what happened was that
Pontius Pilot had a problem.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.810 align:middle line:84%
The Jews and the rabbis wanted
to kill Jesus because they

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:03.480 align:middle line:90%
were putting them out of a job.

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:03.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.809 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: He was saying
it's a person experience.

00:23:05.809 --> 00:23:07.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the masses
were following him.

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.640 align:middle line:10%
And it was creating
a huge problem,

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.140 align:middle line:10%
because they were saying,
no, no, to talk to God,

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:12.520 align:middle line:10%
you have to talk
to us, and we'll

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.210 align:middle line:10%
talk to you or your behalf.

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:16.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, Jesus was saying,
no, the connection--

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:17.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go direct.

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.440 align:middle line:84%
The temple of God
resides within you.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.911 align:middle line:10%
You don't need an intermediary.

00:23:20.911 --> 00:23:21.910 align:middle line:10%
That's bad for business.

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:22.710 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:26.110 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: So, Baigent realized
through his connections

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:27.940 align:middle line:10%
and his sources that
Pontius Pilate said,

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:29.920 align:middle line:10%
well, we can't
actually crucify Jesus

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.650 align:middle line:10%
because he hasn't
broken any Roman law.

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:34.520 align:middle line:84%
Crucifixion was
reserved for criminals.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.960 align:middle line:90%
He's not a criminal.

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And so Joseph of Arimathea
was the go between.

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
let me do this.

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:42.360 align:middle line:84%
Why don't I take
Jesus off your hand?

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.380 align:middle line:84%
I'll make sure he
meets his death

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:47.521 align:middle line:84%
and then you can
basically wash your hands

00:23:47.521 --> 00:23:48.520 align:middle line:90%
and it will all be done.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.950 align:middle line:90%
And Pontius said, OK.

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:53.260 align:middle line:84%
It turns out, Joseph of
Arimathea had a plot of land

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:54.676 align:middle line:84%
not far from the
hill of Golgotha,

00:23:54.676 --> 00:23:57.280 align:middle line:84%
where they did the
real crucifixions.

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:58.655 align:middle line:90%
And the nearest eyewitnesses--

00:23:58.655 --> 00:24:00.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It wasn't Calvary?

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Same thing.

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:02.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:04.720 align:middle line:84%
The nearest witnesses were
a quarter of a mile away.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.640 align:middle line:84%
In the shimmering
heat of the desert,

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.190 align:middle line:84%
you could be watching anything
a quarter of a mile away,

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:12.220 align:middle line:84%
and they basically
gave Jesus a narcotic.

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:14.690 align:middle line:84%
To all intents and purposes,
he has the outward appearance

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:15.490 align:middle line:90%
of death.

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Probably the
poison from the pufferfish,

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:20.410 align:middle line:84%
which Mary Magdalene,
being a priestess

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:23.580 align:middle line:84%
of the temple, a high priestess,
would have known about.

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:25.000 align:middle line:90%
They string him up on a cross.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:25.960 align:middle line:90%
They didn't nail him.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.220 align:middle line:90%
And then they take him down.

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:28.020 align:middle line:90%
Mary Magdalene--

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:29.052 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He looks dead.

00:24:29.052 --> 00:24:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: He looks dead.

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:31.030 align:middle line:90%
He's pale.

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And Mary Magdalene is the first
witness to his resurrection,

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:35.620 align:middle line:90%
remember?

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The narcotic
wears off, right?

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: She gives him
the antidote, you see?

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.709 align:middle line:84%
But in the official
version of the Bible,

00:24:41.709 --> 00:24:43.750 align:middle line:84%
it's not Mary Magdalene
who is the first witness,

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:46.040 align:middle line:84%
because she's a woman, and
it's a patriarchal system

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:46.840 align:middle line:90%
that's taken over.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's Peter the Apostle.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Peter becomes
the first witness.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Peter, yeah.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And that's
the difference

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.270 align:middle line:84%
between the gnostic gospels
and the real gospel--

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:53.340 align:middle line:90%
and the official.

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you know
what to believe, Freddy?

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, I
never tell the truth.

00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:58.329 align:middle line:90%
I always tell facts.

00:24:58.329 --> 00:25:00.370 align:middle line:84%
So we'll let people figure
it out for themselves.

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:02.574 align:middle line:84%
But I find Michael's
work very convincing--

00:25:02.574 --> 00:25:03.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:04.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --very
convincing because it

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.040 align:middle line:90%
shows you the whole picture.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, you make up your own
mind, because the Indian people

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:13.120 align:middle line:84%
claim that Jesus-- he survived
his crucifixion because he

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.590 align:middle line:90%
died in India at the age of 80.

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about the
story of the Shroud of Turin?

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:20.500 align:middle line:90%
We have this image of somebody.

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:21.760 align:middle line:90%
Is it a painting?

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.850 align:middle line:90%
Is it a farce, or is it real?

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:27.520 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: I'm trying to remember
the name of the two authors

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.580 align:middle line:10%
who wrote a fantastic book on
this, a very scientific book.

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.663 align:middle line:84%
And they came to the
conclusion that it's actually

00:25:32.663 --> 00:25:35.650 align:middle line:84%
the image of Jacques de Molay,
because the person that's

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:38.420 align:middle line:84%
printed on the shroud is
not of Semitic origin.

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.420 align:middle line:84%
He looks like a white
European with a big beard.

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:41.795 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who is
Jacques de Molay?

00:25:41.795 --> 00:25:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Jacques de Molay
was the Templar Master,

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.180 align:middle line:90%
the last Templar Master.

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:47.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that was him?

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:48.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes.

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And if I remember-- to try and
paraphrase the book correctly--

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it a painting?

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: No, it was part of the
mechanics of what happens when

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:58.257 align:middle line:84%
they put a kind of embalming
fluid on him because he was

00:25:58.257 --> 00:26:00.340 align:middle line:84%
suffering really badly
after he was beaten badly--

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So, it's
like an image, then.

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:02.385 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:26:02.385 --> 00:26:03.760 align:middle line:84%
It was part of
the chemicals that

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.880 align:middle line:84%
were put on his body to heal
his wounds after being seriously

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.320 align:middle line:90%
beaten up by the Church.

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.460 align:middle line:90%
Well, tortured.

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And when they put the shroud
on him to sort of clean up

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:15.190 align:middle line:84%
his wounds, there's a kind
of a radioactive element that

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:16.762 align:middle line:90%
took part between the plants.

00:26:16.762 --> 00:26:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that
etched the image?

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:19.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.790 align:middle line:84%
Because you look at the image,
it does not look Semitic.

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you got-- that's
the first point of reference

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:24.600 align:middle line:90%
right there.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.920 align:middle line:84%
He does not look like
someone from the Near East.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.350 align:middle line:84%
He looks like a northern
European person from the Middle

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:30.150 align:middle line:90%
Ages.

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And again, I find their
argument very compelling.

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing, amazing work.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:38.500 align:middle line:10%
Carmen Boulter was on my
program before, "Beyond Belief."

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about
some ancient pyramids.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Before we get into that, because
I want to show you a video,

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:48.080 align:middle line:90%
you have looked at Egypt.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.610 align:middle line:90%
You've gone there.

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:52.310 align:middle line:84%
What is your overall
perception of what

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:53.930 align:middle line:90%
this is, what the pyramids are?

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:57.240 align:middle line:84%
Because you just mentioned
that it's not a burial tomb.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: No.

00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:59.030 align:middle line:90%
Where is the body?

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:00.650 align:middle line:90%
Where are the inscriptions?

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:03.120 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
places in Egypt,

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.960 align:middle line:90%
which there is no one buried.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.390 align:middle line:10%
In fact, one of my favorite
ones is the pyramids

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:11.970 align:middle line:10%
of Unas, where Una is
actually buried in the pyramid

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:12.770 align:middle line:10%
next door.

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, why does one
guy need two pyramids?

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:17.450 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing
with Thutmose III.

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:21.111 align:middle line:84%
He has a chamber built into
the Valley of the Kings

00:27:21.111 --> 00:27:23.360 align:middle line:84%
and yet it's completely
oriented in a different manner

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.990 align:middle line:90%
to burial chamber.

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:27.530 align:middle line:10%
And he has himself buried
in Hatshepsut's Temple.

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:28.860 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make any sense.

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.760 align:middle line:84%
There's too many buildings
with too many absent bodies.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:36.770 align:middle line:84%
The pyramid of Sekhemkhet
was found completely sealed.

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:38.150 align:middle line:84%
The sarcophagus
was found sealed.

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Even the chambers
were found sealed.

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:40.941 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With nothing in there.

00:27:40.941 --> 00:27:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: There's
nobody in there.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.540 align:middle line:10%
And after a while, it
began to dawn to me

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:49.920 align:middle line:10%
that the Great Pyramid in
Giza served several purposes,

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.010 align:middle line:10%
because all of these
are multi-functional.

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:55.040 align:middle line:84%
But after my utmost
visit, I began

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:58.310 align:middle line:84%
to realize, wait a minute,
if I start at the very bottom

00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:00.290 align:middle line:90%
of the pyramid, and--

00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:03.231 align:middle line:84%
well, you can't now because the
actual shaft is for the debris.

00:28:03.231 --> 00:28:04.730 align:middle line:10%
There's another
chamber under there,

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:07.340 align:middle line:10%
which you could reach through
the Nile, which Herodotus

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:08.670 align:middle line:10%
talked about.

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And if I was actually just
to sit back for a second,

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:15.050 align:middle line:84%
look at this and observe
this dispassionately,

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:17.149 align:middle line:84%
well, you start off
at the very bottom,

00:28:17.149 --> 00:28:18.440 align:middle line:90%
and the chamber is very narrow.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:19.500 align:middle line:90%
It's claustrophobic.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.300 align:middle line:90%
It's dark.

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:21.110 align:middle line:90%
It's unfinished.

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And as you go
through the chambers,

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:24.620 align:middle line:84%
and you go further
up, the chambers

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.500 align:middle line:90%
get wider and more polished.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And you end up at
the King's Chamber,

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:31.730 align:middle line:84%
highly polished, beautiful,
sonic properties,

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:34.269 align:middle line:90%
mathematical designs.

00:28:34.269 --> 00:28:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And you think, my
god, I've just gone

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:38.240 align:middle line:84%
from being a rough stone
to a polished diamond.

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.750 align:middle line:84%
That is a metaphor
of initiation.

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And in fact, if you
go to Thutmose III's tomb,

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.320 align:middle line:84%
where he wasn't
buried, it actually

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.300 align:middle line:84%
shows diagrams
which are remarkably

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:50.600 align:middle line:84%
similar to the internal
chambers of the Great Pyramid.

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.240 align:middle line:10%
But in his tomb, they are
describing the passage

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.620 align:middle line:10%
into the other world.

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that, most
of all, the Great Pyramid

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:59.342 align:middle line:90%
was used for initiation.

00:28:59.342 --> 00:29:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And I've been in
there enough times

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.160 align:middle line:84%
and under certain
circumstances where

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:06.920 align:middle line:84%
I believe that,
because I've had things

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.660 align:middle line:84%
happen to me in
the Great Pyramid,

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:11.450 align:middle line:84%
where we were with a small group
of people in total darkness.

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:14.720 align:middle line:84%
We actually saw about 30
people coming out of the stones

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:15.555 align:middle line:90%
after we used sound.

00:29:15.555 --> 00:29:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:17.678 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: We weren't
expecting that.

00:29:17.678 --> 00:29:20.730 align:middle line:84%
We were just there to
honor, pray, show respect.

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:23.420 align:middle line:84%
30 people just surrounded
us in total darkness.

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:24.860 align:middle line:90%
And here's the weird part.

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:27.830 align:middle line:84%
I know electrical engineers that
have done sound work in there.

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:30.560 align:middle line:84%
They've seen the same people
when they hit a certain note.

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And a writer called Paul
Brunton in the 1920s

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:36.170 align:middle line:84%
wrote about exactly
the same experience.

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:38.660 align:middle line:10%
I had his book in my library
for years, never read it.

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:40.672 align:middle line:10%
When I wrote this
in my second book,

00:29:40.672 --> 00:29:42.130 align:middle line:10%
I thought, I wonder
if someone else

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:45.756 align:middle line:10%
has had the same experience to
validate what I've experienced.

00:29:45.756 --> 00:29:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, he
described the same people

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:49.940 align:middle line:84%
coming out of the same
stone in the King's Chamber.

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:51.350 align:middle line:90%
And he had all night in there.

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:53.060 align:middle line:84%
He went walk about
into different parts

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:53.960 align:middle line:90%
of the building.

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.330 align:middle line:84%
So there's something very
important about that building

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:59.120 align:middle line:84%
that is just not just
for a practical reason.

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Or as Chris Dunn
has pointed out,

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:04.230 align:middle line:84%
it's an actual technological
one, which I believe it is.

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:06.410 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, I think it
shows the ultimate level

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:07.210 align:middle line:90%
of initiation.

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:08.900 align:middle line:84%
It was designed as
an electrical circuit

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:11.899 align:middle line:84%
to get you to have an
out-of-body experience, which

00:30:11.899 --> 00:30:13.940 align:middle line:84%
of course is why it's
called the House of Osiris.

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what
a mind they had.

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, Carmen Boulter
on "Beyond Belief"

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.720 align:middle line:84%
was talking about an area
in Egypt called Hawara.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:24.760 align:middle line:90%
And there was a pyramid there.

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:28.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CARMEN BOULTER: And so
we found a huge complex

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:30.760 align:middle line:84%
in front of the
Pyramid of Hawara,

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:34.460 align:middle line:84%
with one layer that's the
ceilings are 20 meters deep.

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:35.260 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:38.050 align:middle line:10%
>>BOULTER: And the second
one is 40 meters deep.

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:38.890 align:middle line:90%
That's huge.

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:41.470 align:middle line:84%
But there's 63
chambers, six of which

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:44.902 align:middle line:84%
are bigger than Olympic
size swimming pools.

00:30:44.902 --> 00:30:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are they doing
with all these chambers,

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.515 align:middle line:90%
Freddy?

00:30:47.515 --> 00:30:47.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Wow.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:48.720 align:middle line:90%
That's big.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are they doing?

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:51.490 align:middle line:90%
No bodies.

00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:52.290 align:middle line:90%
No nothing.

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:53.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: No bodies.

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:55.490 align:middle line:90%
It reminds me a lot of--

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:57.580 align:middle line:84%
again, going back to
the Pyramid of Unas--

00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:00.490 align:middle line:84%
if you can just look at the
whole spectrum of how it's all

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:02.140 align:middle line:84%
put together, the
whole thing is very

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:04.330 align:middle line:84%
metaphorical of the
journey of the soul.

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:07.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you start on the
east coast of the Nile.

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:09.900 align:middle line:84%
You're ferried across the
River of Forgetfulness, which

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:11.350 align:middle line:90%
is the River Nile in this case.

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:14.620 align:middle line:84%
You disembark in the west,
following the figurative path

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:18.550 align:middle line:84%
of the sun going into the other
world, the equinox position.

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:20.440 align:middle line:84%
From the moment you
land on dry land,

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:23.620 align:middle line:84%
you go into like this tube,
like an umbilical cord.

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:25.420 align:middle line:84%
You go into
preparatory chambers.

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:27.100 align:middle line:84%
You are taught
certain information

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.450 align:middle line:90%
about the other world.

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And then you are prepared,
you are given the narcotic,

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:33.060 align:middle line:84%
you are put into a chamber,
which is essentially

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:35.920 align:middle line:84%
a big sarcophagus in the west
side of the building, which

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.080 align:middle line:84%
is the figurative
position of descending

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.370 align:middle line:90%
into the other world.

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Even the choice of
granites-- black signifies

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:44.560 align:middle line:90%
the source of all wisdom.

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Black and darkness is where
all wisdom resides, according

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:50.200 align:middle line:84%
to the original cultures, which
is why we have a Black Madonna,

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.340 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:54.114 align:middle line:10%
So all of the things that design
these buildings-- they're all

00:31:54.114 --> 00:31:56.530 align:middle line:10%
designed to mimic the soul's
journey into the other world,

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:59.220 align:middle line:10%
which again is a lot of
trouble to go to, isn't it?

00:31:59.220 --> 00:31:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I mean, they had to
ferry the stones from 400 miles

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:03.442 align:middle line:84%
away, create these
enormous things--

00:32:03.442 --> 00:32:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It doesn't
make any sense.

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:06.983 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --just to have
an out-of-body experience.

00:32:06.983 --> 00:32:09.880 align:middle line:84%
So it leads me to believe
then that, yes, part of it

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.487 align:middle line:84%
was a ritual, because
all the signs are there.

00:32:12.487 --> 00:32:14.820 align:middle line:84%
But there are other things,
which we're still working on

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:15.700 align:middle line:90%
and still didn't know about.

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:16.910 align:middle line:90%
Part of it is technological.

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:19.840 align:middle line:84%
Part of it is as a
storehouse for information.

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:22.600 align:middle line:10%
I mean, why would you build
something that's so waterproof,

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.610 align:middle line:10%
so earthquake proof?

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:26.980 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me that they
had an understanding

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:29.290 align:middle line:84%
and the foreknowledge that
every once in a while,

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:32.050 align:middle line:84%
the Earth goes through some
really horrible and painful

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:32.950 align:middle line:90%
events.

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:36.340 align:middle line:84%
They had to actually build these
things to last into a lifetime,

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:39.462 align:middle line:84%
almost to remind us of
something, as if to say, well,

00:32:39.462 --> 00:32:41.920 align:middle line:84%
you're going to go through this
at some point in your life.

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.080 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be so
technologically advanced,

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:47.110 align:middle line:84%
and yet you'll know so little
about what's really going on.

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:50.080 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps if we build these things
to last, you will go there--

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.036 align:middle line:84%
whether it was tourists,
it was pilgrims--

00:32:52.036 --> 00:32:54.160 align:middle line:84%
and you will remind yourself
that there's something

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.919 align:middle line:90%
much bigger going on here.

00:32:55.919 --> 00:32:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
there's sort of--

00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:59.756 align:middle line:84%
there is a spiritual and
technological component

00:32:59.756 --> 00:33:01.630 align:middle line:84%
to all of these things
going on all the time.

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Valley
of the Kings truly

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:08.240 align:middle line:90%
had some of the bones of kings.

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Much different
than the pyramids.

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:12.320 align:middle line:90%
Why the difference?

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.970 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: Again, it
was a place where

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:16.350 align:middle line:10%
if you were much more in
tune with your environment,

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:19.100 align:middle line:10%
and you can say
this, whether you're

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:20.804 align:middle line:10%
a psychic or an
intuitive person,

00:33:20.804 --> 00:33:22.220 align:middle line:10%
you go to the
Valley of the Kings,

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:24.170 align:middle line:10%
there's something very
energetic about it.

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:27.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a very electromagnetic
environment.

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:29.794 align:middle line:84%
We now have the tools to
measure this, by the way.

00:33:29.794 --> 00:33:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And Princeton has
done a lot of research

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:33.660 align:middle line:84%
into measuring the energy
of these sacred places.

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:34.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:36.046 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: But essentially,
it is the repository

00:33:36.046 --> 00:33:37.170 align:middle line:90%
in the West of the Nile.

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:39.620 align:middle line:84%
So that is actually the
physical repository.

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:41.750 align:middle line:84%
But yet there was a tomb
of Thutmose III, which

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:43.220 align:middle line:90%
is totally anomalous again.

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:44.600 align:middle line:90%
There's no one buried there.

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:45.400 align:middle line:90%
It usually--

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe it was
taken out, perhaps.

00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:48.832 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: He was buried in--

00:33:48.832 --> 00:33:50.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, they put
him someplace else.

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: --Hatshepsut's Temple.

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:51.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:53.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, he had earlier built
himself a mortuary temple.

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:56.590 align:middle line:84%
One guy needs two
places to get buried.

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:57.590 align:middle line:90%
If you've tried to get--

00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:59.423 align:middle line:84%
when you get buried,
your head should always

00:33:59.423 --> 00:34:01.520 align:middle line:84%
be in the East, your
feet in the West.

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:02.776 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of these--

00:34:02.776 --> 00:34:04.400 align:middle line:84%
and his particular
tomb doesn't add up.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:07.160 align:middle line:84%
It's facing Northeast,
which is a sign of wisdom

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.840 align:middle line:90%
in the traditional teachings.

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.340 align:middle line:84%
So, if you go into the
tomb, there is a well.

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, why would a dead guy need
a well to have a drink of water,

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:15.360 align:middle line:90%
if he's dead?

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.699 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Symbolism.

00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:17.580 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:20.090 align:middle line:10%
You're drinking a
fountain of knowledge.

00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:22.670 align:middle line:10%
The sarcophagus, again,
is a beautiful example

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:23.830 align:middle line:10%
of craftsmanship.

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:26.840 align:middle line:84%
There's no one buried inside
it, but all around the chamber

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:30.290 align:middle line:84%
is a massive book called "The
Book of the Hidden Chamber."

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:33.530 align:middle line:10%
And again, it describes the
pathway into the other world,

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:35.840 align:middle line:10%
how to avoid all
the distractions

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.540 align:middle line:10%
when your soul leaves the
body, what you should say

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:41.870 align:middle line:10%
to yourself to keep your focus,
what to do in the other world,

00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:44.540 align:middle line:10%
and also how to return back
into your physical body

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:46.850 align:middle line:10%
to carry on life as normal.

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, most pharaohs
in their 13th year of reign

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:52.940 align:middle line:84%
had to undergo this
actual experience,

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:55.639 align:middle line:84%
and then from which they were
declared risen from the dead.

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Saqqara was one place where
they were actually indoctrinated

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.250 align:middle line:90%
in this particular teaching.

00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the Pyramids of
Giza, again, the same thing,

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.790 align:middle line:84%
nothing found inside
of any of them?

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:06.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And marking Orion, the actual
simulation of the Orion

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:10.850 align:middle line:90%
of the ground.

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:11.990 align:middle line:90%
And who is Orion?

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:15.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, Orion is Osiris
in the physical form.

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:18.604 align:middle line:84%
Osiris is essentially
the risen god-man,

00:35:18.604 --> 00:35:20.270 align:middle line:84%
who basically goes
into the other world,

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:22.040 align:middle line:84%
he gets cut up
into little pieces,

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.350 align:middle line:84%
he then marries his
divine virgin, Isis,

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:28.060 align:middle line:84%
comes back, and is
replaced by his son Horus.

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:29.390 align:middle line:90%
He's not avenging his father.

00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:32.390 align:middle line:84%
Horus is the living image
of the resurrected god-man.

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:35.054 align:middle line:84%
There are many pharaohs
called Osiris, a lot of them.

00:35:35.054 --> 00:35:36.470 align:middle line:84%
So the Egyptians
actually believed

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:38.950 align:middle line:84%
that he was actually a real
man and a figurative person.

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:40.750 align:middle line:90%
He was an example to follow.

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And from Osiris,
we also get people

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:46.850 align:middle line:84%
like Jesus, whose etymological
name actually goes

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:48.760 align:middle line:90%
all the way back to Osiris.

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:52.400 align:middle line:84%
So you could say that Jesus
and Osiris are the same people.

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.470 align:middle line:84%
So, they are real
living people like us

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:57.020 align:middle line:84%
who undergo this
process for initiation.

00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And they basically
follow this risen god-man

00:35:59.330 --> 00:36:00.314 align:middle line:90%
on the winter solstice.

00:36:00.314 --> 00:36:02.605 align:middle line:84%
And they do the same thing
again on the spring equinox.

00:36:02.605 --> 00:36:04.070 align:middle line:84%
Freddy, throughout
this planet, we

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:07.430 align:middle line:84%
find them mounds
that are supposed

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:10.940 align:middle line:90%
to be burial ground areas.

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:13.190 align:middle line:90%
But again, where are the bodies?

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:16.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: 90% of all excavated
mounds, there's no body inside.

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:17.522 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing, nothing.

00:36:17.522 --> 00:36:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They're
marking something.

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:22.249 align:middle line:84%
I used to think that
the earliest mound

00:36:22.249 --> 00:36:23.540 align:middle line:90%
culture was in northern Europe.

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:25.164 align:middle line:84%
And we do have a lot
of giant's graves.

00:36:25.164 --> 00:36:27.065 align:middle line:84%
And yes, there are
giants buried there.

00:36:27.065 --> 00:36:28.940 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's funny
going to a shop in London

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:31.990 align:middle line:84%
and asking for a map of
Wiltshire, and you get a map,

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and there are giant's graves
marked all over the place,

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:35.940 align:middle line:90%
even to this very day.

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:38.150 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of them don't
have anybody in them.

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And again, it depends on the
orientation of the mound.

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:42.410 align:middle line:84%
So if you're looking
at the East-West,

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:44.120 align:middle line:84%
the equinox position,
which is actually

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:47.120 align:middle line:84%
aligned to the rising of
Venus before the equinox

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:50.157 align:middle line:84%
in the spring, there's the
mark of the risen initiate.

00:36:50.157 --> 00:36:51.740 align:middle line:84%
I thought that those
mounds in Britain

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:53.656 align:middle line:84%
were actually some of
the oldest in the world.

00:36:53.656 --> 00:36:55.850 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that the
oldest mounds are actually

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:57.320 align:middle line:90%
around the Black Sea area.

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.360 align:middle line:84%
There was a culture
that was allegedly

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.730 align:middle line:84%
older than the Egyptians
called the Scythians.

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And we're now getting more
information from there

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:06.224 align:middle line:84%
now that we have a more
openness on the internet.

00:37:06.224 --> 00:37:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And we're getting
more information

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:08.910 align:middle line:90%
that part of the world.

00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And their mounds
are truly cyclopean.

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And there was one mound, which
I'm particularly taken with,

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:17.420 align:middle line:84%
where they found it, it
was completely unexcavated.

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:19.130 align:middle line:84%
They went to the
inside chambers.

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:20.060 align:middle line:90%
No one found inside.

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing.

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:23.235 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: But they found these
beautiful little gold cups.

00:37:23.235 --> 00:37:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And they're beautifully
adorned with a picture,

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:27.620 align:middle line:84%
a very interesting
subject matter,

00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:30.950 align:middle line:84%
of an old bearded man stabbing
a younger man on the neck.

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nice.

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:33.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Right here.

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, that reminds me of a
lot of the stuff from Sumeria

00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:39.140 align:middle line:84%
and Babylonia, where you
had exactly the same image

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:41.240 align:middle line:84%
of a man stabbing
the bull in the neck

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:43.130 align:middle line:84%
with corn coming
out of the spine.

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:44.630 align:middle line:90%
You think, that's weird.

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:47.240 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me of Theseus
and the Minotaur in Crete.

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:49.400 align:middle line:84%
These are all
initiation symbols.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out
that the cups were

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:54.370 align:middle line:84%
found to be laced with
narcotics, which is exactly

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:56.120 align:middle line:84%
the kind of narcotics
that were being used

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.010 align:middle line:90%
for the out-of-body journeying.

00:37:58.010 --> 00:38:00.800 align:middle line:84%
So, it matches with the
image on the cups, which

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:04.190 align:middle line:84%
suggest that the cup was used
during an initiation, where

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:05.570 align:middle line:90%
you are basically--

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:09.562 align:middle line:84%
your older self is stabbing
your immature self in the neck,

00:38:09.562 --> 00:38:11.270 align:middle line:84%
because when you go
into the other world,

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:12.894 align:middle line:84%
and you come back
with the information,

00:38:12.894 --> 00:38:14.382 align:middle line:84%
with specialist
knowledge, you come

00:38:14.382 --> 00:38:15.590 align:middle line:90%
back much more knowledgeable.

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:17.180 align:middle line:90%
You're no longer mature.

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:18.740 align:middle line:84%
You're killing
that immature self.

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:20.990 align:middle line:84%
You're now a learned
individual, which

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:24.920 align:middle line:84%
is why you had these figures
of a bearded man on the cup.

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:29.270 align:middle line:84%
So this again gets found
in Cyprus, in Crete,

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:32.160 align:middle line:84%
in the Near East, exactly
in the same format.

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
symbolism tell you

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:35.960 align:middle line:84%
about what's going
on on this planet,

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:39.410 align:middle line:84%
because it seems to be in
every region of the world?

00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:40.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:42.630 align:middle line:90%
I think it's an ongoing process.

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:44.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the more I
travel, the more I see it,

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:48.650 align:middle line:84%
whether it's in the Yucatan,
in Peru, in the Far East.

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's the fact that
the human condition really

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:54.520 align:middle line:84%
is the same condition that
it was for 50,000 years,

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.140 align:middle line:84%
that we've come here
basically to be better people.

00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:59.920 align:middle line:84%
We come here as flesh
and blood people.

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.864 align:middle line:90%
A soul inhabits your body.

00:39:01.864 --> 00:39:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And you have no idea what
you're doing for half your life.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:06.488 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is to basically
get a sense of awareness

00:39:06.488 --> 00:39:09.560 align:middle line:84%
of the bigger picture so you
can leave as a better person.

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:13.070 align:middle line:84%
It sounds very basic and
very new-age and fluffy,

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:14.450 align:middle line:90%
but it actually is quite true.

00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And I found that
also for myself,

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:18.080 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not just
writing about this stuff.

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:19.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm actually living in it.

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And I actually found that
doing this, bit by bit,

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:24.290 align:middle line:84%
going for these
places, I certainly do

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:26.900 align:middle line:84%
realize I am slowly
becoming a better person.

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:30.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm not perfect yet, working
on it, like all of us.

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:33.890 align:middle line:84%
But there is a sense that you
do become much more enlightened

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:35.460 align:middle line:90%
as you go through the years.

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
it, you're supposed

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:39.992 align:middle line:84%
to leave your body in a
better condition than when

00:39:39.992 --> 00:39:41.450 align:middle line:84%
you arrived and
hopefully you leave

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:43.460 align:middle line:84%
the world in a better condition
than when you arrived.

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that
was their goal.

00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:46.069 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And that
was the only goal.

00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:48.710 align:middle line:84%
It sounds so simple, and
yet it's so hard to master.

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have we gotten it close
to what they did in those days?

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:55.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, I don't know.

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:59.270 align:middle line:84%
I want to say yes, because
I travel a lot and I see--

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:00.770 align:middle line:84%
you read the headlines
in the paper.

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:02.470 align:middle line:90%
It's always doom and gloom.

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Constantly.

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I worked in the
media for many, many years.

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:06.200 align:middle line:90%
I know how it works.

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.857 align:middle line:84%
There is this sort of
challenge to sell newspapers.

00:40:08.857 --> 00:40:10.440 align:middle line:84%
You have to, basically,
to make money.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's got
to be dramatic.

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:13.456 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And you have
to dramatize everything.

00:40:13.456 --> 00:40:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Good news rarely
makes the headlines.

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And it came to the point of
view that it really comes down

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:22.280 align:middle line:84%
to the fact that
on a local level,

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.530 align:middle line:84%
there's many, many
poor people like us who

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:26.220 align:middle line:90%
are doing the right thing.

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:29.075 align:middle line:84%
One of my biggest mailing
lists is actually in Ohio,

00:40:29.075 --> 00:40:29.875 align:middle line:90%
conservative--

00:40:29.875 --> 00:40:30.675 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:40:30.675 --> 00:40:31.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: --little Ohio.

00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:34.400 align:middle line:84%
I have spoken to more
people in small little towns

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:37.580 align:middle line:84%
you've never heard of than
anywhere else in the world.

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And they come out
of the woodwork.

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And people are doing
the right thing.

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:41.774 align:middle line:84%
You never get to
hear about them.

00:40:41.774 --> 00:40:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And that to me tells me that
we're actually far more ahead

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.404 align:middle line:90%
than we actually think we are.

00:40:46.404 --> 00:40:48.320 align:middle line:84%
I think we're actually
pretty close to hitting

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:50.030 align:middle line:90%
a certain critical mass.

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:51.110 align:middle line:90%
We're not that far off.

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:53.480 align:middle line:84%
It's just, you don't
get to hear about us.

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our dear friend
Erich von Daniken,

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.300 align:middle line:84%
author of "Chariot
of the Gods?"--

00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:58.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Who?

00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:01.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --has a lot to say.

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:01.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Cusco.

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.950 align:middle line:90%
Cusco is a city in Peru.

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:05.780 align:middle line:10%
And Cusco is known to tourists.

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:09.290 align:middle line:10%
And all the tourists are
shown the Wall of Cusco.

00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:12.140 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
Wall of Saksaywaman.

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:13.340 align:middle line:90%
It's an Inca wall.

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:16.742 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:41:16.742 --> 00:41:24.050 align:middle line:90%


00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:27.260 align:middle line:10%
But soon as you turn your
back to the Inca wall,

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:31.940 align:middle line:10%
and you just move a few hundred
meters, you scrap into rocks.

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:36.260 align:middle line:10%
And you see all these rocks are
cut artificially, absolutely

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:37.240 align:middle line:10%
precise.

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:39.780 align:middle line:10%
You stand before
gigantic blocks,

00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:42.170 align:middle line:10%
which are standing upside down.

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:44.320 align:middle line:10%
For example, you
have staircases.

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:47.080 align:middle line:10%
Stairs, and the
block is on the head,

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:49.880 align:middle line:10%
so the staircases are coming
down from the ceiling.

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:53.660 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:57.830 align:middle line:10%
It was a technology,
prehistoric technology, which

00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:00.480 align:middle line:10%
definitely came from the gods.

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.504 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: I love this place.

00:42:02.504 --> 00:42:03.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:04.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: I love this place.

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:05.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But what's its purpose?

00:42:05.770 --> 00:42:08.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Saksaywaman
was a big mystery to me

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:10.100 align:middle line:84%
until I began to
get into the concept

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:12.489 align:middle line:90%
of the art of resurrection.

00:42:12.489 --> 00:42:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And then I when I looked at
it from this point of view,

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:17.330 align:middle line:84%
everything made a lot of sense,
because Saksaywaman is not

00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:18.900 align:middle line:90%
by itself.

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:20.960 align:middle line:84%
You have to basically
start at the Koricancha

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:25.130 align:middle line:84%
in Cusco, which is 800 feet
further lower down, the navel

00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:26.780 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth, one of them.

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:29.090 align:middle line:10%
You put a pin there on the map.

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:31.520 align:middle line:10%
Everything comes in perfect
triangles, I've discovered.

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.830 align:middle line:10%
All these temples
come in triangles.

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:37.040 align:middle line:84%
The second point is in
this little hollowed

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:40.210 align:middle line:84%
out limestone butte
called Kenko up the hill.

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:42.890 align:middle line:84%
There is an S-shaped
chamber where

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:45.230 align:middle line:84%
they used to actually do
out-of-body ceremonies

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:46.930 align:middle line:90%
and rituals.

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:49.280 align:middle line:84%
The passages follow the
rising and the setting

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.920 align:middle line:84%
of the equinox sun,
which again tells me it's

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:53.330 align:middle line:90%
an initiation place.

00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:54.770 align:middle line:90%
So you put a pin there.

00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:57.110 align:middle line:84%
The third pin that forms
a perfect triangle,

00:42:57.110 --> 00:43:00.530 align:middle line:84%
and I mean perfect, is
exactly in a horseshoe,

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:02.640 align:middle line:84%
which is the oldest
part of Saksaywaman.

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:04.680 align:middle line:84%
So this is part of a
huge ritual complex.

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who would
think of all this?

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:06.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: I know.

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:07.550 align:middle line:90%
It's extraordinary.

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:09.050 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
television and apps

00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:10.970 align:middle line:84%
to refresh every six
months, did they?

00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're like architects
of the past, these people.

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:15.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:17.780 align:middle line:84%
But the biggest surprise
about Saksaywaman

00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:19.590 align:middle line:84%
is its original
name, what it means.

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:22.190 align:middle line:84%
It means the place of
the satisfied falcon.

00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, falcons don't
figure in Andean law.

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:27.470 align:middle line:90%
Condors do, not falcons.

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:28.560 align:middle line:90%
That's your first clue.

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, why would
a falcon be satisfied?

00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Because that's an
Egyptian phrase.

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:36.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, what would an Egyptian
phrase be doing here?

00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:38.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, the falcon in
Egypt is of course Horus,

00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:41.900 align:middle line:84%
who is the representation
of the risen god-man Osiris.

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, my
god, if you actually

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:48.740 align:middle line:84%
look above Saksaywaman, look
at those corrugated walls,

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:51.440 align:middle line:84%
there used to be a second-- a
mirror image on the other side

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:53.310 align:middle line:84%
before the Spanish
took everything down.

00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, the walls
are not built by the Inca.

00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:57.140 align:middle line:84%
They were built way, way,
way, way before the Inca.

00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:58.310 align:middle line:90%
Way before.

00:43:58.310 --> 00:44:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And from the air, they actually
resemble the wings of a falcon.

00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
oh my god, we're

00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:06.140 align:middle line:84%
looking at the actual
shape of the bird.

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And when you actually stand
on top of the Saksaywaman

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:10.990 align:middle line:84%
and you look at the
actual angles of the wall,

00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:14.300 align:middle line:84%
where it stops, they are
aligned to the solstices,

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:16.730 align:middle line:84%
which is, again, another
initiation position.

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And then the center alignment
is not exactly East-West.

00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:22.160 align:middle line:84%
It's just five
degrees off, which

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:24.650 align:middle line:84%
enables it to be
aligned to Venus rising

00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:28.040 align:middle line:84%
before the sun, which, again,
is another initiation position.

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
this tell you?

00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:33.470 align:middle line:84%
About what's been happening
on this planet in the past

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:34.434 align:middle line:90%
and in the future?

00:44:34.434 --> 00:44:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, the fact
that spiritual evolution

00:44:36.350 --> 00:44:38.130 align:middle line:90%
is an ongoing process.

00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:39.965 align:middle line:84%
It's a constant process
of self-development

00:44:39.965 --> 00:44:43.766 align:middle line:84%
and polishing that rough
stone into a polished diamond.

00:44:43.766 --> 00:44:44.890 align:middle line:90%
We're still doing it today.

00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:47.040 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be doing
this for a long, long time.

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's a constant
evolutionary process

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:50.600 align:middle line:90%
that needs time and patience.

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:53.602 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Tell me a little bit
about the Nag Hammadi texts.

00:44:53.602 --> 00:44:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, Nag Hammadi
is very interesting.

00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:58.280 align:middle line:84%
It was very uncomfortable
for the Church

00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:00.580 align:middle line:84%
when this stuff
was discovered by--

00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:01.439 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:45:01.439 --> 00:45:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Because it
talks about things that

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:04.850 align:middle line:90%
are not mentioned in the Bible.

00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:06.433 align:middle line:84%
You have to remember
that the Bible is

00:45:06.433 --> 00:45:09.650 align:middle line:84%
a very selective series of
books written by a bunch of guys

00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:11.120 align:middle line:90%
who had a certain agenda.

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:13.820 align:middle line:84%
When you start looking at
why the Church was wiping out

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:16.190 align:middle line:84%
the gnostic Christians,
and realizing

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:18.420 align:middle line:84%
what the gnostic
Christians were writing,

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:21.270 align:middle line:84%
and why they hid it to make sure
that a future generation would

00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:23.690 align:middle line:84%
discover the truth,
it becomes very

00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:26.120 align:middle line:84%
clear as to why the
Church was very upset.

00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:29.240 align:middle line:84%
Because first of all, there
were gospels like the Gospel

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:31.310 align:middle line:90%
of Seth, which talks--

00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:33.440 align:middle line:84%
well, it actually has
a section about Jesus

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:35.990 align:middle line:84%
watching his own crucifixion,
having a chat with Peter,

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:38.650 align:middle line:84%
saying it's not me up there
that's getting crucified.

00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:40.280 align:middle line:90%
It's another guy called Simon.

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:43.000 align:middle line:84%
It's someone else who's drinking
the vinegar and the gall,

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.780 align:middle line:84%
someone else having
the crown of thorns

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:46.790 align:middle line:90%
put on top of their head.

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:49.719 align:middle line:84%
And I was laughing at
their ignorance, he says.

00:45:49.719 --> 00:45:51.260 align:middle line:84%
That's very
uncomfortable, because it

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:53.450 align:middle line:84%
says that Jesus did
not actually physically

00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:54.530 align:middle line:90%
get nailed to a cross.

00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And the Quran
agrees, by the way.

00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And the Quran actually
has a lot of reverence

00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:59.390 align:middle line:90%
for Jesus, by the way.

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:01.400 align:middle line:90%
Not many people know this.

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:03.290 align:middle line:84%
So all these things
are very uncomfortable,

00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:05.810 align:middle line:84%
because it shows, yet again,
like the Gospel of Thomas,

00:46:05.810 --> 00:46:09.740 align:middle line:84%
the Gospel of Philip, that there
was a mystical appreciation

00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:10.550 align:middle line:90%
of Christianity.

00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And the roots of Christianity
are far, far older

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:14.341 align:middle line:90%
than we give it credit for.

00:46:14.341 --> 00:46:15.590 align:middle line:90%
The Church couldn't have that.

00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:17.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's get
Gregg Braden's take

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:20.600 align:middle line:84%
on this from his Gaia series,
"Ancient Civilizations."

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:23.960 align:middle line:90%


00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Nag Hammadi is a small
village along the Nile River

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:28.030 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt.

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:31.370 align:middle line:10%
And a young boy was
tasked by his mother

00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:33.350 align:middle line:10%
to find kindling,
which was in very

00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:35.330 align:middle line:10%
short supply, because
there are very few trees.

00:46:35.330 --> 00:46:37.400 align:middle line:10%
There's no forests that
grow along the Nile River

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.680 align:middle line:10%
in that part of Egypt.

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:42.590 align:middle line:10%
Being very resourceful,
he went to what

00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:44.750 align:middle line:10%
he knew were old grave
sites and old tombs.

00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:51.410 align:middle line:10%
And he found papyrus
books that were bound.

00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:54.040 align:middle line:10%
These are the gnostic texts.

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:56.115 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't until
someone recognized--

00:46:56.115 --> 00:47:00.050 align:middle line:10%
a neighbor recognized
what it was that he had--

00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:03.027 align:middle line:10%
that Department of Antiquities
in Cairo became aware.

00:47:03.027 --> 00:47:04.610 align:middle line:10%
And of course, they
moved very quickly

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:07.250 align:middle line:10%
to preserve the
remaining documents.

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:11.660 align:middle line:10%
So the Nag Hammadi library,
it is the most complete record

00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:13.400 align:middle line:10%
of the Old Testament.

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.410 align:middle line:10%
And the reason it's
so controversial

00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:18.680 align:middle line:10%
is because it contains many
of the books that have not

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:21.020 align:middle line:10%
been seen since the
Church edited them

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:23.960 align:middle line:10%
in the fourth century.

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:25.707 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating work.

00:47:25.707 --> 00:47:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And John Allegro, who is one
of the scholars deciphering

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:31.880 align:middle line:84%
the texts, he broke ranks
with the other people.

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And he said there's a
huge conspiracy of silence

00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:36.154 align:middle line:84%
here, because the Church
is spending millions

00:47:36.154 --> 00:47:38.570 align:middle line:84%
making sure that this stuff
doesn't come out, because it's

00:47:38.570 --> 00:47:40.430 align:middle line:84%
going to undermine
the entire structure

00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:42.890 align:middle line:84%
and foundation of the
Church, because it talks

00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:45.350 align:middle line:84%
about things that the
Church is not discussing

00:47:45.350 --> 00:47:48.710 align:middle line:84%
and also saying that Christ
was a real person, not a god.

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And also the experience
that he was describing

00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:52.760 align:middle line:90%
was mystical, not physical.

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:53.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
want to hear that.

00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely not.

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And it puts the whole emphasis
on a matriarchal line, not

00:47:57.830 --> 00:47:59.150 align:middle line:90%
a patriarchal line.

00:47:59.150 --> 00:48:00.530 align:middle line:90%
Very, very uncomfortable.

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:02.720 align:middle line:90%
So, well done, John Allegro.

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:05.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Over 300 comparisons
between the stories

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:08.134 align:middle line:90%
of Krishna and Jesus.

00:48:08.134 --> 00:48:09.050 align:middle line:90%
What's that all about?

00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:09.912 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh dear.

00:48:09.912 --> 00:48:11.120 align:middle line:90%
Very uncomfortable, isn't it?

00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:13.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:16.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look at the
story of Krishna, and in fact

00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:18.410 align:middle line:84%
not just Krishna
but also Mithra,

00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:20.480 align:middle line:84%
which is the older
iteration of that story--

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:24.870 align:middle line:84%
it goes back to 6000 BC now,
as far as I can figure it out.

00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:26.390 align:middle line:84%
It's also found
in Central America

00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:28.335 align:middle line:90%
with Kukulkan and Quetzalcoatl.

00:48:28.335 --> 00:48:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's all the same.

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's all the same
person, or the same concept,

00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:36.590 align:middle line:84%
which is then regurgitated by
a physical person following

00:48:36.590 --> 00:48:38.130 align:middle line:90%
that spiritual tradition.

00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:41.610 align:middle line:84%
So the story I love to hear is
actually about Quetzalcoatal

00:48:41.610 --> 00:48:43.110 align:middle line:84%
when the Spanish
show up and they're

00:48:43.110 --> 00:48:48.270 align:middle line:84%
teaching Jesus that gets risen
from the dead in the equinox.

00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:51.320 align:middle line:84%
He's born in the
cave to a virgin.

00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And then he goes away for
40 years in the wild--

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:54.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry- 40 days
in the wilderness.

00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:55.660 align:middle line:90%
He comes back.

00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:58.809 align:middle line:84%
He rides an ass, goes on top of
a hill, gets nailed to a cross,

00:48:58.809 --> 00:49:01.100 align:middle line:84%
goes into the other world,
comes back three days later,

00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:02.270 align:middle line:90%
risen from the dead.

00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And the locals said, you've
only just picked up that story?

00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:07.297 align:middle line:84%
We've had it for a
very, very long time.

00:49:07.297 --> 00:49:09.380 align:middle line:84%
I would have loved to have
been a fly on the wall.

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Biblically
speaking, there

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:14.660 align:middle line:84%
was a town called Nazareth,
where Jesus apparently

00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:17.030 align:middle line:90%
lived as a child.

00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:18.675 align:middle line:90%
Was that myth or reality?

00:49:18.675 --> 00:49:20.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well,
according to archeology,

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Nazareth really didn't
exist at the time of Jesus.

00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:24.600 align:middle line:84%
It was just a bunch of
caves and some hovels.

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:25.419 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:49:25.419 --> 00:49:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The synagogue
that the Bible

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:29.210 align:middle line:84%
talks about apparently
there's no evidence

00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:31.430 align:middle line:90%
or proof that it ever existed.

00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:33.830 align:middle line:84%
But there was a term that
existed around his time,

00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:36.450 align:middle line:84%
which is called a [NON-ENGLISH],,
which sounds very,

00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:37.400 align:middle line:90%
very similar.

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, the [NON-ENGLISH] turns
out to be the highest level

00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:43.670 align:middle line:84%
of priesthood in
Babylonian times.

00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And to be a [NON-ENGLISH]
literally means to be a keeper

00:49:46.310 --> 00:49:47.960 align:middle line:90%
of divine secrets.

00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:49.900 align:middle line:10%
So, if you're actually
a [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:53.300 align:middle line:10%
it meant you're a high level
initiate of the temple.

00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:56.180 align:middle line:84%
So, by saying Jesus of Nazareth,
you're actually revealing

00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:58.490 align:middle line:84%
the fact that Jesus was
actually a [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:49:58.490 --> 00:50:01.432 align:middle line:84%
Not from Nazareth, he was
actually a [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:50:01.432 --> 00:50:02.765 align:middle line:90%
He was a priest and a preserver.

00:50:02.765 --> 00:50:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, they used to
call him the Nazarene, right?

00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:06.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:07.130 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:09.560 align:middle line:84%
So this thing is actually
2,000 years older

00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:10.670 align:middle line:90%
than the actual Nazareth.

00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:12.419 align:middle line:84%
It goes back to
the Babylonian era.

00:50:12.419 --> 00:50:14.210 align:middle line:84%
So again, it shows that
Jesus was following

00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:16.430 align:middle line:84%
a very old initiatic
tradition, which

00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:19.031 align:middle line:84%
is the same tradition of
John the Baptist as well.

00:50:19.031 --> 00:50:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Knights
Templar, they were always

00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:25.520 align:middle line:84%
looking for secrets, especially
under the Temple Mount.

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:29.496 align:middle line:84%
There was a phrase called
the risen that they used.

00:50:29.496 --> 00:50:30.620 align:middle line:90%
What were they looking for?

00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:33.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Ah, the
Knights Templar.

00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:35.494 align:middle line:84%
Most of them were Cistercian
monks, by the way.

00:50:35.494 --> 00:50:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And in order to
understand the Templars,

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:39.897 align:middle line:84%
you've got to understand
who the Cistercians were

00:50:39.897 --> 00:50:41.480 align:middle line:84%
and their leader
Bernard of Clairvaux.

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:42.969 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've read 500
of his letters,

00:50:42.969 --> 00:50:44.260 align:middle line:90%
got pretty much under his skin.

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 500?

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I do my
work thoroughly.

00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, you do.

00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: I have no life.

00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And basically, I
got under his skin.

00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And I basically realized
this man was a true Christian

00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:57.409 align:middle line:90%
in the real sense of the word.

00:50:57.409 --> 00:50:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to basically
go back and figure out

00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:02.060 align:middle line:84%
what the Essenes were doing
and get the true story.

00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:05.690 align:middle line:84%
So he basically handpicked
most of the Templars,

00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:08.270 align:middle line:90%
who were half Cistercian monks.

00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And they basically knew
what to look for when

00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:11.912 align:middle line:90%
they went to Jerusalem.

00:51:11.912 --> 00:51:12.870 align:middle line:90%
They weren't crusaders.

00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:15.170 align:middle line:84%
They were very different
from the crusaders.

00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:18.350 align:middle line:84%
They used the Crusades as a
means to get into Temple Mount.

00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:20.120 align:middle line:84%
They knew exactly where
they were digging.

00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:22.287 align:middle line:84%
And this was proved by
archaeological digs recently.

00:51:22.287 --> 00:51:24.578 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they looking
for the Ark of the Covenant?

00:51:24.578 --> 00:51:25.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: I'm not sure.

00:51:25.610 --> 00:51:27.260 align:middle line:84%
I am much more
convinced that they

00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:30.470 align:middle line:84%
were looking for actual
spiritual treasure,

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:32.270 align:middle line:90%
because they're already rich.

00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:35.870 align:middle line:84%
They gave up their money to
pool it into a central resource

00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:37.130 align:middle line:90%
to become poor.

00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:40.220 align:middle line:84%
To go into the Holy
Land to dig in really

00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:43.820 align:middle line:84%
hot and unfavorable
conditions to discover money,

00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:45.320 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't make sense.

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Seems to me that
when you actually

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.440 align:middle line:90%
look at the word treasure--

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:51.130 align:middle line:84%
the original word
treasure-- it actually means

00:51:51.130 --> 00:51:54.770 align:middle line:84%
at the [NON-ENGLISH],, which
means a library of treasure,

00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:57.020 align:middle line:90%
a library of words and scrolls.

00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:59.510 align:middle line:84%
I think they went there
to look for the scrolls

00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:00.710 align:middle line:90%
that the Essenes had hidden.

00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:02.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was the treasure.

00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: That was
the real treasure.

00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:05.200 align:middle line:90%
They also found money.

00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:06.380 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt about that.

00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:07.460 align:middle line:90%
That's proven.

00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:09.380 align:middle line:84%
But their real
treasure was spiritual.

00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:11.300 align:middle line:90%
It was in here.

00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:13.160 align:middle line:84%
Because for them,
the whole purpose

00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:15.410 align:middle line:84%
was to experience
another level of being.

00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And when you put that in context
of central Europe at that era,

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.990 align:middle line:84%
in the 12th century,
Europe was a mess.

00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:22.310 align:middle line:90%
It was a disaster zone.

00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:25.110 align:middle line:84%
It was an economy based
on plunder and death.

00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:27.590 align:middle line:84%
So, for them to discover
a spiritual treasure

00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:30.350 align:middle line:84%
meant that they could
actually create a new kingdom

00:52:30.350 --> 00:52:32.770 align:middle line:90%
on Earth, a new Jerusalem.

00:52:32.770 --> 00:52:34.580 align:middle line:90%
And that was their stated fact.

00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:37.070 align:middle line:90%
So they had two brotherhoods--

00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:39.700 align:middle line:84%
an outer brotherhood that
took care of business

00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:41.200 align:middle line:84%
and an inner
brotherhood who behaved

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:44.990 align:middle line:84%
like a magisterial college--
sorry, a ministerial college.

00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And they basically acted like a
secret society, a society apart

00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:51.990 align:middle line:84%
from everybody else,
the few above the many,

00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:53.930 align:middle line:84%
and here were taught
the special secrets

00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:55.580 align:middle line:84%
in special chambers,
which I found

00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:58.340 align:middle line:84%
in Portugal of all places,
which is a country they created

00:52:58.340 --> 00:52:59.720 align:middle line:90%
from scratch.

00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And in these chambers,
they actually

00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:03.080 align:middle line:90%
did the risen ceremonies.

00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And at the end, the brotherhoods
that went into these chambers

00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:08.270 align:middle line:84%
were declared reason,
exactly as you'd

00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:10.880 align:middle line:84%
find in the third degree of
Freemasonry, which of course

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:12.480 align:middle line:90%
are the Templar's progeny.

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:13.700 align:middle line:90%
So, there's your connection.

00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:15.740 align:middle line:84%
They were looking for
a spiritual treasure

00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:19.010 align:middle line:84%
on the Temple Mount buried
there by the Essenes who

00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:21.470 align:middle line:84%
were following the same
concept, which they called

00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:24.350 align:middle line:84%
the way, which was the same
concept that was basically

00:53:24.350 --> 00:53:27.320 align:middle line:84%
followed by the
Chinese in 3000 BC

00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:30.410 align:middle line:84%
by a group called the
Gentleman of the Way.

00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:33.174 align:middle line:84%
You see how this big tradition
is going on over 4,000 years--

00:53:33.174 --> 00:53:34.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a long time.

00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:36.048 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --by different
groups of people.

00:53:36.048 --> 00:53:38.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the living
resurrection ritual

00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:40.460 align:middle line:90%
still going on now?

00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:42.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: In certain
parts of the world, yes--

00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:42.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:53:42.830 --> 00:53:44.246 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --by
indigenous cultures.

00:53:44.246 --> 00:53:47.406 align:middle line:84%
You'd have to go to the
Amazon, the Yucatan.

00:53:47.406 --> 00:53:48.530 align:middle line:90%
It's still being practiced.

00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:49.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With narcotics?

00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: With narcotics.

00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:52.640 align:middle line:84%
One of them is
called [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:54.770 align:middle line:84%
which is like this
honey-flavored drink.

00:53:54.770 --> 00:53:56.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How about ayahuasca?

00:53:56.330 --> 00:53:58.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Ayahuasca-- see,
that's what I asked myself

00:53:58.550 --> 00:53:59.450 align:middle line:90%
when I was writing the book.

00:53:59.450 --> 00:54:01.100 align:middle line:84%
How does this differ
from shamanism?

00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:02.160 align:middle line:10%
Is it the same thing?

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:03.590 align:middle line:10%
It turns out it's not.

00:54:03.590 --> 00:54:06.830 align:middle line:10%
Most shamanic
experience is actually

00:54:06.830 --> 00:54:10.990 align:middle line:10%
a way to actually have an
induced visionary experience.

00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:12.770 align:middle line:84%
The living
resurrection experience

00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:16.550 align:middle line:84%
was actually an actual physical
experience, but by your soul

00:54:16.550 --> 00:54:17.910 align:middle line:90%
rather than your body.

00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:19.880 align:middle line:84%
So just like you and I
are talking right now,

00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:22.520 align:middle line:84%
we were having this
experience on a soul level.

00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:24.620 align:middle line:90%
That's not what shamanism is.

00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:27.200 align:middle line:10%
So ayahuasca is kind
of a means to create

00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:29.930 align:middle line:10%
an illusionary environment,
which you will still

00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:34.250 align:middle line:10%
get visions and information
to a certain degree.

00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:35.870 align:middle line:84%
But the true
resurrection experience

00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:37.820 align:middle line:84%
was actually a
physical experience

00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:39.980 align:middle line:90%
experienced by your soul alone.

00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Very, very real on
another dimensional level.

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:44.090 align:middle line:90%
And you're able to come back.

00:54:44.090 --> 00:54:45.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's still ongoing?

00:54:45.590 --> 00:54:47.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And it's still
ongoing in parts of the Pacific

00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:48.340 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:49.249 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:54:49.249 --> 00:54:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Freddy, thanks
for being on the program.

00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:53.067 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: My pleasure.

00:54:53.067 --> 00:54:55.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who knows what these
structures really are for?

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:57.110 align:middle line:10%
As Freddy has been
saying, they would

00:54:57.110 --> 00:55:01.100 align:middle line:10%
go inside and not find any
bodies, not find any skeletons.

00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:03.260 align:middle line:84%
But there was truly
a purpose or reason

00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:05.540 align:middle line:90%
for building these structures.

00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:07.160 align:middle line:84%
One day, we'll
get those answers.

00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:10.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
