>>JIMMY CHURCH:
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jimmy Church.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.350 align:middle line:84%
You might know me from Into
The Vortex right here on Gaia.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.660 align:middle line:10%
And I'm honored to
be guest hosting

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.270 align:middle line:10%
for George Noory on this
episode of Beyond Belief.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Joining me today is Jason
Quitt, an esoteric researcher

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.540 align:middle line:84%
and author who's been
exploring energy work

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.360 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual
traditions since 2002.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.260 align:middle line:84%
He's a graduate of the
Institute of Energy Wellness

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.600 align:middle line:84%
and has spent years
teaching and speaking

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.465 align:middle line:84%
around the world on
mysticism, sacred geometry,

00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:49.710 align:middle line:90%
and, of course, ancient history.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.740 align:middle line:84%
His latest book is
Gates of the Anunnaki,

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.610 align:middle line:84%
and it breaks open
ancient texts using

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.280 align:middle line:84%
what he calls the forgotten
language of the stars.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.600 align:middle line:90%
It's all powerful stuff.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And trust me,
you're going to want

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.830 align:middle line:84%
to listen to everything
that we go over today.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the interest
of transparency,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.140 align:middle line:84%
I wrote the foreword
to this book,

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.730 align:middle line:84%
and I did it because the book
is great and it has inspired me.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.280 align:middle line:90%
Jason, welcome to the show.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>>JASON QUITT:
Thanks for having me.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: It's inspired me.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.040 align:middle line:84%
But what inspired you
to write this book?

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.790 align:middle line:10%
>>QUITT: Well, as you know,
I'm always been interested

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.770 align:middle line:10%
in mysticism, and
it always started

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.020 align:middle line:10%
with out-of-body experiences
and different contact,

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.300 align:middle line:10%
altered states of consciousness.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.980 align:middle line:84%
So I really wanted to research
what ancient civilizations

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.350 align:middle line:84%
knew about the
afterlife, what they

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.900 align:middle line:84%
knew about altered states of
consciousness in that world.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.430 align:middle line:10%
So I started to research
ancient Sumeria, ancient Egypt,

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.120 align:middle line:10%
and I'm trying to find
what the ancients knew.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of took me on
a path I wasn't expecting

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.870 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted to look into
the mystical side of things,

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.780 align:middle line:84%
things that are not really
talked about, the esoteric.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And what really pulled
me in a direction

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.300 align:middle line:84%
was I started to see
a relation to the gods

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.780 align:middle line:84%
and goddesses and the
ancient myths to the stars

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.470 align:middle line:84%
and how they were all connected
to the cycles of time,

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.830 align:middle line:84%
to the cycles of the sun and
the moon and the planets,

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.450 align:middle line:84%
and how the different
constellations basically shaped

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.660 align:middle line:84%
and molded ancient philosophies
and ancient mythologies.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's traveled for thousands
of years as information

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.050 align:middle line:84%
into theology and religions
that we know today.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.370 align:middle line:84%
So it really took me on a
path that I wasn't expecting,

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.820 align:middle line:84%
and it opened up this
whole other world to me

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.260 align:middle line:84%
about this language of the stars
and how ancient civilizations

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.890 align:middle line:84%
basically created allegories and
symbolism and myths in relation

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.070 align:middle line:84%
to the as above,
so below principle

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.550 align:middle line:84%
to show that when they look
up in the sky and, let's say,

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.540 align:middle line:84%
they see a certain
constellation,

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.070 align:middle line:84%
something has to be done on
Earth because we have the four

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.830 align:middle line:84%
seasons, everything
changes in cycles,

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.480 align:middle line:84%
that basically they applied the
logic of as above, so below.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And they wrote, when you see
these stars in the skies,

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.980 align:middle line:84%
this is what's
happening on Earth,

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.850 align:middle line:84%
and this is what you
have to have to do.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Were the ancients
hoping that somebody

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.700 align:middle line:84%
like yourself would
see this encoded wisdom

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.480 align:middle line:84%
and then unwrap it and decode
it for us in the future?

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Because it's right
there in plain sight

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.220 align:middle line:84%
and on different continents and
cave walls and temple sites.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.630 align:middle line:84%
It's all right there in
front of us, isn't it?

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.430 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: It is.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And, you know,
our minds and what

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.850 align:middle line:84%
we do today is not what
they used to do in the past.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.470 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at symbols today
or look at artwork, architecture

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.450 align:middle line:84%
today, we put it
in the framework

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.490 align:middle line:90%
of what we believe today.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.240 align:middle line:90%
We put our filters on it.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.510 align:middle line:84%
But in the past, remember,
they didn't have TV.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.640 align:middle line:90%
They looked up at the stars.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.010 align:middle line:84%
So for them studying
the environment,

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.490 align:middle line:84%
studying the cycles
of time, they

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.519 align:middle line:84%
needed to know
this for survival.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.440 align:middle line:84%
It was extremely
important to them.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.930 align:middle line:84%
So for them, it was pretty
obvious when the rainy seasons

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.240 align:middle line:84%
were, when the dry seasons
were, when they should plant,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.620 align:middle line:90%
when they should harvest.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And if you're part of a
farming community today,

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.690 align:middle line:84%
you know how important
that is for their survival.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.260 align:middle line:84%
If you don't plant the
seeds at the right time

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.010 align:middle line:84%
or harvest them
at the right time,

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.740 align:middle line:84%
your population, your
family, can starve.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.430 align:middle line:84%
So it was a matter of
survival to know the stars,

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.400 align:middle line:90%
know the cycles of time.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And they would encode it
in their myths and symbols.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And we find symbology
across the entire globe

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.050 align:middle line:84%
related to the stars
and the cycles,

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.020 align:middle line:84%
mostly connected to
agricultural societies

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.650 align:middle line:84%
and agricultural cycles of when
to plant and when to harvest.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And we still have
these things today

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.200 align:middle line:84%
where we celebrate different
festivals on very specific dates

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.230 align:middle line:90%
of the year.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And these are usually
around the summer solstices,

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.250 align:middle line:84%
mostly around spring
equinox or fall

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.630 align:middle line:84%
equinox, when it's
the time to plant,

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.890 align:middle line:90%
when it's the time to harvest.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.660 align:middle line:84%
So this is ingrained in us
since our earliest ancestors.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: What was
the moment for you

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.190 align:middle line:84%
where you started to
see a correlation?

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.440 align:middle line:84%
Was there a specific degree
or geometry, something

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.450 align:middle line:84%
that just stood out,
that was starting

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.490 align:middle line:84%
to repeat in these
different symbols?

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:41.290 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Yes.

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, my background is
also a graphic designer.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:46.880 align:middle line:90%
That's where I started off.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, when
you're writing a book,

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.590 align:middle line:90%
you take the picture.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, the hieroglyphs
or the artwork.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And I throw it up
on Illustrator,

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.830 align:middle line:84%
and I start tracing it so that
I could have a nice vector line

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.290 align:middle line:84%
art file that I can use in
book and print and whatever.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
ancient saying, if you

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.180 align:middle line:84%
want to know the
truth of something,

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.740 align:middle line:90%
you have to measure it.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's always in
the back of my mind.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.860 align:middle line:84%
So I started to trace
a number of symbols

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.220 align:middle line:84%
from the tombs of ancient
Egypt, and I started

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.850 align:middle line:90%
to see this repeating pattern.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it's me, or maybe
I had a higher guidance,

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.740 align:middle line:84%
but that voice was
basically saying,

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.110 align:middle line:84%
if you want to know the truth
of something, measure it.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And I know that ancient Egypt
is all about measurements,

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.000 align:middle line:84%
like Toth is, the God of
measurements and numbers.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And I can see that they use
the cubit, which is a measuring

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.060 align:middle line:90%
stick in ancient Egypt.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.000 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to start
measuring these angles,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.030 align:middle line:84%
and I kept having this
repeating pattern of a number

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.740 align:middle line:84%
that originally I had no
idea what it was about,

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.220 align:middle line:84%
but this number kept coming
up over and over when

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.460 align:middle line:84%
I was doing these illustrations,
and it was 23.5 degrees.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And I just did a quick
Google search really

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.570 align:middle line:90%
to figure this out.

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And every person
should know this.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.710 align:middle line:84%
It's the tilt of the Earth,
and the tilt of the Earth

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.790 align:middle line:90%
is 23.5 degrees.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And because the
Earth is tilted, this

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.250 align:middle line:90%
is where we get our seasons.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.570 align:middle line:84%
This is where we
get the solar cycle.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:24.300 align:middle line:90%
It's a very, very ancient key.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And what blew my mind is we're
not supposed to know about this.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:33.480 align:middle line:84%
As in the ancient people
who knew this information,

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.070 align:middle line:84%
how did they know the Earth
was 23.5 degrees tilted?

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:38.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: It seems
impossible, doesn't it?

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.230 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: It seems outlandish
because how could they

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:44.870 align:middle line:84%
measure these very
specific things

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:47.870 align:middle line:84%
and then spread it from
culture to culture?

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And again, in our
education system,

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.180 align:middle line:84%
we're taught that this
information was found out about

00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:00.440 align:middle line:84%
2,000 years ago, and
it's given to Greeks.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, if the Egyptians
had this measurement

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.010 align:middle line:84%
all over their
artwork, and I can

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.350 align:middle line:84%
find this going back
even to ancient Sumeria

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.880 align:middle line:84%
and other locations
around the planet,

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.500 align:middle line:84%
it means that there is this
worldwide understanding

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:20.700 align:middle line:84%
of the division of the heavens,
the measurements of the Earth,

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:25.740 align:middle line:84%
and that our ancestors
across all religions,

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:29.720 align:middle line:84%
all different peoples, they
had a fundamental knowledge

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.000 align:middle line:84%
of the stars in
the Earth, a very

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.030 align:middle line:84%
precise mathematical
foundation of this.

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And they encoded it within their
architecture, their artwork,

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:43.760 align:middle line:90%
and even in their myths.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.177 align:middle line:84%
They put these sacred numbers
directly in their myths.

00:08:47.177 --> 00:08:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Well, there
is a big question that

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.210 align:middle line:90%
has to be asked at this point.

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's fundamental and it's
non-trivial, which is, were they

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.070 align:middle line:90%
taught these cosmic cycles?

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.560 align:middle line:90%
Were they taught this cosmology?

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:06.300 align:middle line:84%
Or did they have the technology
to figure this out on their own?

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Either answer to that is
extraordinary, isn't it?

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.120 align:middle line:84%
Which way do you
think this is going?

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I think this goes
into the ancient mystical

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:19.350 align:middle line:84%
understanding that the
body is the image of god,

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.500 align:middle line:84%
or the body is the
measuring tool of the cosmos

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.550 align:middle line:84%
and our body is built
fundamentally on very

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:27.600 align:middle line:90%
sacred geometry proportions.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And that to measure
the sky, for example,

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.710 align:middle line:84%
a very simple thing is you
could take your arm and hand

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.980 align:middle line:84%
and put it in front of you, like
they teach you in the scouts.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And from your eye to
your hand, just like

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.630 align:middle line:84%
from your eye to your
hand to the horizon

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.190 align:middle line:90%
equals 15 degrees of sky.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.910 align:middle line:84%
So you can divide the heavens
15 degrees using your hand.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And that equals 1 hour of time
of the movement of the sun

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:54.670 align:middle line:90%
through the sky.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:59.070 align:middle line:84%
So I would say the first
technological instrument

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:02.250 align:middle line:84%
that ancient humans used
to measure and plot out

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.860 align:middle line:84%
everything was just
their human body itself.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:11.010 align:middle line:84%
They used their arm, hand,
to create a measuring system

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:12.790 align:middle line:90%
to divide heaven and Earth.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And even the ancient
cubit, the Egyptian cubit--

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.610 align:middle line:84%
and the cubit was
even used in Sumeria--

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:22.020 align:middle line:84%
you have pictures of ancient
Sumerian gods holding

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.340 align:middle line:84%
the cubit rod, which
if you measured it,

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.280 align:middle line:84%
it was the length from the
elbow to the tip of the finger.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.850 align:middle line:84%
So they would use this
measurement, the arm

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:33.780 align:middle line:84%
and the hand, to basically
measure heaven and Earth.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: When we look at what
appears to be an ancient star

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.892 align:middle line:84%
language now, that's
what we're talking about,

00:10:39.892 --> 00:10:42.350 align:middle line:84%
and you have the gods of Sumer,
you have the gods of Egypt,

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.890 align:middle line:84%
but you also have the
gods around the world

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:49.150 align:middle line:84%
with other cultures,
all using 23.5

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:52.310 align:middle line:84%
degrees and other
instances, too, as well.

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:54.950 align:middle line:84%
But they weren't
communicating with each other.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.060 align:middle line:84%
Sumer and Egypt are
very close, but they

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.020 align:middle line:90%
weren't sharing information.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.520 align:middle line:84%
So it seems that either
somebody taught them this

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.880 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, or there
was something else going on

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.200 align:middle line:84%
and it was happening
globally, wasn't it?

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Yes.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And you know, this
begs the question,

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:15.370 align:middle line:84%
was there a heritage
of knowledge

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:18.800 align:middle line:84%
that came before all of this and
was spread throughout the world?

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.170 align:middle line:84%
Or you get to this other
theory of let's say,

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:24.880 align:middle line:84%
like a mass casualty
event, where

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.110 align:middle line:84%
people had to rebuild
across the planet,

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:29.890 align:middle line:84%
and then you had these teachers
that held the knowledge that

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:34.070 align:middle line:84%
would travel from group to
group to reteach civilization.

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:37.980 align:middle line:84%
I think both of
these are plausible,

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.920 align:middle line:84%
but again, it is
an absolute mystery

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:47.910 align:middle line:84%
how civilizations separated
by sea and thousands of miles

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.100 align:middle line:84%
would actually
have this knowledge

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.880 align:middle line:90%
and design it the same way.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And I know we're going to get
deeper into symbolism here.

00:11:55.810 --> 00:12:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And there is symbolism that
is identical from, let's say,

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.380 align:middle line:84%
going to Bolivia
to Egypt to Sumer,

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.540 align:middle line:84%
it goes back all the way to
the most ancient cultures,

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:09.090 align:middle line:90%
even going back to Gobekli Tepe.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:13.210 align:middle line:84%
So again, where is that
original knowledge coming from?

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And again, where do those
symbols come from originally?

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:20.080 align:middle line:90%
And what do they actually mean?

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.760 align:middle line:84%
So this is the mystery to
me, and this is the path

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.340 align:middle line:84%
that I'm trying to follow,
is to understand where

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.940 align:middle line:90%
do these symbols come from.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And the answer that keeps
popping up over and over again

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:36.640 align:middle line:84%
is it's related to the stars
and the cycles of time.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Are those
symbols, for them,

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:47.600 align:middle line:84%
during that period, a recipe,
a preservation of knowledge,

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:53.180 align:middle line:84%
or were they created in
stone for us in the future?

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.950 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I love this
question because a lot

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:59.950 align:middle line:84%
of these artifacts, a
lot of these depictions

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:02.830 align:middle line:84%
are found in the sealed
tombs, especially

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:04.450 align:middle line:90%
in the Valley of the Kings.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:10.200 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like they created
this time capsule for somebody

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.000 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, we lost
all information.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.310 align:middle line:84%
We have those depictions
that if we study them,

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:20.080 align:middle line:84%
we start to learn
about all these things.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.480 align:middle line:84%
The monuments themselves
are incredible.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:27.850 align:middle line:84%
They built megalithic
monuments with these numbers

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:32.330 align:middle line:84%
in mind, with these alignments
to the stars in mind.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's literally-- you
could say, well, what's

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.290 align:middle line:90%
the secret of the pyramids.

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a simple question.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:42.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you just look at the
dimensions, where it's located

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:47.410 align:middle line:84%
and what they depict,
it's giving us

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:51.230 align:middle line:84%
an answer, which is pointing to
the stars and cycles of time.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:53.750 align:middle line:84%
So for them, it was
a vital importance.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:58.360 align:middle line:84%
But I think for our future,
it's vitally important as well.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Where you have--

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:04.360 align:middle line:84%
you have the Egyptian
gods that all of them

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.210 align:middle line:84%
tend to represent
something natural.

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:08.630 align:middle line:90%
And we understand that.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:11.380 align:middle line:84%
But it was the same thing
going on in ancient Sumer

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:12.710 align:middle line:90%
and Mesopotamia.

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:16.790 align:middle line:84%
But it also folds over into
the rest of the world, too.

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.660 align:middle line:84%
But as communication
advanced, you

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.940 align:middle line:84%
can understand how those
gods were shared and renamed.

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.150 align:middle line:84%
But when we push back
in ancient history

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:28.220 align:middle line:84%
into Mesopotamia and
ancient Sumer and Egypt,

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:32.780 align:middle line:84%
these gods are the
same natural forces.

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.940 align:middle line:84%
Were they actually in
contact with these gods?

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And could these gods
have come from elsewhere?

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Well, this is a
very interesting question

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:46.460 align:middle line:84%
because it really depends
on your belief system

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.110 align:middle line:84%
and how you interpret
these ancient texts,

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:51.380 align:middle line:84%
because many will look
at the ancient texts

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:55.610 align:middle line:84%
and look at the gods as
coming from heaven to Earth,

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:59.580 align:middle line:84%
or coming from the stars or
the gods or from the stars.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And as you start to
read the translations

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:05.000 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient texts
yourselves, it kind of

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.730 align:middle line:84%
switches the other way to
saying the gods are the stars.

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:15.240 align:middle line:84%
For example, in the
Pyramid Texts of Unas,

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:24.000 align:middle line:84%
it literally tells you Sah, like
Orion is like the god Osiris.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.480 align:middle line:84%
So as they go to Orion,
they look at it as the god.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.870 align:middle line:90%
Gemini is the Twins of Atum.

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:34.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's like you have these
gods, but in the actual text

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.850 align:middle line:84%
themselves are
depicted and spoken

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:41.600 align:middle line:84%
about as the actual
constellations in the heaven.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Like we have
Ishtar and Shamash.

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:44.780 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Yes.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you go back to Sumer
or going back, you have,

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:51.690 align:middle line:90%
let's say, Ishtar, and Shamash.

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:54.660 align:middle line:84%
Ishtar is the morning
star, which is Venus,

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.680 align:middle line:84%
and she is the twin
sister to Shamash, which

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.850 align:middle line:90%
is the sun god, the actual sun.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And if you look in
the sky, they're

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:06.030 align:middle line:84%
twins because it's
the morning star.

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:09.260 align:middle line:84%
It greets the sun in
the eastern horizon.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And Ishtar as Venus is also
connected to fertility,

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:16.410 align:middle line:90%
vegetation, spring.

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:19.560 align:middle line:84%
So these are stars that ancient
people were familiar with,

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.160 align:middle line:84%
and they would look
to in the morning sky

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.810 align:middle line:84%
to understand these
cycles of time.

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:27.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: This duality
repeats itself, doesn't it,

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:28.260 align:middle line:90%
across cultures?

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And we have Marduk, Tiamat,
same situation there.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:33.350 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Yeah.

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing about that is it

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.720 align:middle line:84%
comes from a creation
text, the Enuma Eliš.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is a Babylonian
creation text.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.300 align:middle line:90%
And Tiamat is the salt water.

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.970 align:middle line:84%
So she's like the
abyss, the dark waters,

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:52.890 align:middle line:84%
and she's basically put together
an army to kill the gods,

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:57.590 align:middle line:84%
because the gods are very noisy
and they want their sleep.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:00.210 align:middle line:84%
It's the same story with
the creation of man.

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:03.650 align:middle line:84%
They get very noisy and the gods
say, we got to get rid of them

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:05.280 align:middle line:90%
because they can't sleep.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:12.290 align:middle line:84%
But Marduk, he kills
Tiamat, rips her apart.

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:15.569 align:middle line:84%
Her one half of her body
becomes the heavens,

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:18.720 align:middle line:84%
the other creates the universe,
physical matter in the Earth.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.829 align:middle line:84%
And he becomes the
patron deity of Babylon.

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:27.750 align:middle line:84%
So if you go back to like,
ancient Sumer, Arcadia,

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:32.530 align:middle line:84%
Babylonian times, each
city-state had their own god.

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:37.740 align:middle line:84%
So like the first city,
Eridu, had Enki as the god.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:40.240 align:middle line:90%
Ur had Ishtar.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.660 align:middle line:84%
But when you go to
Babylon, it was originally

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:45.160 align:middle line:90%
Enlil was the God, patron god.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And then the Babylonian
Empire, which we all know now,

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:53.440 align:middle line:84%
they switched it to
Marduk, the supreme god.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And you see these reflections
in other cultures,

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.780 align:middle line:84%
especially with Marduk, who
also represents Jupiter.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And he uses a weapon
like bolts of lightning,

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:09.480 align:middle line:84%
so it goes directly into Zeus,
because Zeus is also connected

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.200 align:middle line:90%
to Jupiter and with lightning.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.610 align:middle line:84%
So you have these same kind
of motif, motifs and themes

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.840 align:middle line:90%
that you find cross-culturally.

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And most interestingly, if you
study both ancient Sumerian

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:25.020 align:middle line:84%
gods and the Egyptian gods,
it's almost an exact parallel

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.090 align:middle line:90%
to the hierarchy of creation.

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Isn't
it interesting how

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:39.870 align:middle line:84%
history, historians,
archeology, and so forth, all

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:43.230 align:middle line:84%
of that Orthodox
academia wants us

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:49.000 align:middle line:84%
to draw a line between Stone
Age man and modern civilization?

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.960 align:middle line:84%
That Stone Age man was
foraging for seeds in the dirt,

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:56.440 align:middle line:84%
wearing animal
skins until 3000 BC.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Nothing was going on, there's
nothing to talk about when you,

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:04.770 align:middle line:84%
in your research, and
what we're finding now

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:07.630 align:middle line:90%
is that they were well-advanced.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:11.500 align:middle line:84%
They had a firm understanding
of engineering, of astronomy,

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:18.790 align:middle line:84%
of laws, of order, agriculture,
culture and civilization.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:24.750 align:middle line:84%
They weren't wearing animal
skins running around foraging

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:25.750 align:middle line:90%
for seeds, were they?

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:28.080 align:middle line:90%
They were an advanced culture.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: They were definitely
an advanced culture.

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And just because they
didn't have the technology

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:36.210 align:middle line:84%
that we have today, let's say
like cell phones, computers--

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:39.310 align:middle line:84%
cell phones, computers,
things of that nature,

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:40.810 align:middle line:90%
we look at them as primitive.

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:43.760 align:middle line:84%
But again, could we build
the pyramids today with what

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.560 align:middle line:90%
we have?

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And no, they had tools
available to them

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.390 align:middle line:90%
because they were geniuses.

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:51.040 align:middle line:90%
They measured the sky.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.840 align:middle line:84%
They aligned monuments
to various cycles.

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.440 align:middle line:84%
That is very complicated
work, very mathematically

00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.920 align:middle line:90%
precise work.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be an
expert to pull these off.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:07.260 align:middle line:10%
Some of the alignments
are so incredible.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:11.190 align:middle line:10%
For example, in Mexico,
you have the pyramid

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:16.980 align:middle line:10%
that during the equinox it
produces the shadow of two

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.610 align:middle line:10%
serpents descending down.

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:21.980 align:middle line:10%
Just the understanding of
astronomy, the understanding

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:26.660 align:middle line:10%
of the 23.5 degrees
of the equinox,

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:30.650 align:middle line:10%
it's absolutely profound
that ancient humans

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:35.390 align:middle line:10%
were able to actually pull
this off that precisely.

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:36.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Here's the thing.

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:42.290 align:middle line:84%
We have creation stories
like this from every culture.

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:45.930 align:middle line:90%
It indicates one single teacher.

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:48.630 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be a
common source here.

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Was that common source from
a previous civilization

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:53.030 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth?

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:56.450 align:middle line:84%
That maybe went extinct and
we had survivors, or maybe

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:58.400 align:middle line:90%
did it come from the stars?

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I really
think it's both.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:03.900 align:middle line:84%
I think that humans, when
they look up at the stars,

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:07.650 align:middle line:84%
will start to get the same
impressions of different things.

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:11.930 align:middle line:84%
But I also think that there was
this teacher or teachers that

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:15.770 align:middle line:84%
went around the planet
teaching from a time we

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:17.310 align:middle line:90%
don't know much about.

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:21.080 align:middle line:84%
All we know is if
we go back in time,

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:24.400 align:middle line:84%
let's say, we look at Gobekli
Tepe, it's completely buried.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.240 align:middle line:90%
And it has megalithic sites.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:30.340 align:middle line:84%
It has carvings that are very
much aligned with the stars,

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:31.810 align:middle line:90%
and then it gets buried.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:35.050 align:middle line:10%
And then you have a
gap for 4,000 years,

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:38.170 align:middle line:10%
where you go back to
neolithic pottery.

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:42.770 align:middle line:84%
OK, no, no more ancient
building, megalithic structures.

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
around like 4000 BC,

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:50.560 align:middle line:84%
you have this other
influx of building

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.880 align:middle line:84%
again connected to the
stars and knowledge.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.560 align:middle line:84%
So did something
happen in our planet

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:00.580 align:middle line:84%
where basically we were
advanced or advanced enough, had

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:04.210 align:middle line:84%
certain knowledge, suddenly we
went back to the Neolithic Stone

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:06.230 align:middle line:90%
Age for thousands of years?

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:09.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Well, I need to
bring up the A-word then.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's not aliens,
it's Atlantis.

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Yeah.

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Is there
a possibility here

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:19.250 align:middle line:84%
with Plato, and other
references, but Plato

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:23.810 align:middle line:84%
is certainly mentioned
first, that there

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:27.320 align:middle line:84%
was a catastrophe and
survivors, and that

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:30.745 align:middle line:84%
could be our global teachers
and how wisdom was spread?

00:22:30.745 --> 00:22:33.260 align:middle line:90%


00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: We know from
archeological records

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:40.100 align:middle line:84%
that there has been many
floods, many cataclysms

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:41.640 align:middle line:90%
throughout our history.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:45.110 align:middle line:90%
So to think that there isn't--

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:46.850 align:middle line:84%
because it's just
us, we're humans.

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:50.720 align:middle line:84%
To think that there wasn't
a human gathering or race

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.360 align:middle line:84%
or group of people that
were advanced enough

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:57.800 align:middle line:84%
to understand, to navigate
the world, to build things,

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.740 align:middle line:84%
I think that's an extreme
point of view to believe

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:03.450 align:middle line:90%
that we didn't have that.

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:07.430 align:middle line:84%
So if a cataclysm
did happen, which

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:10.430 align:middle line:84%
we can show that it did in
multiple areas around the planet

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:14.510 align:middle line:84%
back then, then if
there are survivors,

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:18.650 align:middle line:84%
then they would pass
on a knowledge that

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:22.160 align:middle line:84%
is the most important
knowledge on Earth, which

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.470 align:middle line:84%
is the knowledge of the stars,
the knowledge of the cycles,

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:29.550 align:middle line:84%
knowledge of agriculture,
knowledge of society.

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:34.050 align:middle line:84%
This is the building
blocks of what humanity is.

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:36.200 align:middle line:84%
We have to understand
these basic principles

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.790 align:middle line:90%
to be modern humans.

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:43.580 align:middle line:84%
So I really believe that there
was these teachers or survivors

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:48.420 align:middle line:84%
that went around to re-educate
and to spread this knowledge,

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.420 align:middle line:90%
so it will never be lost.

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Plato, of course,
said Atlantis was just

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:56.190 align:middle line:90%
outside the pillars of Hercules.

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's been speculated
a lot over the years,

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:01.730 align:middle line:84%
where are the pillars
of or certainly

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:05.210 align:middle line:84%
what do they represent
and where could they be.

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:10.160 align:middle line:84%
In your research, you
recreated this map

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.200 align:middle line:84%
showing what Plato
was talking about.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.910 align:middle line:10%
We have the map right here.

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:19.150 align:middle line:10%
And let's take a look at
this and walk us through it.

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:19.950 align:middle line:10%
>>QUITT: Sure.

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:23.310 align:middle line:10%
So our pole star moves.

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:26.990 align:middle line:10%
So it travels around
because of the 23.5 degree

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:30.330 align:middle line:10%
tilt of the Earth, our pole
star, which is Polaris,

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:31.620 align:middle line:10%
is not stationary.

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:36.210 align:middle line:84%
So we go around in this circle,
which is roughly 26,000 years.

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:40.950 align:middle line:10%
And the polarity of
Polaris is Vega in Lyra.

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:47.900 align:middle line:84%
So every about 13,000 years,
we go back and forth from Vega

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:51.120 align:middle line:84%
being our pole star to
Polaris being our pole star.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:56.510 align:middle line:10%
But if you go back to the exact
date of when Plato described

00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:59.870 align:middle line:10%
the destruction of
Atlantis, it ends up

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:01.680 align:middle line:10%
in a very interesting place.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.530 align:middle line:10%
And if you look at
this circle right

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:09.650 align:middle line:10%
between the arms of Hercules,
the constellation at 9600

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:13.530 align:middle line:10%
BCE in the age of cancer,
that is when Plato describes

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:15.190 align:middle line:10%
the destruction of Atlantis.

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And what's very
interesting is that I

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.570 align:middle line:84%
believe this is the
cycle of the stars that

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:25.350 align:middle line:84%
is very important to our
ancients, where they actually

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:26.230 align:middle line:90%
saw destruction.

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:29.890 align:middle line:84%
Because think about
it, after the Ice Age,

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:32.400 align:middle line:84%
humanity looks up
in the North Sky

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:35.830 align:middle line:84%
and they see Vega, which is
the brightest star in the sky,

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:37.690 align:middle line:90%
and that is the North Star.

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:39.820 align:middle line:84%
It's like the new guiding
light of humanity.

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And they can now
navigate the Earth.

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens is
slowly, over thousands

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:52.660 align:middle line:84%
of years, that star Vega no
longer is the North Star.

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:55.030 align:middle line:84%
It goes out of phase
with being north.

00:25:55.030 --> 00:26:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And as it goes between
Hercules and Thuban in Draco,

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:05.850 align:middle line:84%
you have about 8,000 years where
there's really no fixed star

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:08.670 align:middle line:90%
in the sky to lead people.

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:12.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like once
you get to Thuban, which

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:15.720 align:middle line:84%
is on the tail of
Draco, this is where

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.735 align:middle line:84%
the start of the civilization
as we know it happens.

00:26:18.735 --> 00:26:20.860 align:middle line:84%
This is when the building
of the pyramids happened.

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:24.550 align:middle line:84%
This is where we have advanced
civilization building up again.

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:28.980 align:middle line:84%
You have all this serpent
iconography around this time.

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:33.270 align:middle line:84%
It's because of this star
map of the northern sky,

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:38.160 align:middle line:84%
and I believe that is when
the guiding light comes back

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.900 align:middle line:84%
to Earth, where they can
navigate the planet again.

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:42.340 align:middle line:90%
They know exactly the stars.

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is why the
stars are so important.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: It's not a coincidence
that Carl Sagan chose Vega

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:50.670 align:middle line:84%
for the message
and contact, right?

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:54.130 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of interesting
and a weird coincidence,

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:59.670 align:middle line:84%
but all of this was 12,000
years ago, 10,000 BC, 10,500 BC,

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:03.490 align:middle line:84%
a number that we see
come up across cultures.

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:07.180 align:middle line:84%
Gobekli Tepe is a great
representation of that.

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:12.540 align:middle line:84%
But 10,000 BC, 10,500 BC, in
the end of the last Ice Age

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:17.030 align:middle line:84%
and a possible cataclysm, the
rise and fall of civilizations

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:17.830 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:19.300 align:middle line:90%
This number is repeated.

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:20.530 align:middle line:90%
It's the rise of Leo.

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:22.690 align:middle line:84%
It's repeated over
and over again.

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:24.130 align:middle line:90%
It's in front of the Sphinx.

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:26.170 align:middle line:90%
This is not coincidence, is it?

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:27.865 align:middle line:90%
And it's in this symbolism.

00:27:27.865 --> 00:27:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: It's in the
symbolism and the myths.

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:33.113 align:middle line:84%
Like, if you look at the myths
of Orion, the great hunter,

00:27:33.113 --> 00:27:34.530 align:middle line:84%
there's a meteor
shower that takes

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:39.520 align:middle line:84%
place when you look up at Orion
and it happens around the fall.

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.573 align:middle line:84%
And basically, when
you look up in the sky

00:27:41.573 --> 00:27:43.740 align:middle line:84%
and you see the meteors
hitting the Earth, what does

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:44.650 align:middle line:90%
it look like?

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:47.830 align:middle line:84%
It looks like Orion is
shooting his arrows on Earth.

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And if you go to the
mythology of Orion,

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:54.990 align:middle line:84%
it talks about how
at one time, Orion

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:58.110 align:middle line:84%
sets out to kill all
life on planet Earth

00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:01.060 align:middle line:84%
by shooting his arrows
and killing all life.

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:03.210 align:middle line:84%
So if you go back
in history, maybe we

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:07.870 align:middle line:84%
can say one of those arrows
from Orion did hit the Earth

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:09.560 align:middle line:90%
and killed everything.

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.960 align:middle line:84%
So we have a record
in mythology,

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:17.770 align:middle line:84%
but then in the exact same myth,
it says the scorpion stung Orion

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:19.360 align:middle line:90%
and killed him.

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And he was honored
for saving the Earth.

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:25.120 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's like
when you look up

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:29.360 align:middle line:84%
at the sky in Scorpio,
when we move into Scorpio,

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:32.300 align:middle line:84%
in the night sky, that's
when the meteor shower stops.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:37.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's this myth that's
encoded in the stars.

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:43.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Were they using Vega
in cosmology to see travel?

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And was that a possible way
for transoceanic communication

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:49.100 align:middle line:90%
and contact between cultures?

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: They would need
to understand the stars

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:56.810 align:middle line:84%
and they would need the north
hemisphere stars like Polaris,

00:28:56.810 --> 00:29:01.640 align:middle line:84%
like the Big Dipper,
Little Dipper, and Vega,

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.080 align:middle line:90%
which is in Lyra.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:06.010 align:middle line:84%
These are the stars in
the northern hemisphere.

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And to travel the Earth not
just by boat, but even by land,

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:13.610 align:middle line:84%
they would need to know the
Northern sky intimately.

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:16.160 align:middle line:90%
So it's very important.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.810 align:middle line:84%
If you don't want
to get lost at sea,

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:20.650 align:middle line:84%
you need to know what
stars are above your head.

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: What about here
in Central and South America

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.860 align:middle line:84%
and North America, and the
petroglyphs and the symbolism

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:30.490 align:middle line:84%
that is over here,
which would seem

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:33.490 align:middle line:84%
to be thousands and
thousands of miles

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:36.310 align:middle line:90%
away from the Mediterranean.

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:39.760 align:middle line:84%
How do we make
those connections?

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.950 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Well, they
are are too perfect.

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And I could list a number
of different symbols.

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:48.190 align:middle line:84%
But one of the symbols
that I love seeing

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:52.580 align:middle line:84%
is these two mounds or two hills
with the sun coming out of it

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:53.860 align:middle line:90%
or setting with it.

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:58.120 align:middle line:84%
In Egypt is called the akhet,
which is sun setting or rising

00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.480 align:middle line:90%
between the two mounds.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And you see this also in the
Mayan calendar, the fourth day,

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:06.790 align:middle line:90%
which is Kukulkan.

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:09.190 align:middle line:84%
You actually see again,
you see these two mounds

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:10.550 align:middle line:90%
with the sun above it.

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:13.840 align:middle line:84%
So you have a symbol in
Egypt, exactly the same

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.220 align:middle line:90%
as a symbol in Maya.

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:18.140 align:middle line:90%
So that's just one.

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:21.080 align:middle line:84%
Another one is called
the staff gods,

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.900 align:middle line:90%
which is a very ancient symbol.

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's found all the
way back in Mesopotamia.

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:29.510 align:middle line:90%
It's found in ancient Anatolia.

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:31.040 align:middle line:90%
This is a very old.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.660 align:middle line:84%
I think the oldest one is
about 6,000 or 7,000 years old.

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:37.550 align:middle line:90%
And you see it in Egypt.

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:40.700 align:middle line:84%
It's the gods that are
holding the two staffs.

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And you see it all
over South America.

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:48.910 align:middle line:84%
How is it possible that you
have the exact same symbols,

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:51.340 align:middle line:84%
meaning the exact
same thing found

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:54.100 align:middle line:90%
in two places around the Earth?

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's either
there was navigation,

00:30:57.110 --> 00:31:00.340 align:middle line:84%
like you said, traveling through
both from the stars, which

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:02.760 align:middle line:90%
I think is entirely possible.

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Or they have this
unique heritage.

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to also
back up because earlier, we

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:10.460 align:middle line:84%
were talking about
the creation myth

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:16.070 align:middle line:84%
where Marduk basically
tears Tiamat apart.

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And she's in the form of
this great like dragon sea

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.170 align:middle line:90%
serpent being.

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:26.270 align:middle line:10%
If you go back to Mexico, to the
creation myth with Quetzalcoatl,

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:31.520 align:middle line:10%
he and his brother also fight
a great sea serpent crocodile,

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.660 align:middle line:10%
which represents the waters.

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:37.620 align:middle line:84%
He also rips the body of
that sea serpent apart,

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:40.890 align:middle line:84%
and he also creates heaven
and earth with that body.

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:46.940 align:middle line:84%
So you have Marduk and
Tiamat in Sumeria, Babylon.

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:48.780 align:middle line:90%
And then you have it in Mexico.

00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:51.600 align:middle line:84%
How do you have
the exact same myth

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.400 align:middle line:84%
in two completely
different places,

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:56.273 align:middle line:84%
even though two different
cultures, two different names--

00:31:56.273 --> 00:31:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Two
different languages.

00:31:57.690 --> 00:31:59.065 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Two
different languages.

00:31:59.065 --> 00:32:01.630 align:middle line:84%
It's the same motif,
it's the same theme.

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:03.450 align:middle line:84%
So this is what I'm
looking for when

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:07.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing the research is,
how does one culture have

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:10.620 align:middle line:84%
a myth that's identical
to another myth

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:12.220 align:middle line:90%
somewhere else in the Earth?

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's only understood if
there was travel and trade

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:21.760 align:middle line:84%
worldwide at a very ancient time
that we're not acknowledging.

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: One of the things
that you do is you teach.

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And when you have ancient myths
with astronomy inside of it,

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:38.230 align:middle line:84%
you have gods represented as
constellations and seasons.

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:39.460 align:middle line:90%
This is very important.

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:43.830 align:middle line:84%
But they were looking up
and seeing the same things

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:45.640 align:middle line:90%
in the constellations.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't necessarily
see that when

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:51.160 align:middle line:84%
I look up into the night
sky, but you teach that.

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:55.230 align:middle line:84%
But they were seeing
the exact same symbols

00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:58.840 align:middle line:84%
in the constellations
combined with the seasons.

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.940 align:middle line:90%
How do we fix this?

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:04.230 align:middle line:84%
How do we understand
that ancients can look up

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:07.030 align:middle line:90%
at constellations and see this?

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:09.460 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Well, there
has to be one source.

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I think the
story of the Tower of Babylon

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:18.360 align:middle line:84%
comes in, which is this
ancient theme or story where

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:21.940 align:middle line:84%
they built these towers
to observe the heavens.

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And they had this knowledge
that was so important,

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.290 align:middle line:90%
they spoke one knowledge.

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that one knowledge
was this star language,

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:32.400 align:middle line:84%
this star knowledge that
became the Zodiac, that

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.420 align:middle line:90%
became these myths and cycles.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:37.410 align:middle line:90%
And then something happened.

00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:40.930 align:middle line:84%
It says God broke them up,
spread them across the Earth.

00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:46.380 align:middle line:84%
My guess is that it was a
worldwide catastrophe that

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:51.150 align:middle line:84%
separated people, and they had
to relearn their new languages

00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:55.740 align:middle line:84%
in new locations on the
planet, and that they basically

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:58.870 align:middle line:84%
had to start again and they
lost that star language.

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And each culture, I believe, has
a piece of this star language

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:04.300 align:middle line:90%
and the stars.

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And we could only figure it
out if we bring it all together

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:10.320 align:middle line:84%
and start looking
at it as a whole.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.820 align:middle line:10%
>>CHURCH: We've got
the illustration

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:15.330 align:middle line:10%
here of the Seal of Adda.

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:16.518 align:middle line:10%
Walk me through this.

00:34:16.518 --> 00:34:17.560 align:middle line:10%
>>QUITT: This is amazing.

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.570 align:middle line:10%
This is over 4,000 years old.

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:22.000 align:middle line:10%
And again, you see
these two hills.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.540 align:middle line:84%
We were talking earlier about
these two hills symbology.

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:28.000 align:middle line:10%
And you have Enki,
which is well known.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.940 align:middle line:10%
He has the water and fish
coming out of his shoulders.

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:32.170 align:middle line:10%
He's holding an eagle.

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:36.520 align:middle line:10%
He's stepping over a goat
on one of these mounds.

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.100 align:middle line:10%
Then you have Shamash,
who is in the middle.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:40.330 align:middle line:90%
He's the sun god.

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:42.070 align:middle line:84%
He's holding a
knife in his hand.

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
Ishtar standing

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:48.670 align:middle line:84%
on the other hill, holding
barley or wheat in her hand.

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And she's standing
by the tree of life.

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:52.409 align:middle line:84%
Now, we look at this,
and we're trying

00:34:52.409 --> 00:34:53.780 align:middle line:90%
to figure out what this means.

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:56.210 align:middle line:10%
But if you understand the
language of the stars,

00:34:56.210 --> 00:35:00.490 align:middle line:10%
it starts to make sense because
our constellations are based off

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:01.730 align:middle line:10%
this mythology.

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:05.410 align:middle line:10%
You have Enki
stepping over a goat,

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:08.450 align:middle line:10%
and he's holding an
eagle in one hand.

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you look
at the wet season,

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.120 align:middle line:84%
the winter star
constellations, you

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.230 align:middle line:84%
have Aquarius, which
is the water bearer.

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:17.160 align:middle line:84%
You have the fish,
which is Pisces.

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Right next to it, you have
Capricorn, which is the goat,

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:27.970 align:middle line:84%
and you have Aquila, the eagle,
the bird in the night sky.

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:32.227 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at the opposing
signs of a Zodiac on one side,

00:35:32.227 --> 00:35:34.310 align:middle line:84%
you have Pisces, the other
side, what do you have?

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:35.980 align:middle line:10%
You have Virgo the Virgin.

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:40.220 align:middle line:10%
And the symbol of Virgo the
Virgin is the shaft of wheat.

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:41.830 align:middle line:84%
So whenever you
see these goddesses

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:45.680 align:middle line:84%
holding a shaft of wheat, it
symbolizes the stars of Virgo.

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:49.300 align:middle line:84%
What's really, really
interesting about this scene

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:50.270 align:middle line:90%
is Shemesh.

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:53.920 align:middle line:84%
Shemesh is the sun god in
between the two pillars

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:55.340 align:middle line:90%
or the two mounds.

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the heat rays of
the sun coming off his shoulder,

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:00.560 align:middle line:90%
and he's holding a knife.

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.960 align:middle line:84%
But he's also holding
Ishtar's foot.

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:06.590 align:middle line:84%
Why is he doing this is because
he's the summer heat, the sun,

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:08.510 align:middle line:90%
the time of the harvest.

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:11.350 align:middle line:90%
So he's cutting down Ishtar--

00:36:11.350 --> 00:36:13.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Who's holding
the shafts of wheat.

00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:14.170 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Yes.

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And so she protects
the tree of life,

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.670 align:middle line:84%
which is fertility on Earth,
and he's cutting it down.

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:24.460 align:middle line:84%
So if you understand the star
language and the language

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:27.590 align:middle line:84%
of symbolism, when you
look at these symbols,

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:29.330 align:middle line:90%
they start to tell a story.

00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:32.170 align:middle line:84%
So even though there's
no texts on this

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:33.680 align:middle line:84%
and we're trying
to interpret it,

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.840 align:middle line:84%
if you understand
the star language,

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:38.810 align:middle line:84%
you just understand what
it's trying to depict.

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Do you
have the ability now?

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:43.340 align:middle line:90%
And can you turn it on and off?

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:47.350 align:middle line:84%
but when you look at
symbolism and you look at,

00:36:47.350 --> 00:36:49.940 align:middle line:84%
is this immediate
and in front of you?

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:51.380 align:middle line:90%
Can you see the stars?

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:52.820 align:middle line:90%
Can you see the seasons?

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:54.860 align:middle line:84%
Can you see what
the gods represent?

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:56.040 align:middle line:90%
Do you see through it now?

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:56.840 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: I do.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.750 align:middle line:84%
It's taking me a long time
and a lot of research,

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:01.910 align:middle line:90%
but you see it cross-culturally.

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And it really fills
in the blanks.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.710 align:middle line:84%
So when you're
looking at monuments,

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:08.890 align:middle line:84%
when you're looking at
the gods and goddesses,

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:10.460 align:middle line:90%
what are they holding?

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:11.990 align:middle line:90%
What are they standing on?

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:13.700 align:middle line:84%
For example, like
you look at Ishtar,

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:16.210 align:middle line:84%
a lot of Ishtar
symbolism is she's

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:17.930 align:middle line:90%
standing on the back of a lion.

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Look up in the sky, what is
the constellation next to Virgo

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:23.090 align:middle line:90%
is Leo the Lion.

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:25.250 align:middle line:90%
Her foot is on the back of Leo.

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:29.210 align:middle line:84%
So all these symbols are
connected to this as above,

00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:30.530 align:middle line:90%
so below principle.

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:35.260 align:middle line:84%
So even though it's been lost in
time, the symbols do not change

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:37.220 align:middle line:90%
and the stars do not change.

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And once we make
that connection,

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:41.630 align:middle line:84%
it's undeniable what
they're trying to tell us.

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Let's jump
into the Sumerian Kings

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:47.230 align:middle line:84%
list, one of my favorite
subjects objects

00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:51.100 align:middle line:84%
to research, because of
the vast amount of time

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:54.100 align:middle line:90%
that we are talking about here.

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:56.650 align:middle line:90%
Do we take it literally?

00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Now, I'll get into
a conspiracy about this

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:02.860 align:middle line:84%
because, no, I don't think
we should be taking it

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:06.980 align:middle line:84%
seriously as it actually
was a king's list of rulers.

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:08.550 align:middle line:90%
You have about two--

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:09.350 align:middle line:90%
let me think.

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:11.652 align:middle line:90%
241,200 years--

00:38:11.652 --> 00:38:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: That's right.

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:17.060 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: --of the pre-flood
kings, which are eight kings,

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:18.530 align:middle line:90%
five kingdoms.

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at those
numbers, they're very long.

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:25.330 align:middle line:90%
You have some that--

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:30.590 align:middle line:84%
some reigns that go
for 43,200 years.

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:34.270 align:middle line:90%
You have-- and it's just--

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:35.690 align:middle line:90%
how can that be real?

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Well, science
says it's possible.

00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:40.340 align:middle line:90%
Let me jump in.

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:41.500 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Yeah.

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Homo sapiens
sapiens, according to science,

00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:49.370 align:middle line:90%
appeared 200,000 years ago.

00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the Sumerian
Kings list and the mythology

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:58.020 align:middle line:84%
behind that that
supports that number.

00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:01.650 align:middle line:84%
It's nearly exact
in the timeline.

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:03.990 align:middle line:90%
So does one support the other.

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that maybe the
King's list is actually correct,

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:12.440 align:middle line:84%
because it lines up with our
own research and science?

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:16.230 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: In that regard, I would
say yes, it could be correct.

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:19.730 align:middle line:84%
But the conspiracy that I'm
looking at is when you look

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:23.870 align:middle line:84%
at the King's list, the earliest
version of the king's list comes

00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:26.730 align:middle line:90%
around about 4,000 years ago.

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was around the
exact same time of a person

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:33.890 align:middle line:84%
or a king named Sargon
the Great, who basically

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:36.600 align:middle line:90%
created the Akkadian Empire.

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And his name is on that
Sumerian King's list.

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:43.640 align:middle line:84%
But there really isn't anything
before that in terms of they've

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:45.840 align:middle line:84%
never found a
tablet before that.

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:49.580 align:middle line:84%
So my conspiracy is
did Sargon the Great

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:54.410 align:middle line:84%
create that Kings list to
solidify his rule, to show

00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:57.050 align:middle line:84%
that he is in the long
list, going all the way

00:39:57.050 --> 00:40:03.740 align:middle line:84%
back to the first city of Eridu,
which was connected to Enki?

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:05.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Which brings
us to the Great Pyramid.

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And it represents something
in ancient history

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:11.797 align:middle line:90%
with civilizations, for sure.

00:40:11.797 --> 00:40:13.380 align:middle line:84%
But there's so much
mystery behind it.

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:14.930 align:middle line:90%
We don't have any answers.

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:19.320 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of news and
breaking news around it today.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.950 align:middle line:84%
But if we look,
certainly we know

00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:25.700 align:middle line:84%
about the alignments going
north in the precision of that

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:27.740 align:middle line:90%
and it being level.

00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:29.910 align:middle line:90%
OK, we understand all of that.

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:33.300 align:middle line:84%
But what about your research
tying it to the equinoxes?

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:36.830 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Well, I think the
biggest secret to the pyramids

00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:40.050 align:middle line:84%
is the sun's alignment
during the equinox.

00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:43.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, we all know
that the Sphinx looks

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:48.700 align:middle line:84%
due east, so that you can see
the rising sun of the equinoxes.

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:50.820 align:middle line:84%
But if you're standing
in front of the Sphinx,

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:56.800 align:middle line:84%
looking at the Sphinx, the
pyramid behind it, Khafre,

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:59.403 align:middle line:90%
the sun sets right on the back--

00:40:59.403 --> 00:41:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: We have
an illustration.

00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:01.780 align:middle line:90%
Walk us through this.

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:05.190 align:middle line:10%
>>QUITT: So the sun sets right
on the back of the Sphinx

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:06.520 align:middle line:10%
on the equinox.

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:11.340 align:middle line:10%
And this image is actually
taken from the Tomb of Twosret

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:13.000 align:middle line:10%
from the Valley of the Kings.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very strange
picture of Horus and Seth

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:21.070 align:middle line:84%
in one body equally standing
on the back of the Sphinx.

00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:26.488 align:middle line:10%
Now, during the equinox,
a very interesting thing

00:41:26.488 --> 00:41:28.530 align:middle line:10%
happens to the pyramid of
Khufu, because it's not

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:31.270 align:middle line:10%
a four-sided pyramid, it's
an eight-sided pyramid.

00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:34.980 align:middle line:10%
And only on the equinox
do we see the shadow

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:38.590 align:middle line:10%
on one face of the
pyramid and not the other.

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:43.680 align:middle line:10%
So you get this division of
half light, half dark, 12 hours

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:45.970 align:middle line:10%
of day, 12 hours of night.

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:49.830 align:middle line:10%
And we see this in the
embodiment of Horus and Seth

00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:51.990 align:middle line:10%
in one body.

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:53.980 align:middle line:90%
Seth is the god of darkness.

00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:55.990 align:middle line:90%
Horus is the god of light.

00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:57.370 align:middle line:10%
They're both equal.

00:41:57.370 --> 00:42:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And he's standing on
the back of the Sphinx.

00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually
the children of Horus

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:04.720 align:middle line:84%
that are represented
as the Sphinx.

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And if you go to
the full picture

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.790 align:middle line:84%
of that scene with
the rope pullers,

00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:13.620 align:middle line:84%
it comes into alignment
a little better.

00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:16.300 align:middle line:84%
You can see that these
rope pullers on each side,

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:20.400 align:middle line:84%
and this is a very ancient
motif of the gods pulling

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.510 align:middle line:90%
the sun across the horizon.

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And the sun does move
across the horizon.

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:27.190 align:middle line:84%
That's how you measure
from solstice to solstice.

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And when the sun gets directly
in between the summer solstice

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:34.110 align:middle line:84%
and winter solstice,
that's when you

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:37.680 align:middle line:84%
get the equinox equal
12 and 12 hours.

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Now you see this symbolism
directly on the Giza Plateau.

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:46.750 align:middle line:10%
If you're standing in
front of the Sphinx,

00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:49.140 align:middle line:10%
you're going to
see the sun setting

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:51.880 align:middle line:10%
on the back of the Sphinx,
just like this picture.

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to see
half shadow and half

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:57.490 align:middle line:90%
light on the face of Khufu.

00:42:57.490 --> 00:43:00.550 align:middle line:84%
So that image is
being played out.

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:04.420 align:middle line:84%
That celestial event is being
played out in symbolism,

00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:07.140 align:middle line:84%
but it's also being
played out directly

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:09.130 align:middle line:90%
on the pyramids themselves.

00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Isn't it
interesting that we

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:16.890 align:middle line:84%
didn't know that the Great
Pyramid had eight sides until we

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:18.370 align:middle line:90%
had flight?

00:43:18.370 --> 00:43:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And we were flying over Giza,
happened to be on the equinox.

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Somebody took some
pictures in 1930.

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing
we've got an eight

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:32.380 align:middle line:90%
sided pyramid and not a four.

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:35.730 align:middle line:84%
So many questions left to
be answered, aren't there?

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:37.175 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: The precision.

00:43:37.175 --> 00:43:39.050 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand
the precision of this,

00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:41.090 align:middle line:90%
it's off by a degree.

00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:43.960 align:middle line:84%
So by the physical
eye, it does not

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.040 align:middle line:84%
look like it's an
eight-sided pyramid.

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:50.360 align:middle line:84%
But it only comes to life during
the equinox using shadows.

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:54.680 align:middle line:10%
And again, where do we see
this/ You see this in Mexico,

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:58.700 align:middle line:10%
where on the equinox the
shadow reveals the serpent.

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:02.540 align:middle line:84%
It's the same code
found on pyramids,

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:07.780 align:middle line:84%
marking a very special time on
the planet of the year, which

00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:10.280 align:middle line:90%
is the spring and fall equinox.

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: The book is The
Gates of the Anunnaki.

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.942 align:middle line:90%
Where can everybody find it?

00:44:14.942 --> 00:44:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: You can
find it on Amazon.

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:19.610 align:middle line:84%
You could also find it on my
website, the crystalsun.com.

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Great work, Jason.

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:22.010 align:middle line:90%
Excellent conversation.

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:22.880 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Thank you.

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Sitting in for George
Noory, I am Jimmy Church.

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for watching
this episode of Beyond Belief.
