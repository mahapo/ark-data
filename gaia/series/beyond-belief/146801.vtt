00:00:18.832 --> 00:00:20.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.130 align:middle line:10%
And in this episode, we're going
to be talking about the brain.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Neil Slade is with us, noted
author, expert on the brain.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And in this edition,
we're going to find out

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.080 align:middle line:84%
about brain function,
how it works.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.360 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything
supernatural to it?

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.575 align:middle line:90%
Neil, welcome to the program.

00:00:37.575 --> 00:00:38.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NEIL SLADE: Thanks,
great to be here.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it safe to
say that the brain is

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.870 align:middle line:90%
the computer of the body?

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.180 align:middle line:10%
>>SLADE: It's a
computer in some senses.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.150 align:middle line:10%
I like to look at the
brain, more or less,

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.720 align:middle line:10%
as being the conductor
of the body's orchestra.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.370 align:middle line:84%
So the conductor in an
orchestra is telling the violins

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.480 align:middle line:90%
to do one thing.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.400 align:middle line:84%
He's telling the
timpanis to do another.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.007 align:middle line:84%
It's coordinating all the
activity of the orchestra.

00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And making
it work, function.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: Making it
all work together.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.050 align:middle line:84%
So I look at the brain as being
the conductor in that sense.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.170 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, like
a computer, it has memories,

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.970 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.140 align:middle line:90%
It's collecting information.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.610 align:middle line:90%
Data is coming in.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And then it's spitting
out data as well.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.270 align:middle line:90%
So it's very complex.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.665 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
going on there.

00:01:26.665 --> 00:01:28.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you're
absolutely right.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.260 align:middle line:84%
The human brain does
have, and perform

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.370 align:middle line:90%
a number of other functions.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Your mind can perform
an estimated 10 quadrillion

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.730 align:middle line:84%
operations per second
without you even knowing it.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.940 align:middle line:90%
Wild.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Ask yourself right now,
what's making your blood

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.880 align:middle line:84%
flow throughout your veins with
the perfect amount of pressure

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.600 align:middle line:90%
to keep you alive?

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.540 align:middle line:84%
What's making your
heart beat right now?

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Are you consciously commanding
your heart to beat right now?

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.410 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.450 align:middle line:84%
What's maintaining your
body core temperature

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.880 align:middle line:84%
to the perfect degree
to keep you alive?

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.680 align:middle line:84%
What's doing the 6 trillion
things to your 60 trillion

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.919 align:middle line:90%
cells every single second?

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.080 align:middle line:84%
It's something called
your subconscious mind.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.290 align:middle line:84%
This is the powerhouse
to who you are.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If something were to
happen to parts of this brain--

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Yeah.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.522 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --we don't
function as well.

00:02:22.522 --> 00:02:23.355 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: It depends.

00:02:23.355 --> 00:02:26.340 align:middle line:84%
You know, the brain
is very interesting,

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.350 align:middle line:84%
because different
parts of the brain

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.885 align:middle line:84%
are responsible for
different types of activity

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:32.685 align:middle line:90%
and functions.

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:33.485 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:02:33.485 --> 00:02:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: Although,
different parts of the brain

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.900 align:middle line:84%
are talking to different parts
of the brain at the same time,

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.550 align:middle line:84%
this reptilian
part of the brain.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Incidentally, when
we saw that video,

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.660 align:middle line:84%
he was talking about
the subconscious mind.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.110 align:middle line:84%
The autonomic functions
of the brain, that's

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.910 align:middle line:90%
contained in this brain stem.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.620 align:middle line:84%
This is what's controlling all
of those non-voluntary things

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.120 align:middle line:90%
in the background.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness, awareness,
that's happening

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.890 align:middle line:90%
in the cerebral cortex.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let me ask you
something about that Neil.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.260 align:middle line:84%
Because there's an argument
about consciousness

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.410 align:middle line:84%
that exists outside
of the brain.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.320 align:middle line:84%
Yet, there's this other
argument that without the brain,

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.760 align:middle line:90%
you would not have thought.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.710 align:middle line:84%
You would not have
consciousness.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.450 align:middle line:90%
Who's right?

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: I don't
think you can say.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.800 align:middle line:84%
I think what we do know
is that without the brain,

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.590 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, of course,
would be very different.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.740 align:middle line:84%
But the evidence seems
to point to the fact

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.860 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness, at
least to a great extent,

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.110 align:middle line:90%
can exist outside of the body.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And we know this from
near-death experiences,

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.760 align:middle line:84%
people who have died on the
operating table, and then--

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They come back.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.433 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: They come
back and say, oh, I

00:03:43.433 --> 00:03:46.020 align:middle line:84%
know what was happening on the
third floor of the hospital,

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.670 align:middle line:84%
because I floated
out of my body.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or you two were
laughing at me while I

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.684 align:middle line:90%
was on the operating table.

00:03:51.684 --> 00:03:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: That's right.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.390 align:middle line:90%
And they can report things.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.290 align:middle line:84%
I remember one case of somebody
reporting seeing a red sneaker

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.510 align:middle line:90%
on the roof of the hospital.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And they then went up to
the roof of the hospital--

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:03.993 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And there it was.

00:04:03.993 --> 00:04:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: --and found
the shoe, something

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.560 align:middle line:84%
that would be absolutely
impossible to know

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.210 align:middle line:84%
without having
left consciousness,

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.360 align:middle line:90%
having left the body there.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.568 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When we talk about
computers, we talk about,

00:04:15.568 --> 00:04:18.310 align:middle line:84%
you know, how much space we
have available in the computer--

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Yeah.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.209 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --for operations.

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:20.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Yeah

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
the human brain?

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.280 align:middle line:84%
What capacity are we
using of the human brain?

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: That's a very
interesting and contentious

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.990 align:middle line:90%
point.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's two ways
of looking at it.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.160 align:middle line:84%
The old folks' saying was you
only use 10% of your brain.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.930 align:middle line:90%
How would they know that?

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: OK.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.050 align:middle line:84%
But then scientists
in many recent years

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.550 align:middle line:84%
say, oh, no, you use all of
your brain all of the time.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Now one doctor
respectfully, Sam Wang--

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.180 align:middle line:84%
I think you used to spoke
with him on your show.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.460 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, you know,
we look at the brain.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.650 align:middle line:90%
And it's always using 12 watts.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.520 align:middle line:84%
So we know that we're using
all of the brain all the time.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.625 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
absolutely not true.

00:05:02.625 --> 00:05:05.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can
have a television set

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.110 align:middle line:84%
turned on drawing full
power on channel 3.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.690 align:middle line:90%
and getting nothing but static.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.820 align:middle line:84%
So you can be
drawing full current.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And the brain,
incidentally, uses up

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.290 align:middle line:84%
25% of the calories
that we use in the body.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.840 align:middle line:84%
It only makes up 2% of
the weight of the body.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.755 align:middle line:84%
But yet, it takes
up a full 25%--

00:05:26.755 --> 00:05:28.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It generates that much.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: It takes 25% of what
we eat just to run the brain.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.850 align:middle line:10%
But in any case, you know, Sir
John Eccles, a Nobel laureate,

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.340 align:middle line:10%
said the possibilities of
the human brain are endless.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.160 align:middle line:84%
He said, the
potential is infinite.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.860 align:middle line:84%
So any percentage of infinity is
an infinitely small percentage.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But then you have
two points, Wang and Eccles.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Yeah.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who's right?

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: Well, my opinion is
that the brain's potential

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:59.510 align:middle line:90%
is unknown.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:00.390 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it unlimited?

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: It's unlimited.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.890 align:middle line:84%
The brain has never
said, hard drive full.

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.290 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what the
brain is capable of doing.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.980 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be growing
in terms of what we find

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.060 align:middle line:90%
the brain is capable of doing.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.520 align:middle line:84%
So any percentage of infinity is
an infinitely small percentage.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.620 align:middle line:84%
So to say that you're only
using 10% of your brain, well,

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.260 align:middle line:84%
that could be far
too generous, or it

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.940 align:middle line:90%
could be totally inaccurate.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.410 align:middle line:90%
But to say that you're using--

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:37.380 align:middle line:84%
you know, what I think of
is functional MRI scans,

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:38.370 align:middle line:90%
and PET scans.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, these take
images of the brain.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: Now, they only work,
because they show a modulation

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.990 align:middle line:90%
of activity in the brain.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.307 align:middle line:84%
If you take a PET scan
or functional MRI,

00:06:48.307 --> 00:06:49.890 align:middle line:84%
it shows, well, this
part of the brain

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.277 align:middle line:90%
is more active than this part.

00:06:51.277 --> 00:06:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It brightens
up a little bit.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:53.901 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: It brightens up.

00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:56.610 align:middle line:84%
It shows, oh, well, not
much is happening over here.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:57.990 align:middle line:90%
And a lot's happening over here.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.790 align:middle line:90%
And it changes constantly.

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you were using all
of your brain all the time,

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.280 align:middle line:84%
you'd have a solid picture
of the whole thing being

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.660 align:middle line:90%
lit up all at the same time.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:07.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: And that's
simply not happening.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.210 align:middle line:84%
So if you used all of your
brain all of the time, PET

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.477 align:middle line:84%
scans and brain imaging,
they simply wouldn't work.

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think that alone
shows that you're not

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.930 align:middle line:84%
using all of your
brain all the time,

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.150 align:middle line:84%
and that the potential
changes from second to second,

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.600 align:middle line:90%
from minute to minute.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.630 align:middle line:84%
The point being is
we don't know what

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.550 align:middle line:90%
you can do with your brain.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Neil, where
in the brain is memory?

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.390 align:middle line:90%
Where is the memory function?

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: Well, not only memory
function is all over the brain,

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:40.890 align:middle line:84%
but any given activity
is an interconnection

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:42.580 align:middle line:90%
of different areas of the brain.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.060 align:middle line:84%
So if you remember
something, it's

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.310 align:middle line:90%
not in a specific location.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.800 align:middle line:84%
It's a combination
of something that

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.460 align:middle line:84%
may be occurring in
the olfactory bulbs,

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.005 align:middle line:84%
talking to something
in the cortex.

00:07:56.005 --> 00:07:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's not like a
storage for memory somewhere?

00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:59.296 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: That's right.

00:07:59.296 --> 00:08:00.780 align:middle line:10%
There's not any--
you know, it used

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:05.490 align:middle line:10%
to be that people thought
the old brain model called

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:10.020 align:middle line:10%
phrenology used to say that,
oh, this type of behavior

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.100 align:middle line:10%
would be found in this
part of the brain.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.480 align:middle line:10%
And you know, this type
of behavior would be here.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And the memory for
one thing would be--

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.200 align:middle line:90%
not true.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Everything is interconnected
and interdependent.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:28.080 align:middle line:84%
So the one thing about saying
that you use all of your brain

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.260 align:middle line:84%
that's true is that
different parts of the brain

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.980 align:middle line:84%
are talking to other parts of
the brain all at the same time.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.559 align:middle line:84%
So it's not localized
in that sense.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I am fascinated by
thought power, telekinesis,

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:48.080 align:middle line:84%
telepathy, clairvoyance,
psychic ability.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.780 align:middle line:84%
Does that originate
from the brain?

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Or is it something
outside of the brain

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.580 align:middle line:90%
that allows us to do this?

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: I think it's a
natural function of the brain,

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.220 align:middle line:90%
these five--

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.440 align:middle line:84%
what I call five--
paranormal senses.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.320 align:middle line:90%
You have five regular senses.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.390 align:middle line:90%
You have smelling.

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:12.090 align:middle line:84%
You have tasting,
hearing, sight, and touch.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:12.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: To me, you also
have five paranormal senses

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:20.390 align:middle line:84%
that go along with those, more
subtle senses that to me are

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:22.430 align:middle line:90%
an extension of those.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:29.990 align:middle line:84%
For example, clairvoyance is
perceiving something visually,

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:33.890 align:middle line:84%
but without physical,
sensory input.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:38.450 align:middle line:84%
You have clairaudience,
which is hearing a sound,

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:42.740 align:middle line:84%
but without the use of the ears,
without having sensory input.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:46.730 align:middle line:84%
You have telepathy,
sensing something

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:50.210 align:middle line:84%
that someone is thinking without
them actually telling you.

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:52.230 align:middle line:84%
That might correspond
with taste, for example.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:57.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: Taste is you use
your mouth for communication.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:00.185 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is taste in the mouth
or the brain, or the nose?

00:10:00.185 --> 00:10:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: Well, taste, it's
actually a combination of those

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.360 align:middle line:90%
now that you bring that up.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.664 align:middle line:84%
Because often when we
taste something, again--

00:10:07.664 --> 00:10:08.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You smell it.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.496 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: You smell it.

00:10:09.496 --> 00:10:11.580 align:middle line:84%
So like everything
else in the brain,

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.370 align:middle line:90%
it's a combination of things.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:18.110 align:middle line:84%
But the paranormal
senses seem to be senses

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:21.860 align:middle line:84%
that we have that come
about without sensory input,

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.600 align:middle line:90%
extrasensory input.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Now the experiments
that I know about

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:29.750 align:middle line:84%
and the experiments that I've
done, for example, with music

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:33.590 align:middle line:84%
and ESP, seem to
point to a correlation

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:38.240 align:middle line:84%
between frontal lobes'
activity and the perception

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.420 align:middle line:90%
of non-sensory perception.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And we've done some
experiments to show

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:49.460 align:middle line:84%
that you can elicit paranormal
sensitivity by something

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.390 align:middle line:84%
as simple as listening to
the right kind of music

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:53.810 align:middle line:84%
in the right kind
of environment.

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, now, that's
an interesting question, too.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:11:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Why to some is music, some
kind of music, so wonderful,

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:03.830 align:middle line:90%
so beautiful?

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And then to others, they
like rock music better?

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's the function
of the brain, isn't it?

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Yeah.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.680 align:middle line:84%
I think your taste
in music is something

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:17.480 align:middle line:84%
that's dependent upon
how you were brought up,

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.500 align:middle line:84%
what your peer group
is listening to.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Probably there's some genetic
component to that as well.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.160 align:middle line:84%
For example, I
have a little girl.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.930 align:middle line:90%
I teach music lessons.

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And I have a little girl who's
a tremendous piano player

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:36.020 align:middle line:90%
at the age of eight years old.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a prodigy.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: You know, she's a
prodigy or close to a prodigy.

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:42.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Baby
Beethoven or something.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:43.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: I don't know.

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:45.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
she's that advanced.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:49.760 align:middle line:84%
But I tried to figure out why
was this little girl so drawn

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.230 align:middle line:90%
to classical music.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:53.035 align:middle line:90%
And why was she so adept?

00:11:53.035 --> 00:11:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, hold that
right there, that thought.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Because I want us to listen
to a clip of fast music.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll listen
to one of slow music.

on the mood you're in.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.500 align:middle line:84%
It depends on what
effect fast music--

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.900 align:middle line:84%
there's a thing called
synchronization.

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.550 align:middle line:84%

study where they've

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:42.385 align:middle line:84%

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:50.540 align:middle line:90%
they synchronize with the music.

find out what type of music

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:37.830 align:middle line:84%
would encourage this paranormal

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:38.630 align:middle line:90%
perception.

And what I found in that
particular research project

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:49.350 align:middle line:84%
was that paranormal
perception is very subtle.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:53.690 align:middle line:84%
It's not in your face as
sensory information would be.

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:57.120 align:middle line:84%
It's much more subtle, and
much more in the background.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.445 align:middle line:84%

if the music was

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:17.130 align:middle line:84%
more of a moderate
nature, not something that

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:19.650 align:middle line:84%
would put you to
sleep and bore you,

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:22.770 align:middle line:84%
stimulating enough that
you would stay alert,

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:26.800 align:middle line:84%
but not overstimulating
so much that it'd

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:31.050 align:middle line:84%
block the perception of
non-sensory information.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And it gets your
attention, because you

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:49.350 align:middle line:84%
get that anticipation of
something's about to happen.

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:53.377 align:middle line:84%

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And they're a little
mellow and laid back.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:01.590 align:middle line:84%
But it has a place
in the whole format.

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:03.540 align:middle line:90%
And you're absolutely right.

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.730 align:middle line:90%
Music will determine that.

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:09.750 align:middle line:10%
During military exercises,
and the Brits were very good

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:15.270 align:middle line:10%
at this, they played music or
the Scots with their bagpipes,

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:16.930 align:middle line:10%
before they went into battle.

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:17.730 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:19.060 align:middle line:90%
Did that motivate the troops?

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:19.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Oh, sure.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.480 align:middle line:84%
It would get the
adrenaline going.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.150 align:middle line:90%

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:28.120 align:middle line:90%

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:28.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Exactly.

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:29.448 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let me at 'em!

00:15:29.448 --> 00:15:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: Now, you know,
one of the new things

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:34.410 align:middle line:84%
that has been discovered
in recent years

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:36.390 align:middle line:90%
has to do with super learning.

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, super learning
is the concept

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:42.300 align:middle line:84%
that came out of Eastern
Europe back in the '70s.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:46.230 align:middle line:84%
that if you played Baroque
music at 60 beats per minute

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:47.710 align:middle line:90%
regularly in the background--

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: --while you were
trying to learn something,

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:54.861 align:middle line:84%
it would enhance your retention,
and absorption of new material.

00:15:54.861 --> 00:15:55.860 align:middle line:90%
And that's been proven--

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: -- that that's--

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could you play that
music when you were sleeping?

00:15:59.130 --> 00:15:59.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Well--

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Before you go to bed?

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:01.695 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: You could do that.

00:16:01.695 --> 00:16:04.420 align:middle line:84%
But that wasn't the purpose
of the super learning.

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.360 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of
the music would be

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:10.920 align:middle line:84%
to get into this regular
semi-relaxed state that

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.770 align:middle line:84%
would open up your
brain, as it were,

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:17.700 align:middle line:84%
to remembering the information
that you were taking in.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, originally, it was thought
that Baroque music at 60

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:22.110 align:middle line:90%
beats per minute would do that.

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:24.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, recent
university experiments

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:27.780 align:middle line:84%
showed that it didn't
have to be Baroque music,

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:32.040 align:middle line:84%
that pop music, show tunes,
almost any kind of music

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.590 align:middle line:90%
would enhance learning.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:35.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love show tunes.

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:36.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Well, it would work.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.820 align:middle line:84%
The main thing that
it seemed to be

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:43.140 align:middle line:84%
is that you enjoyed the music
that you were listening to.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.510 align:middle line:84%
That seemed to be the
main component that

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:47.400 align:middle line:90%
was most important.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Music itself is something that
activates the entire brain.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's unique in that
sense that some activities

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.730 align:middle line:84%
will cause more areas to
be active than other areas.

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:04.599 align:middle line:84%
But music draws upon not
only the auditory cortex,

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:08.069 align:middle line:84%
but the frontal
lobes, the cerebellum.

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:09.780 align:middle line:84%
All of the regions
of the brain are

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:14.579 align:middle line:84%
activated during listening,
and especially playing music.

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:17.980 align:middle line:84%
So music, in a sense,
is a supercharger

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.849 align:middle line:84%
for all kinds of brain
activity and functions.

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's also
emotional for people.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:23.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Of course.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can listen
to a piece of music.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And it will bring up memories
of, perhaps, pleasurable events

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:34.057 align:middle line:90%
and even some negative events.

00:17:34.057 --> 00:17:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right, it's the
memories that it accents.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.098 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Exactly right.

00:17:37.098 --> 00:17:40.400 align:middle line:84%
In the same way that when
you smell certain odors,

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.379 align:middle line:84%
it will generate
the recollection

00:17:42.379 --> 00:17:43.670 align:middle line:90%
of certain memories and events.

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:45.753 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Grandma's flowers
or something like that.

00:17:45.753 --> 00:17:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Exactly, right.

when we die, but we believe

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.320 align:middle line:90%
of other functions.

Now, if the brain dies, how
does that other stuff still

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:03.182 align:middle line:90%
continue?

00:18:03.182 --> 00:18:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: You've
got to explain that

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.931 align:middle line:90%
in a little more detail for me.

00:18:05.931 --> 00:18:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, when you die,
assuming there's an afterlife--

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Yeah.

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --there's an existence
of something else out.

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:13.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Oh,

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a subconscious
that seems to still prevail.

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:21.570 align:middle line:84%
How does that work if the brain
is the sole function for all

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:22.370 align:middle line:90%
of this?

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:24.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: Well, I
think, yeah, I mean,

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:27.680 align:middle line:84%
what you're talking about is
some sort of evidence that

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.930 align:middle line:84%

outside of the--

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:31.340 align:middle line:90%

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.700 align:middle line:84%
So you know, I'm in
agreement with people

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:39.500 align:middle line:84%
who said the brain is just
a part of consciousness.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:43.100 align:middle line:84%
It's just part of the
formula of who we are,

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:46.190 align:middle line:84%
our experiences, and our
sensory information that we

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:47.870 align:middle line:90%
gather at any given moment.

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:50.750 align:middle line:90%
That plays a role in who we are.

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:52.570 align:middle line:90%
But you know, I agree.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:54.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that's
the whole picture.

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's that
the brain, in a sense,

00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:01.910 align:middle line:84%
is a camera or a television
receiver that plays, you know,

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:04.184 align:middle line:84%

00:22:23.765 --> 00:22:24.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: They're diminished.

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.640 align:middle line:84%
So the thing to keep
in mind if you're

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:32.560 align:middle line:84%
trying to become accessible
to those very subtle energy

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:37.960 align:middle line:84%
signals is to click forward
into a relaxed state,

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:41.440 align:middle line:84%
into a state where you're not
worried about survival, where

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.360 align:middle line:90%
you're feeling comfortable.

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And you're thinking
happy emotions.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And that takes us back to
that music for ESP study.

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:51.910 align:middle line:84%
We listen to music
that was not--

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:54.670 align:middle line:84%
that drumbeat, you know,
the boom, boom, boom,

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:56.320 align:middle line:90%
get ready for battle music.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.930 align:middle line:84%
But we're sitting in a
hot tub with the lights

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:02.860 align:middle line:84%
out and listening to
music that was comforting.

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And that allows us to
access the telepathy,

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:09.580 align:middle line:84%
and the precognition,
and the clairvoyance.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:13.180 align:middle line:84%
So there's a definite connection
between those two states

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:17.620 align:middle line:84%
of mind, that state of high
arousal and fight or flight

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:21.250 align:middle line:84%
and the state of
relaxation and comfort.

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:23.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
been on a computer looking

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:26.690 align:middle line:90%
at scary videos or pictures?

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And there's always
that one scene where

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.107 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at your screen,
and out pops a face right away.

00:23:32.107 --> 00:23:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Yeah, yeah.

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you bolt back.

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:34.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Yes.

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What creates
that bolting back effect?

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:37.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Well, that's--

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:39.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do we
get scared like that?

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.498 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: You know,
there's an organ

00:23:40.498 --> 00:23:43.100 align:middle line:84%
that we've talked about many
a times on your show called

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:43.900 align:middle line:90%
the amygdala.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:44.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.360 align:middle line:84%
You wrote a book
called "Tickle--

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: "Tickle Your
Amygdala," right.

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's a little button
right in the midbrain.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's sort of
a master compass.

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:58.969 align:middle line:84%
It's a switch, so that when
you see something threatening--

00:23:58.969 --> 00:24:00.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fight or flight?

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: --it causes
the fight or flight.

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:05.770 align:middle line:84%
What it does when it perceives
something threatening,

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:10.050 align:middle line:84%
it says, you need
to protect yourself.

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:10.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Quickly.

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:11.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Quickly.

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:12.940 align:middle line:90%
It's automatic.

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:14.759 align:middle line:90%
It's an automatic reaction.

00:24:14.759 --> 00:24:16.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long
does it take to get

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:20.740 align:middle line:84%
that video seen from
your eyes to your brain,

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:21.710 align:middle line:90%
where your brain--?

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: It's milliseconds.

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:22.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: It's a
fraction of a second.

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:25.990 align:middle line:90%
And it does that.

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:27.970 align:middle line:90%
It bypasses.

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:29.920 align:middle line:84%
It allows this
part of your brain

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.990 align:middle line:90%
to crank up into high gear.

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And so it bypasses all of this
advanced part of your brain.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.750 align:middle line:84%
You don't think, oh, there's
something with big teeth,

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:42.140 align:middle line:90%
and growling at me.

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:43.960 align:middle line:90%
So I guess I better run away.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.410 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:46.750 align:middle line:90%
You don't even think about it.

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:48.440 align:middle line:90%
You don't even think about it.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.580 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is
it doesn't allow

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:55.150 align:middle line:84%
you to think of
solutions that allow you

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:57.400 align:middle line:90%
to survive for the long term.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:00.550 align:middle line:84%
It only allows you to jump
out of the way of a Mack truck

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:02.800 align:middle line:84%
that's about to run
over you as it were.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:03.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.430 align:middle line:10%
So that type of fight
or flight response

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:09.160 align:middle line:10%
is good for short-term
survival, but it's not

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.550 align:middle line:10%
good for long-term survival.

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And as human beings,
we need to get

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.460 align:middle line:84%
beyond thinking about what's
good just for this minute.

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:20.340 align:middle line:84%
We have to think of
what's good for us--

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Long term.

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: --a minute from now, an
hour from now, a week from now,

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:25.420 align:middle line:90%
10 years from now.

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:28.029 align:middle line:84%
And to do that, you've got
to turn on the frontal lobes.

00:25:28.029 --> 00:25:29.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let me see that.

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: And you've got to
tickle that amygdala switch,

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:34.049 align:middle line:90%
so it's in the front position.

00:25:34.049 --> 00:25:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Little
amygdala right there.

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:36.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Yes.

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:39.500 align:middle line:84%
You've got to
tickle the amygdala.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.550 align:middle line:84%
So you activate the most
advanced part of your brain,

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:46.380 align:middle line:84%
and so you can understand
cause and effect.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.080 align:middle line:90%
You can incorporate planning.

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.380 align:middle line:84%
You can incorporate
empathy, cooperation.

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:57.900 align:middle line:84%
You know, I came up with a
word called CICIL, C-I-C-I-L.

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And that stands for
this advanced frontal

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:07.650 align:middle line:84%
lobe's computations, Creativity,
imagination, cooperation,

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:10.000 align:middle line:90%
intuition, and logic.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.890 align:middle line:84%
So if you can allow that
amygdala to click forward,

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:18.420 align:middle line:84%
it will allow neurochemical
electricity and functions

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:21.210 align:middle line:84%
to occur in the most
advanced part of your brain.

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:24.360 align:middle line:84%
So that you're just
not reacting to things.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:28.770 align:middle line:84%
You react to the degree that
it protects you for the moment.

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:32.460 align:middle line:84%
But you're also incorporating
all of those advanced functions

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:34.170 align:middle line:90%
of your brain.

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:36.750 align:middle line:84%
But you know, we're
culturally conditioned

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:41.990 align:middle line:84%
to stay clicked backward,
and think about, oh, I've

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:43.790 align:middle line:90%
got to fight back.

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:44.780 align:middle line:90%
I've got to hit back.

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:47.840 align:middle line:84%
If I'm threatened, I've
just got to fight back.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.210 align:middle line:84%
But life is more than
just fighting back.

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:53.610 align:middle line:84%
It's about everything
working together.

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:55.910 align:middle line:84%
It's about working
out the problems.

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:57.630 align:middle line:90%
It's about communication.

00:26:57.630 --> 00:26:58.910 align:middle line:90%
It's about planning.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And so we've got to overcome
this cultural conditioning

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:07.380 align:middle line:84%
to fight back as a means of
solving all of our problems.

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:08.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is laughter?

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And where is it
developed in the brain?

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:13.269 align:middle line:84%
Because it is a
bizarre phenomenon.

00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:14.068 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Yeah.

00:27:14.068 --> 00:27:15.440 align:middle line:90%
Laughter's very interesting.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Well again, laughter requires
this frontal lobes area

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.220 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:25.390 align:middle line:90%
What humor is really is--

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:27.880 align:middle line:84%
a joke, for example,
is leading you

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:31.730 align:middle line:84%
down a path where you
expect one thing to happen,

00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and then something else
completely unexpected happens.

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But what creates
the physical laughing

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:38.280 align:middle line:90%
within your body?

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Oh, the physical?

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:40.580 align:middle line:90%
That's a good question.

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:42.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I
know the answer.

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The brain must be
the stimulus for it, right?

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:47.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: Yeah, it's
definitely involved.

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:51.670 align:middle line:84%
But, again, it's that
advanced part of your brain.

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:53.455 align:middle line:90%
You know what I think it is?

00:27:53.455 --> 00:27:57.130 align:middle line:84%
It's probably a
release of energy

00:27:57.130 --> 00:28:00.670 align:middle line:84%
where you are
expecting one thing,

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:04.330 align:middle line:84%
and then something else
happens that you find

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:06.370 align:middle line:90%
that it's not harmful to you.

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:07.690 align:middle line:90%
It's just different.

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:08.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Have you ever--

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: So the
laughter, it's a release.

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:12.100 align:middle line:90%
It's like, a-ha, oh, I'm OK.

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:14.540 align:middle line:84%
But that's funny, because
I didn't expect that.

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
laughed so hard you

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.330 align:middle line:90%
start crying literally?

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:19.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Yes.

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your eyes
start watering.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:20.995 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Absolutely.

00:28:20.995 --> 00:28:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, isn't crying-
I mean, crying

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:28.390 align:middle line:90%
can express a great relief.

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:32.090 align:middle line:84%
It can express a great
level of expression.

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what creates
that emotion, the emotion

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:36.830 align:middle line:90%
to cry and get emotional?

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:41.260 align:middle line:84%
I was at my granddaughter's
graduation in May from college.

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:43.540 align:middle line:84%
We raised her since
she was a little baby.

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.487 align:middle line:84%
So I saw in her this
little baby, now

00:28:46.487 --> 00:28:49.770 align:middle line:84%
this 22-year-old woman
getting a degree.

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:52.390 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of emotional for
me, Neil, I got to tell you.

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And my daughter
kind of looked over.

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And she saw some tears
coming down my eyes.

00:28:57.410 --> 00:28:59.775 align:middle line:90%
What the heck causes that?

00:28:59.775 --> 00:29:01.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: Well, you're
talking about something where

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:04.270 align:middle line:84%
you're connecting
with another person,

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:07.420 align:middle line:84%
where there's some
empathy, where you're--

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But what is it in
the brain that did that to me?

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: Well,
there's a little area.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.282 align:middle line:90%
Here, give me the brain here.

00:29:13.282 --> 00:29:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hold it
up for the camera.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: So if you
put these two halves--

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Show it to the camera.

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.818 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: If you put these two
halves of the brain together,

00:29:18.818 --> 00:29:20.650 align:middle line:84%
you've got this front
third of the brain

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:22.330 align:middle line:84%
is called the
frontal lobes, right?

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And you've got
this crevice that's

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:27.250 align:middle line:84%
separating the right and left
hemispheres of the brain.

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:28.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: Well, if
you go inside right

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:32.770 align:middle line:84%
on the inside of
this crevice, there's

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:37.130 align:middle line:84%
an area called the
medial prefrontal cortex.

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is where
my emotions are?

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:42.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: It is a
combination of this part

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:45.580 align:middle line:84%
of the brain that allows
you to feel something

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:46.960 align:middle line:90%
for another person.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:50.620 align:middle line:84%
But it also has to
do with the amygdala.

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:54.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, people who have damage to
the medial prefrontal cortex--

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:55.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: --as well as damage
to the amygdala or if they have

00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:59.740 align:middle line:90%
amygdala that's too small--

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
experience this?

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.212 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: They don't experience
those kinds of emotions.

00:30:04.212 --> 00:30:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So a serial
killer, for example.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Exactly right.

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:12.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, what has been done on many
research, or a few research

00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:18.820 align:middle line:84%
projects, is they've done brain
scans of psychotic criminals

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:19.620 align:middle line:90%
in prison.

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:20.828 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something's lacking.

00:30:20.828 --> 00:30:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Something is lacking.

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:28.450 align:middle line:84%
You can have criminals who are
guilty of horrendous crimes.

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And you can subdivide those
criminals into two classes.

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:35.050 align:middle line:84%
One is the criminal
that feels remorse, that

00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:37.480 align:middle line:90%
feels something for the victim.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm sorry
I killed them.

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Exactly right.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.580 align:middle line:90%
That's not a psychotic criminal.

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:45.360 align:middle line:84%
But then you've got
another criminal

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:49.112 align:middle line:84%
that feels nothing, that
doesn't feel any emotional tie--

00:30:49.112 --> 00:30:50.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing, no emotion.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.085 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: --to that person.

00:30:51.085 --> 00:30:52.043 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In cold blood.

00:30:52.043 --> 00:30:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: And that
type of person has

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:57.160 align:middle line:84%
been shown to have
an undersized,

00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:02.410 align:middle line:84%
or under active, or damaged
amygdala, and medial prefrontal

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:04.810 align:middle line:90%
region.

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:08.380 align:middle line:84%
One very interesting
study that's fairly recent

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:12.670 align:middle line:84%
had to do with cases
of psychotic children.

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, these are very young, very
young juveniles and children,

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.320 align:middle line:90%
who are found to be callous.

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.520 align:middle line:84%
They call this callous
and unemotional children.

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:24.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're like
walking Chucky dolls.

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:26.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Exactly right.

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And what they found
is those children

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:34.390 align:middle line:84%
have a defect in the
amygdala circuit.

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:36.430 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
they're clicking back

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:43.360 align:middle line:84%
into aggressiveness, and
into harming other beings,

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:45.510 align:middle line:84%
but they feel no
emotional effect.

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing.

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.765 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: There's no--

00:31:46.765 --> 00:31:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No guilt, nothing.

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:48.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Yes.

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:52.990 align:middle line:84%
So when you were talking about
those feelings of emotion,

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:56.830 align:middle line:84%
of connectedness, that has to
do with both the frontal lobes,

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:59.260 align:middle line:90%
and that amygdala.

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:03.370 align:middle line:84%
One interesting part about that
study of psychotic children

00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:06.520 align:middle line:84%
is they don't respond
to punishment.

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:07.947 align:middle line:84%
You can punish
them all day long.

00:32:07.947 --> 00:32:08.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No emotion.

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:11.819 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: And since there's no
emotion, they don't respond.

00:32:11.819 --> 00:32:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Spank them,
nothing happens.

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:13.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Nothing.

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:15.880 align:middle line:84%
They'll just continue
with that same behavior.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:21.910 align:middle line:84%
But yet, the reward part
of circuits of the amygdala

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:23.560 align:middle line:90%
continues to work.

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:28.250 align:middle line:84%
So they found that if they
give positive reinforcement

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:31.400 align:middle line:84%
and reward, the
children will respond.

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And it will change their
behavior to the point

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:36.825 align:middle line:84%
where they stop doing
these types of--

00:32:36.825 --> 00:32:37.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: --harmful
psychotic activities

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:43.610 align:middle line:90%
towards other people.

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Within the brain, where
does the power for, let's say,

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:48.920 align:middle line:90%
extrasensory perception lie?

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: My opinion
is that it is

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:55.160 align:middle line:84%
dependent upon
the frontal lobes.

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:59.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, like any other
activity, the frontal lobes

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.240 align:middle line:84%
are only one part of the
brain that's activated.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.790 align:middle line:84%
But it's talking to
different parts of the brain

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:06.260 align:middle line:90%
all at the same time.

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:09.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, I worked at a facility
called the Dormant Brain

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.300 align:middle line:84%
Research and
Development Laboratory.

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:12.633 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What the heck was that?

00:33:12.633 --> 00:33:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: Well, this was a
brain and behavior modification

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:21.080 align:middle line:84%
laboratory that was run by
a fellow named TD Lingo.

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.965 align:middle line:90%
And he ran that from 1957 to--

00:33:23.965 --> 00:33:25.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've heard of him.

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: --1993.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.370 align:middle line:84%
This was his life's
work, figuring out

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:31.010 align:middle line:90%
what made the brain tick.

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And hundreds of people
coming through trying all

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.210 align:middle line:90%
sorts of different things--

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:38.240 align:middle line:84%
and that was the
Dormant Brain Research

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.840 align:middle line:90%
and Development Laboratory.

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.840 align:middle line:90%
And that's where I got my start.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And I spent 11 years
as his assistant,

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:49.550 align:middle line:84%
and where I wrote my first
book and learned all the ins

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:51.452 align:middle line:90%
and outs of brain self-control.

00:33:51.452 --> 00:33:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So many
people, Neil, will

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:57.200 align:middle line:90%
tell you focus, focus, focus.

00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:02.310 align:middle line:84%
It's as if the brain has
an innate ability to focus.

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Your brain focuses and puts
its attention on things it sees

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:10.020 align:middle line:84%
as important and relevant to
your survival and well-being.

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:13.620 align:middle line:84%
How does your brain decide
what's important and relevant?

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:15.900 align:middle line:84%
The only way you can
do this is to assess

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:18.690 align:middle line:84%
the external environment
against what is contained

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:21.159 align:middle line:90%
in your long-term memory.

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:26.510 align:middle line:84%
This includes all your beliefs,
experiences, and conditioning.

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:28.980 align:middle line:90%
This is its default system.

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:32.310 align:middle line:84%
So if you choose to believe that
something is impossible, then

00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:37.139 align:middle line:84%
even if it does exist
you will not see it.

00:34:37.139 --> 00:34:38.719 align:middle line:84%
You do, of course,
have the power

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:40.400 align:middle line:84%
to override this
[INAUDIBLE] default

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:43.909 align:middle line:84%
system with the thinking
part of your brain known

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:46.090 align:middle line:90%
as the frontal lobes.

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:49.030 align:middle line:84%
This is as simple as choosing
to put your attention

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:51.600 align:middle line:90%
and focus on what you want.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:55.270 align:middle line:84%
Basically, what you
focus on, you find.

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So we have the
ability to focus our own brains

00:34:58.030 --> 00:34:59.000 align:middle line:90%
on certain things.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.710 align:middle line:84%
It's not just the
brain that takes over.

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Yes.

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:04.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's very interesting,
that segment that we just

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:04.840 align:middle line:90%
watched.

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:09.205 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the primary
exercises at the brain lab,

00:35:09.205 --> 00:35:13.510 align:middle line:84%
and which I continue as well
in my instruction to people,

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:15.730 align:middle line:84%
is to take that
ability to focus,

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:19.370 align:middle line:84%
and focus on specific
regions in the brain.

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:23.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, what is found that you
can focus on the amygdala

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:27.609 align:middle line:84%
and cause it to click forward,
which is a term I use.

00:35:27.609 --> 00:35:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You should try
thinking that way, right?

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:31.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: You can
imagine, for example,

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:34.150 align:middle line:84%
that you've got a feather
inside your skull.

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:36.154 align:middle line:84%
And you're tickling--
that's where the phrase

00:35:36.154 --> 00:35:37.320 align:middle line:90%
"tickling your amygdala" is.

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I see.

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:41.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: You visualize
stimulating specific areas

00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:42.250 align:middle line:90%
in your brain.

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:43.674 align:middle line:84%
You can tickle
your frontal lobes.

00:35:43.674 --> 00:35:44.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it works.

00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:46.945 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: And it
absolutely works.

00:35:46.945 --> 00:35:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a type
of meditation.

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, some researchers
have studied

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:57.640 align:middle line:84%
that type of inner focus to see
what is happening in the brain.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:00.910 align:middle line:10%
Sara Lazar, Herbert
Benson, there

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:04.360 align:middle line:10%
have been others, show
that when you focus,

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:07.720 align:middle line:10%
do a focused meditation,
that actually causes--

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:13.060 align:middle line:10%
it's just not a
thing that's femoral.

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:16.420 align:middle line:84%
It actually causes a
change in brain function.

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:20.170 align:middle line:84%
If you focus in a
meditative state,

00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:23.590 align:middle line:84%
it will cause an increase
in frontal lobes' activity.

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:25.427 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
this on the FMRI--

00:36:25.427 --> 00:36:26.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's there.

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:28.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: --scans and PET scans.

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, to connect that, what
you were talking about,

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:35.610 align:middle line:84%
with paranormal and
ESP, what I have

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:38.410 align:middle line:84%
found in my own
experimentation and research

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:42.460 align:middle line:84%
is if you do that
amygdala tickling

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:45.430 align:middle line:84%
focusing on the frontal
lobes' area of the brain

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:48.160 align:middle line:84%
and on the amygdala,
then people report

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:53.420 align:middle line:84%
an increase in those types
of paranormal perceptions.

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:56.830 align:middle line:84%
So simply by focusing on
specific areas of the brain,

00:36:56.830 --> 00:36:58.840 align:middle line:90%
you can turn on ESP.

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And that that's happening as
a real function of the brain

00:37:03.850 --> 00:37:07.540 align:middle line:84%
has been proven by the
brain scanning as well

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:10.210 align:middle line:84%
as the anecdotal
reports that I'm

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:12.340 align:middle line:84%
getting from people all
over the world who are

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:14.440 align:middle line:90%
doing that particular exercise.

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The brain is a
marvelous machine, isn't it?

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: It's the
most complex thing

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:22.210 align:middle line:90%
that we know of in the universe.

00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And in
200,000 years from now,

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:25.860 align:middle line:90%
what will our brains look like?

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: You know,
in 20 years from now?

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:33.160 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting to
note that anthropologists

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:38.200 align:middle line:84%
have seen changes in the human
brain from 20,000 years ago

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:39.820 align:middle line:90%
to present day.

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:44.350 align:middle line:84%
One interesting thing is they've
been tracking cranial size.

00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:46.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they've looked at skulls.

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And they've looked at the
capacity of the cranium.

00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:53.790 align:middle line:10%
Now, from 20,000 years
ago to 200 years ago,

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:57.820 align:middle line:10%
believe it or not,
they've seen shrinkage.

00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:59.530 align:middle line:84%
They've seen the
cranial size getting--

00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:00.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:01.240 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: Well, there's
some interesting theories

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:05.460 align:middle line:90%
about that.

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:08.860 align:middle line:84%
But importantly, they've
seen that the human brain

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:12.419 align:middle line:84%
has gotten smaller during
the past 20,000 years.

00:38:12.419 --> 00:38:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's not good.

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Significantly smaller.

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:19.420 align:middle line:84%
If you were to correlate that
with brain size, for example,

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:22.660 align:middle line:90%
Cro-Magnon man, who existed--

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:25.810 align:middle line:84%
is it, 40,000 or 70,000
years ago or 100,000?

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:26.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Before we did.

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.133 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: It was a long time ago.

00:38:28.133 --> 00:38:30.072 align:middle line:84%
Or I think that was
20,000 years ago.

00:38:30.072 --> 00:38:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
the Neanderthals.

00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:34.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: Well, Cro-Magnon
man 20,000 years ago

00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:38.380 align:middle line:84%
had a brain of a certain size
and a body of a certain size.

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:41.230 align:middle line:90%
Now, brains have shrunken.

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:45.550 align:middle line:84%
If we were to keep that
same relative size of body

00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:50.387 align:middle line:84%
to brain size, today we
should be the size of Pygmies.

00:38:50.387 --> 00:38:51.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That small?

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:52.030 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: That small.

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To match our brains?

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:54.696 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: To match the
reduction in brain size.

00:38:54.696 --> 00:38:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Instead of
being 10 feet tall.

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.111 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: Well, instead
of being 6 feet tall

00:38:58.111 --> 00:39:00.820 align:middle line:84%
and 5 foot 7", the
way we are now.

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:02.830 align:middle line:84%
That's how much the
brain has shrunk.

00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:04.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, interestingly
enough, they've

00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:07.330 align:middle line:84%
also tracked the
change in cranial size

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:09.790 align:middle line:90%
over the past 200 years.

00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:13.712 align:middle line:90%
And it's started to go up again.

00:39:13.712 --> 00:39:14.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's hope for us.

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: There's hope for us.

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:19.750 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's
a lot of theories

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:22.750 align:middle line:90%
about why brain has shrunk.

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:28.603 align:middle line:84%
One is that, well, we're just
getting dumber for some reason.

00:39:28.603 --> 00:39:29.570 align:middle line:90%
Did you ever see the--

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:31.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or we're
not using it as much.

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:32.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Well, we're not--

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:34.040 align:middle line:90%
that's exactly right.

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.765 align:middle line:84%
Why wouldn't we be
using it as much?

00:39:35.765 --> 00:39:36.565 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Computers.

00:39:36.565 --> 00:39:38.315 align:middle line:84%
We're relying on stuff
like that to think.

00:39:38.315 --> 00:39:39.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Well, technology.

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:40.860 align:middle line:90%
And you know--

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Calculators,
for example, right?

00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:43.630 align:middle line:10%
>>SLADE: Well, but that's--

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:45.090 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: In the old
days, in our days, Neil,

00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:46.870 align:middle line:10%
you use to calculate
in your head.

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:47.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Yes.

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:48.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or write
it down on paper.

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:48.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Yes.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you
have a calculator.

00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:51.830 align:middle line:10%
There's calculators
on our smartphones.

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:52.510 align:middle line:10%
>>SLADE: Yeah, but that's--

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:54.610 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: People aren't
thinking anymore.

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:55.777 align:middle line:90%
You go to a fast food place.

00:39:55.777 --> 00:39:56.576 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Yeah.

00:39:56.576 --> 00:39:58.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is one
of my pet peeves.

00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:00.610 align:middle line:84%
If their computers are
down, and that person's

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:03.520 align:middle line:84%
got to give you change
for a $20 bill based

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:07.210 align:middle line:84%
on what you charged and bought,
they can't figure it out.

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: You're
absolutely right.

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're brains are
shrinking, because of that.

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:11.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Yeah.

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:16.210 align:middle line:84%
But you have to say, though,
however, this industrialization

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:19.540 align:middle line:84%
has only happened in
the past 100, 200 years.

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:23.320 align:middle line:84%
That's the period where the
brain has gotten a bit larger.

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:29.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, it may be that as
civilization has come along

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:31.330 align:middle line:90%
and agriculture--

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:33.790 align:middle line:84%
you know, 20,000 years
ago, human beings

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:38.080 align:middle line:84%
only existed in very small
groups of 10 or 20 people that

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.430 align:middle line:90%
were nomadic.

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:40.404 align:middle line:90%
You didn't have cities.

00:40:40.404 --> 00:40:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not any more.

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: You didn't have towns.

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, the change has
been that civilization

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:49.330 align:middle line:84%
has taken over a
lot of the roles

00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:54.940 align:middle line:84%
that in prehistoric times,
we had to think to survive.

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:56.650 align:middle line:84%
You know, we had to
calculate, how am I

00:40:56.650 --> 00:41:00.550 align:middle line:84%
going to survive to the
next day living in a cave?

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:03.340 align:middle line:84%
You know, what am I going
to do just to make it

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:04.990 align:middle line:90%
from one day to the next?

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:08.500 align:middle line:84%
So it may be that
prehistoric man, people

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:12.700 align:middle line:84%
living 20,000 years ago, had
to use a lot more brainpower.

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:15.070 align:middle line:84%
These days, we don't
have to think as much.

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:17.420 align:middle line:84%
As you said, you know, a lot
of things are done for us.

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That are done for us.

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:20.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: So the
brain has shrunk.

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:22.060 align:middle line:84%
But that's just one
way of looking at it.

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Another way of looking
at it may be that--

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:28.960 align:middle line:84%
do you know how
computers have shrunk?

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:30.815 align:middle line:84%
Your laptops used
to be this big.

00:41:30.815 --> 00:41:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And now, they're only
as big as phones.

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:33.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: A regular
computer, a supercomputer,

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.450 align:middle line:84%
would be the size
of a warehouse.

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:39.366 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're saying
capacity sometimes--

00:41:39.366 --> 00:41:42.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: So efficiency
has increased, and size.

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:44.770 align:middle line:84%
So it might be that our
brains are just much more

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:47.410 align:middle line:90%
efficient than they used to be.

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we're packing more
neurons into a smaller area

00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:53.750 align:middle line:90%
than we were before.

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:58.780 align:middle line:84%
So nobody really knows why in
general the brain has shrunken.

00:41:58.780 --> 00:41:59.860 align:middle line:90%
It's just something--

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's happening.

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:01.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: --interesting to note.

00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Melatonin is
developed in the pineal gland.

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:07.130 align:middle line:90%
What does that do for us?

00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And what is the perception
that comes out of that gland?

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: Oh, very
interesting, melatonin.

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, melatonin
is used to enhance sleep--

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:15.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:17.414 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: --to cause
you to go to sleep.

00:42:17.414 --> 00:42:20.110 align:middle line:84%
But it's also related to a
very interesting chemical

00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:23.470 align:middle line:90%
called dimethyltryptamine, DMT.

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:28.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, DMT is the most powerful
hallucinogen known to man.

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:34.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: People who take
DMT have fantastic visions,

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:37.390 align:middle line:84%
and experience reality
that has nothing

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:39.560 align:middle line:90%
to do with physical reality.

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, you've spoken,
and we've spoken

00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:44.830 align:middle line:84%
in this program about
consciousness that

00:42:44.830 --> 00:42:49.990 align:middle line:84%
resides outside of the body, and
outside of sensory information.

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, people who take DMT,
a relative to melatonin,

00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:59.410 align:middle line:84%
experience a reality that
is like another universe.

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what does
that pineal gland do for us?

00:43:02.590 --> 00:43:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: Well, the pineal
gland is, reportedly,

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:11.440 align:middle line:84%
part of the manufacture of
that particular chemical,

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.870 align:middle line:90%
of the melatonin and the DMT.

00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:16.060 align:middle line:90%
That is what it's speculated to.

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Another interesting
connection is when we sleep,

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:21.020 align:middle line:90%
we experience dreams.

00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And it may be that
there's a connection

00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:27.640 align:middle line:84%
between that perception
of an alternative reality

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:30.270 align:middle line:90%
as we experienced in dreams.

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:32.440 align:middle line:84%
There's a connection
between the melatonin,

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:34.510 align:middle line:84%
and the pineal
gland and the DMT.

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:37.510 align:middle line:84%
It's all kind of connected
together in that manner.

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a
special resonance

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:43.450 align:middle line:84%
of 528 Hertz cycles
per second that

00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:45.190 align:middle line:90%
resonate with the human mind.

00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:46.795 align:middle line:90%
What does that do for us?

00:43:46.795 --> 00:43:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: Some people call this
the God frequency, as it were.

00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And there are claims
that it enhances

00:43:57.070 --> 00:44:00.550 align:middle line:84%
a certain state
of mind, this sort

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:03.340 align:middle line:90%
of universal consciousness.

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:08.050 align:middle line:84%
My feeling is that
the brain moves

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:10.510 align:middle line:90%
into all kinds of frequencies.

00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And we're not limited, or
we perceive more than just

00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:19.240 align:middle line:90%
that one particular frequency.

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:22.870 align:middle line:84%
It's an opinion
that if you listen

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:27.430 align:middle line:84%
to that particular frequency,
that it will enhance

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:29.680 align:middle line:84%
certain types of
perceptions that will lead

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:31.450 align:middle line:90%
to a certain state of mind.

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:36.580 align:middle line:84%
My feeling is, for
example, you have a piano.

00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And you have a vast
range of frequencies

00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:41.170 align:middle line:90%
on a piano keyboard.

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:44.260 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to play a
piece of music or a song,

00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:48.280 align:middle line:84%
you're utilizing all of the
frequencies on the keyboard.

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:52.030 align:middle line:84%
You're not just playing one note
on the-- if you're going like

00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:53.130 align:middle line:90%
ding, ding, ding--

00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:53.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It sounds
like "Eyes Wide Shut."

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:55.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: --that's going
to be very monotonous.

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:58.060 align:middle line:84%
That's not going to be
very interesting at all.

00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:03.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, as a meditation, you
focus on one particular thing.

00:45:03.250 --> 00:45:06.220 align:middle line:84%
You might focus on a
single candle flame,

00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:10.120 align:middle line:84%
or you may focus on a
particular sound like, ohm.

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And that will bring about a
certain response in your body.

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:20.740 align:middle line:84%
But if you were to do nothing
but stay in that state

00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:24.820 align:middle line:84%
all of the time, it would be
a rather bland experience.

00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:32.020 align:middle line:84%
So my advice to people is
you can utilize meditation

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:36.310 align:middle line:84%
on that frequency or listen
to that frequency on occasion

00:45:36.310 --> 00:45:39.460 align:middle line:84%
if you're trying to achieve
a calm state of mind

00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:41.620 align:middle line:90%
or a meditative state.

00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:45.144 align:middle line:84%
But life is more than
just one frequency.

00:45:45.144 --> 00:45:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It better be.

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:48.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: And life consists
of a lot of different tones.

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And everything, all different
tones, all different colors,

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:55.211 align:middle line:90%
they're all important to us.

00:45:55.211 --> 00:45:56.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We all
know that meditation

00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:58.360 align:middle line:90%
does affect the brain.

00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:59.520 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:01.390 align:middle line:90%
And why?

00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:04.570 align:middle line:10%
>>SLADE: Well, there have
been research studies

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:08.530 align:middle line:10%
as to what happens in the
brain when you meditate.

00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:12.640 align:middle line:10%
And they've done brain
scans of Tibetan monks.

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:16.450 align:middle line:84%
They've done brain scans
of ordinary people.

00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:18.310 align:middle line:90%
And what happens in the brain?

00:46:18.310 --> 00:46:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Well as it turns out,
when you meditate,

00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:24.910 align:middle line:84%
it activates the prefrontal
cortex and the frontal lobes,

00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:27.550 align:middle line:84%
the most advanced
parts of your brain.

00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Again, Sara Lazar and Herbert
Benson at Harvard University

00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:33.610 align:middle line:90%
have done these studies.

00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And I refer to those
studies in my book.

00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SLADE: But there have been a
great number of other studies

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:45.160 align:middle line:84%
that show when you meditate,
this turns on compassion

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:46.820 align:middle line:90%
to increase in the brain.

00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:48.010 align:middle line:90%
It turns on empathy.

00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:49.385 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kicks it
into high gear.

00:46:49.385 --> 00:46:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: It turns on creativity.

00:46:51.010 --> 00:46:55.360 align:middle line:84%
So meditation is very useful
for turning on these higher

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:56.990 align:middle line:90%
functions of the brain.

00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:58.840 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
become smarter,

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:02.140 align:middle line:84%
spend a little bit of your
time each day or at least once

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:05.200 align:middle line:84%
in a while sitting
in a chair, and doing

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:07.690 align:middle line:90%
the meditation of your choice.

00:47:07.690 --> 00:47:10.709 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there's a lot of
different kinds of meditation.

00:47:10.709 --> 00:47:12.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what
does chanting do?

00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:12.480 align:middle line:90%
Ohm.

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:13.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SLADE: Well, chanting is--

00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:17.350 align:middle line:90%
we talked about focus again.

00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:22.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's the elimination
of distraction

00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:24.850 align:middle line:90%
to get the brain to synchronize.

00:47:24.850 --> 00:47:29.020 align:middle line:84%
When people meditate, you
see a synchronization.

00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:31.270 align:middle line:10%
And you can actually see a--

00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:33.430 align:middle line:10%
I can't think of the
word at this moment.

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:38.900 align:middle line:10%
But you see this
cascading of brain--

00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:39.700 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Functions.

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:41.870 align:middle line:10%
>>SLADE: --waves, of
functions through the brain.

00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:46.210 align:middle line:10%
And you'll see the brain, as it
were, synchronize within itself

00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:50.540 align:middle line:10%
and also cause a increase
in frontal lobes activity.

00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's what brings about
all of these positive changes

00:47:54.550 --> 00:47:56.889 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:47:56.889 --> 00:47:58.930 align:middle line:84%

to do whatever you want.

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And then you meditate,
and make it happen.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.570 align:middle line:90%
Use your brain.

00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Because if you use your brain,
it'll take you to places

00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:19.330 align:middle line:90%
you can only imagine.
