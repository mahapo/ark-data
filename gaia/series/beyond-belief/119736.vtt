00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:08.130 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[THEME MUSIC] And I think
many people today don't

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:08.810 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.290 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.600 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.265 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.265 --> 00:00:26.640 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY:
Well welcome back

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.380 align:middle line:10%
to another edition
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.652 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:29.652 --> 00:00:31.690 align:middle line:10%
You know, throughout
history, mankind

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:37.070 align:middle line:10%
has reported seeing objects
flying all over the planet.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.160 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrial life--
are we being visited?

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Our special guest,
Tracie Austin.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.470 align:middle line:84%
Tracie written a book
called "Alien Encounters

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.900 align:middle line:90%
in the Western United States."

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Now that's fascinating
Trace that you

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.300 align:middle line:84%
were able to pinpoint
a certain region.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.535 align:middle line:90%
How did you do that?

00:00:53.535 --> 00:00:54.910 align:middle line:10%
>>TRACIE AUSTIN:
Well George, how

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.170 align:middle line:10%
it began, I was approached
by the publisher Schiffer

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.050 align:middle line:10%
to write this book
about alien encounters.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.990 align:middle line:10%
And they suggested,
why don't you--

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.980 align:middle line:10%
because I lived in the
Western United States--

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.800 align:middle line:10%
why don't you
concentrate on that area?

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.450 align:middle line:90%
So that's exactly what I did.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we have a huge
incidents of UFO reports

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.380 align:middle line:84%
in the western portion
of the country?

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: We do actually.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.010 align:middle line:84%
You'll find that
some of those cases

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.420 align:middle line:84%
in there-- well the majority of
the cases-- are from Las Vegas.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.080 align:middle line:90%
They're from Colorado.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.290 align:middle line:84%
They're from California,
some stretching over

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.820 align:middle line:90%
to Texas as well.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.010 align:middle line:84%
But that book is totally
dedicated to the western part

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.830 align:middle line:90%
of America.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.359 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now I detected a
little British accent there.

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:40.150 align:middle line:90%
Where are you from?

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.376 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Yes I'm from
England, the good old UK.

00:01:43.376 --> 00:01:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're in
the United States now.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.140 align:middle line:84%
How did you get interested
in UFO encounters?

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.240 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Well George, how it
happened for me was totally

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.720 align:middle line:90%
out of the blue, so to speak.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.920 align:middle line:84%
I trained as a
classical musician.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.420 align:middle line:90%
I trained--

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.086 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:01:59.086 --> 00:02:01.330 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Yes, as a
classical concert pianist.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And I studied at the Guildhall
School of Music and Drama

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.180 align:middle line:90%
in London.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.419 align:middle line:84%
And one fine day, a UFO decided
to show up and show itself

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:11.640 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.440 align:middle line:84%
I was with my dear
friend at the time.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.050 align:middle line:90%
He was also a musician.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And so we got to see
this craft together.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And we were at the YMCA as
students where we were staying.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And we just having
a conversation,

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.550 align:middle line:84%
a regular conversation
about life.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And I look out the
window and I see a craft.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.547 align:middle line:90%
And it was a cone shaped object.

00:02:32.547 --> 00:02:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is way before
drones and things like that,

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.100 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.975 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Absolutely.

00:02:35.975 --> 00:02:38.930 align:middle line:90%
We're talking now back to 1987.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And so I see this object
that's like a cone.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.870 align:middle line:90%
It's pointed at the top.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.420 align:middle line:90%
It's rounded at the bottom.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And this thing is rotating
as it's moving in the sky.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:47.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: And I see the
sunlight hitting it.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.350 align:middle line:84%
So there's a metallic
glint coming from it.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.110 align:middle line:90%
And I turned to my friend.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And of course being
British, as you do,

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.000 align:middle line:84%
I said, "What the
bloody hell is that?"

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.380 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "It's a UFO."

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "What
do you mean, a UFO?"

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.634 align:middle line:10%
He'd seen things as a
kid whereas I hadn't.

00:03:07.634 --> 00:03:08.550 align:middle line:90%
So he explained to me.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.633 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well you mean
then that this thing is

00:03:10.633 --> 00:03:13.589 align:middle line:84%
being piloted by beings
from another dimension?"

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who knows where.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Or who knows
where, outer space.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.590 align:middle line:90%
And he said exactly.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, so
I just watched it.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.610 align:middle line:84%
We watched it together go
across the sky and out of view.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.770 align:middle line:84%
The next day, we came
out of a train station,

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.210 align:middle line:84%
an underground train
station, which London

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.460 align:middle line:90%
has those, just like New York.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.760 align:middle line:84%
There's a guy selling
newspapers at the entrance.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.250 align:middle line:84%
My friend points to the
newspaper and says look,

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.040 align:middle line:90%
there's our UFO.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.010 align:middle line:84%
So we see a great
big headline, UFO

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.300 align:middle line:90%
seen over the city of London.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.130 align:middle line:84%
So we knew that we were not
the only people to see that.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.130 align:middle line:90%
Other people saw it too.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And was
there any explanation?

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Did the government come out
and say hey, it's one of ours?

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.160 align:middle line:90%
Nothing like that?

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Nothing at all.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.820 align:middle line:90%
Nothing was talked about.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know Nick
Pope as well as I do.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And Nick of course was part
of the British Ministry

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.820 align:middle line:90%
of Defense.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And he was responsible
for a section

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.040 align:middle line:90%
that accumulated UFO data.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And he is totally convinced that
this planet is being visited.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.079 align:middle line:84%
He claims that he
saw actual reports

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.000 align:middle line:84%
from the Ministry of Defense
testifying, basically, to that.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Something's happening
here Tracy, isn't there?

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: I think so George.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And I've been studying
this since 1987.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And the more and more
I do look into this

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.210 align:middle line:84%
and research it and
speak to people,

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.790 align:middle line:84%
there's more evidence
for it than against it.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.950 align:middle line:84%
I think more and more
people are coming forward.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.760 align:middle line:84%
More and more skeptics
are becoming believers.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And there's definitely
something going on

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.260 align:middle line:84%
here on this planet of magnitude
with visitations from someone,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.520 align:middle line:90%
somewhere.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you say that
your expertise is dealing

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.740 align:middle line:84%
with people who
have had encounters,

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.810 align:middle line:90%
or just the craft themselves?

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: It's a mixture of
both, to be honest with you.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.850 align:middle line:84%
The book "Alien Encounters
in the Western United States"

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.080 align:middle line:84%
deals with nine true
accounts of alien abductions,

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.320 align:middle line:90%
in particular.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.319 align:middle line:84%
So they have had actual
contact with these beings.

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:25.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.800 align:middle line:84%
Well you had an opportunity
to meet one of our dear

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.230 align:middle line:90%
friends, the late Roger Leir.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Roger Leir was a podiatrist
who decided somewhere early

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.400 align:middle line:84%
in his career, I'm
going to investigate

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.120 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial presence
and objects that people claim

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.660 align:middle line:90%
they've been implanted with.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And he conducted a
number of operations.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.800 align:middle line:84%
Now to those of
you who might know

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:57.140 align:middle line:84%
who the great late Dr. Roger
Leir was or is, take a look.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.136 align:middle line:10%
>>ROGER LEIR: I've
located the object

00:05:59.136 --> 00:06:04.365 align:middle line:10%
and we're trying to an
instrument to get a hold of it

00:06:04.365 --> 00:06:05.300 align:middle line:10%
and get it out.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: The name Dr. Roger
Leir has become synonymous

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.440 align:middle line:90%
with the term alien implant.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Leir had a long career
as a podiatric surgeon

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.170 align:middle line:84%
and was recognized as one of
the most significant leaders

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.420 align:middle line:84%
in the research and collection
of physical evidence

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.060 align:middle line:84%
from alleged alien
abduction cases.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.490 align:middle line:10%
>>LEIR: How do you get
something into the human body

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.320 align:middle line:10%
and not have the
body react to it?

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.250 align:middle line:10%
Well, that just doesn't happen.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.000 align:middle line:10%
Maybe there's some
weirded out explanation

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.200 align:middle line:10%
that I didn't understand from
one site, maybe two sites.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.810 align:middle line:10%
But three sites, from
two different people?

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.200 align:middle line:10%
That's just a little
too much to handle.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.860 align:middle line:10%
There's something
similar going on here.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.880 align:middle line:10%
You either have an
inflammatory reaction.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.190 align:middle line:10%
Or if it's a full blown
inflammatory reaction,

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.890 align:middle line:10%
we call it a rejection reaction.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.690 align:middle line:10%
You just don't get foreign
material into the body

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.157 align:middle line:10%
and have the body sit
there and smile at it.

00:07:03.157 --> 00:07:03.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I miss him.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: I miss him terribly.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.030 align:middle line:90%
I don't like that late word.

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what a void
without him being around now.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.790 align:middle line:84%
I get calls on "Coast to
Coast" Tracie all the time

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.470 align:middle line:84%
from people who say, I
think I have an implant.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:17.250 align:middle line:90%
What do I do?

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:18.750 align:middle line:90%
Where do I go?

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who to
refer them to anymore.

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:22.610 align:middle line:90%
I mean, Roger was the guy.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: He was
the pioneer, yes.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.970 align:middle line:90%
I mean, who is doing this now?

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.070 align:middle line:90%
I mean, who's these surgeries?

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.330 align:middle line:90%
Has anyone come forward?

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever
have a chance to witness

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.120 align:middle line:90%
one of his surgeries?

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.660 align:middle line:84%
I did with producer
Tom Danheiser.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.280 align:middle line:90%
This was an incredible thing.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.140 align:middle line:90%
This was back around 2003, 2004.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And Roger said, "We're
going to conduct a surgery

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.490 align:middle line:84%
on a woman who claims that
she has some kind of implant

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:49.850 align:middle line:90%
in her cheek.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:51.400 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to extract it.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.880 align:middle line:90%
We're going to go get it."

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.900 align:middle line:90%
And I said all right.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:54.910 align:middle line:90%
And he said "Come on by.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.030 align:middle line:84%
I want you to witness
this operation."

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:57.940 align:middle line:90%
So we did.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.240 align:middle line:90%
And we audiotaped it.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And Roger was there
with a surgeon.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And they had a
television screen up

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.760 align:middle line:84%
so you could see
where they were going.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough Tracie,
there was an object

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.410 align:middle line:90%
in the cheek of this woman.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And every time the surgeon
went to surgically remove it,

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:17.140 align:middle line:90%
it moved.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.820 align:middle line:90%
It was like it had eyes.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:19.480 align:middle line:90%
It knew.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.760 align:middle line:90%
It sensed.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And it just kept wiggling
around in her cheek.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Very small, about the
size of a grain rice.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.260 align:middle line:90%
Finally he got it out.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.610 align:middle line:84%
But I felt sorry for the
woman because he really

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:34.299 align:middle line:84%
had to dig around in her
face to get this thing out.

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And Roger was never
able, never able

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.970 align:middle line:84%
to find out exactly
what the object was.

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:42.309 align:middle line:84%
There was just no
explanation for it.

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:44.830 align:middle line:84%
You've had a chance to
witness some of that too.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.290 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:49.290 align:middle line:10%
>>>>[INAUDIBLE] the light
around a little better

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:50.160 align:middle line:10%
and you can see it.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.201 align:middle line:10%
>>Yeah, that's the shape.

00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>>There it is.

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:52.670 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:53.320 align:middle line:90%
>>That's it.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.109 align:middle line:90%
>>Wow.

00:08:54.109 --> 00:08:55.025 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE] typical.

00:08:55.025 --> 00:08:57.640 align:middle line:90%


00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.591 align:middle line:10%
>>Similar to the--

00:08:58.591 --> 00:08:59.340 align:middle line:10%
>>You can feel it.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.020 align:middle line:10%
It feels like a--
it's pretty soft.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.140 align:middle line:10%
>>[INAUDIBLE] membrane.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.010 align:middle line:10%
>>Yeah, let's see.

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.312 align:middle line:10%
Softer than I
thought it would be.

00:09:06.312 --> 00:09:09.760 align:middle line:10%
Here, we'll shot it to you.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.630 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: The implant
was finally out.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:16.650 align:middle line:10%
It was Dr. Leir's 17th
implant removal surgery.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:19.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did you think
when you were witnessing that?

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: I thought,
I'm witnessing

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.770 align:middle line:84%
something very amazing
that obviously not everyone

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.380 align:middle line:90%
gets to do.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.410 align:middle line:84%
If this thing is
something that's

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.890 align:middle line:84%
been implemented by
beings from elsewhere,

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:33.820 align:middle line:84%
wow what a fantastic
opportunity, and how

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.580 align:middle line:84%
amazing to be there
and witness it.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.970 align:middle line:84%
This was a lady who was an
airline stewardess, actually,

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:44.230 align:middle line:84%
who had the implant
in her right forearm.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And she remembers 20 something
years ago with her boyfriend,

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:52.170 align:middle line:90%
they were in a motel room.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And they in their head get a
message to go to the window,

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:59.560 align:middle line:90%
to look outside the window.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.700 align:middle line:90%
They see a UFO.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.190 align:middle line:90%
They see a disk with lights.

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And she said the next
thing they remembered

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:10.000 align:middle line:84%
was a ball of blue light
coming into the room.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And then all of the
sudden, it's morning.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.040 align:middle line:90%
So they awake.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.535 align:middle line:84%
And they're having a regular
morning conversation.

00:10:17.535 --> 00:10:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And she says "Wait a minute,
what happened to us last night?

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:21.940 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember?""

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.700 align:middle line:84%
Well her boyfriend at the time
didn't want to talk about.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:28.140 align:middle line:90%
He was totally not interested.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "Well, I
remember we went to the window.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.060 align:middle line:90%
We saw the craft.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And then the ball of blue light
came in and it's morning."

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Well that day was the last
day she saw her boyfriend.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.870 align:middle line:84%
She never saw him
again after that.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:42.700 align:middle line:90%
She's taking a shower.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.310 align:middle line:84%
She notices this
lump in her forearm

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:49.150 align:middle line:84%
that wasn't there the
night before, previously.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And just think it's a
little odd with the fact

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.592 align:middle line:84%
she could move it around
her arm a little bit.

00:10:55.592 --> 00:10:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She could feel that.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.060 align:middle line:84%
So she keeps it in there
for 20 something years,

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:05.870 align:middle line:84%
finds Dr. Roger Leir on a
documentary about suspected

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:10.170 align:middle line:84%
alien implants and thinks hmm,
I wonder if that's what I have,

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.810 align:middle line:90%
because I had the sighing.

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:13.490 align:middle line:90%
Then I have this.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:15.150 align:middle line:90%
So she contacts Dr. Leir.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:16.900 align:middle line:90%
They meet.

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:20.090 align:middle line:84%
He takes her through the
testing which he usually does.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And says, "Yeah, you have
something in your arm here.

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.160 align:middle line:90%
Do you want it removed?"

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.470 align:middle line:90%
And she said yes.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:29.910 align:middle line:84%
So he did the surgery
along with another surgeon.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And very difficult to actually
get a hold of this object--

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It moves.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:34.279 align:middle line:10%
It does

00:11:34.279 --> 00:11:35.730 align:middle line:10%
>>AUSTIN: --because it moved.

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:37.630 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely, shot up her arm.

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:40.200 align:middle line:10%
So they have to pick
up the skin like a tent

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.510 align:middle line:10%
and really go in there.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:42.926 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And block
it from moving.

00:11:42.926 --> 00:11:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Yes, and
grab this thing.

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And this object was
unlike anything else

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.560 align:middle line:90%
that Dr. Leir has removed.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.000 align:middle line:90%
The majority have been metallic.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.540 align:middle line:90%
This was biological.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.250 align:middle line:84%
It was like yellowish
cream in color.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Attaching
itself to her body.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:00.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Yes.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Two halves like a clam
with a black strip that

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.770 align:middle line:90%
ran down the middle of it.

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And unlike anything else
I've seen, to be honest.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He is and
have been convinced

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:17.580 align:middle line:84%
that these objects were of
extraterrestrial origin.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Initially he didn't
know what they were.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.740 align:middle line:84%
But then he is convinced
that that's what they are.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Yeah, he talks about--
and he wrote a little bit

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.430 align:middle line:84%
in my book here in a chapter
about his findings of it

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:32.370 align:middle line:84%
and said that at first,
he was highly skeptical

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.450 align:middle line:84%
of these things, because
he's removed everything

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.630 align:middle line:84%
from the human body
being a podiatrist.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:40.150 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh, pieces of glass
and feet and things like that.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.300 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Yeah, glass,
hair, plastic, you name it,

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:43.530 align:middle line:90%
he's removed it.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:47.270 align:middle line:84%
But he was convinced
after he'd seen these

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:49.820 align:middle line:84%
and had them analyzed
what they were.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And states in my book
that these objects

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:59.750 align:middle line:84%
have been analyzed to come
1/3 away from the Milky Way

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:03.470 align:middle line:84%
from a civilization that are
13 million years older than we

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:04.500 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:08.020 align:middle line:84%
So that gives food
for thought there.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is your conclusion
about what might be going on?

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.780 align:middle line:90%
Why put these objects in people?

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.380 align:middle line:90%
What do they want?

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.990 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Well
first, Roger thought

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:20.780 align:middle line:90%
they were tracking devices.

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.830 align:middle line:84%
Then came to the conclusion
they're not tracking

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:24.930 align:middle line:84%
devices, because these
beings can actually

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:25.905 align:middle line:90%
locate you anywhere.

00:13:25.905 --> 00:13:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Anytime they want.

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Absolutely.

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:30.150 align:middle line:84%
So what they're doing
George, it seems

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:32.980 align:middle line:90%
is that they are monitoring DNA.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:36.070 align:middle line:84%
We all have our own electronic
signature in our DNA.

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:37.530 align:middle line:90%
They're all different.

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:40.130 align:middle line:84%
But there's a certain
characteristic, apparently,

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:42.310 align:middle line:84%
that these beings
are looking for.

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:45.317 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't have
this characteristic,

00:13:45.317 --> 00:13:46.150 align:middle line:90%
they don't need you.

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't want you.

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: So they're
interested in family lineage.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For themselves.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:50.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Yes.

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.889 align:middle line:84%
If you've been taken,
your mother's been taken,

00:13:52.889 --> 00:13:54.430 align:middle line:84%
and your mother's
mothers been taken.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:55.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or your
children have been taken.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: That's right.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.670 align:middle line:90%
So they're following lineage.

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:01.330 align:middle line:90%
They're following bloodlines.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now of course
we're interactive.

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:05.530 align:middle line:84%
We've got a phone
call for Tracie.

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:06.494 align:middle line:90%
Let's listen in.

00:14:06.494 --> 00:14:07.410 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hi Tracie.

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.920 align:middle line:84%
My name is Troy and
I'm 20 years old.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.770 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering if you think
we'll ever see disclosure

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:14.362 align:middle line:90%
in my lifetime?

00:14:14.362 --> 00:14:16.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's an
interesting question Tracie.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.949 align:middle line:84%
Will we see disclosure
in our lifetime?

00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:20.990 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: That is an
interesting question George.

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:22.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm hoping yes.

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:24.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping that
will be the case.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.000 align:middle line:84%
I was hoping within
this next five years

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.320 align:middle line:84%
we may get to hear something
from the scientific community

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.530 align:middle line:84%
about it, because I
don't think governments

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:35.200 align:middle line:90%
per se will come forward.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.750 align:middle line:84%
But I think it will be
science related in some way.

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:40.970 align:middle line:90%
So I'm hoping so Troy, yes.

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:43.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping it will
happen for us.

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: If you
talk to most people

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:47.451 align:middle line:84%
and ask them about
extraterrestrial life, what

00:14:47.451 --> 00:14:48.450 align:middle line:90%
do you think they'd say?

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Would they agree with all of
us that we're being visited,

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.470 align:middle line:84%
or would they just
pooh, pooh it away

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.274 align:middle line:90%
and they go nah, not at all.

00:14:56.274 --> 00:14:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: I think
it's a mixed bag

00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:59.170 align:middle line:90%
to be honest with you George.

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:02.270 align:middle line:84%
I've been fortunate to
speak with a lot of people

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:05.510 align:middle line:84%
who are in belief of it,
who have seen things,

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.490 align:middle line:84%
and who are convinced
we are being

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:12.820 align:middle line:84%
visited by some form of
extraterrestrial life.

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Of course you're still going
to have skeptics out there.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Even if a ship was to land
right in front of them

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:19.674 align:middle line:84%
and beings get out,
they're going to--

00:15:19.674 --> 00:15:20.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a drone.

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: It's a drone
or I'm not seeing this.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.160 align:middle line:90%
It's not real.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.950 align:middle line:84%
You're always going to
have skeptics I think.

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:29.950 align:middle line:84%
But I've been
fortunate, like I say,

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:33.870 align:middle line:84%
to have met people who
do believe it and have

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:34.890 align:middle line:90%
seen things themselves.

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your
specific work, is there

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:40.517 align:middle line:84%
one case that
stands out for you?

00:15:40.517 --> 00:15:41.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Yes.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Well actually, there's a
lot of cases that stand out.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:49.020 align:middle line:84%
If we talk about the book,
there is an actual scientist

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:52.480 align:middle line:84%
within the book who
had visitations himself

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.080 align:middle line:90%
who also had--

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:53.913 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That helps.

00:15:53.913 --> 00:15:56.950 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Yes, and who
also had an implant

00:15:56.950 --> 00:16:01.640 align:middle line:84%
in the second great
toe of the left foot,

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.290 align:middle line:84%
and actually had
visitations since he

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:08.580 align:middle line:84%
was four and a half years old,
seeing the beings in his room

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.930 align:middle line:84%
as he's sitting
there in his crib.

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And this kind of
thing with abductions

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.640 align:middle line:84%
is usually from the
cradle to the grave.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's a lifelong
thing with interaction.

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once it happens,
you don't get out.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.616 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Exactly.

00:16:21.616 --> 00:16:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's like the mob.

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Exactly.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:28.310 align:middle line:84%
So he's had
experiences growing up.

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:31.420 align:middle line:84%
He told me that his mother
shared some very interesting

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:34.300 align:middle line:84%
information with
him as a teenager

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.540 align:middle line:90%
that he was, in fact, a twin.

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And that during the
mother's pregnancy,

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.439 align:middle line:84%
the doctor did hear
two heartbeats.

00:16:41.439 --> 00:16:42.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh that's interesting.

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: She was
carrying twins.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.630 align:middle line:84%
But between four
and five months,

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:51.180 align:middle line:84%
the other twin
suddenly disappeared.

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.140 align:middle line:90%
There's only then one heartbeat.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:56.150 align:middle line:84%
So he claims that
his mother also

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:58.070 align:middle line:84%
had interaction
with these beings

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:00.280 align:middle line:90%
and that the twin was taken.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Since John has grown
older, he's got married.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:08.530 align:middle line:84%
His wife also has had
interaction with these beings

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:09.890 align:middle line:90%
on board the craft.

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:13.349 align:middle line:84%
And the children are also
involved with this too.

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And in fact his younger
daughter said "Daddy, I'm

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.460 align:middle line:84%
afraid of the trash
truck when it comes."

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Well why are you
afraid of the trash truck?"

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:26.430 align:middle line:84%
She said, "Well it
reminds me of the UFO

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:29.860 align:middle line:84%
that takes me up into the
sky with these gray people."

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And she was three at the
time, three, four at the time.

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Way too young to
have a vivid imagination.

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:37.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: I think so.

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Way too young.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:38.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: I think so.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dr. David
Jacobs believes

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:47.110 align:middle line:84%
that whatever's happening
is not a good thing.

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:48.660 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:54.350 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Oh George, that's
a tough question to answer.

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:58.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I'm tending
to believe his theory

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:01.050 align:middle line:84%
as I go more into
this, that there's

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:03.050 align:middle line:90%
something else going on.

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:05.060 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: You know,
I can understand

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.990 align:middle line:84%
if the whole thing
of the abduction

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:11.340 align:middle line:84%
and what they're
trying to do here--

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:16.172 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to
create a hybrid race.

00:18:16.172 --> 00:18:16.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But why?

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: But why.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And that is a million
dollar question.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:23.650 align:middle line:84%
But on Earth, we
have scientists here

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:25.500 align:middle line:90%
that are doing similar things.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.900 align:middle line:84%
Our technology is
increasing tenfold.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:28.930 align:middle line:90%
We are cloning.

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:30.670 align:middle line:90%
We have the ability to clone.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.290 align:middle line:84%
So we can't really
fault them for that

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:33.670 align:middle line:90%
because they're advancing.

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:34.790 align:middle line:90%
They are very advanced.

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:35.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they need
us for some reason.

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:37.435 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: They need
us for some reason.

00:18:37.435 --> 00:18:39.920 align:middle line:84%
But it's the way they're
going about doing it.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.560 align:middle line:84%
They don't ask for
our permission.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:43.140 align:middle line:90%
They don't.

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:43.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They just do it.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.211 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: They just
do it regardless.

00:18:45.211 --> 00:18:49.250 align:middle line:84%
They have a mission, and they're
going to fulfill this mission.

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:52.770 align:middle line:84%
So I do agree with Dr.
Jacobs-- who I highly

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:56.960 align:middle line:84%
respect-- in his books "The
Secret Life" and "The Threat"

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:00.770 align:middle line:84%
that the intentions seem to be
that they are eventually going

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:04.896 align:middle line:90%
to seed hybrids here on Earth.

00:19:04.896 --> 00:19:06.020 align:middle line:90%
And that's a scary thought.

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:07.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's the mission.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:11.439 align:middle line:84%
Get rid of us, replace
us with the hybrids.

00:19:11.439 --> 00:19:12.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Maybe so.

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.780 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that is the agenda.

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They might
have millions of them

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:19.220 align:middle line:84%
somewhere just
ready to march in.

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Right.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we're going to die
out too quickly, but, you know.

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:24.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's hope not.

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:30.410 align:middle line:84%
One of your other works of
course, "Haunted Las Vegas."

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:32.710 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to Haunted Las Vegas.

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:35.960 align:middle line:84%
Look, we've all
been to Las Vegas.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.630 align:middle line:84%
There are some nights you
think it's haunted, to be sure.

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:39.900 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about this.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Well for this
particular book George, what

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.800 align:middle line:84%
I did, I teamed up with
a really great team

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:49.090 align:middle line:84%
of paranormal
investigators, called

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:53.060 align:middle line:84%
LVSSI, Las Vegas Society of
Supernatural Investigation.

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:53.957 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I like that.

00:19:53.957 --> 00:19:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Yes.

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.640 align:middle line:10%
And what they do, they
go into people's homes

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:02.800 align:middle line:10%
and they rid them, the
homes, of ghost activity.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.670 align:middle line:84%
So I met these
incredible people.

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.530 align:middle line:90%
It's a team of four people.

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And they do, in fact-- they
are real life Ghostbusters.

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:11.820 align:middle line:90%
They go into the properties.

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:13.160 align:middle line:90%
They get rid of the ghosts.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.510 align:middle line:90%
So sat down with them.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:17.710 align:middle line:84%
They give me 20 somethings
scenarios, cases

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:19.060 align:middle line:90%
that they had worked on.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And for that particular book I
choose the best that I could.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:27.110 align:middle line:84%
So there's 18 chapters in there
of hauntings in the Silver

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:28.500 align:middle line:90%
State.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:32.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When Michael
Keaton's movie came out,

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.770 align:middle line:84%
"White Noise," you had an
opportunity to talk with him,

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:36.270 align:middle line:90%
didn't you?

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:37.062 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: I did it.

00:20:37.062 --> 00:20:38.478 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think of him?

00:20:38.478 --> 00:20:39.420 align:middle line:90%
Great guy, huh?

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:40.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Great guy.

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And I made a point of
telling him, by the way,

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.380 align:middle line:90%
he was the best Batman ever.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:45.790 align:middle line:90%
I think he made the best Batman.

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He enjoyed that, huh?

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Yes, he did.

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:47.813 align:middle line:90%
He liked that.

00:20:47.813 --> 00:20:50.490 align:middle line:90%


00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:55.590 align:middle line:84%
But I asked him, because he
grew up in a haunted property.

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "My
sister is really

00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.460 align:middle line:90%
into this subject big time.

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And she's a really
big believer of this."

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well
what about you?

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.030 align:middle line:84%
What does Michael Keaton
think about all of this?"

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "You
know, I'm on the fence.

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:09.310 align:middle line:90%
I neither belief.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.900 align:middle line:90%
I neither disbelief.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:15.840 align:middle line:84%
But I did witness some
things in the property."

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.150 align:middle line:90%
So we left it at that.

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:19.810 align:middle line:84%
He didn't really
answer any further.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:21.050 align:middle line:90%
But he's on the fence.

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know,
it's interesting,

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:27.770 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of us don't think
that these stars and people

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:30.920 align:middle line:84%
like that ever think about
some of the same things

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.210 align:middle line:90%
we think about all the time.

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:33.490 align:middle line:90%
But they do, quite often.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:34.430 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: They do.

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:37.760 align:middle line:84%
They have everyday
experiences like we did.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And it was a great moment to
speak with him about this.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And also the producer of "White
Noise" was there on set too.

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:46.300 align:middle line:84%
So it was great
to talk with him.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.250 align:middle line:84%
Who, incidentally, had
had a UFO sighting.

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And so he spoke
to me about that.

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With Las
Vegas, I mean, is it

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:58.620 align:middle line:84%
any more particularly
haunted or paranormalish

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:01.740 align:middle line:84%
than other regions
of this planet?

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:05.160 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: I don't
think so George.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.860 align:middle line:84%
It's just that I think we
do have some history here

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:11.920 align:middle line:84%
on the land of where
homes are built.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Some people are under
the misconception

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:17.440 align:middle line:90%
that only old homes are haunted.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.630 align:middle line:90%
And in fact, they're not.

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:20.810 align:middle line:90%
New homes are too.

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:22.905 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If they're built
on some kind of ground.

00:22:22.905 --> 00:22:24.946 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: If they're built
on some kind of ground

00:22:24.946 --> 00:22:28.530 align:middle line:84%
that's got some activity
or had something there.

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a couple
more questions here for Tracie.

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:31.664 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:22:31.664 --> 00:22:32.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hi Tracie.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:33.420 align:middle line:90%
My name is Michael.

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to know
if you've ever recorded

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:37.650 align:middle line:90%
and EVP yourself?

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:41.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of course EVPs,
electromagnetic voice

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:42.696 align:middle line:90%
phenomena.

00:22:42.696 --> 00:22:43.320 align:middle line:90%
How about that?

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever
stumbled across that?

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: You know,
I have personally

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:51.300 align:middle line:84%
heard EVPs that other
people have captured.

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.320 align:middle line:84%
I tried myself one time
when my grandfather

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:57.385 align:middle line:84%
passed away, but only
got a very strange noise.

00:22:57.385 --> 00:22:59.510 align:middle line:84%
I didn't actually hear the
voice of my grandfather.

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Really difficult
to hear them sometimes.

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:02.151 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: They are.

00:23:02.151 --> 00:23:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got some experts
who provide us EVP sounds,

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:08.420 align:middle line:84%
and they try to play
them on the radio.

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:11.479 align:middle line:84%
You'll hear something
like [STATIC],

00:23:11.479 --> 00:23:13.020 align:middle line:84%
but you don't really
know what it is.

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Now they tell you what it is
so you listen again for it,

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.014 align:middle line:90%
but it's really tough sometimes.

00:23:18.014 --> 00:23:18.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: It is.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:22.090 align:middle line:84%
Some come through very clearly,
that there's no mistaking what

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:23.000 align:middle line:90%
they're saying.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.724 align:middle line:84%
And some it's a
little more difficult.

00:23:24.724 --> 00:23:26.890 align:middle line:84%
What you've got to do, if
someone out there is going

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:29.530 align:middle line:84%
to try an EVP, you've
got to try and do it

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:32.510 align:middle line:84%
on the same day
at the same time,

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:35.420 align:middle line:84%
get in the habit of doing
that, and just letting it play,

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:38.329 align:middle line:84%
and then letting it play
right through to the end,

00:23:38.329 --> 00:23:40.870 align:middle line:84%
and then playing it back to see
if you've captured something.

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:42.453 align:middle line:84%
But I think that's
the important thing

00:23:42.453 --> 00:23:45.320 align:middle line:84%
to remember, to try to do it on
the same day at the same time.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, let's
take one more question.

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:50.160 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Hi Tracie,
my name is John.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to know what it's
like when a human beings dies

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:55.987 align:middle line:84%
and passes into
the spirit world.

00:23:55.987 --> 00:23:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now that's a little
different question for you,

00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.156 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:23:59.156 --> 00:24:02.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: It is actually George.

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:03.960 align:middle line:90%
I don't really know.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:09.270 align:middle line:84%
But based on conversations I've
had with spiritualist medium

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:13.170 align:middle line:84%
friends of mine, they claim
that when you pass over,

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:16.030 align:middle line:84%
you are greeted
by your relatives,

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:17.830 align:middle line:84%
that they are
there to greet you.

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And apparently the
person that's died

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:23.160 align:middle line:84%
does actually show up
to their own funeral.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.910 align:middle line:84%
People have seen the
deceased person standing

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:28.519 align:middle line:84%
by their own coffin when
they have passed away.

00:24:28.519 --> 00:24:29.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Precisely.

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Exactly.

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:34.520 align:middle line:84%
I like the way James
Van Praagh puts it

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.920 align:middle line:84%
as an example for the
transition of human

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:42.610 align:middle line:84%
into spirit, very similar
to that of an ice cube.

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:44.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, the ice
cube is solid, just

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.470 align:middle line:90%
like we are as human beings.

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:50.560 align:middle line:84%
When that ice cube
melts, it becomes fluid.

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.110 align:middle line:90%
It becomes the source.

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:56.140 align:middle line:84%
The same source is there, what
it once was, which was water.

00:24:56.140 --> 00:25:00.010 align:middle line:84%
So for us passing over into
the spirit world, we lose this.

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:02.660 align:middle line:84%
We lose the physical
form, obviously.

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:06.020 align:middle line:84%
So we can be
anywhere at any time.

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's that
sometimes that devices

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:12.760 align:middle line:84%
such as the electromagnetic
devices that pickup

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:16.210 align:middle line:84%
spirit, if they haven't moved on
into the spirit world and they

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:18.620 align:middle line:84%
linger on the earthly
plane for whatever reason,

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.010 align:middle line:84%
it's those devices that
are picking those up.

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:23.430 align:middle line:84%
But I really do like
the way James Van Praagh

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:25.252 align:middle line:90%
puts that with that ice cube.

00:25:25.252 --> 00:25:27.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got a
friend Mary Ann Winkoswki.

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:29.790 align:middle line:84%
She lives in the Midwest,
and she's a medium.

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:31.960 align:middle line:90%
And she sees dead people.

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And when she was a little girl,
she used to see dead people.

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:39.920 align:middle line:84%
They would invite her as
a little girl to funerals

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:43.100 align:middle line:84%
so she could tell the
living about the dead.

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:44.680 align:middle line:84%
Because she always
said, just like

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:48.210 align:middle line:84%
you just pointed out, that
the dead would always be

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:50.900 align:middle line:90%
hanging around their funeral.

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure I want
to hang around.

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:57.590 align:middle line:84%
That's probably one event I
don't want to be attending.

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Right.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.260 align:middle line:90%
We're all going to die.

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:01.310 align:middle line:90%
Nobody wants to.

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:05.290 align:middle line:84%
But we hear great things,
that it's really not

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:06.380 align:middle line:90%
as bad as you think.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.890 align:middle line:84%
It's an easy process to
make this transition.

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And really on the other side
is a really great place,

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.850 align:middle line:84%
and that people
don't fear death.

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:17.020 align:middle line:90%
But hmm.

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:19.069 align:middle line:90%
I would hope I'm immortal.

00:26:19.069 --> 00:26:19.985 align:middle line:90%
But obviously I'm not.

00:26:19.985 --> 00:26:21.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You never know.

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.141 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: You never know.

00:26:22.141 --> 00:26:23.849 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You hosted
a paranormal show.

00:26:23.849 --> 00:26:24.640 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.306 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: I did.

00:26:25.306 --> 00:26:27.810 align:middle line:84%
It was called "Let's
Talk Paranormal."

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And we did that
show in California.

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:33.830 align:middle line:90%
And we coproduced it in Arizona.

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:36.600 align:middle line:84%
It was seen in 486,000
homes in Arizona.

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:37.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's great.

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Yeah, and
also in New York.

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And we did that show
for about five years.

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.665 align:middle line:90%
And we covered--

00:26:44.665 --> 00:26:44.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a good run.

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:46.033 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: It's a good run.

00:26:46.033 --> 00:26:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And we covered every subject,
A to Z of the strange but true.

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:52.760 align:middle line:84%
We won three awards for it,
three Telly Awards for it,

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.730 align:middle line:90%
which we're very honored.

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to revive
the show in some way,

00:26:58.890 --> 00:26:59.990 align:middle line:90%
shape, or form right now.

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well I
hope you revive it.

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:01.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Thank you.

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That would
be fun for you.

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:04.273 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Thank you, absolutely.

00:27:04.273 --> 00:27:06.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As you look
at this entire field,

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.240 align:middle line:84%
this paranormal
field in the book

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.980 align:middle line:84%
about "Welcome to Haunted
Las Vegas," about some

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:16.570 align:middle line:84%
of the cases, what stands
out for you in terms of what

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:18.480 align:middle line:90%
you think is really happening.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.480 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:24.690 align:middle line:84%
We have all these episodes
of deathly encounters, UFO

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:27.730 align:middle line:90%
visitations, Bigfoot sightings.

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:29.204 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:27:29.204 --> 00:27:32.040 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Well I think
it's always gone on George.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:35.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
anything new, to be honest.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:39.610 align:middle line:84%
I think that people are
becoming more aware of it

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:42.070 align:middle line:90%
and are becoming less skeptical.

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:46.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean I can't say why
it's becoming more intense.

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, to
be honest with you.

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:49.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it?

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: It is becoming
more intense, yes.

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:54.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.030 align:middle line:90%
But again, it's nothing new.

00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:59.490 align:middle line:90%
This is always, always happened.

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:02.470 align:middle line:84%
People have always
experienced things.

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:06.650 align:middle line:90%
So a question I can't answer.

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:07.370 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:09.078 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you come
across cases where

00:28:09.078 --> 00:28:12.250 align:middle line:90%
people are scared to death?

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:13.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Oh sure, of course.

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:16.370 align:middle line:84%
They have no idea
what's going on.

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:18.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm speaking with a
young lady right now

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.612 align:middle line:84%
who's having some
interaction in her home.

00:28:20.612 --> 00:28:22.320 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't know
whether it's paranormal.

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.050 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't know whether
it's extraterrestrial.

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:26.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or in our head.

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: It's definitely
not in her head,

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:31.540 align:middle line:84%
and I'll tell you why-- because
she took a photograph just

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:32.680 align:middle line:90%
a few days ago.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And she was told to
take the photograph.

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And she aimed it
to her back garden.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And then behind a
bush is a face of,

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:46.610 align:middle line:84%
I think-- I think it's ET
related to be perfectly honest.

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:47.320 align:middle line:90%
She doesn't know.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:48.778 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Does it
look like a gray?

00:28:48.778 --> 00:28:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: To me it
looks like a gray.

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:53.470 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to
have the guys, LVSSI,

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:57.950 align:middle line:84%
going to meet with her and
checking out the property.

00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:00.070 align:middle line:84%
But she's definitely
got something going on.

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:02.100 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like her
house is trying

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:04.420 align:middle line:84%
to be broken into when
she hears these noises,

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:05.960 align:middle line:90%
but no one's trying to break in.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:09.784 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you been scared
on an investigation, ever?

00:29:09.784 --> 00:29:11.450 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: No George,
I can't say I have.

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You haven't?

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:12.551 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: No.

00:29:12.551 --> 00:29:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How about the
guys from the group?

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: There's been
occasions where they have, yes.

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And Tina, the lead
investigator, her husband

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:24.690 align:middle line:90%
is the group skeptic.

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:27.760 align:middle line:84%
He always likes
to find a way of--

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The real reason, quote.

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:30.561 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: The real reason, yes.

00:29:30.561 --> 00:29:32.690 align:middle line:84%
He tries to find ways
that of pooh poohing this

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:36.675 align:middle line:84%
and oh, it's because of this,
or it's because of that.

00:29:36.675 --> 00:29:37.759 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is healthy.

00:29:37.759 --> 00:29:38.383 align:middle line:90%
That's healthy.

00:29:38.383 --> 00:29:40.490 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Of course, it's
healthy being skeptical,

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:41.400 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:46.170 align:middle line:84%
But all roads lead back
to what this is all about.

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:50.150 align:middle line:90%
And it's ghostly interaction.

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had
categorize the UFO

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:57.270 align:middle line:84%
encounters and the
ghostly encounters, would

00:29:57.270 --> 00:30:01.520 align:middle line:84%
you say that they're related
or they're totally separate?

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.840 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: That's
a good question.

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:06.420 align:middle line:84%
I have spoken to
people where they

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:11.384 align:middle line:84%
have had ghostly encounters
followed by UFO interaction.

00:30:11.384 --> 00:30:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Me too.

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:12.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Yeah.

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:19.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's leading to that answer
of yes, I believe it is.

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:22.730 align:middle line:84%
I would like more
of a solid answer

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:24.830 align:middle line:90%
to that to connect the two.

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:27.390 align:middle line:90%
But I don't have it as yet.

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:30.760 align:middle line:84%
Whether it will happen
with other investigations

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:33.010 align:middle line:84%
down the road,
hopefully so, that we'll

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:34.910 align:middle line:90%
have more of a solid answer.

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:37.060 align:middle line:84%
But it's pointing
in that direction.

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What keeps
driving you Trace?

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Oh George,
I'm an enthusiast,

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:43.890 align:middle line:90%
and I love this subject.

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And from having my own
experiences, both UFOs

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:52.890 align:middle line:84%
and ghostly, I want to
get to the bottom of it.

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:54.600 align:middle line:90%
I want an answer.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.220 align:middle line:90%
I want to find out why.

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if I'll
ever get that answer,

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:02.820 align:middle line:90%
but I keep being driven forward.

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:05.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, I trained, like I
said, as a concert pianist.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.072 align:middle line:84%
And when I had my very
first UFO sighting,

00:31:08.072 --> 00:31:09.530 align:middle line:84%
it's like it said
to me, you're not

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:11.650 align:middle line:84%
going to go down
this path that you

00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:13.100 align:middle line:90%
think you're going to go down.

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:14.891 align:middle line:84%
You're going to go down
this one and you're

00:31:14.891 --> 00:31:17.340 align:middle line:84%
going to find out
what we are all about.

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And so my life has
really taken that shift.

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:23.690 align:middle line:84%
It's taken me on
a different path.

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If ETs
came down and said,

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:30.550 align:middle line:84%
we would like to
show you our planet.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And maybe 500 years
would go by before they

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:37.380 align:middle line:84%
were able to get you
back, Earth time.

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:38.542 align:middle line:90%
Would you go?

00:31:38.542 --> 00:31:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: I'd say sign me up.

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:40.666 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You would go?

00:31:40.666 --> 00:31:42.080 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Yes, I'd go.

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.470 align:middle line:90%
But I'd need my mother with me.

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You'd come
back, it would be 2515.

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:48.020 align:middle line:90%
You would do that?

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:48.900 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: I'd do it.

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.170 align:middle line:84%
I'd do it as long as I can
have my mother with me,

00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:56.450 align:middle line:84%
my father, my sister, my
cats, my boyfriend, whoever

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:58.070 align:middle line:90%
I love in my life.

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Please let us all go
together, and then we

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:02.485 align:middle line:90%
will have a great journey.

00:32:02.485 --> 00:32:05.904 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if you only
could go by yourself?

00:32:05.904 --> 00:32:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: I might put a
restricted time frame on it,

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:10.210 align:middle line:90%
but yes.

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:11.899 align:middle line:90%
Yes I think I would.

00:32:11.899 --> 00:32:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I have
a difficult even

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:17.640 align:middle line:84%
deciding if I would go to Mars
for three years and come back.

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:21.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, by that time, your
children are three years older.

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:23.400 align:middle line:84%
Your grandchildren
are three years older.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.742 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure I want to
go through with that.

00:32:25.742 --> 00:32:27.450 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Well, if
we're talking in terms

00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:36.560 align:middle line:84%
of going to Mars as an astronaut
would go to visit Mars,

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:39.000 align:middle line:90%
then probably not.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.900 align:middle line:84%
I think it's kind of a
one way trip, really.

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is a one way trip.

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: So ETs are advanced.

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:49.000 align:middle line:84%
They're advanced
technologically.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.085 align:middle line:84%
I don't think really
there would be an issue.

00:32:51.085 --> 00:32:54.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At this point somebody
watching this program, Tracie,

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:57.790 align:middle line:84%
what advice would you give them
if they think that they have

00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:02.130 align:middle line:84%
been implanted or
part of an abduction

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:05.610 align:middle line:84%
or that something very strange
is happening in their life?

00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And of course I think you
always have to rule out

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:10.600 align:middle line:90%
any psychological problem.

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:13.070 align:middle line:84%
That's always that
possibility too.

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:14.900 align:middle line:90%
But what would you do?

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:18.900 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: I would say to
them, please try and contact

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:20.450 align:middle line:90%
your local Mufon.

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:22.920 align:middle line:90%
Mufons are all over the globe.

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
Mutual UFO Network.

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And try to speak with
somebody locally too.

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
sympathetic, aren't they?

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: They very sympathetic.

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And they're great
investigators and researchers.

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:33.300 align:middle line:90%
I love Mufon.

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And they're there to assist
and they're there to help.

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:39.310 align:middle line:84%
So that's the best
advice I could give

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:42.570 align:middle line:90%
right now in terms of that.

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you come across
a case where you think someone

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:50.630 align:middle line:90%
seriously has a mental issue?

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:51.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: No.

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:51.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You haven't?

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: No.

00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:53.130 align:middle line:90%
Straightforwardly no.

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:55.296 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, I've had
some calls on the program,

00:33:55.296 --> 00:33:58.460 align:middle line:84%
the radio show,
that I've questioned

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:02.380 align:middle line:84%
some of these people who have
called in because they just

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:06.880 align:middle line:84%
seemed to ramble on and on
about people watching them

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:10.600 align:middle line:84%
and things happening
and they're being spied.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I think
they're paranoid.

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a part of
me that says, wait a minute.

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:19.550 align:middle line:84%
What if it's actually
happening to them?

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:21.889 align:middle line:84%
What if these things
are happening?

00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:24.690 align:middle line:84%
They're being
abducted every night

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:28.010 align:middle line:84%
and they have no
control over this.

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:30.000 align:middle line:84%
So it does make you stop
and think, doesn't it?

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:30.833 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Of course.

00:34:30.833 --> 00:34:34.139 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying that there
aren't people out there who

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:35.889 align:middle line:84%
are somewhat
delusional, or they're

00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:40.620 align:middle line:84%
thinking this subject
is-- they're making up

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:41.900 align:middle line:90%
the subject in their mind.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:43.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying there aren't.

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:46.949 align:middle line:84%
But for who I have
spoken to personally, no.

00:34:46.949 --> 00:34:50.639 align:middle line:84%
They've all been
sane, credible people,

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:52.909 align:middle line:90%
and from all walks of life.

00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This universe is vast.

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:55.949 align:middle line:90%
It's 14 billion years old.

00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:58.670 align:middle line:90%
We're 4.5 billion years old.

00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:04.050 align:middle line:84%
That means someone, somewhere
has a major head start on us

00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:06.060 align:middle line:90%
in terms of existence.

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And if they have, let's say, a
million years ahead of us, just

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:13.370 align:middle line:84%
based on our technological
growth over 100 years,

00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:15.450 align:middle line:84%
if they're a million
years ahead of us,

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:18.460 align:middle line:84%
and assuming that
progression continues,

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:22.290 align:middle line:84%
god knows what kind of
technology they would have.

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:26.220 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: It's scary
to think, actually

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:31.160 align:middle line:84%
isn't it, of what kind of
technology they have got.

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:36.060 align:middle line:84%
They're so far advanced
of our own planet here.

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:38.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, from the
UFOs I've seen, you

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:42.570 align:middle line:84%
know, just the shapes and
the fact that totally silent.

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:43.900 align:middle line:90%
They're not ours.

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Who knows how
further down the road

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:51.220 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be more
technologically advanced.

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They've learned
how to bend space and time.

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:54.740 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Yes, they have.

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:57.031 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they've done it
quite effectively I think.

00:35:57.031 --> 00:35:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: And I think Michio
Kaku is a great scientist who

00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:06.430 align:middle line:84%
talks about this and the force
of it, rather than against,

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:09.980 align:middle line:84%
and scientifically
explains it that everything

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:13.100 align:middle line:84%
that we're seeing
right now on Star Trek,

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:16.620 align:middle line:84%
for example, we're
finding this to be real.

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:18.000 align:middle line:90%
We're finding black holes.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.590 align:middle line:84%
We're finding we can
bend space and time.

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:24.320 align:middle line:84%
So these beings, whoever
they are, they're doing it.

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And apparently one of these
races, the gray beings,

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:32.587 align:middle line:84%
are only 39 light years away,
which Stanton Friedman says,

00:36:32.587 --> 00:36:33.670 align:middle line:90%
it's just down the street.

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
nothing, that's right--

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:34.710 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Down the street.

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:36.376 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --especially
if they've learned

00:36:36.376 --> 00:36:37.690 align:middle line:90%
how to bend space and time.

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:40.840 align:middle line:84%
What do you think we can expect
in the next five or 10 years

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:43.920 align:middle line:90%
in this field of ufology?

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:44.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Oh, wow.

00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:48.100 align:middle line:84%
I think more and more
sightings are going to happen.

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:49.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm convinced of that.

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
they're going to stop.

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:55.555 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the abductions
are going to stop either.

00:36:55.555 --> 00:36:57.270 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they may slow
down a little bit

00:36:57.270 --> 00:37:01.590 align:middle line:84%
depending on where these
beings have with their agenda,

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:04.110 align:middle line:84%
where they're at
with their agenda.

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:07.620 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think that's
going to stop anytime soon,

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't think.

00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:11.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We seem to have
gone through an evolution

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:16.080 align:middle line:84%
of counters where back
in the '50s and '60s,

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:19.930 align:middle line:84%
there seemed to have been a more
direct, I could see occupants

00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:23.520 align:middle line:84%
coming out of crafts, and those
kinds of sightings-- landing

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:28.220 align:middle line:84%
pads, pots, holes,
burned out areas.

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.100 align:middle line:84%
We don't seem to be
getting that anymore.

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:32.130 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Again,
that's a good question.

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:36.180 align:middle line:84%
I think maybe
they're just deciding

00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:39.030 align:middle line:90%
that they need to not be here.

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:40.750 align:middle line:90%
They don't need to land.

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:43.687 align:middle line:84%
They're doing things
remotely from the craft.

00:37:43.687 --> 00:37:45.020 align:middle line:90%
They're interacting with beings.

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:48.890 align:middle line:84%
They're either taking us up
and talking to us that way

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:50.320 align:middle line:90%
rather than physically landing.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.560 align:middle line:90%
But who knows?

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.830 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a landing
will happen tomorrow

00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:55.217 align:middle line:90%
and we'll hear about it.

00:37:55.217 --> 00:37:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think there's
a huge mothership up there

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:58.890 align:middle line:90%
somewhere?

00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: I think there's many
huge motherships up there,

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:03.390 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:06.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm convinced because
of seeing the footage

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:09.860 align:middle line:84%
around the space station,
things that we see up there.

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Apparently just a
few days ago there

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:14.180 align:middle line:84%
was something in the media
regarding a huge megastructure

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:16.080 align:middle line:90%
that's circling the sun.

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Had a chance to
talk to a shuttle astronaut.

00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And I asked them about STS-48,
that incredible video that

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:27.520 align:middle line:84%
shows some objects coming
through, and then all

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:30.320 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden a
missile taking off.

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And folks you can grab
that and look at that.

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:34.450 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a little
look at it too.

00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:36.300 align:middle line:10%
I think we've got
some video on that.

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:38.530 align:middle line:10%
And that's an amazing
piece of video.

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:40.790 align:middle line:10%
You can see-- you can
see something is being

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:43.250 align:middle line:10%
shot at an objects flying by.

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:45.900 align:middle line:10%
I asked him about that,
and he said "No, I

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:47.590 align:middle line:10%
don't know anything about it."

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And to me, if I were
a shuttle astronaut,

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:53.340 align:middle line:84%
I would want to look at
that piece of videotape.

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Right, exactly.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.480 align:middle line:10%
And since that STS-48
footage George,

00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.850 align:middle line:10%
I mean other footage
has come forward

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:04.330 align:middle line:10%
where you can see the Earth,
the part of the Earth here

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:08.570 align:middle line:10%
in the camera, and then two UFOs
coming in together and doing

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:09.830 align:middle line:10%
an immediate right angle turn.

00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:10.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And off they go off.

00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:11.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: And off they go.

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:12.231 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is amazing.

00:39:12.231 --> 00:39:14.760 align:middle line:84%
Trace, for people who want
to monitor what you do

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.647 align:middle line:84%
and how to find you,
where do they go?

00:39:16.647 --> 00:39:18.480 align:middle line:10%

directly to my website,

I know one thing for
sure, having gone to Vegas

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:42.640 align:middle line:10%
several times, sometimes
it is haunted--
