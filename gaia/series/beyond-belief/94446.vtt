00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.120 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.744 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:14.756 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:14.756 --> 00:00:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.680 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.420 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.959 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:28.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.541 align:middle line:10%
You know, in the
television business,

00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:32.810 align:middle line:10%
we always go by ratings
to determine, of course,

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.640 align:middle line:10%
how an audience is
perceiving a program.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And of course, in
commercial television,

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.920 align:middle line:90%
it's sponsor-oriented.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.920 align:middle line:84%
The higher the ratings, the
bigger the sponsorship becomes.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.530 align:middle line:84%
Well with our show, "Beyond
Belief," we're rated, too.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.010 align:middle line:84%
We're rated at what you like
to see and watch and hear.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And one of our highest
rated programs,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.570 align:middle line:84%
beyond a shadow of a doubt,
is with David Wilcock,

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.580 align:middle line:90%
who's with me now.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.220 align:middle line:90%
David, welcome.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID WILCOCK: Thank you.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.091 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Quite an introduction
to you, wasn't it?

00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Yeah, I think
my head has exploded.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have
a program starting

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.990 align:middle line:84%
on Gaiam Television soon
called "Disclosure."

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.040 align:middle line:90%
What's that all about?

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.830 align:middle line:10%
>>WILCOCK: We had so
many requests for people

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.780 align:middle line:10%
to be interviewed by me
that it broke off and became

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.390 align:middle line:10%
a second show.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:30.850 align:middle line:10%
And my goal was to try to create
a disclosure through Gaiam TV,

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.360 align:middle line:10%
to essentially get the truth
out and talk to people who

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.720 align:middle line:10%
are giving us the
inside scoop, and also

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.130 align:middle line:10%
share what I know from a variety
of insiders who would never

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.050 align:middle line:10%
come forward for interviews.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.080 align:middle line:84%
So we created a vast narrative
arc in which everything

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.390 align:middle line:84%
is part of a story, sort
of like the TV show "Lost,"

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.152 align:middle line:84%
except that it's actually
going to resolve at the end

00:01:54.152 --> 00:01:55.860 align:middle line:84%
and not just spiral
off into nothingness.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right,
leaving us wondering.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.830 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: So we
have this vast grid

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.660 align:middle line:84%
in which every piece
of content plugs

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.710 align:middle line:84%
in to an overall arc,
which is pretty cool.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.699 align:middle line:84%
So if you watch the show, by
the time it's all finished,

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:12.990 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to be evolving,
obviously, week by week.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: By the time
you see the whole thing,

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.670 align:middle line:84%
it is essentially a complete
disclosure of everything

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.520 align:middle line:84%
that I think people ought to
know that has been suppressed

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.770 align:middle line:90%
and hidden from us as truth.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it could
be UFOs, the cover up

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.824 align:middle line:84%
there, it could be
one world government.

00:02:29.824 --> 00:02:30.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Absolutely.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It could be all of
these various alternative--

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Ancient
civilizations.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --medicine,
health issues, you name it.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: We found a way
to weave it all together

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.932 align:middle line:84%
and create something
that makes sense.

00:02:41.932 --> 00:02:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And we're essentially going
to start ancient and work

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.740 align:middle line:90%
our way forward.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.180 align:middle line:90%
So it's very exciting.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.790 align:middle line:84%
I've already actually done
several of the interviews,

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.290 align:middle line:84%
and I'm very happy with
how it's turning out.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.985 align:middle line:84%
So here, with you I wanted to
focus on sort of a part two

00:03:01.985 --> 00:03:06.240 align:middle line:84%
to our previous episode since,
as you said, it was so popular.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And we've been talking
about the ascension concept.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.290 align:middle line:84%
So if you're interested
in me continuing,

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.791 align:middle line:84%
we can talk about
that, or maybe you

00:03:13.791 --> 00:03:15.956 align:middle line:84%
have something else you'd
like to discuss this time.

00:03:15.956 --> 00:03:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHTER] Would
I simply say no to you?

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.999 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: You could say no.

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:20.790 align:middle line:90%
You have the right.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:21.581 align:middle line:90%
You have free will.

00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: David and I, by
the way, go way, way back.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.230 align:middle line:84%
I stiffed him on lunch
once, and I've never

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.410 align:middle line:90%
heard the end of that.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Well, you actually
still haven't paid me back.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, I haven't

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: But we're apparently
going to go to a restaurant

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.920 align:middle line:90%
at some point in the future.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We actually
walked out on the check

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.920 align:middle line:84%
and you got stuck with
the bill, didn't you?

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: That is true.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.250 align:middle line:84%
I did eat the remaining
half of the sandwich

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.365 align:middle line:90%
that you did not eat.

00:03:44.365 --> 00:03:46.035 align:middle line:84%
So at least I got
some of my money back

00:03:46.035 --> 00:03:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You got
something out of it.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:47.720 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.850 align:middle line:84%
Well now, when we talk about
ascension, rainbow abilities,

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.110 align:middle line:90%
what does that mean?

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.730 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Ascension
is a concept

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.660 align:middle line:90%
that's easily misunderstood.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And in our previous
episode, we discussed

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.360 align:middle line:84%
that there are different
types of ascension.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.390 align:middle line:84%
So the concept of rainbow
body is quite daunting,

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.750 align:middle line:84%
because a rainbow body
ascension is literally

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.740 align:middle line:84%
finishing the entire
job of what you're here

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.932 align:middle line:84%
for in the universe in
all of your lifetimes.

00:04:18.932 --> 00:04:20.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And who
finishes that job?

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.600 align:middle line:90%
Do we do that?

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Most people probably
are not going to do this.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.210 align:middle line:84%
That type of ascension is
very, very exclusive and rare,

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.700 align:middle line:84%
and it requires,
essentially, a life

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.020 align:middle line:84%
that is completely dedicated
to one pointedness of mind,

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.250 align:middle line:84%
meditating on having every
thought be a loving thought.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could be
like the Jesus state?

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.360 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Yes.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:49.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's interesting is that
we have a lineage from Buddha

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.070 align:middle line:90%
that becomes Tibetan Buddhism.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And Buddha, of course,
also taught ascension

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.110 align:middle line:84%
and ascended at the end of his
life into a rainbow body state.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Then, there were
other reinforcements

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.650 align:middle line:90%
who came in later.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.030 align:middle line:84%
I have an eight part
miniseries on the rainbow body

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.270 align:middle line:84%
on my show, "Wisdom
Teachings," where

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.050 align:middle line:84%
I go through this, that
there was a guy who shows up

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.640 align:middle line:84%
around 790 AD moving
through India, then

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.740 align:middle line:84%
into Nepal and Bhutan and
eventually settling in Tibet.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And his name was
Padmasambhava, which

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.900 align:middle line:84%
means "the man who was
born of the lotus."

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.827 align:middle line:84%
And the lotus appears to be
a flying craft of some kind.

00:05:28.827 --> 00:05:30.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Isn't that interesting?

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.284 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: The legend says
he didn't have a mother.

00:05:32.284 --> 00:05:33.400 align:middle line:90%
He didn't have a father.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.530 align:middle line:84%
He shows up as an
adult out of this egg

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:37.690 align:middle line:90%
that comes out of the sky.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:38.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.340 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: OK.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.311 align:middle line:84%
And he leaves hand prints
and footprints in the rock.

00:05:43.311 --> 00:05:44.810 align:middle line:84%
He could just mush
into solid stone.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do we have that?

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.270 align:middle line:90%
That's stone?

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: We don't have
that technology now,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.710 align:middle line:90%
but there are plenty of other--

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, but I mean is
the stone around somewhere?

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Oh, there's
dozens of them.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you can
see a hand print there?

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Oh yeah, and it
took eight episodes for me

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.219 align:middle line:90%
to go through all of it.

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: So the key is
this temple where he first

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.090 align:middle line:84%
achieved the highest level of
this practice or at least close

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.310 align:middle line:90%
to the highest level.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And he walks out of the
temple and he mushes his hand

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.020 align:middle line:90%
into the stone.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.333 align:middle line:84%
But they're six fingers
on the hand print.

00:06:12.333 --> 00:06:12.992 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah.

00:06:12.992 --> 00:06:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: And
that's very bizarre.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Then, some of the footprints
from him, he's barefoot

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.630 align:middle line:84%
and his foot looks
totally different.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.304 align:middle line:84%
It's human like, but it
has distinct differences.

00:06:22.304 --> 00:06:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think he
was an extraterrestrial?

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Absolutely,
extraterrestrial human.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And another weird
thing about him

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.460 align:middle line:84%
is that when you see
sculptures of him,

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.620 align:middle line:84%
he's got this little
bitty mustache

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.160 align:middle line:84%
it looks like you
drew it with a pencil.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.109 align:middle line:84%
My guess is that his
extraterrestrial human species

00:06:39.109 --> 00:06:40.900 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have facial
hair at all and he just

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.674 align:middle line:84%
drew it in sort
of apologetically.

00:06:42.674 --> 00:06:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you ought
to try that buddy.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.715 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:06:44.715 --> 00:06:45.356 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I should.

00:06:45.356 --> 00:06:46.350 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: [LAUGHTER]

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
bringing that up, David.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: You know the point
is Padmasambhava gave Tibetans

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.560 align:middle line:84%
the modern practice
of dzogchen, which

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.140 align:middle line:84%
is their word for the formless
state of being that we all

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.130 align:middle line:90%
emerge from.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.435 align:middle line:84%
And Padmasambhava paved the
way for 25 of his own disciples

00:07:09.435 --> 00:07:11.920 align:middle line:84%
to also hit rainbow body
at the end of their lives

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.390 align:middle line:90%
just like he did.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.978 align:middle line:84%
The legends say-- and
we're talking now 800,

00:07:15.978 --> 00:07:21.790 align:middle line:84%
815 AD-- these guys are flying
around in the air like birds.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Not just Padmasambhava
but his disciples as well.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.700 align:middle line:84%
You're literally watching
people zipping around

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.320 align:middle line:84%
in the air in their
physical bodies.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There some
reports of people

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:36.654 align:middle line:84%
seeing human-like creatures
flying in the air.

00:07:36.654 --> 00:07:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Absolutely.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:38.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now, that's weird.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.050 align:middle line:90%
Might that be this?

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: It very
well could be.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:46.170 align:middle line:84%
We are all, as a
human race, going

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:50.450 align:middle line:84%
through a provocative
transitional process in which

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:56.640 align:middle line:84%
it appears that we are in a
losing war with a villain that

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:01.830 align:middle line:84%
is supernatural and beyond
any capability to be defeated.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And yet, this is
exactly what all

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.700 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient
prophetic traditions

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.200 align:middle line:84%
say was going to happen
to us at this time.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not just
Christianity saying

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.160 align:middle line:84%
that Lucifer was given
dominion over the earth

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.820 align:middle line:84%
and that the Beast
of Revelation would

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.350 align:middle line:84%
be formed into an
idol worshipped

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.290 align:middle line:84%
by all peoples of all
nations of all tongues.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:25.640 align:middle line:90%
That is not strictly Christian.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.890 align:middle line:90%
The Hindus talk about it.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They all talk about it.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: The
Iranians talk about it

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.646 align:middle line:84%
in Zoroastrian scriptures
like the Vivendidad.

00:08:31.646 --> 00:08:32.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Muslims.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: The Muslim
scriptures totally have it.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:36.780 align:middle line:90%
Native American prophecy has it.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.450 align:middle line:90%
Celtic prophecy has it.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere you go,
it's saying that there

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.650 align:middle line:84%
is going to be this mega
villain that shows up

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:46.860 align:middle line:84%
on Earth that seems
impossible to be defeated.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.650 align:middle line:84%
But depending on which
one you go through,

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:53.340 align:middle line:84%
the prophecies have some very
interesting things that happen.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.660 align:middle line:84%
For example, there
is a reincarnation

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:58.840 align:middle line:84%
in the Hindu tradition at
the end of the age, which

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:03.980 align:middle line:84%
is basically now or very
soon, of Kalki the Destroyer.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:04.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh boy.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Kalki the Destroyer
comes in and kicks ass,

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.530 align:middle line:84%
and specifically he goes
after the people who

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.870 align:middle line:90%
are part of this villain.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And he has these eight
magical abilities

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.520 align:middle line:84%
that are way beyond
what we can do.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.120 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, the
greatest superhero you

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.560 align:middle line:84%
could imagine in
any Hollywood film,

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.440 align:middle line:84%
he's got all their
magic powers and more.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And he's using that to defend
us against the bad guys.

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:31.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where is he now?

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:32.690 align:middle line:90%
We may need him.

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:34.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: It's
probably something

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:37.404 align:middle line:84%
that will happen
sooner than we think.

00:09:37.404 --> 00:09:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly
enough, when you

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.880 align:middle line:84%
look at what the prophetic
traditions are saying,

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:46.520 align:middle line:84%
it appears that it
is people like us who

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.830 align:middle line:84%
will go through the
evolutionary process

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:52.640 align:middle line:84%
and become those heroes who
start cleaning up the planet.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we close
to end times now, David?

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: This is end times
as far as I'm concerned

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think we're
right in it, right now?

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: If you look at
the 2012 prophecies, which

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:06.830 align:middle line:84%
of course I was a big
component of and proponent of,

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:12.240 align:middle line:84%
what we're seeing is a
transitional change that

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.410 align:middle line:84%
is very much
precisely determined

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:18.720 align:middle line:90%
by astrophysical cycles.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.070 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about
anything arbitrary here.

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.960 align:middle line:84%
All of the ancient
traditions-- essentially,

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.920 align:middle line:84%
every ancient
tradition on earth says

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.100 align:middle line:84%
that they were
contacted by gods.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Every ancient tradition
says the gods looked human.

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.430 align:middle line:84%
Every ancient tradition
says that we're

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.010 align:middle line:90%
going to go into a golden age.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And every ancient tradition
uses symbolism and metaphors

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:42.690 align:middle line:84%
and mythologies and
mathematical codes

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:46.360 align:middle line:84%
to indicate that this
golden age begins

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.766 align:middle line:84%
at the end of a
25,000 year cycle.

00:10:48.766 --> 00:10:51.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's the procession of
the equinoxes that you hear.

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:52.264 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They all say this?

00:10:52.264 --> 00:10:54.050 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: They all say this.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:57.310 align:middle line:10%
That was only determined by the
work of Giorgio de Stantillana

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:59.990 align:middle line:10%
and Hertha von Deschend.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.060 align:middle line:84%
They have a classic book
called "Hamlet's Mill,"

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.060 align:middle line:84%
and I first heard
about it 1995 when

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.980 align:middle line:84%
I read "Fingerprints of the
Gods" by Graham Hancock.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.240 align:middle line:10%
"Hamlet's Mill" is
a meta analysis.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.250 align:middle line:10%
It's the grand
unified conspiracy

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:14.600 align:middle line:10%
theory of ancient history.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And what they did is they
went through everything

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:20.660 align:middle line:84%
and found that every
single ancient culture that

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.310 align:middle line:84%
has written records
that survived,

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:25.260 align:middle line:84%
or oral teachings that
survived, they all

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.660 align:middle line:84%
have very cleverly
encoded metaphors

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.850 align:middle line:84%
about this wobble
in the Earth's axis,

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:35.300 align:middle line:84%
which mathematically causes
the stars in the night sky

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.940 align:middle line:84%
to shift in their position
during the equinox

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.530 align:middle line:90%
by one degree every 72 years.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:44.130 align:middle line:84%
You multiply 72 by 360 which
is the number of degrees

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:48.480 align:middle line:84%
in a circle, and you
get 25,920 years.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.230 align:middle line:84%
If you chop that
up into 12 units,

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:55.720 align:middle line:84%
you get 2160 years per unit, and
that's your age of the zodiac.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And we're moving into
the Age of Aquarius.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.430 align:middle line:84%
Now in my book, "Source
Field Investigations,"

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:02.420 align:middle line:84%
I got right into
the debate and got

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:06.520 align:middle line:84%
my hands dirty about when does
the Age of Aquarius start.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And it is true that
French astronomers

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:12.770 align:middle line:84%
calculated that
it began in 2011.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:15.650 align:middle line:10%
And when you look at the Mayan
calendar, the Mayan calendar

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:20.190 align:middle line:10%
end date of December 21, 2012,
probably you felt the same way.

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:22.250 align:middle line:10%
I was hoping for
bigger fireworks.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:25.237 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I thought we might have
had some kind of solar flare

00:12:25.237 --> 00:12:26.570 align:middle line:90%
or some kind of event like that.

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:27.480 align:middle line:10%
>>WILCOCK: I wanted
to see something.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.039 align:middle line:10%
I didn't want it to be
this deafening silence--

00:12:30.039 --> 00:12:30.580 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:35.500 align:middle line:10%
>>WILCOCK: --because I actually
did hinge a lot of my beliefs

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.945 align:middle line:10%
and my public
persona on the idea

00:12:37.945 --> 00:12:39.820 align:middle line:10%
that there would be some
profound transition.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if the
time period was wrong?

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: It's
entirely possible

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.510 align:middle line:90%
that that is what happened.

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:48.870 align:middle line:84%
But before we get
into that, I want

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:52.500 align:middle line:84%
to say look at what happens
in our society six months

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.080 align:middle line:90%
after the Mayan calendar ending.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.660 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, we've had the
Snowden documents come out.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.000 align:middle line:84%
NSA surveillance is
no longer something

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.790 align:middle line:84%
that's only talked about at
1:00 AM on the nation's largest

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:06.530 align:middle line:90%
nighttime talk radio program.

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.660 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's mainstream.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:13.200 align:middle line:84%
It's public knowledge that
they are listening to you.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.890 align:middle line:90%
Why are they listening to you?

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:16.980 align:middle line:84%
It's not to find
some guy hanging out

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:21.017 align:middle line:84%
in a cave in Afghanistan
polishing his box.

00:13:21.017 --> 00:13:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: His arrows.

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:23.495 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: [LAUGHTER]

00:13:23.495 --> 00:13:24.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:25.578 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Forget about that.

00:13:25.578 --> 00:13:29.170 align:middle line:84%
What they're interested
in is suppressing dissent

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.379 align:middle line:84%
because we're dealing with
the biblical villain here.

00:13:31.379 --> 00:13:33.669 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And knowing
where to go to suppress it.

00:13:33.669 --> 00:13:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: That's exactly right.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:39.670 align:middle line:84%
If you can identify the
threat before it manifests,

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:44.060 align:middle line:84%
then you have the ability
to secure a new world order.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And what's so interesting
is that both the good guys

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.130 align:middle line:84%
and the bad guys
understand that we're

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:52.860 align:middle line:84%
going to go through
an ascension process.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.690 align:middle line:84%
The bad guys--
and I'm not saying

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.770 align:middle line:84%
that everybody who's into
ancient mystery schools is bad.

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:01.070 align:middle line:84%
There are definitely people who
have been Freemasons, who've

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.810 align:middle line:84%
studied ancient mystery schools,
who are doing the right thing

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:04.470 align:middle line:90%
and helping us.

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right,
they're good people.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: I do believe
that, absolutely.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
part of disclosure.

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:09.569 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: There
are also people who

00:14:09.569 --> 00:14:14.380 align:middle line:84%
are sacrificing newborn babies
and who are doing pedophilia

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:17.270 align:middle line:84%
and who are creating mass
slaughter of innocent people

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:18.950 align:middle line:90%
on vast scales.

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:21.440 align:middle line:84%
The most evil things you
could possibly imagine

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.540 align:middle line:90%
are being done.

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:24.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's wrong with them?

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:27.792 align:middle line:84%
How can somebody
even conceive this?

00:14:27.792 --> 00:14:29.500 align:middle line:10%
>>WILCOCK: I would
say that the answer is

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:33.940 align:middle line:10%
to look at the profile and
the physiological evidence

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.870 align:middle line:10%
of what's called a psychopath.

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:38.830 align:middle line:84%
A psychopath is a person
whose frontal lobes do not

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:40.270 align:middle line:90%
function in the brain.

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:42.898 align:middle line:84%
The brain does not show
electrical activity up here.

00:14:42.898 --> 00:14:43.606 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing.

00:14:43.606 --> 00:14:44.750 align:middle line:90%
It's like it's dead.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:46.208 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: That's
right, and that's

00:14:46.208 --> 00:14:49.430 align:middle line:84%
the area where you have feelings
and compassion and remorse

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:52.010 align:middle line:90%
and you're willing to apologize.

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.430 align:middle line:10%
A psychopath or a sociopath--
and the terms are sort

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:54.760 align:middle line:10%
of interchangeable--

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:55.890 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Are the narcissistic?

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:57.473 align:middle line:10%
>>WILCOCK: They're
highly narcissistic

00:14:57.473 --> 00:14:59.244 align:middle line:10%
and they will not apologize.

00:14:59.244 --> 00:15:00.160 align:middle line:10%
One of the best test--

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.830 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Because they don't
think they did anything wrong.

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:03.130 align:middle line:10%
>>WILCOCK: That's right.

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:06.420 align:middle line:84%
If you look at serial
killers on death row,

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.877 align:middle line:84%
they invariably say I
didn't do anything wrong.

00:15:09.877 --> 00:15:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And even if you ask
them, well, didn't

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:12.543 align:middle line:90%
you kill all those people.

00:15:12.543 --> 00:15:13.455 align:middle line:90%
They said yes.

00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:13.955 align:middle line:90%
Typically--

00:15:13.955 --> 00:15:15.121 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They had it coming.

00:15:15.121 --> 00:15:18.210 align:middle line:10%
>>WILCOCK: --the killer has some
sort of storyline, similar to--

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:20.360 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: He has a reason
why he did what he did.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:20.580 align:middle line:10%
>>WILCOCK: Yeah.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:22.860 align:middle line:10%
You look at the Friday the
13th movies with Jason,

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.260 align:middle line:10%
the guy with the hockey mask,
and he's killing people.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.130 align:middle line:10%
[BREATHY SOUND EFFECTS] Right.

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:31.420 align:middle line:10%
Invariably, his
victims are people

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:35.700 align:middle line:10%
who are violating a traditional
Christian idea of morality.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:39.650 align:middle line:84%
So he's sort of setting the
game straight by skewering

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:41.560 align:middle line:84%
this lady who's
having sex in a car.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, a young couple
in bed or something like that.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.860 align:middle line:90%
So evil.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Every killer
has a story like that.

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:54.410 align:middle line:84%
They're so deeply wounded that
they are perpetrating abuse

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:56.860 align:middle line:84%
on others as a way of making
themselves feel better

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.559 align:middle line:90%
because the pain is so extreme--

00:15:58.559 --> 00:15:59.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Precisely.

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:01.780 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: --that they don't
care about their own life.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Most psychopaths--
in fact, I would

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:07.037 align:middle line:84%
argue almost all psychopaths
are also suicidal.

00:16:07.037 --> 00:16:08.370 align:middle line:90%
They're ready to go at any time.

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:09.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But they don't do it.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:10.710 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:12.809 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Because they
want to make it count.

00:16:12.809 --> 00:16:14.350 align:middle line:84%
If they're going to
go out, they want

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:16.590 align:middle line:84%
to go out in a blaze of glory,
and they want to get revenge,

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:18.923 align:middle line:84%
and they want to take out a
whole bunch of people first.

00:16:18.923 --> 00:16:20.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
want to be caught?

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Ultimately,
some of them do.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And they don't care
if they get killed.

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:27.290 align:middle line:84%
They don't care if they get
caught, because they don't

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:28.920 align:middle line:90%
value their own lives very much.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The FBI tells us,
David, that at any given time,

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:36.960 align:middle line:84%
there are at least 50
serial killers wandering

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.584 align:middle line:84%
around the United States,
right now as we speak.

00:16:39.584 --> 00:16:40.500 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Absolutely.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At least 50.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: But the
serial killer thing

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:47.800 align:middle line:84%
has actually allowed most
psychopaths to operate

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.600 align:middle line:84%
under cover, because
most psychopaths are

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.460 align:middle line:90%
nonviolent psychopaths.

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:53.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Most of the time.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: That's right.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, they may be capable of
violence, but most of them

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:00.070 align:middle line:84%
don't actually go there
because they're not all the way

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:02.561 align:middle line:84%
down the road where
they're actually suicidal

00:17:02.561 --> 00:17:03.560 align:middle line:90%
and they're ready to go.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: And they just want
to take a bunch of people out.

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.220 align:middle line:84%
A non-violent
psychopath is a person

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.660 align:middle line:84%
who is highly narcissistic,
highly self involved, highly

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:13.760 align:middle line:90%
dominant.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.890 align:middle line:84%
One of the key characteristics
of a psychopath

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:17.859 align:middle line:90%
is called fearless dominance.

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:19.970 align:middle line:90%
They are not affected by fear.

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:23.190 align:middle line:84%
But that also leads to
intolerable boredom.

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:27.200 align:middle line:84%
They get their thrills
through doing dangerous things

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.730 align:middle line:84%
and through dominating
and abusing other people.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:32.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do their families
know who they are?

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:33.970 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Absolutely.

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:35.600 align:middle line:84%
If you're living
with a psychopath,

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.440 align:middle line:84%
you're dealing with a person
who is always going to be right.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.230 align:middle line:84%
They're always going
to be in control.

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:41.530 align:middle line:90%
They dominate you.

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:42.870 align:middle line:90%
You're always in trouble.

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:44.617 align:middle line:84%
You're always
apologizing to them.

00:17:44.617 --> 00:17:46.450 align:middle line:84%
You can never meet up
to their expectations.

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're never right.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: You're never right,
and they will never apologize.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And they got one set of rules
for them and one set for you.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And if you break their
rules in the slightest way,

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:58.770 align:middle line:84%
you're in deep trouble, but
they can break their own rules

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:00.854 align:middle line:84%
all the time, and if you
dare to stand up to them,

00:18:00.854 --> 00:18:03.311 align:middle line:84%
all they're going to do is just
hammer you down with force.

00:18:03.311 --> 00:18:04.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.070 align:middle line:90%
How do they ascend?

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:07.130 align:middle line:90%
Will they ever ascend?

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:09.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: What ends up
happening-- and we do know this

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:13.160 align:middle line:84%
from the past life
regression work of people

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.620 align:middle line:84%
like Dr. Michael Newton-- is
that psychopaths, when they

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:20.520 align:middle line:84%
go into the afterlife, they
know what they're doing.

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And they understand that
they have a role to fulfil.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And part of that role is
that they're in a soul family

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:31.440 align:middle line:84%
and they are the ones who stir
things up and cause trouble

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:37.390 align:middle line:84%
and create chaos, which leads
other people to evolve faster.

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:40.646 align:middle line:84%
They're aware in the afterlife
that they're doing this.

00:18:40.646 --> 00:18:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And they say things
like, I don't

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.130 align:middle line:90%
want to go too easy on you.

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:47.100 align:middle line:84%
I want to make sure that
you have the struggle

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.630 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to need to
grow and move forward and be

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:54.766 align:middle line:84%
spring loaded in your
own spiritual evolution.

00:18:54.766 --> 00:18:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And, ultimately, they
are going to have

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:59.140 align:middle line:90%
to pay off all of that karma.

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:00.820 align:middle line:84%
The people in the
Illuminati, if you

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:04.620 align:middle line:84%
want to use that term, those
people-- or you could use

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:07.740 align:middle line:84%
the word cabal and that's
less charged-- the people

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.110 align:middle line:84%
in the cabal think
of themselves as

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:12.890 align:middle line:84%
if they are a natural
force like a fire.

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:16.170 align:middle line:84%
How can you blame a fire for
burning down a whole village?

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:18.890 align:middle line:84%
That's just what the fire did
because it had the right wind,

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:20.620 align:middle line:84%
and it had the right
dryness, and it

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.470 align:middle line:90%
had the right time of the year.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:24.305 align:middle line:84%
The fire is just a
natural phenomenon.

00:19:24.305 --> 00:19:25.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It just is what it is.

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:26.836 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: It is what it is.

00:19:26.836 --> 00:19:30.130 align:middle line:84%
You can't blame the lion for
tearing apart the gazelle.

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:31.320 align:middle line:90%
The lion was hungry.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.500 align:middle line:90%
That's how he eats.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.290 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that
you are not an element.

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:37.610 align:middle line:90%
You're not a mineral.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:40.290 align:middle line:84%
You're a thinking,
feeling human being

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:44.100 align:middle line:84%
with an ethical code that is
a universal standard which

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.600 align:middle line:84%
is called the prime
directive, if you

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.230 align:middle line:84%
use Star Trek, or basically
the law of free will.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:52.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The psychopath does
not have any conscience does he?

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:54.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: They don't understand
that the prime directive is

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:55.470 align:middle line:90%
real.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:58.280 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand
that if you infringe

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.420 align:middle line:84%
on someone's free will,
it must be balanced out.

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And the ultimate
source of that is

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.380 align:middle line:84%
that we're all coming
from the same identity.

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.470 align:middle line:90%
The universe is one mind.

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, if I were to suddenly
take this and throw it on you,

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.710 align:middle line:84%
like Richard Branson--
wasn't it he who did that?

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:15.270 align:middle line:90%
No, it wasn't Branson.

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:17.740 align:middle line:84%
But there's been a couple cases
where somebody threw water

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:18.790 align:middle line:90%
on somebody else on television.

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:19.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to do that to you.

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:20.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thanks, David.

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:21.350 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Because
then I'd get fired.

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:23.100 align:middle line:84%
I'd lose my job probably,
but that would suck.

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I'd
hate you forever.

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:25.220 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: And you'd hate me.

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.320 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- I'm not going
to balance out the sandwich

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:27.810 align:middle line:90%
karma--

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.210 align:middle line:10%
>>WILCOCK: --that way.

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:30.850 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I mean over
a unpaid lunch--

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:31.250 align:middle line:10%
>>WILCOCK: I think
a gentle meal--

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:33.230 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: --you would do that?

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:35.920 align:middle line:10%
>>WILCOCK: I think a gentle
dinner would suffice.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:36.820 align:middle line:90%
But the point is--

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:37.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fair compromise.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: --if you're
out there and you're

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:41.680 align:middle line:84%
doing this kind of
stuff and you're not

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.350 align:middle line:84%
getting what's going
to happen to you,

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:49.350 align:middle line:84%
you're just repeating
the cycle that

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:53.000 align:middle line:84%
exists in the lack of knowledge
of who you really are.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.010 align:middle line:90%
You are me.

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:56.580 align:middle line:84%
If I did that to you, if I
throw this water all over you,

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:57.401 align:middle line:90%
I'm hurting myself.

00:20:57.401 --> 00:20:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You forget
I have one, too.

00:20:58.900 --> 00:20:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: That's true.

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:00.411 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: See?

00:21:00.411 --> 00:21:01.890 align:middle line:90%
Checks and balances.

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:04.100 align:middle line:90%
How many people will not ascend?

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:07.054 align:middle line:90%


00:21:07.054 --> 00:21:07.970 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: There are--

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Most of them.

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: I would imagine
most people are not ready.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.560 align:middle line:84%
I would imagine
that most people are

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:16.280 align:middle line:84%
going to repeat third
dimensional reality

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.120 align:middle line:90%
on another planet.

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And this gets into
the deep esoteric

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.196 align:middle line:84%
of what we're
talking about, which

00:21:21.196 --> 00:21:24.500 align:middle line:84%
is my source body of
teaching, the body

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.236 align:middle line:84%
of teaching that's
sort of gave rise

00:21:26.236 --> 00:21:27.860 align:middle line:84%
to everything else
I've done since then

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.650 align:middle line:90%
is called the Law of One.

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:31.780 align:middle line:84%
People say David, how do
you know so much stuff?

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.850 align:middle line:84%
How did you put
this all together?

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:37.350 align:middle line:84%
It started in 1996,
in January, when

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:40.070 align:middle line:84%
I began reading these
series of five books.

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And I call you, as you know at
events, the world's greatest

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:44.870 align:middle line:90%
thinker.

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Well,
I appreciate that.

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because
that's what you are.

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: You have
told me off camera

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.691 align:middle line:84%
that you think I'm the smartest
person you've ever met.

00:21:50.691 --> 00:21:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I shouldn't say that,
but you just said it so.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I just admitted it.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: It's funny
when you have-- OK, I

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:01.350 align:middle line:90%
don't think of myself as smart.

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:03.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't think of
myself as different.

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:05.700 align:middle line:84%
But the way that I
notice that I'm different

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:08.280 align:middle line:90%
actually is in my ethics.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:11.130 align:middle line:84%
I expect other people to think
and behave the way that I do.

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:12.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're not going to.

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: And they don't.

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:14.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you get frustrated?

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:15.413 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: They lie.

00:22:15.413 --> 00:22:16.780 align:middle line:10%
They disappoint.

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:20.900 align:middle line:10%
They are willing
to use my strengths

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.270 align:middle line:10%
to further their own gains
without wanting to work hard.

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:25.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They compromise.

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: I see this
over and over again.

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:29.240 align:middle line:10%
It's a repeating
theme of people want

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:33.330 align:middle line:10%
to latch on and benefit
from someone else's energy.

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would say 9 out
of 10 people are that way.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:37.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Sadly, I
would have to agree

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:39.170 align:middle line:84%
that a predominant
number of people

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:42.230 align:middle line:84%
are basically lazy
and unmotivated.

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:45.860 align:middle line:90%
And the cabal makes use of that.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:49.810 align:middle line:84%
They try to funnel you down
pre-described channels that

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:51.530 align:middle line:90%
benefit them.

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:53.390 align:middle line:90%
You work 9:00 to 5:00.

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:55.780 align:middle line:84%
You come home and you
watch the boob tube.

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:56.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Then that's it.

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:57.765 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Television
programming.

00:22:57.765 --> 00:22:59.056 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what they want.

00:22:59.056 --> 00:23:01.330 align:middle line:84%
Hey, as Howard Beale in
the movie networks said,

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:06.920 align:middle line:84%
just give us our telly, my
radial tires, my toaster,

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:07.935 align:middle line:90%
and leave us alone.

00:23:07.935 --> 00:23:08.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: [LAUGHTER]

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:10.105 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just leave us alone.

00:23:10.105 --> 00:23:11.063 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: That's true.

00:23:11.063 --> 00:23:13.830 align:middle line:10%
But if they can then
get you angry at who

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:16.790 align:middle line:10%
they want to attack, then
in that moment where you

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:19.210 align:middle line:10%
feel oh my gosh there is no God.

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:21.100 align:middle line:90%
The government has to save us.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:23.110 align:middle line:84%
It's so traumatic, I
can't deal with this.

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.401 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to think about it.

00:23:24.401 --> 00:23:26.400 align:middle line:90%
Go bomb those sons of guns.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.940 align:middle line:84%
Then, if you slip for
that short period of time,

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.750 align:middle line:84%
they get to get away
with murder literally.

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think the
good guys will eventually win?

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.850 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Absolutely.

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:38.810 align:middle line:84%
What we're seeing on earth
right now, I believe,

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:40.730 align:middle line:84%
is paving the way
for more people

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:47.470 align:middle line:84%
to be able to ascend by
the mass public decloaking

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:51.242 align:middle line:84%
of the satanic agenda,
because it is satanic.

00:23:51.242 --> 00:23:52.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is satanic.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.120 align:middle line:90%
There's no question about that.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:53.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Look at
what's happening

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.670 align:middle line:90%
in music videos for example.

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:59.310 align:middle line:84%
Look at what's happening
in so many movies

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:05.300 align:middle line:84%
where all of these negative
behavioral characteristics

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:07.847 align:middle line:84%
are enshrined as,
hey, this is what

00:24:07.847 --> 00:24:09.430 align:middle line:84%
you should do if you
want to be happy.

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:11.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would guess
Frank Sinatra's rolling

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:13.500 align:middle line:84%
over in this grave
looking at some

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:15.800 align:middle line:84%
of the music that's
out there today.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.560 align:middle line:84%
Now look, I'm not a
prude by any means.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.790 align:middle line:84%
I remember the Beatles episode,
and I remember my parents

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:25.720 align:middle line:84%
saying, oh, their hair is
so long and this and that.

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.680 align:middle line:90%
I don't go there.

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:29.990 align:middle line:84%
You know, I like younger people
with their styles and stuff.

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:33.700 align:middle line:84%
But I got to tell you,
some of the music I see

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:41.170 align:middle line:84%
and the wiggling and so-called
dancing just to me is not art.

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:41.960 align:middle line:90%
It's horrible.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.210 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: It goes way beyond.

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:47.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yet, social networking,
David, has made it popular.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.930 align:middle line:90%
And people are into this.

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: It goes way beyond
Elvis swishing his hips.

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:53.114 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, way beyond.

00:24:53.114 --> 00:24:55.280 align:middle line:10%
>>WILCOCK: That was supposedly
a big conspiracy when

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:58.600 align:middle line:10%
it happened, but
twerking is very, very

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:02.540 align:middle line:10%
much more erotic than
Elvis' swiveling hips dance.

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:05.750 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's amazing what
society has gone through.

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:07.470 align:middle line:10%
>>WILCOCK: But you
and I have a choice

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:09.680 align:middle line:10%
of how we're going
to respond to this.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.690 align:middle line:84%
We can see something
that appears

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:14.980 align:middle line:84%
to be beyond our control,
but you and I, I would say,

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:16.640 align:middle line:90%
both of us are heroes.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.520 align:middle line:90%
We've stepped up to the plate.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.270 align:middle line:84%
We're going out there
as public figures.

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:22.100 align:middle line:90%
We're using our real name.

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean your name
might not be Noory.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.410 align:middle line:90%
There might be some other--

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, it's Noory.

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:26.070 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: It is Noory.

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.944 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is Noory.

00:25:26.944 --> 00:25:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: It's not like
some crazy multisyllabic.

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:31.294 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, it is what it is.

00:25:31.294 --> 00:25:32.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: So there you are.

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:33.418 align:middle line:90%
You got your real name.

00:25:33.418 --> 00:25:34.290 align:middle line:90%
I got my real name.

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:34.960 align:middle line:90%
We're out here.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.520 align:middle line:90%
People know who we are.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.020 align:middle line:84%
We have to travel with security
when we do these conferences

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.580 align:middle line:84%
because there's crazy
people out there,

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:42.900 align:middle line:90%
but we're out there doing it.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And more and more people
are becoming heroic.

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:46.520 align:middle line:90%
They're speaking out.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.370 align:middle line:84%
They're stepping up to
the powers that were,

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:52.850 align:middle line:84%
and they're learning that
we can make a difference.

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:54.280 align:middle line:90%
We can change the outcome.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:57.570 align:middle line:84%
We're not stuck with
the way things are.

00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And these villains
are vulnerable.

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:04.080 align:middle line:84%
If we fear them,
that is worship.

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.450 align:middle line:90%
That's what they want want.

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:07.641 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they do have
the upper hand right now.

00:26:07.641 --> 00:26:09.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: It would
appear that way,

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:11.730 align:middle line:84%
but look at the things that
are starting to happen.

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:14.630 align:middle line:84%
Look at how there is an ever
increasing international

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:17.810 align:middle line:84%
alliance, BRICS, as it's
called-- Brazil, Russia, India,

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:21.460 align:middle line:84%
China, South Africa-- that has
essentially already created

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:25.100 align:middle line:84%
the beginnings of an alternative
financial system that

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:29.460 align:middle line:84%
will unhook the dollar
from being the only way

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:32.300 align:middle line:84%
that any two countries
can spend money

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.370 align:middle line:90%
and buy each other's stuff.

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:35.700 align:middle line:90%
That's the way it's been.

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:37.360 align:middle line:84%
That's the global
reserve currency.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 30 seconds, bitcoin,
would you ever do it?

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:43.594 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Bitcoin
just dropped to $287.

00:26:43.594 --> 00:26:45.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: God, it was at
$900 a few months ago.

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: The Queen
bought a whole bunch of it,

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.093 align:middle line:90%
that's what my insiders told me.

00:26:48.093 --> 00:26:49.810 align:middle line:84%
So I would watch
out for bitcoin.

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:51.580 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The Queen
bought bitcoin.

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: A whole bunch,
that's what my insiders told me.

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:54.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't know.

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:54.670 align:middle line:90%
I would not.

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: She doesn't want
to compete with the dollar.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't think I
would invest in bitcoins.

00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Neither would I.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, it's
kind of dangerous.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: It's very volatile.

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:04.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When digitally just
a push of a button it's gone,

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.540 align:middle line:90%
I still like the paper money.

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Paper money is going
to always be there in some form

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:12.681 align:middle line:84%
until we get our materializers
and our ET technology,

00:27:12.681 --> 00:27:14.430 align:middle line:84%
which could be a lot
sooner than we think.

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If David Wilcock could
change one thing on this planet

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:18.862 align:middle line:90%
right now, what would it be?

00:27:18.862 --> 00:27:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Probably my shirt.

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHTER]

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: It's kind of sticky.

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:25.494 align:middle line:84%
No, honestly, I would want
to see this type of material

00:27:25.494 --> 00:27:27.160 align:middle line:84%
that you and I are
talking about get out

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.920 align:middle line:84%
to much larger audiences so
they have the opportunity

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.760 align:middle line:84%
to understand how
they've been misled

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:36.180 align:middle line:84%
and where the faults lie in our
prevailing scientific paradigm,

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:40.660 align:middle line:84%
which is based on lack and
materialism and might makes

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.300 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
think it's doable?

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:44.760 align:middle line:90%
Changeable?

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: I think
it's absolutely doable.

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:48.720 align:middle line:84%
I think that the world
that we're heading into

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.650 align:middle line:84%
is a world of much
greater harmony and peace.

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we are
seeing the dawning of that

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:55.810 align:middle line:90%
coming to fruition.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:28:00.020 align:middle line:84%
If we get disclosure, if the
UFO cover up is uncloaked

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:03.920 align:middle line:84%
and it all becomes known, then
with it comes technologies that

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:07.640 align:middle line:84%
can completely satisfy all
the needs of our biosphere,

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.940 align:middle line:84%
can eliminate the drought
problem in California.

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:11.990 align:middle line:90%
We can desalinate ocean water.

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:14.450 align:middle line:84%
We can have teleportation,
anti-gravity,

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:16.570 align:middle line:84%
materialize objects
out of thin air,

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:18.100 align:middle line:90%
and that is one aspect of this.

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.352 align:middle line:84%
But we're not going
to get that, we're not

00:28:20.352 --> 00:28:22.810 align:middle line:84%
going to be allowed to get
that, until we're ethical enough

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:25.910 align:middle line:84%
to handle it and not become
this conquering race that wants

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:29.210 align:middle line:84%
to go out throughout the galaxy
and kick everybody's ass.

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:30.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How close
is David Wilcock

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:32.648 align:middle line:90%
to becoming a rainbow body?

00:28:32.648 --> 00:28:37.470 align:middle line:10%
>>WILCOCK: [LAUGHTER] If I would
answer a question about myself

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:41.960 align:middle line:10%
in third person, I would
say David is doing well.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:47.050 align:middle line:84%
But the answer on a physical
level as the I would be I

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:51.030 align:middle line:84%
hope that I'm doing well
and I always stay humble.

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:54.422 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
presume anything.

00:28:54.422 --> 00:28:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: David, people
want to track you.

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:57.580 align:middle line:84%
Your website, give
it out, please.

00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:57.860 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Please.

00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.180 align:middle line:90%
My website is divinecosmos.com.

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:02.890 align:middle line:90%


00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:07.280 align:middle line:10%
I do have an event coming
up in November at Sedona,

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.574 align:middle line:10%
and there's lots of
other stuff we're doing.

00:29:09.574 --> 00:29:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Probably, I'll be doing
your show again pretty soon.

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:14.670 align:middle line:10%
You guys have me on
about twice a year, so--

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:17.000 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: David Wilcock,
he's on Gaiam Television

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.610 align:middle line:10%
and he's starting
another new program

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:22.840 align:middle line:10%
on Gaiam Television
called "Disclosure."

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:24.030 align:middle line:10%
You don't want to miss it.

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:28.070 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
