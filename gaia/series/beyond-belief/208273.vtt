[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEDRICH OLSEN: I've actually
had a few seances where spirits

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.455 align:middle line:84%
have come through,
going, you know,

00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:18.830 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think there was an
afterlife in the first place.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.987 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm seeing a
seance from this side.

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:22.820 align:middle line:84%
What if there was a way
that you could learn

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.680 align:middle line:84%
to get out of your body,
explore the spiritual realm

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.480 align:middle line:90%
so you can have--

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And come back.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --confirmation,
come back into your body

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.060 align:middle line:84%
so that when the moment of
death comes and your body is

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.070 align:middle line:84%
no longer here,
you're ready for it.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.880 align:middle line:90%


00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.120 align:middle line:10%
And we have a marvelous
program for you today.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.580 align:middle line:10%
Kaedrich Olsen back with
us, an author, speaker,

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.340 align:middle line:10%
and a teacher who specializes
in alternative paths

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.730 align:middle line:10%
to spiritual growth.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.188 align:middle line:84%
How did you get
involved with this?

00:00:53.188 --> 00:00:54.063 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Hey, George.

00:00:54.063 --> 00:00:55.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad to be back here again.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.760 align:middle line:84%
I got involved with this
by growing up with it.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.910 align:middle line:84%
My parents took me to
a spiritualist church.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.500 align:middle line:84%
They let me have
any of the books

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.390 align:middle line:90%
that I wanted to have to study.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.650 align:middle line:10%
My mom was a CPA accounting
controller down in Denver

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.810 align:middle line:10%
and, if I would
say, hey, mom, can I

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.423 align:middle line:10%
get these herbs, can
I get these oils,

00:01:12.423 --> 00:01:13.840 align:middle line:10%
that sort of thing,
she would stop

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.910 align:middle line:10%
at the metaphysical
bookstore, bring it home.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.500 align:middle line:84%
So it was encouraged
to explore this.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And part of the reason
was, is because our house

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.730 align:middle line:90%
was so haunted--

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --that we needed to
figure out what to do about it

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.080 align:middle line:84%
and how to deal with the
ghosts that were in the house.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.955 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did you
stay in a haunted house?

00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:29.918 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: You know, I
thought it was normal.

00:01:29.918 --> 00:01:31.960 align:middle line:84%
I thought that was just
the way the world worked.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.460 align:middle line:84%
You know, you'd set
something down, turn around.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.510 align:middle line:90%
It would disappear.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.920 align:middle line:90%
TV channels would change.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.360 align:middle line:10%
You'd hear the
toilet flush, feet

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.280 align:middle line:10%
walking up and down the stairs.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.247 align:middle line:10%
As a teenager, I was a musician.

00:01:41.247 --> 00:01:42.580 align:middle line:90%
So I brought in some keyboards--

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.215 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --into the basement,
where I was sleeping.

00:01:45.215 --> 00:01:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And at night, I could
hear little keys

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.900 align:middle line:90%
tick-tapping at night.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.180 align:middle line:90%
It was so kind of cool.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's cool.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.120 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I was tempted to turn
it on to see what kind of music

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.200 align:middle line:90%
they would play.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I wish I'd known that.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.420 align:middle line:90%
We'd play some music here.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Oh, yeah.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.905 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That would
have been fun.

00:01:56.905 --> 00:01:59.110 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I do some really
interesting music now.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Doing some Nordic folk
music to conjure the dead

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.400 align:middle line:84%
so that we are speaking
to the dead through music.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.340 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of fun now.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.875 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you always
dealt with the other side?

00:02:09.875 --> 00:02:10.675 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Always.

00:02:10.675 --> 00:02:12.418 align:middle line:84%
You know, when kids
are playing in school

00:02:12.418 --> 00:02:13.960 align:middle line:84%
and they're on the
playground, right?

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.460 align:middle line:84%
They've got their
imaginary friends.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.710 align:middle line:84%
They're on the swing,
swinging back and forth.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.027 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Or they're playing
house or different games

00:02:20.027 --> 00:02:21.220 align:middle line:90%
with kids.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.260 align:middle line:84%
My imaginary friends
were telling me

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.600 align:middle line:84%
about the multiple
layers of reality,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.740 align:middle line:84%
about how to connect with
other type of beings,

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.690 align:middle line:90%
and how things talk.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:29.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Deep.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.460 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Oh, yeah.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.800 align:middle line:84%
When I even got to junior
high and most people

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.380 align:middle line:84%
lose their imaginary
friends, mine

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.400 align:middle line:84%
were giving me infinite
mathematics on a linear scale.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.108 align:middle line:84%
I was writing down pages
of infinite mathematics.

00:02:42.108 --> 00:02:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, I don't
know how I know this,

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.940 align:middle line:84%
until my mom took me to
her old college professor.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:47.940 align:middle line:90%
He looked over my notes.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.578 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, how
do you do this?

00:02:49.578 --> 00:02:50.620 align:middle line:90%
How are you knowing this?

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.660 align:middle line:84%
This is like the work
of Bertrand Russell.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He thought you
were a boy genius, right?

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, he didn't know
where I was getting it from.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And I told him I was
basically channeling

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.320 align:middle line:90%
this infinite mathematics out.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And of course he
didn't believe me.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:01.330 align:middle line:90%
But that's OK.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.330 align:middle line:84%
But the results were
the results, right?

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.170 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: The results
were the results.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.480 align:middle line:84%
He was dumbfounded how I
would know stuff like that.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is amazing.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And you've used this to really
alter your life, haven't you?

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.383 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: You know,
I'm using it more

00:03:15.383 --> 00:03:17.800 align:middle line:84%
to alter other people's lives,
to help them be aware of it

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.812 align:middle line:84%
because this is how
I've always been.

00:03:19.812 --> 00:03:20.770 align:middle line:90%
I've always known this.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:21.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
natural for you.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.692 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: This is natural to me.

00:03:22.692 --> 00:03:24.550 align:middle line:84%
The supernatural is
completely natural.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Paranormal is completely normal.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's still one
of those things.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.382 align:middle line:84%
When you live in a
world in a certain way

00:03:30.382 --> 00:03:31.840 align:middle line:84%
and then you look
beyond that world

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.260 align:middle line:84%
and you see other people living
differently, it's like, hm,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.602 align:middle line:84%
how do you not know that there's
a lady standing beside you

00:03:38.602 --> 00:03:40.810 align:middle line:84%
with her hand on your shoulder
trying to talk to you,

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.100 align:middle line:84%
say, hey, everything's
going to be OK?

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.890 align:middle line:90%
Just take a breath and go.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.510 align:middle line:90%
To me, that's completely normal.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.892 align:middle line:90%
But I look around the world.

00:03:47.892 --> 00:03:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, oh,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.970 align:middle line:84%
We need to help people wake
up to the reality that's

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.610 align:middle line:84%
all around us, this beautiful
paranormal world that's

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.600 align:middle line:90%
everywhere all the time.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are spirits in
this room right now with us.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.568 align:middle line:84%
And most people just
go about the world--

00:04:01.568 --> 00:04:03.235 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
always been spiritual?

00:04:03.235 --> 00:04:04.372 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Always.

00:04:04.372 --> 00:04:06.580 align:middle line:84%
I took a little break when
I was in college because I

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.140 align:middle line:90%
was focusing on my studies.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.223 align:middle line:84%
But after I got out of
that, it was both feet

00:04:10.223 --> 00:04:11.140 align:middle line:90%
in, full, deep plunge.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do your
friends say about this?

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: They think I'm one
of the most interesting people

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:15.355 align:middle line:90%
that they know.

00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:15.640 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Perfect.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:17.860 align:middle line:90%
So they believe you?

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.029 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: They do
believe me, you know?

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.360 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's important.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --there are
things I can validate

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:22.810 align:middle line:84%
for their experiences
because I'd

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.310 align:middle line:84%
say one of the worst
parts of having

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.190 align:middle line:84%
a paranormal experience is not
having somebody you could talk

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.420 align:middle line:90%
to about it, you know?

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.855 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's so true.

00:04:28.855 --> 00:04:30.190 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: We have
something that happens

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.000 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the night.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.810 align:middle line:90%
We're like, what is it?

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:32.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm so scared.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.480 align:middle line:84%
So we go, we talk to our
friends or loved ones.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.100 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, [SCOFFS] no.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.470 align:middle line:90%
And we get poo-pooed about it.

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:39.280 align:middle line:90%
We get shunned.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.780 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes we get shamed for it.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.238 align:middle line:84%
And I'm one of those friends
that they can come to and say,

00:04:43.238 --> 00:04:44.320 align:middle line:90%
hey, this happened.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.623 align:middle line:90%
What's that all about?

00:04:45.623 --> 00:04:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And we can actually
have a conversation.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And they feel normalized,
like a normal person.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.508 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kaedrich, do you ever
get scared with what you do?

00:04:52.508 --> 00:04:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Oh, yeah, every
now and then it happens.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.337 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the other night
it was really fun.

00:04:56.337 --> 00:04:57.295 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:04:57.295 --> 00:05:00.055 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I had a sleep
paralysis, a hag dream.

00:05:00.055 --> 00:05:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You enjoy that?

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.288 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Oh, yeah, it
was fun because I woke up

00:05:03.288 --> 00:05:04.940 align:middle line:84%
and I realized
what was going on.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.175 align:middle line:84%
And my first method that
I tell everybody to do,

00:05:08.175 --> 00:05:09.550 align:middle line:84%
if you feel
something creepy, you

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.230 align:middle line:84%
have that creep
factor coming along,

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.120 align:middle line:84%
the first thing I want
you to do is laugh.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Have fun with it
because if there's

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.140 align:middle line:84%
something negative in the room
that's trying to provoke you,

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.970 align:middle line:84%
to get you into a
fear state, it's

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.550 align:middle line:84%
actually going to feed
off of that fear energy.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And if you can laugh and have
fun and joy with that moment,

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.657 align:middle line:84%
it's going to
disrupt that energy.

00:05:26.657 --> 00:05:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And that thing, if that's
really a negative thing trying

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.040 align:middle line:84%
to bug you, is going to
be like, I'm out of here.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't want anything
to do with it.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.410 align:middle line:84%
But if it's a higher level
being or a friendly person,

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:36.970 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
have fun with you.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.872 align:middle line:84%
So I had this sleep
paralysis, sometimes

00:05:38.872 --> 00:05:40.330 align:middle line:84%
called a hag dream,
where you think

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.060 align:middle line:84%
there's something sitting on
your chest and you can't move.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something's
taking your breath away.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Right.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.010 align:middle line:90%
And I finally woke up.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.340 align:middle line:90%
I realized what it was.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And my body is flooded with
a fear, neurochemicals,

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.050 align:middle line:84%
and the whole
biological part of that.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.238 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that easy
to get through it.

00:05:53.238 --> 00:05:54.280 align:middle line:90%
But I took my own advice.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.080 align:middle line:90%
And I'm laughing.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm going,
[HESITANTLY CHUCKLING]

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.050 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
things about laughter

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.670 align:middle line:84%
is it's one of those things you
can fake it till you make it.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:02.870 align:middle line:90%
So I knew to fake laugh.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:03.770 align:middle line:90%
I knew to have a good time.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.350 align:middle line:84%
I knew to pick up my phone
and do something that was

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:06.853 align:middle line:90%
kind of fun and scan the room.

00:06:06.853 --> 00:06:08.020 align:middle line:90%
And there was nothing there.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, but just to be
sure, I'll put up some wards.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.190 align:middle line:84%
I'll flood with some
positive energy.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.660 align:middle line:90%
And I'll go do something fun.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I went back to
sleep with no problem.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
had night terrors?

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Oh, yeah.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.347 align:middle line:84%
Night terrors,
again, no problem.

00:06:19.347 --> 00:06:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't think
that's ever happened to me.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I'm
missing anything, am I?

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.340 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: No.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.610 align:middle line:84%
But I'll say this-- it's a
little kind of controversial--

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.590 align:middle line:84%
but they can be
fun if you realize

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.130 align:middle line:84%
it's just mostly your body
just kind of having a reaction,

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.070 align:middle line:84%
just letting go of
some stress, releasing

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.080 align:middle line:84%
some of-- any of the
built-up frustration that

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.880 align:middle line:90%
needs to happen.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.937 align:middle line:84%
It's just your body
letting that go.

00:06:40.937 --> 00:06:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And if you can recognize it
and you come back out of it,

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.812 align:middle line:84%
you can have a little
bit of a moment

00:06:44.812 --> 00:06:47.423 align:middle line:84%
where you can reset that
emotion just by laughing, having

00:06:47.423 --> 00:06:48.590 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of fun with it.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.215 align:middle line:84%
Think of it like a
horror movie, right?

00:06:50.215 --> 00:06:51.260 align:middle line:90%
You watch a horror movie.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.820 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: It's fun.

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:52.862 align:middle line:90%
You have that jump scare.

00:06:52.862 --> 00:06:53.680 align:middle line:90%
You're like, wah.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.720 align:middle line:90%
But then you laugh.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Same way with a nightmare
or a paralysis thing.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:58.640 align:middle line:90%
Just have fun with it.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And then it will reset
everything around you.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kaedrich, Ross
Allison, who is a ghost hunter,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.960 align:middle line:84%
has investigated some pretty
strange, haunted places--

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.377 align:middle line:84%
you were talking
about your house.

00:07:09.377 --> 00:07:10.177 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Mhm.

00:07:10.177 --> 00:07:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at what he's done.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS ALLISON: So
this is Mr. Creepy.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.700 align:middle line:84%
He goes back to
the 1960s, when he

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.160 align:middle line:84%
was created by a retired
ventriloquist artist.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.610 align:middle line:84%
And he made this
doll in his likeness,

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.470 align:middle line:90%
that you can actually see there.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.320 align:middle line:84%
What makes these
dolls really creepy

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.810 align:middle line:84%
is they actually use their
real hair on the dolls.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.240 align:middle line:84%
So I brought them
to our old location.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And we had them in a different
glass case at the time.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.150 align:middle line:90%
And I was alone in the store.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.920 align:middle line:84%
I was doing something
in the office when I

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.930 align:middle line:90%
heard this thud against glass.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, I immediately
thought something

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.640 align:middle line:90%
happened in the gift shop.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.600 align:middle line:84%
So I go out, and I'm looking
around to see what had fallen

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.220 align:middle line:84%
or what that noise
could have been.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.845 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't find
anything disturbed.

00:07:49.845 --> 00:07:51.050 align:middle line:90%
So I start walking around.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm walking around these
huge tables we used to have

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:57.280 align:middle line:84%
and I come face
to face with him,

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.800 align:middle line:84%
I see that his head is
now turned and leaning up

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.750 align:middle line:90%
against the glass.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:05.350 align:middle line:84%
So I immediately
take a picture of it.

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.440 align:middle line:10%
And to my surprise, when
I reviewed the photo,

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.532 align:middle line:10%
in the photo, you
can see his head

00:08:10.532 --> 00:08:11.740 align:middle line:10%
leaning up against the glass.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.460 align:middle line:84%
But in the reflection
of the glass itself,

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.170 align:middle line:84%
you don't see the
reflection of him.

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:22.450 align:middle line:90%
You see the reflection of him.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So have you
ever gone ghost hunting?

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:26.710 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Oh, yeah.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:28.750 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily with
a ghost hunter team,

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.450 align:middle line:84%
with all the gadgets and
all of the technology.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:32.830 align:middle line:90%
That kind of stuff is fun.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.590 align:middle line:84%
But definitely with
some friends on my own,

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.500 align:middle line:84%
exploring cemeteries,
exploring haunted locations.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:39.320 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Scary?

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:42.130 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: No, actually.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.993 align:middle line:84%
Most of these places are
really not scary at all to me.

00:08:44.993 --> 00:08:46.660 align:middle line:84%
I understand the
spirits that are there.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:46.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.335 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I can
connect with them.

00:08:48.335 --> 00:08:50.660 align:middle line:84%
I can feel the energy out
and see what's going on.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.297 align:middle line:84%
And I've never had a really
too frightening experience

00:08:53.297 --> 00:08:54.130 align:middle line:90%
exploring like that.

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:56.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think a ghost is?

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:59.110 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Ah, this
is kind of fun.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.450 align:middle line:84%
You know how we have
the spiritual principle

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:05.060 align:middle line:84%
that we are spiritual beings
having a physical experience?

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:05.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.210 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I want to throw
that out the window.

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:08.140 align:middle line:90%
Just completely throw that away.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:08.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Toss it out.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:09.190 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Toss it out.

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:10.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Doesn't exist.

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:10.968 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Doesn't exist.

00:09:10.968 --> 00:09:14.650 align:middle line:84%
We are spiritual
and physical beings

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:17.140 align:middle line:90%
having a dynamic experience.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.480 align:middle line:84%
The work of Hameroff
and Penrose showed us

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.150 align:middle line:84%
that the neurons of our
body have microtubules

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:23.350 align:middle line:90%
with virtual energy.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And that virtual energy
is locked into a matrix

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:27.880 align:middle line:90%
that is in the human form.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And they theorize that is
actually the human soul.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And if we are looking from
the higher-self perspective,

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:36.280 align:middle line:84%
the higher self exists
in a timeless place

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.590 align:middle line:84%
where it just wants to
experience different realities.

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And it sends out a little
tendril that becomes George.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's experiencing
all of your lifetimes

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:47.140 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously
because it wants to.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.170 align:middle line:84%
But the physical George
and the spiritual George

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:51.880 align:middle line:84%
came into being
at the same time.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.590 align:middle line:84%
It's not a
chicken-or-egg situation.

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:55.520 align:middle line:84%
They both came into
being at the same time.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And they both create each
other at the same time.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.660 align:middle line:84%
At the point where the
physical body no longer exists,

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.120 align:middle line:84%
that matrix of virtual
energy continues.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And it persists
in multiple ways.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And it could reach higher
levels of vibration

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:10.543 align:middle line:84%
and can ascend into
higher states of being.

00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:11.710 align:middle line:90%
And that's what a spirit is.

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are
various levels of beings.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:84%
What would you
call poltergeists?

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:18.160 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Poltergeists
would not even

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.320 align:middle line:90%
be a being, believe it or not.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.230 align:middle line:84%
What a poltergeist is,
it's more of an effect.

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.750 align:middle line:84%
There's some interesting
work out there showing--

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:26.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's evil.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:27.850 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Nope,
it's not even evil.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't think so?

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.440 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Not even evil.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.107 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But the movie
said it was evil.

00:10:31.107 --> 00:10:32.100 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yes, and that's
one of my missions

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:37.390 align:middle line:84%
in this world is
to help us reset

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:39.700 align:middle line:84%
what we think we see in the
movies as the paranormal.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.580 align:middle line:84%
The paranormal in the
real world doesn't work

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:43.855 align:middle line:90%
like it does in the movies.

00:10:43.855 --> 00:10:44.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A-ha.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:45.220 align:middle line:90%
So what are they?

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Poltergeist happens
when usually an adolescent--

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.430 align:middle line:84%
but it can happen in older
people; and I've seen that,

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:52.960 align:middle line:90%
too, with different ages--

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.220 align:middle line:84%
where there is a lot of
emotional turmoil going on

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.020 align:middle line:90%
inside.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.810 align:middle line:84%
Somebody is sensitive,
emotionally sensitive.

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:02.060 align:middle line:84%
But they are not able to
express their emotions.

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.740 align:middle line:90%
They can't get that emotion out.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things we know
through metaphysical research

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.000 align:middle line:84%
is that if you have an emotion
or if you have some sort

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.130 align:middle line:84%
of energy that you
cannot express,

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.275 align:middle line:90%
it will find another way.

00:11:14.275 --> 00:11:16.150 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes emotion will
come out as an illness

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:18.860 align:middle line:84%
in the body, which is where
we get conversion disorders.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes to
the metaphysical world,

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.190 align:middle line:84%
if a person cannot express that
emotion that needs to get out

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:25.960 align:middle line:84%
and they have a
telekinetic ability,

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.570 align:middle line:84%
they'll send a book
flying across the room.

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, how we'll see
this one is maybe

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.620 align:middle line:84%
the child has their
imaginary friend

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.270 align:middle line:90%
that's not an imaginary friend.

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:36.037 align:middle line:84%
And mom and dad say,
just go to your room.

00:11:36.037 --> 00:11:37.120 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to hear this.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.078 align:middle line:90%
Stop playing your game.

00:11:38.078 --> 00:11:39.250 align:middle line:90%
Stop telling your lies.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:40.917 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, the kid's
like, what do I do?

00:11:40.917 --> 00:11:41.717 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Panic.

00:11:41.717 --> 00:11:42.740 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Where do I go?

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to give
a very real situation.

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:48.460 align:middle line:84%
It's an adolescent
or preadolescent girl

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.485 align:middle line:84%
seeing something, feeling
something strange.

00:11:50.485 --> 00:11:51.610 align:middle line:90%
They don't know what to do.

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.037 align:middle line:84%
Dad is like, just
go to your room.

00:11:53.037 --> 00:11:54.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm tired of hearing about this.

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:55.170 align:middle line:90%
Just stop.

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:57.250 align:middle line:90%
Now the kid is like, ugh!

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And that energy comes out,
the emotion comes out.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And then things start flying,
things start breaking.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:06.623 align:middle line:84%
Dad gets scratches because dad
is that focus point of, just

00:12:06.623 --> 00:12:07.790 align:middle line:90%
shut up and go to your room.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:08.720 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to hear it.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:08.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.180 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And that's
what the poltergeist is.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.545 align:middle line:90%
It's usually a compound.

00:12:11.545 --> 00:12:13.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
out to hurt you?

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:13.990 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: No.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:17.320 align:middle line:84%
What it is, it's a person trying
to express their emotions out.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And if we can work
with the family,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.490 align:middle line:84%
get the family dynamics
going and help the person

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:23.650 align:middle line:84%
to find a more comfortable,
healthy way to express

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:26.530 align:middle line:84%
their energy and their
emotion, the poltergeist effect

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:27.860 align:middle line:90%
drops away.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:31.090 align:middle line:84%
But what we usually find is that
there is an underlying cause,

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.850 align:middle line:84%
an underlying paranormal cause,
that imaginary friend that's

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:34.810 align:middle line:90%
not imaginary.

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:36.730 align:middle line:84%
There really is a
spirit in the house.

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, that spirit is also
going, what are you doing?

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.290 align:middle line:90%
Why are you acting this way?

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:43.370 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to
say, hey, I'm lost.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:44.790 align:middle line:90%
How do I get out of here?

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is a servitor?

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:50.290 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: A servitor is a
being created in a ritual,

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:52.175 align:middle line:84%
like a witch or a
magician, some sort of a--

00:12:52.175 --> 00:12:53.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Conjured up.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:54.190 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Conjured up.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.423 align:middle line:84%
And it's given a
specific purpose.

00:12:56.423 --> 00:12:58.090 align:middle line:84%
The person will create
a will statement,

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:02.500 align:middle line:84%
like, it is my will to
find this rare book.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.780 align:middle line:84%
They'll create a clay
effigy or some sort

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.840 align:middle line:84%
of a drawing of this creature
that they want to send out.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And they will send it out as
an astral being throughout all

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.270 align:middle line:84%
of the different layers of
the collective unconscious,

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:16.290 align:middle line:84%
throughout the subtle
reality to find that book.

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And every now and then, they'll
check in with that servitor.

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:20.770 align:middle line:84%
They'll call it back and say,
hey, have you found the book?

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:21.710 align:middle line:90%
What have you found?

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:22.540 align:middle line:90%
Here's some energy.

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:23.340 align:middle line:90%
Keep going.

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.132 align:middle line:84%
And so they'll feed
the servitor so that it

00:13:25.132 --> 00:13:26.550 align:middle line:90%
can go out and find that book.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And eventually it
finds that book.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And it comes back and says, hey,
it's over here in this library.

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:32.710 align:middle line:90%
Go find it there.

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And then the magician will
go out to that library,

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.375 align:middle line:84%
find the book, and
say, cool, thank you.

00:13:37.375 --> 00:13:38.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I like that.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tulpas.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Tulpas are what
happens if a servitor isn't

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:44.520 align:middle line:90%
taken care of very well.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Like, maybe it's
charged up a few times.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:47.760 align:middle line:90%
It has that purpose.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.590 align:middle line:84%
It goes out, and
it finds that book.

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:51.007 align:middle line:84%
And then the
magician goes, great,

00:13:51.007 --> 00:13:53.100 align:middle line:84%
thanks, but doesn't
dissipate that energy,

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.090 align:middle line:84%
doesn't, in essence,
kill the servitor.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:55.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:13:55.890 --> 00:14:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And the tulpa goes, hm,
well, let's go find that book.

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And it'll go find
somebody else that

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.460 align:middle line:84%
may have an interest in
reading and it says, hey,

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:03.900 align:middle line:90%
here's a book.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:04.320 align:middle line:90%
Here's a book.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.250 align:middle line:90%
Here's a book.

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And over the years, it
learns how to find books.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it collects
a library of books.

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:11.880 align:middle line:90%
And it says, great.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.110 align:middle line:90%
I have this library.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:14.520 align:middle line:84%
You want to come
to this library?

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And it convinces people
to build this library.

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's, in essence, the
spirit of that library.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.828 align:middle line:84%
And it will have people
just continuously going

00:14:22.828 --> 00:14:24.870 align:middle line:84%
to find those rare books
to put into the library.

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:27.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's not necessarily
a bad or evil thing.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.040 align:middle line:90%
But it can lead to obsession.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.498 align:middle line:84%
Like, people get obsessed
to try to fulfill this need

00:14:31.498 --> 00:14:33.540 align:middle line:84%
to get those books and
bring those books in there

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.020 align:middle line:84%
because it's feeding
that tulpa to keep

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:37.020 align:middle line:90%
bringing those books in.

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's an egregore?

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.843 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Ah, egregores
are very, very common.

00:14:40.843 --> 00:14:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, they are?

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.120 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: They're very common.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.938 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we get into
some controversial territory,

00:14:45.938 --> 00:14:46.980 align:middle line:90%
which is going to be fun.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.022 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK, let's do it.

00:14:48.022 --> 00:14:51.370 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: In essence, an egregore
is a collectively created

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:52.170 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:56.460 align:middle line:84%
When we tell stories about a
certain entity over and over

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:58.840 align:middle line:84%
and over and over again,
we give it a name,

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.690 align:middle line:84%
we give it a face,
a description,

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:03.040 align:middle line:84%
we give it a role that
it plays in the world,

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.690 align:middle line:84%
our belief that it exists
and what it does creates it.

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Humans are powerfully
creative creatures.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And so we create this egregore
that lives up to those ideals

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:14.850 align:middle line:90%
that we put together.

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And it is fed off
of our beliefs.

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And so an egregore
literally becomes a deity

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.290 align:middle line:90%
for different religions.

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:23.730 align:middle line:90%
It can be angels.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:25.370 align:middle line:90%
It can even be demons.

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:26.870 align:middle line:84%
These are the things
that we create.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:28.995 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, so it's
not always good things.

00:15:28.995 --> 00:15:30.900 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Right, it's
not always good things.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.068 align:middle line:84%
And it could be
related to a location.

00:15:33.068 --> 00:15:35.610 align:middle line:10%
So when I work with paranormal
investigators and other people

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:39.690 align:middle line:10%
in the paranormal world, we
talk about insane asylums,

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:42.210 align:middle line:10%
where very awful tragedies
have happened there.

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:43.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Horrible
things have happened.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:43.590 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Horrible things.

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And there are
people still there,

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:48.840 align:middle line:84%
spirits trapped, dealing
with this horrible situation.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.400 align:middle line:90%
And investigators go in.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.480 align:middle line:90%
And the stories get told.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And people tell the story
over and over and over again

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:56.610 align:middle line:84%
about this insane asylum,
about how awful it is.

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:59.520 align:middle line:84%
That creates the egregore
that lives there now.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And it is being fed off of the
misery and the torment that's

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:04.090 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's also being fed off
of our fears from our stories

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:08.020 align:middle line:90%
that we're telling.

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And so when an investigative
team goes in there,

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.580 align:middle line:84%
they'll see those little
spirits running around and doing

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:13.380 align:middle line:90%
their thing.

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:16.350 align:middle line:84%
But then they'll come
across the big nasty,

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:18.830 align:middle line:84%
where they're like, oh, what
is this awful, horrible thing

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:19.630 align:middle line:90%
here?

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:21.242 align:middle line:84%
And if you are not
prepared for it,

00:16:21.242 --> 00:16:22.950 align:middle line:84%
you're going to go,
well, that's a demon.

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:25.440 align:middle line:84%
We need to bring in an exorcist
and get it out of here.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's not going to work
because it's not an evil thing,

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.277 align:middle line:90%
part of the Christian religion.

00:16:30.277 --> 00:16:31.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
follow those things.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:34.470 align:middle line:84%
It is created by our
collective beliefs.

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:36.803 align:middle line:84%
And as long as we're telling
those stories of this demon

00:16:36.803 --> 00:16:39.053 align:middle line:84%
there, we're telling these
stories of the awful things

00:16:39.053 --> 00:16:40.680 align:middle line:84%
that happened
there, we're feeding

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:41.880 align:middle line:90%
the belief of that egregore.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.297 align:middle line:84%
And it continues,
and it persists.

00:16:43.297 --> 00:16:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We were talking
about poltergeists.

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:48.330 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of people
who still think poltergeists

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:50.190 align:middle line:90%
are pretty darn scary.

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:51.470 align:middle line:90%
Watch this.

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:54.397 align:middle line:84%
>> And this case was well
documented in the press.

00:16:54.397 --> 00:16:55.980 align:middle line:84%
We were getting calls
from as far away

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.150 align:middle line:90%
as Australia from journalists.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:57.950 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:58.950 align:middle line:10%
>> And the whole city--

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:00.420 align:middle line:10%
Bridgeport is not a small town.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:01.290 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's not a small town.

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:03.150 align:middle line:10%
>> And the whole
place was upside down.

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:05.670 align:middle line:10%
There were up to 10,000 people
gathered outside that house

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.082 align:middle line:10%
at any one time, so I was told.

00:17:07.082 --> 00:17:08.040 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, we went in
after it had begun.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:14.670 align:middle line:10%
There had been pounding on the
walls for months before this.

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:16.050 align:middle line:10%
Strange things were happening.

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:18.810 align:middle line:10%
And I've often found this,
that when a poltergeist begins,

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:20.099 align:middle line:10%
it starts slowly.

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:21.480 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't know why then.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.380 align:middle line:10%
And as people get more annoyed,
more frightened, more angry,

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:26.730 align:middle line:10%
it gets more energy.

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:28.440 align:middle line:10%
It gets more to eat.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.260 align:middle line:10%
And hence, our modern idea of
parasites being what they are.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:32.820 align:middle line:10%
But I didn't know that then.

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.700 align:middle line:10%
So what we did was to go in.

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.400 align:middle line:10%
And it took a while
for us to get--

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.190 align:middle line:10%
it sort of has to accept
you into its chemical mix.

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:42.420 align:middle line:10%
And the place was a mess.

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:45.070 align:middle line:10%
Something had been wheeling
the little girl's baby carriage

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:45.870 align:middle line:10%
around.

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:47.328 align:middle line:10%
This was a couple
in their 40s with

00:17:47.328 --> 00:17:48.630 align:middle line:10%
a 10-year-old adopted child.

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:51.210 align:middle line:10%
And it was filled with
clothes, this baby carriage.

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:54.960 align:middle line:10%
Religious objects-- this is
an example of Roman Catholic

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.748 align:middle line:10%
negative spirituality,
in my opinion--

00:17:56.748 --> 00:17:59.040 align:middle line:10%
religious objects have been
torn from the walls, thrown

00:17:59.040 --> 00:17:59.910 align:middle line:10%
to the floor.

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:01.660 align:middle line:10%
Knives had come out
of the kitchen drawer.

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:02.460 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:04.070 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.980 align:middle line:10%
>> And you know--

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.930 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I can handle religious
artifacts being thrown around,

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:07.650 align:middle line:10%
but not knives.

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:09.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, but not knives
flying around the kitchen.

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.310 align:middle line:10%
So the first thing that I
heard was, several hours

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:14.940 align:middle line:10%
after we got there, there
were police and firefighters.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.270 align:middle line:10%
And we stood there and watched
a 300-pound refrigerator

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.860 align:middle line:10%
lift up off the floor,
turn around, and set itself

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:21.660 align:middle line:10%
back down.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.100 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How high
up, a couple inches?

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:23.900 align:middle line:10%
>> 3 feet or so.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.020 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: 3 feet?

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:25.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:28.375 align:middle line:10%
Police officers on one side of
me, firefighters on the other.

00:18:28.375 --> 00:18:30.000 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And everybody's
watching this.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:30.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:34.075 align:middle line:10%
Oh, this was in their reports,
the official police reports.

00:18:34.075 --> 00:18:34.950 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: This is big.

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:39.000 align:middle line:10%
>> So then, all of a sudden,
you hear this huge crash.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.473 align:middle line:10%
And the enormous
chest of drawers

00:18:40.473 --> 00:18:42.390 align:middle line:10%
in the little girl's
room flew across the room

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:44.010 align:middle line:10%
and hit the wall.

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.890 align:middle line:10%
And things just sort
of took off from there.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you don't think
they're really scary, do you?

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:51.180 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: Well, they
can be, especially

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.220 align:middle line:10%
if there's a family
that has no idea what's

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:54.370 align:middle line:10%
going on in the house.

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:55.860 align:middle line:10%
It's definitely scary.

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.120 align:middle line:10%
It's feeding that fear.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.280 align:middle line:84%
It's not scary to me because
I know what's going on

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.050 align:middle line:84%
and I know how to
check in with a house.

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:02.675 align:middle line:84%
When I've gone into
houses where people

00:19:02.675 --> 00:19:05.140 align:middle line:84%
have some scary things
going on, horrible things,

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.690 align:middle line:84%
the first thing I
do is I get a feel

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:09.150 align:middle line:84%
for the energy of the house
to see what's really going on.

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:11.310 align:middle line:84%
And if there are spirits
there, I'll connect with them,

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:13.020 align:middle line:84%
communicate with them,
see what's going on.

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And in every time there's
been a poltergeist,

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:16.705 align:middle line:84%
it hasn't been scary
to me because I

00:19:16.705 --> 00:19:19.080 align:middle line:84%
get what the energies are and
what's going on with there.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And then I work with the
family to diffuse the fear

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:23.540 align:middle line:84%
factor so that it's
not a problem anymore.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are
some other entities.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.350 align:middle line:84%
We've got Heidi Hollis, who
comes on "Coast to Coast"

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.330 align:middle line:90%
quite often, my radio show--

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:33.540 align:middle line:84%
coined the phrase "hat
people" and "shadow people."

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:34.830 align:middle line:90%
What are those things?

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:36.822 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: That I'm still
trying to figure out.

00:19:36.822 --> 00:19:38.280 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of a
fun little thing.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something's there.

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:39.690 align:middle line:90%
There's something there.

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:41.190 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: There's
something for sure.

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:44.153 align:middle line:84%
My neighborhood that I
live in is full of them.

00:19:44.153 --> 00:19:45.570 align:middle line:84%
As you're driving
down the street,

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:47.700 align:middle line:84%
you can see somebody standing
on the side of the road out

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:48.783 align:middle line:90%
of the corner of your eye.

00:19:48.783 --> 00:19:49.590 align:middle line:90%
You turn to look.

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:50.230 align:middle line:90%
And they're gone.

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's gone.

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: You wake up in
the middle of the night

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:54.900 align:middle line:84%
and you see this shadowy figure
walking through the room.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.450 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly it's not there.

00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Even people who don't believe
in ghosts, when they come

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.350 align:middle line:84%
to visit me, they're driving
through the neighborhood,

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:03.670 align:middle line:84%
they're like, what is
with your neighborhood?

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Every now and then,
I turn a corner.

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:06.810 align:middle line:84%
I swear I see somebody
standing there about

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:08.100 align:middle line:90%
ready to walk in front of me.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.188 align:middle line:90%
And then they're gone.

00:20:09.188 --> 00:20:10.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, oh, yeah,
it's the shadow people.

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:11.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it you?

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:11.930 align:middle line:90%
Are you a magnet?

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: No, I
don't think it's me.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.860 align:middle line:90%
I think it's the territory.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:16.360 align:middle line:90%
I think they live there.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't quite know
what they are.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.370 align:middle line:84%
When I've done seances
and I've done black mirror

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:23.232 align:middle line:84%
work to connect with them,
we've brought them in the room.

00:20:23.232 --> 00:20:25.440 align:middle line:84%
I've had multiple people
validate that they're there.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.220 align:middle line:90%
We're trying to communicate.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.740 align:middle line:90%
But we can't.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.780 align:middle line:90%
There's something blocking us.

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.190 align:middle line:84%
Like, when I work
with spirits, I

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:34.680 align:middle line:84%
check in at the emotional level
to see what the emotion is.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.043 align:middle line:90%
I check at the energy level.

00:20:36.043 --> 00:20:38.460 align:middle line:84%
We'll see if we can actually
have some sort of a dialogue.

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.040 align:middle line:84%
With the shadow
beings, it's like--

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.620 align:middle line:84%
it's like, I want to
use the word "purple."

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.150 align:middle line:84%
But they're
communicating in shades

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:46.980 align:middle line:84%
of green, where I
use a word, they'll

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.290 align:middle line:84%
communicate in shades
of something else.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.240 align:middle line:90%
And we're not connecting.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.920 align:middle line:84%
They don't seem
to be malevolent.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.350 align:middle line:84%
But they don't seem to
be beneficial either.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:57.330 align:middle line:84%
It's like they're living
in another dimension,

00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:58.010 align:middle line:90%
another reality.

00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:58.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And I think
if we mess with them,

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.890 align:middle line:90%
they'll mess with us.

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:04.740 align:middle line:84%
But I haven't really figured
out what they are yet.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.075 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you do many seances?

00:21:06.075 --> 00:21:09.085 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I do them all the
time, sometimes individually

00:21:09.085 --> 00:21:11.460 align:middle line:84%
for clients when they come in
with certain questions, one

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:13.200 align:middle line:84%
off, every now and
then with a group.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:17.130 align:middle line:84%
I do a regular one every couple
of months at a location here.

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:18.755 align:middle line:84%
But I'm doing seances
pretty regularly.

00:21:18.755 --> 00:21:21.047 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, now, this
isn't the proper setting.

00:21:21.047 --> 00:21:23.520 align:middle line:84%
But give me an example of how
you would set a seance up.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.400 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: How I would do a seance
is I first set the setting.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.637 align:middle line:90%
Like, we'll do sacred space.

00:21:27.637 --> 00:21:28.470 align:middle line:90%
We'll set the wards.

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:29.670 align:middle line:90%
We'll clear the energy.

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:31.870 align:middle line:84%
I'll have us go
into a meditation

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:33.840 align:middle line:84%
so that we get into
a proper mindset,

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.353 align:middle line:84%
because similarities
attract and perpetuate.

00:21:36.353 --> 00:21:37.770 align:middle line:84%
If we're in a
higher state of mind

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:39.360 align:middle line:84%
and a higher state
of being, that's

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.860 align:middle line:90%
what we're going to draw to us.

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.863 align:middle line:84%
Then I build up the
energy in the room

00:21:42.863 --> 00:21:44.280 align:middle line:84%
so that the spirits
have something

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.920 align:middle line:84%
that they can exist
in, a medium of energy

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.930 align:middle line:84%
so that they can
easily work through.

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:51.090 align:middle line:84%
I'll call in higher-level
protective beings

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:52.955 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that
everything goes smoothly.

00:21:52.955 --> 00:21:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll even
call in guides

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:57.220 align:middle line:84%
to help to facilitate
communication when need be.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll ask for the
presence of spirits to come in.

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And then as they come
in, sometimes it's

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:04.260 align:middle line:84%
like a flood of information
going on and off.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I'll get
the occasional one that

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.382 align:middle line:84%
pokes and says, hey,
I need to talk here.

00:22:08.382 --> 00:22:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And if we're doing
a group session,

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.595 align:middle line:84%
I'll bring toys, like Ouija
boards and dowsing rods

00:22:12.595 --> 00:22:13.395 align:middle line:90%
and pendulums.

00:22:13.395 --> 00:22:14.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ouija boards.

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:15.290 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Oh, yeah.

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:16.427 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, no.

00:22:16.427 --> 00:22:17.227 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:22:17.227 --> 00:22:19.738 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: [CHUCKLES]
Yeah, they're a staple.

00:22:19.738 --> 00:22:20.780 align:middle line:90%
They're kind of fun, too.

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You haven't ever been--

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:26.040 align:middle line:84%
having it backfired
with a Ouija board?

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I've never had a
seance go wrong whatsoever.

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:31.580 align:middle line:90%
It's actually been wonderful.

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Every seance has gotten so
much enlightenment, so much

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:35.570 align:middle line:90%
good emotion.

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:38.585 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes there's tears when
people reconnect and they

00:22:38.585 --> 00:22:39.710 align:middle line:90%
realize their loved one's--

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do seances have
to be in so much darkness?

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.300 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: They don't necessarily.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:45.980 align:middle line:90%
But it helps our minds.

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:48.710 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the stories
I tell about the veil.

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:51.080 align:middle line:84%
We hear so much about the
veil between the worlds.

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:54.680 align:middle line:84%
There's a veil at midnight
that opens up, or at 3:00 AM.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:57.860 align:middle line:84%
Or graveyards, the veil is the
thinnest, or certain locations.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:59.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say
there is no veil.

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.400 align:middle line:84%
But the veil is
a great metaphor.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.950 align:middle line:84%
What really it is is
our minds are tuning in

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:06.950 align:middle line:84%
to be able to be receptive
and open to picking up

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:08.870 align:middle line:90%
communication from the spirits.

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And so when we
are in a dark room

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.490 align:middle line:84%
and we get the candles going
and we have some incense,

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:16.065 align:middle line:84%
it puts our mind into an
open, receptive state.

00:23:16.065 --> 00:23:16.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: So it seems
like it's a better

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:22.280 align:middle line:84%
place for the spirits when it's
really a better place for us.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, some people
feel that spirits are here

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:25.960 align:middle line:90%
to actually help people.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:26.760 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Mhm.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's look.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.110 align:middle line:10%
Who do you help the
most, Mark, the human who

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:32.600 align:middle line:10%
wants to communicate
with the other side,

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:36.350 align:middle line:10%
or those on the other side
who need to cross over?

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:38.075 align:middle line:10%
>> MARK NELSON: I
think I help both.

00:23:38.075 --> 00:23:38.875 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Both.

00:23:38.875 --> 00:23:42.380 align:middle line:10%
>>NELSON: And the reason is
is that I get my information

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:43.850 align:middle line:10%
from people on the other side.

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:47.450 align:middle line:10%
And they are usually,
like, in a great place

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:49.430 align:middle line:10%
where they want to
communicate to their--

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:51.770 align:middle line:10%
like, this past week,
I spoke to a woman who

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:55.070 align:middle line:10%
had had her daughter, she
had taken her own life.

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:56.915 align:middle line:10%
And it put the
mother in a great--

00:23:56.915 --> 00:23:57.170 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh, God, horrible.

00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:58.500 align:middle line:10%
>> NELSON: --terrible place.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.890 align:middle line:10%
But this woman in
spirit, this young woman,

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:02.750 align:middle line:10%
was trying to tell mom, I'm OK.

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:03.710 align:middle line:10%
I'm sorry.

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:04.700 align:middle line:10%
I love you.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:05.675 align:middle line:10%
I made a mistake.

00:24:05.675 --> 00:24:06.475 align:middle line:10%
I understand.

00:24:06.475 --> 00:24:08.460 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It doesn't
justify it by any means.

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:09.377 align:middle line:10%
>> NELSON: No, no, no.

00:24:09.377 --> 00:24:12.720 align:middle line:10%
But this woman was going
through such great pain.

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.480 align:middle line:10%
And I think that
the spirit wanted

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:19.370 align:middle line:10%
to help alleviate her
mother's pain because, also,

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:22.610 align:middle line:10%
what the doctor was saying is
that many of the things that

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:25.160 align:middle line:10%
are our quirks and our
problems, that is based

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.170 align:middle line:10%
in the physical, the body.

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:28.320 align:middle line:10%
It's not our soul.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.610 align:middle line:10%
It's not our consciousness.

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:33.320 align:middle line:10%
So when we step away
from this physical being,

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:37.790 align:middle line:10%
we tend to be a little
clearer, more together

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:39.050 align:middle line:10%
version of ourselves.

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:40.820 align:middle line:10%
We don't stop being who we were.

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:45.080 align:middle line:10%
But we have less of the physical
foibles that have maybe plagued

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.040 align:middle line:10%
us or bothered us in our lives.

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So are spirits
here to help us sometimes?

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:50.450 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:52.680 align:middle line:84%
They're all around
us all the time.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time, I have to
say, the spirits around us

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.330 align:middle line:90%
are indifferent.

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:58.280 align:middle line:84%
They could care less
one way or another.

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:02.150 align:middle line:84%
But a majority of them that are
here, that interact with us,

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:03.440 align:middle line:90%
are to help us.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.630 align:middle line:84%
They want to help us go
in the right direction,

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:07.140 align:middle line:90%
do the things we need to do.

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And most of the
time, they're not

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:12.085 align:middle line:84%
going to do a single thing to
help you until you ask for it.

00:25:12.085 --> 00:25:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it
Hollywood that has

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:17.220 align:middle line:84%
made us think that they're
all scary and evil?

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And if I could do a little bit
of a soapbox on that one, yeah.

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do it.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.710 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: The Hollywood movies
have really portrayed ghosts

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:27.890 align:middle line:84%
as these scary, awful things
that are in our world,

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:29.150 align:middle line:90%
doing these terrible things.

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:30.915 align:middle line:90%
And the movies are fun.

00:25:30.915 --> 00:25:31.790 align:middle line:90%
I love watching them.

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:32.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they sell tickets.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.110 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: They sell tickets.

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.650 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:34.370 align:middle line:90%
They're great movies.

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:35.720 align:middle line:90%
They're a lot of fun to watch.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.300 align:middle line:84%
But they don't portray
what the reality

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.200 align:middle line:90%
is of the paranormal world.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And if I can poke specifically
in, say, the "Conjuring"

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:46.040 align:middle line:84%
movies, where they depict
Ed and Lorraine Warren,

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.610 align:middle line:84%
who were two real-life
paranormal investigators--

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:49.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, they were.

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:50.410 align:middle line:90%
I miss them.

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:52.850 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: But they also said
that they were demonologists.

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And I have this belief that
if you're a demonologist,

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:58.160 align:middle line:84%
everything that you're going
to encounter is a demon.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.763 align:middle line:84%
And so everything that
seemed like they encountered

00:26:00.763 --> 00:26:02.180 align:middle line:84%
and that they
depict in the movies

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:05.210 align:middle line:84%
were these demonic
forces, when that has not

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:07.385 align:middle line:90%
been my experience at all.

00:26:07.385 --> 00:26:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you attract,
though, Kaedrich, evil

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:12.860 align:middle line:90%
and demons if you want to?

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yes, we as human beings
have that creative power--

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:16.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We can do that.

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.052 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: --to draw those to us.

00:26:18.052 --> 00:26:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And there are negative beings,
negative forces out there

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.490 align:middle line:84%
that will feed off of
our homogeneous energy.

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:25.400 align:middle line:84%
So if we're already
producing that fear,

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.685 align:middle line:84%
we're already producing
that hate, that angst,

00:26:27.685 --> 00:26:29.060 align:middle line:84%
then we're going
to get something

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:31.520 align:middle line:84%
that connects with us
to help us to continue

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.690 align:middle line:90%
to produce that energy.

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:34.398 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
get fed off of that.

00:26:34.398 --> 00:26:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to do
awful things sometimes

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.670 align:middle line:90%
to perpetuate that negativity.

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ed and Lorraine
Warren, no longer with us,

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:43.160 align:middle line:84%
but they spent
their career chasing

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.000 align:middle line:90%
these kinds of entities.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:45.800 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:46.600 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: They did.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And I am going to even cast
a skeptical doubt out there,

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:53.990 align:middle line:84%
that they created them sometimes
with their own beliefs,

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:57.200 align:middle line:84%
like we talked about egregores,
that they created the situation

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.840 align:middle line:84%
and that the narratives
that they sometimes built

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:03.080 align:middle line:84%
helped to change the
situation in a person's home.

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:06.410 align:middle line:84%
For example, when I work with
somebody, most of the time

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:08.780 align:middle line:84%
I see the victim
situation going like, oh,

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:10.460 align:middle line:84%
my God, what are they
here to do to me?

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.370 align:middle line:90%
Why are they here?

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:12.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did I do?

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:12.890 align:middle line:90%
What did I do?

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:15.307 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Right, and I want to
switch that around to, OK, I

00:27:15.307 --> 00:27:16.260 align:middle line:90%
recognize you're here.

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:17.280 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you need help.

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.530 align:middle line:90%
Is there a way I can help you?

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:20.570 align:middle line:84%
So that switches from
that victim to like,

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:21.560 align:middle line:90%
oh, you're here.

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.070 align:middle line:90%
How can I help you?

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
a lot of movies

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:26.600 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of other
situations, I see

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.910 align:middle line:84%
the curiosity of like, OK,
there's something going on.

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:29.767 align:middle line:90%
What do I do?

00:27:29.767 --> 00:27:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Somebody comes into the
house, goes, it's a demon.

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:32.650 align:middle line:90%
It's an evil force.

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And then like,
[GASPS] I knew it!

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:35.510 align:middle line:90%
And then it gets worse.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:36.590 align:middle line:90%
And it gets terrible.

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's horrible, when
before it was just like, no,

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:40.910 align:middle line:90%
this is just how it is.

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why do we need sage?

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:44.180 align:middle line:90%
Why do we need holy water?

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:45.808 align:middle line:90%
What does this stuff do?

00:27:45.808 --> 00:27:47.600 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I don't like
to use those things--

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [SCOFFS]

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:49.520 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: --sage and holy water.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.520 align:middle line:84%
They're effective
for a quick clearing.

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.830 align:middle line:84%
What they do is they help
shift the energy of the house

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:56.930 align:middle line:84%
and move the energy
and the space

00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:59.040 align:middle line:84%
around it where the
spirits might be.

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:02.300 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't go back to the
source, the individuals living

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:04.980 align:middle line:84%
in the house, the people in
the home, their attitudes,

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:07.100 align:middle line:84%
their beliefs, their own
energy they're producing,

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:08.982 align:middle line:84%
it's going to bring
those things right back.

00:28:08.982 --> 00:28:10.940 align:middle line:84%
They're going to come
right back to the source.

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't people, though,
contact spirits and ghosts

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:15.090 align:middle line:90%
in different ways?

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:16.820 align:middle line:90%
It's very unusual.

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:20.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Mark explains that we all
have two psychic receptor

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:24.470 align:middle line:10%
regions in the body that can
allow us to enter into spirit

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:26.536 align:middle line:10%
communication.

00:28:26.536 --> 00:28:30.480 align:middle line:10%
>>MARK ANTHONY: I believe that
everybody is capable of spirit

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.690 align:middle line:10%
communication.

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:34.080 align:middle line:10%
In other words, not
necessarily being a medium

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.620 align:middle line:10%
but in receiving messages.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:36.420 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:39.540 align:middle line:10%
Because we all have the
same basic physiology.

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.420 align:middle line:10%
And as I explain in "The
Afterlife Frequency,"

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.430 align:middle line:10%
we have the pineal gland
and the solar plexus,

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:48.580 align:middle line:10%
which are the two receptor
areas in our body.

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And I go into great
detail explaining

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:53.910 align:middle line:84%
how they're sensitive to
electromagnetic frequency

00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:56.100 align:middle line:84%
and the types of
information that you

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:58.680 align:middle line:84%
receive through these
two different receptors.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Everybody receives
contact from spirits.

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:05.160 align:middle line:84%
It's whether or not
you're paying attention

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.350 align:middle line:84%
to it, whether or not you're
spiritually, situationally

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:09.150 align:middle line:90%
aware.

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:11.040 align:middle line:10%
That's why I developed
the RAFT technique,

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.680 align:middle line:10%
to help people recognize
signs from spirits,

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.440 align:middle line:10%
accept it as real,
feel it without fear,

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.150 align:middle line:10%
and then trust in the message.

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:20.160 align:middle line:10%
But many people negate it.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.060 align:middle line:10%
They block it.

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:23.790 align:middle line:10%
When they do that, they
create energetic blocks.

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:25.200 align:middle line:10%
And there's many
ways that people

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.850 align:middle line:10%
create an energetic block.

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:29.070 align:middle line:10%
And once you remove
that block, you

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:33.840 align:middle line:10%
will see how spirit
communication not only will

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:37.375 align:middle line:10%
be influencing your life, it
can actually change your life,

00:29:37.375 --> 00:29:38.175 align:middle line:10%
and for the better.

00:29:38.175 --> 00:29:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do people want
to contact ghosts, Kaedrich?

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:44.070 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: To know that there
is continuity of life,

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:46.680 align:middle line:84%
that the life that we
are living here now

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:49.140 align:middle line:84%
does not end with the
death of the body,

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:51.990 align:middle line:84%
that we get that confirmation
that there is something bigger,

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:54.180 align:middle line:84%
that there's something
more important to our world

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:57.520 align:middle line:84%
than just this mundane, rat
race that we live in day in, day

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.320 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.700 align:middle line:84%
We want to know that there's
something more to us.

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:03.750 align:middle line:84%
We want to know that our loved
ones continue on to exist

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:05.730 align:middle line:84%
and that we have that
potential to exist

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:08.910 align:middle line:84%
and that we can connect to
something that's bigger and has

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:11.340 align:middle line:84%
a higher perspective to
the reality and the world

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:14.550 align:middle line:84%
that we live in than what we
could see because it helps

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:17.450 align:middle line:84%
us to find our place in this
world and our path forward.

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And it helps us to be optimistic
with what the world is really

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:21.660 align:middle line:90%
about and what we can do in it.

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we want to know that
the other side truly exists?

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:27.420 align:middle line:84%
I think people want to know
there's life after death,

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:28.220 align:middle line:90%
don't they?

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I would
think most people do.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:33.093 align:middle line:84%
There are some that are
staunchly repulsed by it.

00:30:33.093 --> 00:30:35.010 align:middle line:84%
They're like, no, when
we're dead, we're dead.

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:35.400 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I'll let
them have their path.

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:40.710 align:middle line:84%
I'll let them have that, which
makes for fun in seances,

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:41.730 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.610 align:middle line:84%
I've actually had a few
seances where spirits

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:46.945 align:middle line:84%
have come through
going, you know,

00:30:46.945 --> 00:30:49.320 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think there was an
afterlife in the first place.

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm seeing a
seance from this side.

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.860 align:middle line:90%
And they're kind of amused.

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:55.318 align:middle line:84%
They're a little bit torqued
off sometimes, going, [SCOFFS]

00:30:55.318 --> 00:30:56.735 align:middle line:84%
why are you doing
this to me here?

00:30:56.735 --> 00:30:58.485 align:middle line:84%
But it's like, we're
not doing it to them.

00:30:58.485 --> 00:30:59.790 align:middle line:90%
We're all kind of cooperating.

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:01.770 align:middle line:84%
But it's fun to
see the people who

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:05.190 align:middle line:84%
didn't believe in an afterlife
existing in the afterlife,

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:07.350 align:middle line:84%
coming to a seance,
going, I didn't even

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:08.910 align:middle line:90%
know this was possible.

00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:11.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People who ask me about
the existence of the afterlife,

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:17.100 align:middle line:84%
I said, if there is one, you'll
know about it when you die.

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And they go, well,
what if there isn't?

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.450 align:middle line:90%
Then I say, who cares?

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: [CHUCKLES]

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Simple as that.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, I want to
take it a step further.

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:28.270 align:middle line:84%
What if there is a way that
you could learn to get out

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:30.370 align:middle line:84%
of your body, explore
the spiritual realm

00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:31.620 align:middle line:90%
so you can have confirmation--

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:31.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And come back.

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --come
back into your body

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.570 align:middle line:84%
so that when the moment of
death comes and your body is

00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:38.520 align:middle line:84%
no longer here,
you're ready for it.

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:39.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
know what it's like.

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:40.410 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: You know
what it's like.

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:41.410 align:middle line:90%
And you know what to do.

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:43.725 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't that what
astral projection really is?

00:31:43.725 --> 00:31:45.007 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:31:45.007 --> 00:31:46.090 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what it is.

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:48.330 align:middle line:84%
It's your chance to
explore, to practice,

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:50.208 align:middle line:84%
and to get ready so
you have confirmation

00:31:50.208 --> 00:31:52.500 align:middle line:84%
that the body and the physical
isn't all that there is.

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you afraid
of dying, Kaedrich?

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: I don't want to.

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:56.250 align:middle line:84%
I have a whole bunch
more stuff to do.

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're in
no rush to leave.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:58.890 align:middle line:90%
No rush to leave.

00:31:58.890 --> 00:31:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I'm in
no rush to leave.

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.780 align:middle line:84%
But when the moment
comes, it's going

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:03.170 align:middle line:90%
to be an ecstatic, fun trip.

00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You really think so?

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:05.310 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:06.935 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be a
heck of a good time.

00:32:06.935 --> 00:32:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will your loved
ones be there to meet you?

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yep, they're
already there.

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:11.395 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does that happen?

00:32:11.395 --> 00:32:12.395 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, oh, yeah.

00:32:12.395 --> 00:32:13.480 align:middle line:90%
You betcha.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.430 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that we
say in the English language,

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:17.638 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure it's in other
languages, too, is we say,

00:32:17.638 --> 00:32:18.790 align:middle line:90%
I was close to my father.

00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:20.140 align:middle line:90%
I was close to my brother.

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:22.012 align:middle line:90%
My mom and I were really close.

00:32:22.012 --> 00:32:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'll teach
people, when they go

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:26.012 align:middle line:84%
to do some automatic writing,
spend a moment remembering what

00:32:26.012 --> 00:32:27.802 align:middle line:84%
it's like to be
close with them, when

00:32:27.802 --> 00:32:29.260 align:middle line:84%
you had a great
time together, what

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.580 align:middle line:90%
it felt like to be with them--

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:31.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.640 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: --because when you're
feeling close to your loved

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.980 align:middle line:10%
one, they are close.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:38.560 align:middle line:90%
They're right here with you.

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Just by feeling, by connecting
and saying, hey, Mom, can

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.390 align:middle line:84%
we connect and say hi
again one more time,

00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:45.760 align:middle line:84%
and you're feeling that
closeness, she's there.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:46.820 align:middle line:90%
She really is there.

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
tell a nonbeliever?

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: I don't.

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:51.880 align:middle line:84%
I let them explore
it on their own.

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And I try to work
with things as best

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.900 align:middle line:84%
as I can from a
scientific point of view.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:59.680 align:middle line:84%
I have had some staunch atheist
nonbelievers look at my stuff

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.870 align:middle line:84%
and go, huh, some
of this makes sense.

00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:02.830 align:middle line:90%
It's cool.

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:04.930 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not in the
business of convincing--

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Convincing people.

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:06.638 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: --anybody either way.

00:33:06.638 --> 00:33:08.680 align:middle line:84%
If somebody comes to me
with a paranormal problem

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.380 align:middle line:84%
or a concern, I'm happy to
work with them on their terms,

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:14.380 align:middle line:84%
in ways that they understand
so that we can make it working

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:15.460 align:middle line:90%
for them in a good way.

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:18.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
say you're spiritual?

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:20.205 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, definitely
a spiritual person.

00:33:20.205 --> 00:33:22.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't really follow
too much of a religion.

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.892 align:middle line:84%
I've got the Norse
path that I work with.

00:33:23.892 --> 00:33:26.350 align:middle line:84%
But those are the tools and
the technology that we can use.

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you believe in a
divine intelligence, a creator?

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:30.760 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: In essence.

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:33.660 align:middle line:84%
The way I kind of see that one,
if we'll go into that one, is,

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:38.340 align:middle line:84%
to me, the darkness is like the
Kabbalistic term of ein sof,

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:40.530 align:middle line:90%
the limitless potential.

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
darkness, the substrate

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.400 align:middle line:90%
for all existence, all life.

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.320 align:middle line:84%
Everything comes
from the darkness.

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Whatever that darkness
is can condense

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:50.970 align:middle line:84%
to become consciousness
and awareness that

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:52.710 align:middle line:90%
can condense to become light.

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Then we get ein sof ohr,
the Kabbalistic term,

00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:57.250 align:middle line:90%
the limitless light.

00:33:57.250 --> 00:34:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And that light is what condenses
into spirituality, condenses

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:01.800 align:middle line:90%
into matter and form.

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.410 align:middle line:84%
But within that collective
unconscious and in that light

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:07.620 align:middle line:84%
level is the collective
unconscious of humanity.

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And the collective
unconscious of humanity

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.940 align:middle line:90%
is a powerfully creative force.

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:14.670 align:middle line:84%
It creates the reality
we exist in by the fact

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:15.630 align:middle line:90%
that we observe it.

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:17.250 align:middle line:84%
We create it through
our observation.

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:20.159 align:middle line:84%
And it creates those egregores
throughout it that we call

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:21.659 align:middle line:84%
deities, that we
can say, hey, yeah,

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:23.699 align:middle line:84%
you're the creative
force, when really,

00:34:23.699 --> 00:34:26.826 align:middle line:84%
I think it's-- my belief is that
it's all of us working together

00:34:26.826 --> 00:34:28.409 align:middle line:84%
at the unconscious
level to create it.

00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:29.969 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Reincarnation,
yes or no?

00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:31.469 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Oh, absolutely.

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:34.170 align:middle line:84%
It comes from a higher self
that exists in that weird place

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:35.590 align:middle line:90%
that we were just talking about.

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:37.860 align:middle line:84%
But it sticks out little
tendrils throughout time,

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:40.170 align:middle line:84%
says, hey, I want to be
an artist with a drinking

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:41.350 align:middle line:90%
problem in this life.

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:44.340 align:middle line:84%
But in this time, I want
to be a politician that's

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:45.389 align:middle line:90%
super successful.

00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:48.469 align:middle line:84%
And in this lifetime, I want
to be a good, caring mother.

00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:51.659 align:middle line:84%
And it's living all of those
lifetimes at the same time

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:54.822 align:middle line:84%
to get a different perspective
of what reality is, just

00:34:54.822 --> 00:34:55.739 align:middle line:90%
to see what it's like.

00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When your seances
are done, do the people--

00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:02.073 align:middle line:84%
are they in awe,
who are witnesses?

00:35:02.073 --> 00:35:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Everybody has
a different experience.

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:06.365 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes there are people
that are in tears because they

00:35:06.365 --> 00:35:07.590 align:middle line:90%
finally got to connect.

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Some people walk away going,
I don't know about that one.

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:12.615 align:middle line:84%
Other people are
like, wow, I didn't

00:35:12.615 --> 00:35:13.740 align:middle line:90%
know that we could do this.

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how about you,
the originator of the seance,

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:18.305 align:middle line:84%
do you sometimes
shake your head?

00:35:18.305 --> 00:35:19.105 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:35:19.105 --> 00:35:21.035 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "That was
a good one," right?

00:35:21.035 --> 00:35:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Sometimes I
go, that was a good one.

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I go, you know,
that could have been better.

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:28.870 align:middle line:84%
I will admit, recently
I did a two-hour seance.

00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:30.190 align:middle line:90%
For the first hour, I just--

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:30.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a long time.

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:31.900 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --felt like
I couldn't connect.

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:34.120 align:middle line:84%
It was just nothing going
on for the first hour.

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.975 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
hour, it was just like,

00:35:35.975 --> 00:35:36.850 align:middle line:90%
things were clicking.

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:39.340 align:middle line:10%
And I'm like-- but I knew
that was going to happen.

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:40.960 align:middle line:10%
My guides, the
whisperers the night

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.460 align:middle line:10%
before said, you
know, you're going

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:44.162 align:middle line:10%
to have a slow start
on seance tomorrow.

00:35:44.162 --> 00:35:46.120 align:middle line:84%
It's going to have a hard
time setting that up.

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:47.920 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, OK.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
you call yourself,

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:52.030 align:middle line:84%
if you had to give
yourself a title?

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:55.465 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: The only title I'd
really like is hierophant.

00:35:55.465 --> 00:35:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A hierophant?

00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:57.070 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: "Hierophant."

00:35:57.070 --> 00:35:58.320 align:middle line:90%
It comes from the Tarot cards.

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:01.935 align:middle line:10%
But it's a revealer of the
secret, a teacher of the occult

00:36:01.935 --> 00:36:03.310 align:middle line:10%
because I believe
we're no longer

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:06.160 align:middle line:10%
in the age of the occult.
Those ancient secrets,

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.720 align:middle line:84%
everybody is ready
to learn those.

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.700 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's ready to
ascend to a higher state.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And so it's time to bring all
of those dark secrets out,

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:14.900 align:middle line:84%
make them into the open
and available to everybody.

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:16.300 align:middle line:90%
And so that's what I teach.

>>NOORY: --fascinating
discussion.

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:23.137 align:middle line:90%
You've made me a believer--

>>OLSEN: Ah, that's great.

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:25.630 align:middle line:90%

was a believer.

But I mean, you've
just convinced me

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:31.545 align:middle line:84%
that there's really
something there.

00:36:31.545 --> 00:36:32.920 align:middle line:84%

definitely is.

world, do you believe?

Do you not believe?

00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:39.790 align:middle line:10%
One day, you'll find
out for sure, won't you?

00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:40.840 align:middle line:90%
