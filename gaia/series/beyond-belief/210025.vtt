00:00:09.277 --> 00:00:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DEBRA SILVERMAN:
I was 10 years old,

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.770 align:middle line:84%
and I saw in the cartoon
section the word astrology,

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:14.687 align:middle line:90%
and something lit up.

00:00:14.687 --> 00:00:15.645 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Really?

00:00:15.645 --> 00:00:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: I did
a session for Sting.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.952 align:middle line:84%
I ended up traveling
for a year and a half.

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:21.750 align:middle line:84%
The police reunion
tour playing mediator

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.010 align:middle line:90%
and also doing readings.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.470 align:middle line:84%
The shamanic astrologer is
asking the most important

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.250 align:middle line:90%
question, what is your purpose?

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.530 align:middle line:90%
What is your soul doing here?

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.360 align:middle line:84%
Because the shaman is
here to wake you up

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.950 align:middle line:84%
and alter your
traditional point of view.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.038 align:middle line:84%
It's not something I've
publicly said here, we go.

00:00:35.038 --> 00:00:35.955 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to disclose.

00:00:35.955 --> 00:00:36.515 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Ooh.

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:36.667 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: Yeah.

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:37.882 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Breaking
news right now.

00:00:37.882 --> 00:00:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: Right
now, ding, ding ding.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.643 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You took
a look at my chart.

00:00:40.643 --> 00:00:41.700 align:middle line:90%
Let's call it up.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.000 align:middle line:90%


00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.350 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.500 align:middle line:10%
Debra Silverman with us,
an expert astrologer,

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.430 align:middle line:10%
psychotherapist, and author
with more than 40 years

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:55.630 align:middle line:10%
of experience.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And she has taught
thousands of people

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.170 align:middle line:84%
through her online
astrology school since 2015.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.890 align:middle line:90%
Debra, welcome to the program.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:04.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: Thank you.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.140 align:middle line:90%
So glad to be here.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How did you get
involved in astrology?

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.905 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVERMAN: It was
when the first time

00:01:08.905 --> 00:01:11.500 align:middle line:10%
I was 10 years old
in the Detroit News,

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.500 align:middle line:10%
and I saw in the cartoon
section the word astrology,

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.460 align:middle line:10%
and something lit up.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Really?

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.493 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: That
was how young I was.

00:01:17.493 --> 00:01:20.410 align:middle line:84%
By the time I was 21,
I was doing charts.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.670 align:middle line:84%
It was like if you would
have put a kid by a piano who

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.920 align:middle line:90%
had never taken piano lessons,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I try, and they
fell in love with that.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.567 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: It
just came through.

00:01:26.567 --> 00:01:28.990 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a memory
that had come back to me.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.940 align:middle line:10%
And before I knew
it, self-taught.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.860 align:middle line:10%
I became a well-known
astrologer.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.090 align:middle line:10%
It's one of those deep
callings that came with me.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.305 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Did anyone else
help you and school you?

00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:38.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: I went
to graduate school.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.820 align:middle line:84%
I have a degree in
clinical psychology.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.120 align:middle line:84%
But the graduate
school is a little bit

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.640 align:middle line:84%
intimidated by the fact that
I was bringing astrology

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.510 align:middle line:90%
into all my plans.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: They don't
want to hear that.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: Those two
didn't go together,

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.970 align:middle line:84%
but what you don't know is
Carl Jung was an astrologer,

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.450 align:middle line:84%
and he was quoted to say
psychology will be a dinosaur

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.970 align:middle line:84%
science until it
includes astrology.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.310 align:middle line:84%
So he was doing it, but
he couldn't tell anyone

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.260 align:middle line:84%
because it has
such a bad stigma.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You have worked
with some interesting talent

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.550 align:middle line:90%
in your day.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.259 align:middle line:84%
Can you throw us
a couple of names?

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.059 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: Yes.

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:12.460 align:middle line:84%
So I ended up meeting Sting's
best friend unbeknownst to me.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.290 align:middle line:84%
Within two days
after doing a reading

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.060 align:middle line:84%
for him, got a phone
call from Sting,

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.470 align:middle line:90%
who had just arrived in Denver.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Was about to start his tour
with the police and said,

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.240 align:middle line:84%
you just met my best friend,
and he can't stop talking.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: And I want to read in.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: I so
then I ended up

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.890 align:middle line:84%
traveling for a year
and a half with Sting

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.098 align:middle line:84%
and the police reunion tour
playing the game of mediator

00:02:31.098 --> 00:02:32.890 align:middle line:84%
and also doing readings
for all the people.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And he became one
of my best allies.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.423 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Anybody else?

00:02:36.423 --> 00:02:37.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: Aaron
Rodgers is now,

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.382 align:middle line:84%
people are so
surprised to hear this.

00:02:39.382 --> 00:02:41.650 align:middle line:84%
The tattoo just came out
recently about astrology.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.460 align:middle line:90%
He's one of my students.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Sure.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:43.750 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.010 align:middle line:90%
And Madonna, I heard.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: And Madonna.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Is that true?

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: Yes.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's true.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't like
dropping those names,

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.870 align:middle line:90%
but I know they impress people.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:50.860 align:middle line:90%
I always thought it was funny.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.240 align:middle line:84%
I was the same
astrologer the day

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.040 align:middle line:84%
before I did all
those famous people,

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.740 align:middle line:84%
but to get endorsed by
celebrities has a lot of cloud

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.860 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well, it
helps your credibility.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.485 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: Yeah, it
gave me credibility.

00:02:59.485 --> 00:03:02.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It Just enhances
the things that you do.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.180 align:middle line:90%
What is karma mean to you?

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: Karma is
a very strange word.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.870 align:middle line:90%
You really don't know.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a logical word that's been
passed from the Eastern times,

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.740 align:middle line:84%
but in astrology,
it's very loud.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.820 align:middle line:84%
I can look at a chart and see
where your challenges will be.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.640 align:middle line:84%
The parts of your character
that over lifetimes, this

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.450 align:middle line:90%
is my theory.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure I
can validate this,

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.260 align:middle line:84%
but it's certainly been
obvious over all these years.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260 align:middle line:84%
There are certain patterns in
your behavior that repeat, that

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.247 align:middle line:84%
are annoying, that are
personality traits that

00:03:28.247 --> 00:03:30.580 align:middle line:84%
make you feel uncomfortable,
and I can look at the chart

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.160 align:middle line:84%
and call it out, and say this
is part of your character

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.300 align:middle line:90%
that's not going away.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And we can call that karma,
we can call that lessons,

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.050 align:middle line:84%
but the more that
you learn about it,

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.110 align:middle line:84%
the less that the
karma becomes difficult

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.700 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly it
becomes good karma

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.470 align:middle line:90%
because your awareness is on.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What I've always said
about karma, what goes around

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.800 align:middle line:90%
comes around.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: That's
another way of saying it.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Is that true?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: Yes.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.170 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, past lives,
Akashic Records, stories

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.360 align:middle line:84%
that have happened
before return to you.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.712 align:middle line:84%
And so you get to see
part of your behavior

00:03:57.712 --> 00:03:59.170 align:middle line:84%
that came back from
your last life.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.360 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, like for
me, for example,

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.360 align:middle line:84%
I had the good karma of knowing
astrology at a very young age.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Difficult patterns
come when you have

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.470 align:middle line:84%
really difficult
times in relationships

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.460 align:middle line:90%
or you have health issues,

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That happens.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.708 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: And it's
right in the chart.

00:04:11.708 --> 00:04:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Debra, what
is a birth chart?

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: Based on
the moment of your birth,

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.040 align:middle line:84%
the city you were born
in, and your birth date,

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.522 align:middle line:90%
we can execute a chart.

00:04:20.522 --> 00:04:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: All
important statistics?

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: Three
very important details

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.160 align:middle line:84%
that you can't make
a chart without.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.563 align:middle line:84%
And it used to be--
it took so much math.

00:04:27.563 --> 00:04:29.480 align:middle line:84%
Like it was involved,
it took hours and hours.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have a button
we push on a computer

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.187 align:middle line:90%
and there's the chart.

00:04:33.187 --> 00:04:33.987 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Amazing.

00:04:33.987 --> 00:04:36.158 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to do a
little chart reading for me

00:04:36.158 --> 00:04:37.700 align:middle line:84%
a little bit later
on in the program.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: Exactly.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.632 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you to know what
it looks like because people

00:04:40.632 --> 00:04:41.840 align:middle line:90%
have never seen their chart.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.215 align:middle line:84%
And it follows you around
throughout your whole lifetime.

00:04:44.215 --> 00:04:46.850 align:middle line:84%
It's that moment of birth
where the planets were

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.370 align:middle line:84%
that influences your
character and your karma

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.690 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of your life.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Where did
you get my data?

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: I can't tell.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.140 align:middle line:90%
It's a little secret.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.485 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Huh.

00:04:54.485 --> 00:04:54.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.205 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN:
Anyways, you can put

00:04:56.205 --> 00:04:57.690 align:middle line:90%
anyone that's famous, honestly.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Their name in, and say
what their chart is

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.030 align:middle line:84%
and it's in the archives
of the internet.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.330 align:middle line:84%
So I love doing that, meeting
someone, hearing a story,

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.980 align:middle line:84%
looking at their
chart and beginning

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.960 align:middle line:84%
to understand what
was their destiny

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.240 align:middle line:84%
and how does it show
up based on astrology.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How
important are factors

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.840 align:middle line:84%
within your life to the
astrology that is tied into it?

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Because I've always
been fascinated

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.415 align:middle line:84%
by how a planetary alignment
can affect somebody's life.

00:05:25.415 --> 00:05:26.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: Exactly.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.240 align:middle line:84%
So this is where I'm
a psychotherapist.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.440 align:middle line:84%
I have a master's in
clinical psychology.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.580 align:middle line:84%
So the part of your life that
shows up with your personality,

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.000 align:middle line:84%
and uniquely to you, is
dependent on the chart

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.060 align:middle line:90%
and how that shows up.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.360 align:middle line:84%
So there is a marriage
between the destiny

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.210 align:middle line:84%
of your lifetime, your family,
your upbringing, and then

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.500 align:middle line:90%
the chart's influence.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.592 align:middle line:84%
And that's where it
gets really interesting.

00:05:46.592 --> 00:05:47.800 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's fascinating.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: It makes
an endless fascination.

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It sounds like
you love doing what you do.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: Oh, my God.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:52.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm so in love with it.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.110 align:middle line:84%
It's almost 45 years,
and I'm still captured

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.730 align:middle line:90%
every single chart I see.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.860 align:middle line:84%
The part of it is I
came as a skeptic.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:00.760 align:middle line:90%
I was cautious.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Oh, really?

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: Because
I couldn't understand.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.650 align:middle line:90%
It made no sense.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And every single reading,
especially in graduate school

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.248 align:middle line:84%
when I would do therapy and
someone would sit with me

00:06:08.248 --> 00:06:10.510 align:middle line:84%
and tell me all the things
that were wrong with them,

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.310 align:middle line:84%
and I'd say, wait a
minute, let me explain this

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.480 align:middle line:90%
to you in a different angle.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.105 align:middle line:84%
And it would change
their point of view

00:06:15.105 --> 00:06:16.720 align:middle line:84%
completely from
judging themselves

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.280 align:middle line:90%
to understanding themselves.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.172 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What is an
old soul mean to you?

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: Can
see it in a chart.

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:23.830 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
beings, and you

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.080 align:middle line:84%
know this when you meet
someone, where they have wisdom.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Instantly.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: And you
can look in their eyes

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.200 align:middle line:84%
or you can feel it
in their energy.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.825 align:middle line:84%
And yes, you can see
it in their chart.

00:06:30.825 --> 00:06:33.260 align:middle line:84%
It simply means someone
who's done their work.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.770 align:middle line:84%
We come into this lifetime with
the weirdest personalities.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Raise your hand if
you have an ego?

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.170 align:middle line:84%
Oh, look, everyone's
raising their hand.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:40.870 align:middle line:84%
We have these weird
personalities.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.690 align:middle line:84%
The difference, though, is
who has the wherewithal,

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.270 align:middle line:84%
the wisdom, the
appetite to learn.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's an old soul who
takes difficulties, hardships,

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.620 align:middle line:84%
depression, anxiety, all these
words that are present and ask

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.440 align:middle line:84%
the question, when am I supposed
to be learning from this?

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Debra, if
reincarnation is real,

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.880 align:middle line:84%
does that mean they're all born
at the same time all the time?

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.005 align:middle line:90%
Or is it different for you?

00:07:05.005 --> 00:07:06.338 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: Definitely changes.

00:07:06.338 --> 00:07:07.810 align:middle line:90%
And there's a clue in astrology.

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:09.790 align:middle line:84%
It's called the South
node that tells me what

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.100 align:middle line:90%
your last lifetime theme was.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.320 align:middle line:84%
So there's our
indications in astrology

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.970 align:middle line:84%
that represent the past lives,
but the goal of the game

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:17.770 align:middle line:90%
is to keep moving.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.530 align:middle line:84%
So no, you don't come back
the same sign every time.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: On Gaia's
program, "Microdose,"

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:25.660 align:middle line:84%
they talk about the
purpose of reincarnation.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.170 align:middle line:10%
>> The past lives explain
something in current life

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:33.100 align:middle line:10%
because the past lives have
a direct connection to life

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:33.910 align:middle line:10%
today.

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.910 align:middle line:84%
They explained something
we're working on

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.780 align:middle line:84%
to change in life today,
which is what we call karma.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.840 align:middle line:84%
They also can explain
a relationship,

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.590 align:middle line:90%
a phobia, a physical symptom.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:51.340 align:middle line:84%
The soul is required to evolve,
and we're required to learn.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.390 align:middle line:84%
So we gather karma, and
we also gather Dharma,

00:07:55.390 --> 00:08:00.220 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we're working
on in our current life.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.920 align:middle line:84%
Karma is a free will
decision we made

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:07.570 align:middle line:84%
in a past life that perhaps
wasn't the best decision.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not a permanent
black mark on your soul,

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:13.480 align:middle line:84%
it's something you can
balance in a subsequent life.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.300 align:middle line:84%
You have a life plan,
life intentions,

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.775 align:middle line:84%
and then you basically
come in with free will.

00:08:18.775 --> 00:08:22.390 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:25.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Many humans experience
profound suffering during

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.080 align:middle line:90%
their lifetime.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.070 align:middle line:84%
So why would a soul
choose to come into body

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.470 align:middle line:90%
knowing it will be painful.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.980 align:middle line:10%
>> It's perfectly plausible
to me that from the framework

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.880 align:middle line:10%
outside of this one, we would
choose to come into it knowing

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.789 align:middle line:10%
that we were going to be having
a certain kind of suffering

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:45.790 align:middle line:10%
because we know from that
framework that it's time

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.040 align:middle line:10%
limited, that
you'll be out of it.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.380 align:middle line:10%
But then once you get
into this framework see,

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.030 align:middle line:10%
that knowledge is blocked.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:55.930 align:middle line:10%
So that you are faced there
with the raw suffering

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:58.690 align:middle line:10%
without the insight,
maybe the event

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:00.430 align:middle line:10%
that you chose it
in the first place,

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:03.040 align:middle line:10%
but also that it will be over.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Throughout many
regression therapy sessions,

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:08.920 align:middle line:84%
patients not only recall
previous human lives,

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:13.060 align:middle line:84%
but the lives of intelligent
off planet alien species.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm regressing a lot of
clients in the last 10 to 12

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.660 align:middle line:84%
years who discovered their
inner planetary souls,

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.510 align:middle line:84%
meaning they don't
regularly come here.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:25.270 align:middle line:90%
They come here on occasion.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And they come to Earth, if I
oversimplify the explanation,

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.240 align:middle line:84%
because they're highly
evolved, and they

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.240 align:middle line:84%
come from evolved,
healthy, locations.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:39.810 align:middle line:84%
They come to teach us how
to progress as humanity.

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What do you
think of that Debra?

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: I love that.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:43.960 align:middle line:90%
And I totally agree.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.840 align:middle line:84%
The reincarnation, the
evolution of a soul

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.000 align:middle line:84%
continues, and the
chart is the imprint

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.690 align:middle line:84%
or the signature of this
lifetime what you agree to do.

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:55.060 align:middle line:84%
So where you came from
and how old you are

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.390 align:middle line:84%
shows up in this life with a
specific mission and a purpose.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: If you looked at
the chart of a little baby,

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:02.960 align:middle line:84%
would you be able
to pinpoint what

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.085 align:middle line:90%
their future might be like?

00:10:04.085 --> 00:10:06.252 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: That's one of
my favorite things to do.

00:10:06.252 --> 00:10:08.780 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine if your parent
understood your character

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.897 align:middle line:84%
as a child and they directed
you to what you were built for?

00:10:11.897 --> 00:10:13.355 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Before
it even developed.

00:10:13.355 --> 00:10:13.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:13.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: Yes.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:15.577 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of my
greatest pleasures,

00:10:15.577 --> 00:10:17.458 align:middle line:90%
is giving parenting the insight.

00:10:17.458 --> 00:10:18.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Do they listen?

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.190 align:middle line:90%
The parents.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: They do.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And they say to me they listen
to the session again and again

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.445 align:middle line:84%
and re-listen to it because once
the child starts to develop,

00:10:24.445 --> 00:10:26.570 align:middle line:84%
and they realize, for
example, a child doesn't like

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:29.150 align:middle line:84%
to go to the party because
they're very water and quiet,

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:30.260 align:middle line:90%
don't push them.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Or the child who can't stop
asking questions, encourage it.

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:36.170 align:middle line:84%
So you learn the natural
tendency and you encourage it.

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:39.288 align:middle line:84%
And then the parent and
the child are in rapport.

00:10:39.288 --> 00:10:40.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: And you can see that?

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:40.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: Absolutely.

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:41.960 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: In a chart?

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: Absolutely.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:43.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: At a newborn?

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: At a newborn.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.370 align:middle line:84%
From the moment of
conception, if the-- and this

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.800 align:middle line:84%
is interesting that
every hospital you go to,

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.360 align:middle line:84%
they take a picture
of that moment.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.743 align:middle line:90%
They write down the time.

00:10:51.743 --> 00:10:52.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's incredible.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: This
is not a coincidence

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:56.960 align:middle line:84%
that across time we've
known the significance.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.120 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know it
consciously, but this has

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.620 align:middle line:90%
been carried on across time.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Is the
birth time, when

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.925 align:middle line:84%
the little child takes
its first breath,

00:11:04.925 --> 00:11:06.050 align:middle line:90%
is that how they time that?

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:06.925 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: Exactly.

00:11:06.925 --> 00:11:07.730 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:08.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That is something.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.933 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: It's fascinating
to understand that there's

00:11:10.933 --> 00:11:13.310 align:middle line:84%
a cosmic imprint that's
waiting for the parents

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:16.040 align:middle line:84%
and waiting for the person, the
child, to become themselves.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And there's all this
language and information.

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:20.393 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What is a
shamanic astrologer?

00:11:20.393 --> 00:11:22.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: So there's
a distinction between,

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:25.670 align:middle line:84%
we all must know this by now,
between the ego and the soul.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:27.533 align:middle line:84%
The ego is
traditional astrology.

00:11:27.533 --> 00:11:28.700 align:middle line:90%
Where am I going to grow up?

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:29.660 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to be?

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:30.535 align:middle line:90%
Who am I going to be?

00:11:30.535 --> 00:11:32.190 align:middle line:84%
With what's the
nature of my interest?

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:34.370 align:middle line:84%
The question from the
shamanic astrologers,

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.162 align:middle line:84%
tell me about your
soul's growth?

00:11:36.162 --> 00:11:37.370 align:middle line:90%
Just like what we just heard.

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:38.930 align:middle line:90%
How many lifetimes?

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:39.980 align:middle line:90%
What are you here to do?

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.500 align:middle line:84%
So the shamanic astrologer
is looking at what

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.250 align:middle line:90%
are the lessons this lifetime?

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:46.290 align:middle line:84%
What is your purpose
for being here?

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.790 align:middle line:84%
How can I support you to be
fully accepting of your fate?

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Because often, for the human
condition, it's so confusing

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:53.990 align:middle line:90%
and it's so troublesome.

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.030 align:middle line:84%
So the shamanic
astrologer is asking

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:59.000 align:middle line:84%
the most important question,
what is your soul doing here?

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How do you become
a shamanic astrologer?

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: I think it
comes from inheriting

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:07.220 align:middle line:84%
an old past life desire to
not just work with the surface

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.420 align:middle line:84%
level of the
superficial, the ego,

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:10.910 align:middle line:90%
but actually going deep enough.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:12.622 align:middle line:84%
And it's not something
you call yourself.

00:12:12.622 --> 00:12:13.580 align:middle line:90%
I would never say that.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:14.380 align:middle line:90%
That's a word.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.160 align:middle line:84%
It's just like it's
an inherent truth

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.140 align:middle line:84%
that I love to
work at the deepest

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:20.960 align:middle line:84%
level of the psychological
patterns that

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.090 align:middle line:84%
have been imprinted with pain,
that's the shamanic journey is.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:25.880 align:middle line:90%
How do I take you up and out.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.610 align:middle line:84%
The shaman in olden
times had skeletons

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:30.710 align:middle line:84%
and had drums and
dressed up funny,

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:32.600 align:middle line:84%
and you'd come into
their little tent

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.240 align:middle line:84%
and you'd be scared because
the shaman is here to wake

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.640 align:middle line:84%
you up out of the
illusion and alter

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.360 align:middle line:90%
your traditional point of view.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.330 align:middle line:84%
So then you shake
your head and go, oh,

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.670 align:middle line:84%
thank you for reminding
me because we forget.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.470 align:middle line:90%
We come down here with amnesia.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
chart is meant to do.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And a shamanic
astrologer reminds you,

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.592 align:middle line:84%
and then you go, oh, my
God, that's so true of me.

00:12:51.592 --> 00:12:52.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's right.

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:53.350 align:middle line:90%
There are what?

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:54.680 align:middle line:90%
12 Zodiac signs?

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: 12 Zodiac
signs, 10 planets.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:59.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: All right, and
they're all different?

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:01.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: Every single
sign has a unique flavor.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.770 align:middle line:84%
They're based on the four
elements, water, air, Earth,

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:04.570 align:middle line:90%
and fire.

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:07.370 align:middle line:84%
The oldest foundation of
all of our ancient cultures.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:10.277 align:middle line:84%
All Indigenous people
pray to four directions.

00:13:10.277 --> 00:13:12.110 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians worked
with the four elements,

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:14.750 align:middle line:84%
the Hawaiians work with
hula with the four elements.

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:17.000 align:middle line:90%
It's the oldest common truth.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.950 align:middle line:84%
Wisdom source are the
elements, and that

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:20.180 align:middle line:90%
is the source of astrology.

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Is there
a culture, Debra,

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.900 align:middle line:84%
that is more into this
than the other one?

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: Well, the Mayans
had a complete astrology system

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.680 align:middle line:90%
different than ours.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.770 align:middle line:84%
The Western astrologers, what
we work with, is one system.

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:32.810 align:middle line:84%
There's Eastern astrology,
the Vedic system.

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:35.033 align:middle line:84%
So there are so many
ancient systems.

00:13:35.033 --> 00:13:36.200 align:middle line:90%
The Jews, the ancient Jews--

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Is one
better than another?

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: There's
no way we're ever

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.788 align:middle line:84%
going to say one's
better than the other.

00:13:40.788 --> 00:13:41.900 align:middle line:90%
They all carry wisdom.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.250 align:middle line:90%
And then you pick your favorite.

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Mine, of course, is Western
astrology, and you dive in,

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:47.190 align:middle line:90%
and you stay true.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:49.460 align:middle line:90%
I honor all of the astrologers.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How did the
ancients know this?

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: It was brought to
us, and I can say this on Gaia,

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:56.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm convinced that
the intelligence that

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:00.320 align:middle line:84%
is so advanced, how could it
be possible to 4,000 years ago,

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.820 align:middle line:90%
they knew the planets?

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:02.810 align:middle line:90%
Directions?

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And they knew how to
execute the mathematics.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Without
telescopes, without anything.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: I think
it was the ETs.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.033 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
I've publicly said.

00:14:10.033 --> 00:14:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Here we go, I'm
going to disclose.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:11.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Ooh.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: Yeah.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:12.500 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Breaking
news, right now.

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:14.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: Right
now, ding, ding, ding.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.300 align:middle line:84%
There is no way we could
have known the intelligence,

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.370 align:middle line:90%
the airtight system, astrology.

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:22.402 align:middle line:84%
I came as a skeptic and was
so wanting to make it wrong,

00:14:22.402 --> 00:14:24.110 align:middle line:84%
and there hasn't been
a session I've ever

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:27.470 align:middle line:84%
sat with someone to not say
this explains everything.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So you're
saying it's possible ETs

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:32.450 align:middle line:84%
came to this
planet, and unveiled

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:36.020 align:middle line:84%
the planetary alignments
to these humans?

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: They dropped
the information as a matrix,

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:39.380 align:middle line:90%
just like the pyramids.

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.870 align:middle line:84%
There are things we can't
explain, the seven wonders.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:43.850 align:middle line:84%
There's influences that
go beyond the mind.

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:46.340 align:middle line:84%
Astrology invites you
to go beyond the mind

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:49.080 align:middle line:84%
and open up the heart and
allow the spiritual language

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:49.880 align:middle line:90%
to begin.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Kundalini
is very important.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.145 align:middle line:90%
Barbara Hand Clow.

00:14:54.145 --> 00:14:55.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: Who's
an astrologer.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: She's a
great astrologer,

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.390 align:middle line:90%
was on Gaia's "Open Minds."

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:01.370 align:middle line:90%
>> The 30s are a hard decade.

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.640 align:middle line:84%
I found that was a difficult,
it was a wonderful decade

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.430 align:middle line:84%
in that that's when I had
my beautiful son, which

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:09.920 align:middle line:84%
was the most wonderful thing
I did in this lifetime.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.630 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, I just found

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:15.560 align:middle line:84%
it a very challenging decade
in terms of navigating,

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.430 align:middle line:84%
to find out who
and what you are.

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And as I talk to people, it
seems the 30s, for many people,

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.260 align:middle line:90%
is difficult.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:22.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's also true.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:25.370 align:middle line:84%
So the first transit, that
the book is working with,

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:28.130 align:middle line:84%
the Saturn return, which
occurs for all of us

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.210 align:middle line:90%
when we're 29 to 30 years old.

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
we make a change

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.660 align:middle line:84%
in our physical matrix, which
would be jobs, or marriages,

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.190 align:middle line:90%
or having a child, or whatever.

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And if you watch people
closely, everybody

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.703 align:middle line:84%
makes a major change
at age 29 to 30.

00:15:41.703 --> 00:15:43.370 align:middle line:84%
You just can't find
anybody who doesn't.

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:44.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Right

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>> But as soon as they make
that major change and shift

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:49.430 align:middle line:84%
their reality at that
physical plane level,

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:52.220 align:middle line:84%
then they start processing
themselves emotionally.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And at this point
in time for humans,

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.530 align:middle line:84%
the most difficult part
of our learning process

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:59.120 align:middle line:90%
is definitely emotional.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So all the way through
the 30s, actually, we're

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:05.240 align:middle line:84%
having a rocky emotional
journey because when we come up

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.830 align:middle line:84%
to a midlife crisis,
then we're going

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:08.630 align:middle line:90%
to have an emotional crisis.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.610 align:middle line:84%
The issue, as I
understand it, would

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:13.910 align:middle line:84%
be that when we're ready
at a certain point, which

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:17.540 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the astrological
transits, then what can happen

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:20.840 align:middle line:84%
is this breakthrough from
higher realms of consciousness

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.730 align:middle line:84%
and higher dimensions
of consciousness

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:26.660 align:middle line:84%
can come into our
field and can influence

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:29.520 align:middle line:84%
us to go to very high
levels of consciousness.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And so when you think about
it from this perspective,

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:34.340 align:middle line:84%
and what Dr. Gerber
had to say about it,

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.470 align:middle line:84%
it's not just
Kundalini rising, it's

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.570 align:middle line:84%
also an opening to
higher dimensions.

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, in ancient
spiritual traditions,

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:43.160 align:middle line:84%
they've always
thought of Kundalini

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.770 align:middle line:84%
rising as an open to
spiritual consciousness.

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:49.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's a process of energy
just going in two directions

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.098 align:middle line:90%
from within us.

00:16:51.098 --> 00:16:52.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Debra,
I've always wondered

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:57.020 align:middle line:84%
if you had the astrological
chart of political candidates

00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:01.670 align:middle line:84%
before they were elected,
and we outlined all of them,

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:04.700 align:middle line:84%
the Democrats, or
Republican, the Libertarian,

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.530 align:middle line:84%
and just laid it
right out, but you

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:09.140 align:middle line:84%
had their charts for
each one, could you

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:13.160 align:middle line:84%
be able to predict the type
of President they might be

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.119 align:middle line:90%
or something like that?

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:14.919 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: 100%.

00:17:14.919 --> 00:17:17.089 align:middle line:84%
It's given me great
compassion, because when

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:20.060 align:middle line:84%
you see a president's chart and
you understand their character,

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.410 align:middle line:84%
from Trump to Obama, which
I've studied at length,

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:23.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Right.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:24.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: It
makes so much sense,

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.810 align:middle line:84%
and compassion becomes
part of the conversation

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:30.780 align:middle line:84%
because you see how can they
not be that particular person.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:34.920 align:middle line:84%
So the order that Obama is
the amazing communicator.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.840 align:middle line:90%
He's double air.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And the amount of fire
that Trump has that

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:40.970 align:middle line:84%
controls his ego, it's so
right there in the chart.

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:42.230 align:middle line:90%
Not making a judgment call,

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Right.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:43.895 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: But just
naming a person--

00:17:43.895 --> 00:17:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: It is what it is.

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:46.603 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: It is what it
is and the personality traits

00:17:46.603 --> 00:17:47.540 align:middle line:90%
are so obvious.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:52.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Can people change even
though their astrological chart

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:54.160 align:middle line:90%
is what it is?

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.270 align:middle line:84%
If you were to spell
out to somebody, look,

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:59.560 align:middle line:90%
you've got these traits.

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:02.500 align:middle line:84%
These things are good, but
these aren't, can they fix that?

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.625 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: Well, that's
the whole point of coming

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:06.270 align:middle line:84%
to a shamanic
astrologer, is you want

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.340 align:middle line:84%
to understand the
broken records, where

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.730 align:middle line:84%
you keep repeating yourself,
where things aren't working.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.730 align:middle line:84%
You want to understand
where your strengths are,

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.390 align:middle line:84%
where suddenly you're finding
your gifts and it's flowing.

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:16.740 align:middle line:90%
And yes, you can change it.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:17.822 align:middle line:90%
It's called awareness.

00:18:17.822 --> 00:18:19.530 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as there's
awareness, it's not

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:21.330 align:middle line:84%
like you can totally
change your stripes,

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:24.150 align:middle line:84%
but you can take the high
road or the low road.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do you
think most people are

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.057 align:middle line:84%
aware of their
pluses and minuses.

00:18:29.057 --> 00:18:31.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: It's always
funny when I do a reading

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.930 align:middle line:84%
and they go, oh, my God, she
knows me better than I do.

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:35.970 align:middle line:84%
It becomes very
obvious those traits

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:38.057 align:middle line:84%
that they came with
are going to carry on

00:18:38.057 --> 00:18:39.390 align:middle line:90%
throughout their whole lifetime.

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:39.870 align:middle line:90%
That is how--

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: They know
some of those traits.

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: And they
don't have language for it.

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:43.230 align:middle line:90%
This is the handicap.

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Without studying astrology,
you're doing your own nature.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.290 align:middle line:84%
With studying astrology,
your awareness increases,

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:51.930 align:middle line:84%
your language, and then
comes the compassion.

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:55.140 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, my dad, for example,
had no air in his chart,

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.580 align:middle line:90%
and my brother took my class.

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And all those years
he was so frustrated

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.180 align:middle line:90%
that my dad never talked.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.580 align:middle line:84%
Then he found out,
oh, he has no air.

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And that became a
doorway of compassion.

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly he
understood why it

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.590 align:middle line:84%
was he was so angry with him,
and the whole thing changed.

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's fascinating.

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:15.750 align:middle line:84%
As a psychotherapist,
as an astrologer,

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:18.370 align:middle line:90%
do you combine both abilities?

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:19.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: 100%.

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:20.220 align:middle line:90%
Just like Carl Jung.

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:23.400 align:middle line:84%
Every single chart that Carl
Jung, the original psychiatrist

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.580 align:middle line:84%
had, he worked in therapy
with the chart, same for me.

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:29.520 align:middle line:84%
So every session that I would
do when someone would start

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.140 align:middle line:84%
complaining about
their character

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.188 align:middle line:84%
or about their husband,
I'd say, excuse me,

00:19:33.188 --> 00:19:34.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to explain
to you this character.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And I've had people
come in who literally

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.150 align:middle line:84%
were on the way to
the divorce lawyer,

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:41.640 align:middle line:84%
I sit with the husband and
wife, and said, let me describe.

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And then they were
like, why are you

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.490 align:middle line:90%
trying to change this person?

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, here's the high
road of someone who doesn't

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:48.900 align:middle line:90%
talk, they're sensitive.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.530 align:middle line:84%
Or here's the high road of that
loud personality, they inspire.

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I provide a
language to create

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.588 align:middle line:84%
understanding of the very
thing that bugs you so much.

00:19:57.588 --> 00:19:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What are
the four elements?

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:00.797 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: So that's
a perfect bridge.

00:20:00.797 --> 00:20:02.970 align:middle line:84%
There's water, air,
Earth, and fire.

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:05.550 align:middle line:10%
So water is those people
that don't talk very much.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.070 align:middle line:10%
They're quiet, they're
internal, they're shy,

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:10.890 align:middle line:10%
they're vulnerable, they're
musicians, they're dancers,

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:11.718 align:middle line:10%
they're the artist.

00:20:11.718 --> 00:20:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You call
them water people?

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:14.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: Those
are water people.

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:15.412 align:middle line:90%
They're highly sensitive.

00:20:15.412 --> 00:20:17.880 align:middle line:84%
They cry very easily,
that's a clue for water.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:18.990 align:middle line:90%
Air is what you and I are.

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:21.120 align:middle line:84%
We talk, and we think,
and we communicate,

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.130 align:middle line:84%
and we read, and we ask
millions of questions.

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:24.200 align:middle line:90%
And we're air heads.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Our minds are going
at the speed of light,

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:27.510 align:middle line:84%
and we have information
all the time.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Grasping
everything we can.

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:29.775 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: So interested.

00:20:29.775 --> 00:20:32.340 align:middle line:84%
Earth people are grounded,
just as the word sounds.

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:34.320 align:middle line:84%
They're stable, they
love spreadsheets,

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.330 align:middle line:84%
they love cleaning,
they love organizing,

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:38.102 align:middle line:84%
they love to put
things into form,

00:20:38.102 --> 00:20:40.560 align:middle line:84%
and they're very controlling
because they want you to do it

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.360 align:middle line:84%
the right way, as
compared to air

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:43.960 align:middle line:84%
that said what
was the right way?

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And then last is the
fire personality,

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:49.200 align:middle line:84%
super bold, super
enthusiastic, the athletes.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.030 align:middle line:84%
They're very driven,
and they love

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.530 align:middle line:84%
to show up and show
off because when

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:53.880 align:middle line:90%
you see a fire what do you do?

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.580 align:middle line:84%
You stop and stare, and
they go, how do I look?

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:58.230 align:middle line:84%
So there's four
different elements.

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:01.140 align:middle line:84%
The water person would hate
to have you looking at them,

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:03.630 align:middle line:84%
the fire person loves it,
that's the distinction.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: With 12 Zodiac
signs and only four elements,

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.430 align:middle line:90%
there's an overlap somewhere.

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:10.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: Good catch.

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:13.540 align:middle line:84%
So there's three for each one,
and they are distinct universe,

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.330 align:middle line:84%
like you can really talk about
the Gemini who loves to talk,

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:17.800 align:middle line:84%
as distinct from
the Aquarius who

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.180 align:middle line:90%
loves to go off into science.

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:20.950 align:middle line:84%
There's distinctions
in each element.

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Interesting.

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:24.890 align:middle line:84%
You took a look at my
chart, let's call it up.

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:26.860 align:middle line:90%
Let's call up George's chart.

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And up in the left
hand corner, you

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.443 align:middle line:84%
can see my birth
date June 4th, 1950.

00:21:33.443 --> 00:21:34.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: The time.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: The time I was born,

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:37.015 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: And the place.

00:21:37.015 --> 00:21:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: 10:33 AM
in Detroit, Michigan.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: And on
the right, the chart--

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:42.430 align:middle line:84%
so in the category
of the elements,

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:43.970 align:middle line:90%
you have that big triangle.

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:44.770 align:middle line:90%
Can you see that?

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:45.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Yes.

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: So the sun is the
circle in the dot at the top.

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.410 align:middle line:84%
The moon looks like the moon
over there to the right,

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:52.060 align:middle line:84%
and then down in the
bottom is Neptune.

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:55.220 align:middle line:84%
That's called a grand trine in
air, and I just described air.

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.940 align:middle line:84%
So now I can say to you
your strong element is air.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And guess what air is, the
communicator, the networker,

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.340 align:middle line:84%
the interviewer,
the curious one.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Your chart was built for
the job that you have.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:06.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Interesting.

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:09.060 align:middle line:84%
I was already determined
what I was going to be.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: And so
you interviewed people

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:12.400 align:middle line:84%
and you asked
questions, and I know

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.680 align:middle line:84%
that at 21, I was listening
to one of your interviews.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.770 align:middle line:84%
You started your first interview
in astrology every seven years

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:19.030 align:middle line:90%
after 21.

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:20.920 align:middle line:84%
She was just speaking
to Saturn return.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:24.400 align:middle line:84%
You enter your destiny
somewhere about 21, you find it,

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.800 align:middle line:90%
by 28 to 29, it shows up.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.840 align:middle line:84%
So everyone goes
through these cycles.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And yours is all
about air and thinking

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:33.580 align:middle line:84%
and talking and communicating,
and look, here you are.

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:36.628 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Is there anything
there that scares you?

00:22:36.628 --> 00:22:38.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: I would say that
if there's anything scary

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.810 align:middle line:84%
is part of you need
a lot of attention.

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:42.625 align:middle line:84%
You do have Leo
rising, so there's--

00:22:42.625 --> 00:22:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But I'm not
a braggadocious person.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: No, you're
not a braggadocious person.

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I've
never needed that.

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: No, but you
seem to be in a position

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:49.422 align:middle line:90%
where you're drawing attention.

00:22:49.422 --> 00:22:50.900 align:middle line:84%
It's not a bad--
this is my point.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:54.250 align:middle line:84%
So you have a gift of being
able to perform, Leo rising.

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:55.750 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't
come with your ego,

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:58.480 align:middle line:84%
and that's the distinction
of the low road is ego.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.550 align:middle line:84%
The high road is I'm
just sharing my radiance,

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:03.230 align:middle line:90%
my love for communicating.

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: If I used
my ego, would it

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:08.800 align:middle line:84%
make me a different
kind of person?

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: It would make
you much bolder, and much more

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:12.820 align:middle line:90%
demanding.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.940 align:middle line:84%
So the ego is hungry,
it's starving.

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And maybe
obnoxious, who knows.

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:17.107 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: And
obnoxious, right.

00:23:17.107 --> 00:23:18.880 align:middle line:90%
The ego starves for attention.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.670 align:middle line:90%
It has a neediness.

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:22.770 align:middle line:90%
It's always hungry for--

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:26.250 align:middle line:84%
and the soul on the other hand,
is the part that wants to give.

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is really the
dance of astrology.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:31.140 align:middle line:84%
How do I blend my
ego in my soul?

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:33.660 align:middle line:84%
The need I have to be
human and the need I

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:34.950 align:middle line:90%
have to be spiritual.

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:37.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Debra, is any
of this therapeutic?

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: Well, as a
psychotherapist, all of it

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:42.130 align:middle line:84%
is because every
session that I do,

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.190 align:middle line:84%
I get to help people fall
in love with themselves

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:45.370 align:middle line:90%
right in front of me.

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:47.130 align:middle line:84%
I've had someone
call me once and say,

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:48.900 align:middle line:84%
after I finished the
first man session,

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.360 align:middle line:84%
his wife called and she said,
I think you knew him better

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.460 align:middle line:84%
than we do, can we have
a session together?

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
therapeutic tool.

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:59.400 align:middle line:84%
I get to show someone who
they are in a lens of love,

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.103 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly, they
see themselves as

00:24:01.103 --> 00:24:03.520 align:middle line:84%
though they had never seen
that part of themselves before.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.100 align:middle line:90%
So great example is you.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:08.670 align:middle line:84%
At worst, your
communication would be--

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:11.520 align:middle line:84%
to some people, he's
always asking questions.

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.718 align:middle line:84%
But the high road is, yeah,
that was his function.

00:24:13.718 --> 00:24:14.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: I want answers.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.177 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: I
want to understand.

00:24:16.177 --> 00:24:18.570 align:middle line:84%
My appetite to learn
never stops at George.

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Matias De Stefano
on the Gaia program initiation

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:25.530 align:middle line:84%
also talked about similar
things about building

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:27.180 align:middle line:90%
blocks of reality.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>> As I said before, the main
structures that were created

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:35.370 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, the main beings
that created everyone else

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:39.660 align:middle line:84%
after them were the species of
Earth, fire, water, and air.

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And these four
beings are related

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:45.900 align:middle line:84%
to the construction
of every reality

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.300 align:middle line:84%
through the mineral
world, the water,

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:52.540 align:middle line:84%
and the aspects of the
light and aspects of gases.

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:57.900 align:middle line:84%
So every being that we're
evolving from those four

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:02.670 align:middle line:84%
statements, the four
pillars of the reality,

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:06.570 align:middle line:84%
where the projection, the
physical projection of the time

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:08.890 align:middle line:90%
in the other dimensions.

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:12.390 align:middle line:10%
So while for the
spirit, the process

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:18.660 align:middle line:10%
means expressed, experiment,
integrate, and transcend,

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:22.590 align:middle line:10%
for us in the matter, we will
relate these four statements

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:29.550 align:middle line:10%
of the spirit like the water,
the Earth, the fire, and air.

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:33.210 align:middle line:10%
So this four aspects
in the physical world

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:35.070 align:middle line:10%
are the ones that
helps us to understand

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:36.700 align:middle line:10%
the concepts of the divine.

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:39.300 align:middle line:10%
So each one of them,
the four of them,

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:42.330 align:middle line:10%
has a process itself
to be accomplished

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:47.310 align:middle line:10%
in order for a being to evolve
from the matter to the divine.

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:50.220 align:middle line:84%
This process brings
us to understand

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:54.570 align:middle line:84%
that from the very deep reality,
the beings in the material

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:59.910 align:middle line:84%
world has to look to
the stars and to reach

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:05.220 align:middle line:84%
the pattern of the divine from
the very darkness to the light.

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And that process of growth
is different in every planet,

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:13.782 align:middle line:84%
but the meaning and the
concept is almost the same.

00:26:13.782 --> 00:26:15.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What do
you think of him?

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.907 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: That was
a little abstract.

00:26:16.907 --> 00:26:18.280 align:middle line:90%
I like to speak super simple.

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:19.530 align:middle line:90%
So here's how it works for me.

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: All right, good.

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: Water is
the emotional realm.

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:24.600 align:middle line:84%
It's the ability for
us to really care.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And we can get too sensitive,
or we can be very compassionate.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Air is the ability
to communicate.

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:33.240 align:middle line:84%
We can talk straight and be
very honest and transparent,

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.610 align:middle line:84%
or we can talk in
circles and get confused.

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Earth is the part of us that
wants to ground and fulfill

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:41.010 align:middle line:84%
our purpose here and
be detail oriented,

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:44.460 align:middle line:84%
or it gets controlling, and
it gets caught with I'm not

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:45.750 align:middle line:90%
good enough, I should.

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And it gets caught
in a negativity.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And then last, fire,
is our heartbeat.

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:51.540 align:middle line:84%
We can't live without
any of these elements.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:53.850 align:middle line:84%
Fire is the joy,
makes me just excited

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:56.640 align:middle line:84%
listening to all these people
talk about their spirituality,

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.190 align:middle line:84%
and that's fire, the
joy and the exuberance.

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:01.410 align:middle line:84%
So there's a
necessary relationship

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:02.400 align:middle line:90%
with all four elements.

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.060 align:middle line:84%
You can't live without water,
can't live without air,

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:06.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: No, you can't.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:08.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: Can't live without
Earth, can't live without fire.

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:09.930 align:middle line:84%
So these elements,
in my language,

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:11.490 align:middle line:90%
are really psychological.

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And the more that you
understand the balance

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.860 align:middle line:84%
of four wheels in a car,
if one of them goes down,

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:19.020 align:middle line:84%
of those four elements,
the system breaks.

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:22.650 align:middle line:10%
So all my life's work is
turning people's observer

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:25.240 align:middle line:10%
on to realize, well,
which of my elements.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.240 align:middle line:10%
This is the book I wrote,
"The missing element."

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.575 align:middle line:10%
Which of my elements
is off center so

00:27:29.575 --> 00:27:31.200 align:middle line:10%
that I can live a
life that's balanced?

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.700 align:middle line:90%
That's my whole life's work.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Debra,
when astrologers

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:38.490 align:middle line:84%
talk about mercury retrograde,
what does that mean?

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: It's
actually reality

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:42.270 align:middle line:84%
that when looking
from Earth, mercury

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:44.130 align:middle line:90%
appears to be going backwards.

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And it simply means that
the physical reality

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:48.900 align:middle line:84%
of communicating and
computers and airplanes

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.280 align:middle line:84%
are going to
slightly be altered.

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.930 align:middle line:84%
I used to try to
pretend because I'm so

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:53.680 align:middle line:90%
practical that it wasn't true.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.250 align:middle line:84%
It sounded like a theory,
but if you pay attention,

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:58.303 align:middle line:84%
it's really true, that
during mercury retrograde,

00:27:58.303 --> 00:27:59.220 align:middle line:90%
there's more glitches.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:01.050 align:middle line:84%
It's simply that there's
an energetic going

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:03.000 align:middle line:84%
in the opposite
direction of the Earth.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.250 align:middle line:84%
it's, they say it's like
when two trains are traveling

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:07.490 align:middle line:84%
together, and at the
same speed, suddenly one

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:09.335 align:middle line:84%
looks like it's going
backwards, and that's

00:28:09.335 --> 00:28:10.460 align:middle line:90%
what mercury retrograde is.

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:14.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Have you ever had
any surprises in astrology?

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: It's
constantly surprising me.

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:17.810 align:middle line:90%
I am never ever--

00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So you're
learning new things?

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:21.455 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: Every single chart
that I do, every reading that I

00:28:21.455 --> 00:28:22.520 align:middle line:90%
do is an individual soul.

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.880 align:middle line:84%
It's shocking to think
there's 8 billion people here,

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.190 align:middle line:84%
and even identical
twins aren't the same.

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And all of them carry
karma, destiny, purpose,

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:32.450 align:middle line:90%
that's unique to their soul.

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:34.890 align:middle line:84%
So every single
session I do, I'm like,

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:37.910 align:middle line:84%
did that really just appear
in a completely unique way.

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And, yes, and that's what
keeps my fascination.

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:41.473 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I had a
palm reader on Coast

00:28:41.473 --> 00:28:44.090 align:middle line:84%
to Coast a couple of
weeks ago and asked them

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:45.890 align:middle line:90%
about identical twins.

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And I said, are there palm
prints and fingerprints

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:49.730 align:middle line:90%
the same?

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:53.090 align:middle line:84%
If they're identical twins,
you would think they would be.

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:54.300 align:middle line:90%
He said, no, they're not.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:55.100 align:middle line:90%
They're different.

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:55.975 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: Exactly.

00:28:55.975 --> 00:28:57.560 align:middle line:84%
Every single soul,
isn't that amazing

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.102 align:middle line:84%
when you think about
it, that there's

00:28:59.102 --> 00:29:02.370 align:middle line:84%
8 billion people here in every
soul is volunteer to come here.

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:04.160 align:middle line:90%
No one got pushed on the bus.

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.470 align:middle line:84%
We came with a chart, with
a destiny and a purpose.

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And my job, as
the astrologer, is

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:11.000 align:middle line:84%
to help you remember
what did you come to do.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And usually, like
you, it's already

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:14.600 align:middle line:90%
occurred as you would expect.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:14.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Right.

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: But
to put words to it

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:19.950 align:middle line:84%
and to articulate the timing,
astrology is all about timing.

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:22.370 align:middle line:84%
So we can see like when
will the season change,

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:25.190 align:middle line:84%
when will your life change,
when will Saturn return come,

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:27.770 align:middle line:84%
when will Uranus
opposite Uranus happen.

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:31.460 align:middle line:84%
These are eras in life that
I can predict with confidence

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:33.020 align:middle line:90%
that will describe change.

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:35.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Has astrology
surprised you ever?

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: I'm
constantly in awe.

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:38.420 align:middle line:90%
It's never ending.

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so excited
that you're opening

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:42.770 align:middle line:84%
your another doorway
with my language

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:48.450 align:middle line:84%
because my simple surprise is it
never stops informing the soul.

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Never.

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: Never.

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's never
ever ending for me.

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:54.530 align:middle line:84%
After 45 years, I'm
still just as fascinated

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:55.700 align:middle line:90%
as I was when I started.

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Where do
you see astrology

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.860 align:middle line:90%
going in the next 25 years?

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.275 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: Well, if you
notice on all social media,

00:30:01.275 --> 00:30:02.900 align:middle line:84%
there's such a
popularity because we've

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:04.027 align:middle line:90%
entered the Aquarian Age.

00:30:04.027 --> 00:30:05.360 align:middle line:90%
You've probably heard that term.

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Yes.

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:07.202 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: There
was a woman called

00:30:07.202 --> 00:30:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Alice Bayley, who wrote
in the early 1900s, who

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:10.857 align:middle line:90%
wrote 19 books.

00:30:10.857 --> 00:30:12.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
know her work, But she--

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:13.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: 19.

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: She was
downloaded through a man called

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Djwal Khul that was
channeled through her

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:21.110 align:middle line:84%
and she called out that there
would be this change called

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:23.090 align:middle line:84%
the Aquarian Age,
where we would make

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:24.770 align:middle line:84%
a decision as a
collective, will we

00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:26.660 align:middle line:84%
make it through this
threshold because we're

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:28.820 align:middle line:84%
at a critical moment when
there's this many people

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:32.240 align:middle line:84%
and there's this much ecological
trauma that is occurring.

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.540 align:middle line:84%
The question has to be as the
astrologer, will we survive?

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And what will it take
for me as an individual

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.670 align:middle line:84%
to show up with my highest
self, my best version,

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:42.682 align:middle line:84%
so I can facilitate the
transition we're in.

00:30:42.682 --> 00:30:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What would you say
is the most heartwarming thing

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:46.700 align:middle line:90%
you've done with astrology?

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:48.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: I've watched
people fall in love.

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:51.450 align:middle line:84%
I've watched people
understand their children.

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:53.360 align:middle line:84%
I think the greatest
gift is watching someone

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.980 align:middle line:84%
who doesn't really
like their job,

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:56.480 align:middle line:84%
and I give them
back to themselves

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.188 align:middle line:84%
and they find what
they really want to do

00:30:58.188 --> 00:31:00.410 align:middle line:84%
and their life force comes
back, their enthusiasm

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:03.020 align:middle line:84%
comes back, because people in
the wrong spot doing something

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:05.420 align:middle line:84%
against their chart
is very disheartening.

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:07.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Why do people
need an astrologer

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:10.205 align:middle line:84%
to decide what their
career should be like?

00:31:10.205 --> 00:31:11.330 align:middle line:90%
Or relationships should be?

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:12.872 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: We
conform all the time.

00:31:12.872 --> 00:31:14.960 align:middle line:84%
We try to pretend that
we want people to like us

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:18.513 align:middle line:84%
and we do what our parents
expected or society demanded.

00:31:18.513 --> 00:31:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden, you
get true to your own nature,

00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:23.745 align:middle line:84%
and you find your own rhythm
and your own authenticity.

00:31:23.745 --> 00:31:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing
you know your energy

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:27.440 align:middle line:84%
comes back, you
find your calling,

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.700 align:middle line:90%
and you fulfill your purpose.

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:30.117 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why
else anyone would

00:31:30.117 --> 00:31:32.630 align:middle line:84%
come to Earth if they didn't
want to fulfill their purpose.

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:34.422 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Is there
anything about astrology

00:31:34.422 --> 00:31:35.810 align:middle line:90%
that has scared you?

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:37.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: I think the
problem with astrologers

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:39.260 align:middle line:90%
is they talk in jargon.

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of time when
you listen to them

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.430 align:middle line:84%
or you go into it, there's
a lot of prediction,

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:46.130 align:middle line:84%
and people say things like,
oh, this is a scary chart.

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:46.970 align:middle line:90%
That is not true.

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:49.350 align:middle line:84%
God did not make a
mistake when she made you.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:51.920 align:middle line:84%
That was a perfect moment,
and there was a purpose to it.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And seeing through the eyes of
love, it becomes so healing.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.180 align:middle line:90%
So I don't find it scary.

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:59.060 align:middle line:84%
What I find scary is all the
jargon, and the confusion,

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:00.770 align:middle line:90%
and the amount of words.

00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:03.440 align:middle line:84%
I like when astrology
comes down to ground level,

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.930 align:middle line:84%
and it's practical, and
there's really an application

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:08.013 align:middle line:84%
that you can see, and it
changes people's lives.

00:32:08.013 --> 00:32:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I know when
I have astrologers

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:13.910 align:middle line:84%
on "Coast to Coast," my radio
show, and we take phone calls,

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:15.860 align:middle line:90%
every line is lit.

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:19.132 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as one person gets
off, that other line is lit.

00:32:19.132 --> 00:32:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: And do
you know why that is?

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Because it's in the
chambers of our mind,

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:25.760 align:middle line:84%
the memory of our
zeitgeist is we all

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:27.920 align:middle line:84%
know that there was
something handed to us

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:30.140 align:middle line:84%
that's ancient and
timeless and stable.

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:31.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: In all ages.

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:33.482 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: And my grandmother
knew what sign she was.

00:32:33.482 --> 00:32:34.980 align:middle line:84%
This has been
carried across time.

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And so while the new age has
brought so many other doorways,

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:41.880 align:middle line:84%
astrology is one of the oldest,
simplest, and consistent.

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.820 align:middle line:84%
We know the sun's
coming up tomorrow.

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.590 align:middle line:84%
We know the moon is
coming out tonight,

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:49.460 align:middle line:84%
and we know the exact degree
brought to us by the Egyptians

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.020 align:middle line:90%
4,000 years ago.

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:52.663 align:middle line:90%
Is that shocking?

00:32:52.663 --> 00:32:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Not only
is it shocking,

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:57.933 align:middle line:84%
but what is the birth time
have to do with astrology?

00:32:57.933 --> 00:32:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: Great question.

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:02.360 align:middle line:84%
So at the moment of your birth,
we know where the planet--

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.560 align:middle line:90%
it's like a snapshot.

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And depending on exactly where
the physician, so, for example,

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:07.750 align:middle line:90%
you're Leo rising.

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:10.180 align:middle line:84%
That was determined by
your moment of birth.

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:12.550 align:middle line:84%
All the planets we know
that day where they'll be,

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:14.560 align:middle line:84%
but where in the sky
are they, and that's

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:16.600 align:middle line:84%
required to know
the time, the city.

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:17.770 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's very accurate.

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:18.760 align:middle line:90%
It's a science.

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.502 align:middle line:90%
The oldest science on Earth.

00:33:20.502 --> 00:33:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: It really is.

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at Matias, again,

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:26.680 align:middle line:84%
as he's going to talk
about the cosmic clock.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>> It was also a
clock to understand.

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:32.650 align:middle line:84%
It was not just
for individuals, it

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:36.100 align:middle line:84%
was for the whole planet
that helps us to understand

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:40.640 align:middle line:84%
that the process in daily life
that we have from being born,

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:44.800 align:middle line:84%
grow, and then die, was the
three processes that we also,

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:50.570 align:middle line:84%
as civilizations, as material
realities, we also live.

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:53.630 align:middle line:84%
That helps us to
understand that there

00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:57.740 align:middle line:84%
is a rise of an
empire at the moment

00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:02.150 align:middle line:84%
that the empire reached the
highest point of information

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:05.630 align:middle line:84%
and rule, and then there
is the fall of an empire.

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:09.260 align:middle line:84%
So everyone in the
history of humanity

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:12.560 align:middle line:84%
knew that through
this clock, we could

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:19.010 align:middle line:84%
understand the processes in
which we would rise and fall.

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:23.150 align:middle line:84%
That helps us know that whatever
is going to happen in history,

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:25.880 align:middle line:84%
it will be related to the
portals and the concepts

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.489 align:middle line:90%
of the divine in the skies.

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:30.620 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible
for a civilization

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:33.679 align:middle line:84%
to keep going exactly
the same always

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:37.440 align:middle line:84%
because you need to go through
the 12 phases of reality.

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:40.580 align:middle line:84%
So this big clock is
helping us to understand

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:45.440 align:middle line:84%
that no matter what we do, after
2000 years, our civilization

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.900 align:middle line:84%
and the idea of this
civilization will change,

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:51.739 align:middle line:84%
will die, and another
one will born.

00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:54.920 align:middle line:84%
This is also the idea,
not only for humans

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.290 align:middle line:84%
and the planets in
the physical shape

00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:59.840 align:middle line:84%
to understand that
everything in the universe

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.010 align:middle line:90%
is bounded by time.

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:07.710 align:middle line:84%
So everything that is happening
in our physical realities,

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:11.030 align:middle line:84%
and in our energetic realities
through time and space,

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:14.180 align:middle line:84%
are just the clock that
the spiritual mind has

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:18.800 align:middle line:84%
to understand when is the time
to be body, when is the time

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:21.260 align:middle line:84%
to be soul, when is
the time to be spirit,

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:24.560 align:middle line:84%
and how the three of them
in the four realities

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.990 align:middle line:84%
can help us to
understand the self,

00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:30.620 align:middle line:90%
and what are we capable of.

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Debra, is
astrology a science?

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: It is.

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:38.660 align:middle line:84%
It's all based on numbers,
actual time of you were born,

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:42.080 align:middle line:84%
the birth date, everything
is very, very detailed.

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: If people
want readings from you,

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:45.030 align:middle line:90%
how do they find you?

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: I have 20
astrologers that I've trained,

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:48.890 align:middle line:90%
certified astrologers.

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:49.220 align:middle line:90%
I have--

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:49.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: 20 astrologers?

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:50.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: Yes.

00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:52.950 align:middle line:84%
That have been really
rigorously trained.

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:54.682 align:middle line:84%
I have a school, where
I teach people how

00:35:54.682 --> 00:35:55.890 align:middle line:90%
to do this and make a career.

00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It's taught
thousands already.

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: And it's
my greatest passion

00:35:58.220 --> 00:35:59.637 align:middle line:84%
to watch someone
that doesn't even

00:35:59.637 --> 00:36:02.100 align:middle line:84%
believe to start with
watch them take level one

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:04.100 align:middle line:84%
and fall in love with
themselves, take level two

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.475 align:middle line:84%
and learn how to
execute a chart,

00:36:05.475 --> 00:36:07.908 align:middle line:84%
and level three where
they start doing readings.

00:36:07.908 --> 00:36:09.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: How do they find you?

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.492 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVERMAN: They just go to
Deborah Solomon astrology.

00:36:11.492 --> 00:36:12.350 align:middle line:10%
I have a website.

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:13.460 align:middle line:10%
I have an Instagram.

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:14.310 align:middle line:10%
I have a Facebook.

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:15.110 align:middle line:10%
I have a YouTube.

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:18.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm a social media phenomenon
because I'm older than I look,

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:21.020 align:middle line:84%
and I've been in this
world for so many years.

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized, wow,
the Aquarian Age has arrived.

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.910 align:middle line:84%
We've got the internet
to communicate in ways

00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:27.050 align:middle line:90%
that we never had before.

00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:29.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You're 23 years old,
when did you start doing this?

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.262 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: Yeah, you
haven't seen my chart yet.

00:36:31.262 --> 00:36:32.210 align:middle line:90%
Not far off from you.

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:35.210 align:middle line:84%
I have definitely aged well
because I figured out the four

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:38.150 align:middle line:84%
elements, and I'm in love
with this experience here.

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's so wonderful at
Gaia to see how much you're

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:43.405 align:middle line:84%
tickling and inspiring people
to think and open their mind

00:36:43.405 --> 00:36:45.530 align:middle line:84%
because that's what's
required to make it through--

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:48.118 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Oh, this
company loves the area

00:36:48.118 --> 00:36:49.160 align:middle line:90%
we've been talking about.

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.480 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVERMAN: I know,
and it's necessary

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:52.370 align:middle line:10%
because as we get
through this threshold,

00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:55.040 align:middle line:10%
as the planet moves into
this very strong cycle,

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.903 align:middle line:10%
it's called Pluto
return in America,

00:36:56.903 --> 00:36:58.070 align:middle line:10%
what he was just describing.

00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:02.030 align:middle line:10%
Every 240 years, a civilization
goes up, and it goes down.

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And when Pluto returns,
there's a death.

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's not to be mistaken
with something's wrong.

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:08.750 align:middle line:84%
It's to be understood,
as an astrologer,

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:10.710 align:middle line:90%
that timing is everything.

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And once you're in the
flow, and you're conscious,

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.950 align:middle line:84%
and you're observers on, and
you're aware of the cycles,

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:17.135 align:middle line:90%
you're not scared anymore.

00:37:17.135 --> 00:37:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But we have
had good times in life,

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:20.480 align:middle line:90%
we've had bad times in life.

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: There's
life and there's death.

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:23.570 align:middle line:84%
There's aging and there's
youth, and I'm really

00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:24.920 align:middle line:90%
enjoying the whole thing.

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:27.093 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Don't point at
me when you say aging.

00:37:27.093 --> 00:37:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVERMAN: I'm aging, too.

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:29.120 align:middle line:90%
You just can't tell.

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:31.460 align:middle line:84%
The truth is everything
moves in cycles.

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And astrology is
all about timing.

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And when you understand
that time goes on forever

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.180 align:middle line:84%
in every direction,
and that there's

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:41.850 align:middle line:84%
ETs or higher intelligence
watching us, it's not so scary.

00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:44.248 align:middle line:84%
We just can't understand
it because we can't see it.

00:37:44.248 --> 00:37:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's the value
of studying astrology.

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:49.190 align:middle line:84%
It's very comforting to
know that we can totally

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:51.770 align:middle line:84%
trust where those planets
are, they're consistent,

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:54.110 align:middle line:84%
they're stable, and
they are not changing.

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:56.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Debra, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:58.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVERMAN: That's
been my pleasure.

00:37:58.050 --> 00:38:01.460 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE: I'm a Gemini,
planetary alignments decided

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:05.010 align:middle line:10%
a long time ago that I'd
be doing this program,

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:08.380 align:middle line:10%
and I'm glad I'm with
you on "Beyond Belief."

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:13.000 align:middle line:90%
