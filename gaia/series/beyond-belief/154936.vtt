00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.570 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory with our
special guest, John Desouza.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.470 align:middle line:84%
John, of course, is a special
FBI agent, retired now,

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.530 align:middle line:84%
who has dealt with terrorism
and violent crimes.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.460 align:middle line:10%
He has turned that entire
career into investigating

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.010 align:middle line:10%
UFOs and special cases.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.480 align:middle line:10%
John, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.020 align:middle line:10%
>>JOHN DESOUZA:
Thank you, George.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.950 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be here with you.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How have you
made that transition

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.950 align:middle line:84%
from being an FBI special
agent into investigating

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.530 align:middle line:90%
UFOs and abduction cases?

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Well, George, I
didn't come to the paranormal

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.460 align:middle line:84%
while I was in the FBI
for the first time.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.770 align:middle line:84%
I had paranormal
experiences long

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.780 align:middle line:90%
before I became an FBI agent.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.690 align:middle line:84%
It's actually what
awoke in me the desire

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.379 align:middle line:84%
to become an
investigator-- well,

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.440 align:middle line:84%
that I had to become
an investigator

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.350 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately led me to
be an FBI special agent.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When your left
the FBI and then started

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.350 align:middle line:84%
concentrating on UFOs
and cases like that,

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.104 align:middle line:84%
did your friends and peers
go, John, what are you doing?

00:01:19.104 --> 00:01:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Well,
some of them did.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.320 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.100 align:middle line:90%
Some of them did--

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.960 align:middle line:84%
sometimes ridiculed in public
but consulted in private.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.900 align:middle line:84%
So there were FBI agents
who just didn't understand

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.490 align:middle line:84%
what I was doing or who actually
did make fun of me at times.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.700 align:middle line:84%
But during private
moments, they would

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.040 align:middle line:84%
ask me their most burning
paranormal questions

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.840 align:middle line:90%
and desires.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.860 align:middle line:90%
And they wanted to know.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you the
real-life "X-Files" guy?

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.000 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: I feel like I am.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.290 align:middle line:10%
During the '90s, I had a great
affinity for the show "The

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.090 align:middle line:10%
X-Files"--

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.260 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yes, with
Chris Carter--

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.468 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: With Chris Carter.

00:01:56.468 --> 00:01:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
minor scandal that

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.260 align:middle line:84%
went on as some of
the bosses at the FBI

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.400 align:middle line:84%
noticed that some
of the plots that

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.780 align:middle line:84%
were being used in that show
appeared kind of familiar

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.580 align:middle line:90%
to them--

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha--

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Appeared very
close to some of the cases

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.700 align:middle line:90%
that I worked, I believe.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And they ultimately questioned
Chris Carter about that.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.560 align:middle line:90%
And they asked him.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.720 align:middle line:90%
And I was also questioned.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.280 align:middle line:84%
I was asked if I was giving
Chris Carter any information.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.159 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Were you?

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.200 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: No, I was not.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to tell
them that I wasn't.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And however, Chris Carter
said to them, well,

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.460 align:middle line:84%
if you tell me specifically
what cases you're talking about,

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.230 align:middle line:84%
we can check and
see what's going on.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.570 align:middle line:90%
And that's when they kind of--

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They probably
gave him more information

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.865 align:middle line:90%
than he even had.

00:02:41.865 --> 00:02:43.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Well, that's
why they stopped.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.100 align:middle line:90%
That's why they stopped.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were feeding
him, and he didn't even--

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.570 align:middle line:84%
They stopped asking, and
they told him, it's fine.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:50.850 align:middle line:90%
And I was told, it's fine.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.890 align:middle line:84%
You can just go ahead
with what you're doing.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And Chris Carter said he felt
like they could shut him down.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And I don't see how they would
have the power to do that,

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.270 align:middle line:84%
but he did feel
threatened at that time.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, they
kind of called it a tie,

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.140 align:middle line:90%
and we went to our own corners.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.080 align:middle line:84%
But my bosses, as a
result of that experience,

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.859 align:middle line:84%
did tell me that I had been
demoted from G-man to X-man.

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:14.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Because of that?

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Because
of "The X-Files."

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:16.705 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not fair.

00:03:16.705 --> 00:03:17.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you upset?

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.758 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: It was
not a compliment,

00:03:19.758 --> 00:03:21.910 align:middle line:90%
and I was not happy about it.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.200 align:middle line:84%
But it was something I
got used to, ultimately.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now with that
kind of experience,

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.530 align:middle line:84%
as you look at the UFO
field and what's happening,

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.870 align:middle line:84%
what can you say that
really might be occurring?

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: What I see occurring
from my standpoint, based

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.720 align:middle line:84%
on the cases that
I've reviewed, cases

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.850 align:middle line:84%
I've studied, the
people I've interviewed,

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.720 align:middle line:84%
the contactees,
abductees, people just

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.000 align:middle line:84%
that even have observation
experiences, what I see

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.670 align:middle line:84%
is that ufology hasn't really
moved very much in the last 60

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.550 align:middle line:90%
years or so since Roswell.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.080 align:middle line:84%
There hasn't been very
much forward progress.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.320 align:middle line:84%
They're still in the
process of, are UFOs real?

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.120 align:middle line:90%
Are they real?

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.040 align:middle line:90%
Are alien visitors real?

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And we really are at
the point to where

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.360 align:middle line:90%
we need to move past that.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.310 align:middle line:90%
They are real.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: They are
visiting humanity.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.490 align:middle line:90%
UFOs are supernatural.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.390 align:middle line:84%
They are visiting people
and alien visitors--

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And taking people--

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.858 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: And taking people.

00:04:26.858 --> 00:04:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 30,000 people in the
United States alone every year

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:31.584 align:middle line:90%
merely disappear--

00:04:31.584 --> 00:04:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Disappear--

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Vanish.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yes, no
bodies, no suspects, no--

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.480 align:middle line:90%
these are not murderers.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.930 align:middle line:84%
These are just
disappeared people.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Men, women, children?

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: All kinds, yes--

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.370 align:middle line:90%
30,000.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And now just that's 30,000
per year average in the United

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.990 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, other industrialized
major countries

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.040 align:middle line:90%
have similar numbers, too.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.010 align:middle line:84%
So you're talking
about Brazil, Mexico--

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So hundreds
of thousands of people

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.810 align:middle line:84%
vanish off this planet, and
they don't know where they are.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: And not many
questions are asked.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So some of these
cases I'm sure could be tragic,

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.730 align:middle line:84%
murders, kidnappings,
but not 30,000 of them.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: No, I
don't believe so.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And it really gets
to the point where

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.110 align:middle line:84%
the only explanation
possible has

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.530 align:middle line:84%
to be going towards a
supernatural explanation

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.330 align:middle line:84%
because a physical
explanation isn't there.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.788 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: David
Paulides has written

00:05:28.788 --> 00:05:31.260 align:middle line:90%
a book called "Missing 411."

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.470 align:middle line:10%
His theory is that people
are disappearing in our parks

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:35.830 align:middle line:10%
systems, for example.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.280 align:middle line:90%
That's what he specializes in.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And he has told me
that people will

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.540 align:middle line:84%
be walking with their friends,
just walking in the park.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And they'll turn around, and one
is gone, just gone, vanished--

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.300 align:middle line:90%
no sound.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.480 align:middle line:84%
No animal came down and swooped
down and picked them up.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.710 align:middle line:90%
You would have heard that--

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:56.510 align:middle line:90%
just gone.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah-- in seconds.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.440 align:middle line:10%
During my time in
the FBI, we've had

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.650 align:middle line:10%
cases where you
have a child that

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.210 align:middle line:10%
will be with the
parents in a forest area

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.460 align:middle line:10%
and will just run
behind a tree--

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.780 align:middle line:10%
run behind a tree.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.790 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly, the noise stops.

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:15.780 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.196 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They'll go back, look
for the kid, and he's gone.

00:06:18.196 --> 00:06:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: And
there's nothing there.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.220 align:middle line:84%
That's the example of
things for which there's

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.500 align:middle line:84%
no physical explanation,
especially when you

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.160 align:middle line:90%
have dogs tracking that child.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.700 align:middle line:90%
And they will just sit.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.617 align:middle line:84%
They'll sit because
there's nowhere to follow.

00:06:31.617 --> 00:06:32.416 align:middle line:90%
There's no scent--

00:06:32.416 --> 00:06:33.217 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My god--

00:06:33.217 --> 00:06:35.049 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: No physical
explanation for that.

00:06:35.049 --> 00:06:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
beamed aboard a craft?

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.190 align:middle line:90%
Where are they?

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: It appears something
supernatural is happening.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:42.590 align:middle line:90%
That's all I can--

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:43.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's all you know.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: That's
all I know for sure

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.890 align:middle line:84%
because the physical
explanation isn't there.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could they be stumbling
into another dimension?

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: I believe so.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or something like that?

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.735 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I believe that's
one of the possibilities that

00:06:53.735 --> 00:06:54.780 align:middle line:90%
has to be considered.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.905 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: One of our defense
firms, Lockheed Martin,

00:06:56.905 --> 00:06:59.640 align:middle line:10%
of course, that has done
just an incredible job for us

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.780 align:middle line:10%
as a nation developing high
technology, planes and missiles

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.350 align:middle line:10%
and things like that, there
was somebody part of Lockheed

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.250 align:middle line:10%
Martin who talked about UFOs.

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:12.270 align:middle line:90%
You knew the person, right?

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:13.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yes, Boyd Bushman.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:14.490 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:19.090 align:middle line:10%
He was a great senior
scientist for that company.

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And in 2008, I had been
doing various background

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.330 align:middle line:84%
investigations concerning
Lockheed Martin and others

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.720 align:middle line:84%
because he's worked at many
contractors, not just that one.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:36.000 align:middle line:84%
But he actually reached out
to me on a personal level.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.495 align:middle line:84%
He reached out to me
because he heard about me,

00:07:38.495 --> 00:07:39.870 align:middle line:84%
and he heard about
a conversation

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.200 align:middle line:84%
I had with one of his
coworkers about UFOs.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.250 align:middle line:84%
So he reached out
to me and told me

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:49.620 align:middle line:84%
he wanted to talk to
me about challenges he

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.090 align:middle line:90%
had on his security clearances.

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:51.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:54.870 align:middle line:90%
And talk he did.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BOYD BUSHMAN: Since
I am a scientist,

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:01.700 align:middle line:90%
I do not believe in theory.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:07.010 align:middle line:84%
I basically say, follow
the data theory began.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:11.670 align:middle line:84%
If something can't
verify by a physical test

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:15.650 align:middle line:84%
that something is
true, then I do not

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:20.735 align:middle line:84%
care to accept it in
math that I present.

00:08:20.735 --> 00:08:28.200 align:middle line:84%
But a very dear friend of mine
took his wife up a mountain

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:37.820 align:middle line:84%
on Valentine's Day, and they
took a photograph of Tucson.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.640 align:middle line:84%
It turned out to be when
they developed the film,

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:47.726 align:middle line:84%
there were a total of five
UFOs across Tucson proper.

00:08:47.726 --> 00:08:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And this is Tucson
as they saw it.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.030 align:middle line:90%
Can you get that?

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:05.380 align:middle line:84%
So here's the picture
of Tucson, as he had it.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Then as he developed
further, notice

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:14.050 align:middle line:84%
that there are five
very distinct UFOs

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:17.710 align:middle line:90%
along the top of the mountain.

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what did you
think of Boyd Bushman?

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:23.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I thought Boyd
was an excellent scientist.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:25.270 align:middle line:90%
He was very responsible.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:29.050 align:middle line:84%
He was considered by his
coworkers, by his workers,

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:33.130 align:middle line:84%
by everybody that knew him,
to be an excellent scientist.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.120 align:middle line:90%
Follow the data.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.536 align:middle line:84%
That's what he
always used to say.

00:09:35.536 --> 00:09:38.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was he a whistleblower?

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Well,
when I spoke to him,

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.980 align:middle line:84%
he didn't talk
about his challenges

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.080 align:middle line:90%
to his security clearance.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.210 align:middle line:84%
He started telling
me about Roswell,

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:51.280 align:middle line:84%
that there was an underground
base at Roswell, Nevada.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.210 align:middle line:90%
And he told me--

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:53.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: New Mexico.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:53.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yes.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.360 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:10:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And he told me that he was in
constant contact with people

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:04.180 align:middle line:84%
there and that he had
actually worked on technology,

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.640 align:middle line:84%
alien technology, that was
coming out of there, that was

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.590 align:middle line:90%
being processed out of there.

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And he was constantly
working on these materials.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And he told me that he
was interested in bringing

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.350 align:middle line:84%
some of this technology
to the world.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:21.970 align:middle line:84%
He had filed a number
of patents based

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:24.290 align:middle line:84%
on anti-gravity
and other things.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.970 align:middle line:10%
And he really wanted
to force the government

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:30.820 align:middle line:10%
to expose some of
this technology

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.610 align:middle line:10%
so that people, regular
people, could benefit from it.

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:35.486 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Fat chance of
that happening, right?

00:10:35.486 --> 00:10:36.285 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:10:36.285 --> 00:10:37.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what
he was working on.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:41.290 align:middle line:84%
I believe he was working on that
when he died, unfortunately.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
believe his story?

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:45.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I found him to
be completely credible,

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:49.140 align:middle line:84%
forthright, and
very stable and--

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But did you
believe his story?

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:51.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: I did.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You did?

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:53.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: I really did.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:57.580 align:middle line:84%
I did believe him, and
I know that he believed

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:01.420 align:middle line:84%
what he was telling me
about the base at Roswell,

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.160 align:middle line:84%
about alien technology
being there,

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:07.480 align:middle line:84%
and about aliens themselves
being present at the base.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would he make
this up, John, if he did?

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:11.310 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:12.790 align:middle line:90%
What does he gain?

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I just don't
believe he would, especially he

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.960 align:middle line:84%
was in poor health
during this time.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Poor health--
wasn't obviously wealthy.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:24.010 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and he's not
someone who I believe

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:27.590 align:middle line:84%
would defect from
his belief in science

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:28.840 align:middle line:90%
and the importance of science.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.762 align:middle line:84%
I just don't believe
that he would do that.

00:11:30.762 --> 00:11:32.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you think
he's the real deal.

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:33.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: I really do.

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:34.559 align:middle line:90%
I believe in what he's saying.

00:11:34.559 --> 00:11:37.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many Boyd
Bushmans are out there

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.930 align:middle line:84%
trying to tell their story
and people just won't listen?

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah, there
are a few out there.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.820 align:middle line:90%
There are a few out there.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.790 align:middle line:10%
Lazar was one of them--

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:48.590 align:middle line:10%
Boyd Bushman.

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:53.860 align:middle line:10%
But yeah, they need our help to
bring out some of the materials

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.340 align:middle line:10%
that they have for us, the
same way Bushman finally

00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:01.510 align:middle line:10%
had to expose the stuff himself
in his own farewell video

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:02.830 align:middle line:10%
that he did.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He kept this
quiet for a while.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:05.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.720 align:middle line:90%
He really did.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.450 align:middle line:84%
But the stuff that he
ultimately exposed I think

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:13.630 align:middle line:84%
was very important, very
important to those of us

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.840 align:middle line:84%
with open minds to actually
look at his material.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.540 align:middle line:84%
When I spoke to him, he
showed me a lot of pictures.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't ultimately show
me the famous alien picture

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.240 align:middle line:84%
that he shows in his
final farewell interview,

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.990 align:middle line:84%
but he showed me
a lot of pictures.

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And some of these pictures
were of alien devices,

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.090 align:middle line:90%
of alien technology.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was hard for me to really
make heads or tails of it,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.310 align:middle line:84%
especially because
I'm not a scientist.

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:44.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a scientific thinker.

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.720 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of what he said
to me, I couldn't follow.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.260 align:middle line:90%
But what I could follow is this.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:54.010 align:middle line:84%
He says that the
government has technology

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:59.289 align:middle line:84%
that could give the people
anti-gravity and free energy.

00:12:59.289 --> 00:13:01.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's not
going to happen, is it?

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:01.920 align:middle line:84%
They're not going
to give us that.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.628 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Well, it
doesn't look like it.

00:13:03.628 --> 00:13:05.560 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't look like
it, unfortunately.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And so with his
death, did secrets go with him?

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: I believe they did.

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:13.210 align:middle line:90%
I believe they did.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.640 align:middle line:84%
He has his patents
that were filed,

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:21.160 align:middle line:84%
but I never heard anything more
about his material or anything

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.580 align:middle line:90%
being done with it.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:26.230 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times,
there are people who

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:28.140 align:middle line:90%
work on these black projects.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:31.570 align:middle line:84%
Their stuff gets scooped up,
scooped up and disappeared down

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:32.380 align:middle line:90%
a black hole.

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
extradimensionals, John?

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:40.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Extradimensionals
are basically alien visitors who

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.630 align:middle line:84%
are visiting humanity,
who are visiting people--

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:43.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ongoing?

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Ongoing, but
who are not physical.

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:48.760 align:middle line:90%
They are not physical.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:53.140 align:middle line:84%
They are not like human beings
the way that we've been taught.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.220 align:middle line:90%
They are simply not physical.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:58.490 align:middle line:84%
They are from other
universes, other dimensions--

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not other
planetary systems.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:00.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Exactly.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.495 align:middle line:84%
They're not from the
next solar system.

00:14:03.495 --> 00:14:04.870 align:middle line:84%
They're not from
the next galaxy.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we'd like
that to be, most of us,

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.590 align:middle line:84%
but extradimensionals, that
brings an interesting concept

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:12.750 align:middle line:90%
to the table, too.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:13.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it's unwelcome
because extradimensionality

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:20.320 align:middle line:84%
is as a bad penny
that keeps coming back

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:26.860 align:middle line:84%
to ufology about every 20 years
because people want to believe

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.290 align:middle line:90%
alien visitors are physical.

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:31.150 align:middle line:84%
They want to believe
in alien immanency.

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We want to
believe we're not alone

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:33.330 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yes, exactly,
that our star system,

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.160 align:middle line:84%
our galaxy, that there
are others out there.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, there
are others out there.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:43.300 align:middle line:90%
We aren't alone.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:48.000 align:middle line:84%
But they're in other
levels of reality.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And they can change
their vibration

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:55.500 align:middle line:84%
physically to our vibration
temporarily to be here with us.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.440 align:middle line:84%
But then they go back
to where they came from.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And you were a former
FBI special agent.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:05.400 align:middle line:84%
You're used to investigating,
interrogating--

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.780 align:middle line:90%
probing.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:09.960 align:middle line:84%
How do you look at all of
this as an investigator?

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: As an investigator,
I don't do what scientists do.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't just follow data
until the data runs out.

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:19.770 align:middle line:84%
What I do is I follow
clues, and those clues

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:23.520 align:middle line:84%
can lead me sometimes to
very unexpected places

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.810 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes to places that
are sometimes not physical.

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:28.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dark places?

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.378 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: They
can be dark places.

00:15:30.378 --> 00:15:32.160 align:middle line:90%
They can be paranormal places.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
follow those clues.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And what I learned from
Boyd Bushman actually

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:44.430 align:middle line:84%
fit the patterns of stories I
had been told many, many years

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:47.140 align:middle line:90%
earlier by a KGB officer--

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: By a KGB
officer who had told me

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:54.450 align:middle line:84%
about an underground lab
outside of Moscow that

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:58.380 align:middle line:84%
fit the same parameters
and all the same details

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.484 align:middle line:90%
that Boyd Bushman later told me.

00:16:00.484 --> 00:16:01.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: So when
you see clues like

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:06.510 align:middle line:84%
that that match each
other, even across decades,

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:08.970 align:middle line:84%
that's when you have to
actually see those patterns

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:10.410 align:middle line:90%
and connect those patterns.

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John, why the shroud
of secrecy by government

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.790 align:middle line:90%
about these things?

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:17.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Because they must.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:25.170 align:middle line:84%
There is some sort of
worldwide order that is out.

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have to
have been at the meeting

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.660 align:middle line:84%
to know this is true
because I see its effects.

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:35.220 align:middle line:84%
There's some kind of an order
that is out to all the nations.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.050 align:middle line:90%
Since 1947, since Roswell--

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:39.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Since Roswell--

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.016 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: There is some
kind of an order that

00:16:41.016 --> 00:16:42.930 align:middle line:84%
says to all the
nations, basically,

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:46.350 align:middle line:84%
and to their subunits
that you shall not

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:51.990 align:middle line:84%
allow anything real to be
revealed about alien visitors

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:53.880 align:middle line:90%
or about UFOs.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that I
know that's the case

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:58.500 align:middle line:84%
is because when
you have something

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:04.950 align:middle line:84%
like what happened in
1980 at Rendlesham Forest,

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:07.290 align:middle line:84%
where you have two nations--
you have the United States

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.810 align:middle line:90%
military base on British soil.

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And you have this military
base invaded by several UFOs

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.250 align:middle line:84%
across three days
and three nights.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And the British government and
the American government, they

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.329 align:middle line:84%
don't have to wait for
orders for the cover-up.

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:24.810 align:middle line:90%
The cover-up is immediate.

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:26.890 align:middle line:90%
It springs right into action.

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:30.990 align:middle line:84%
This is a standing order
that the nations have.

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And if everybody wants to
know what I'm talking about,

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:36.422 align:middle line:84%
just google "NASA
cuts the live feed."

00:17:36.422 --> 00:17:38.130 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to
wait for instructions.

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:39.040 align:middle line:90%
They don't have to.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.890 align:middle line:90%
That's a standing order.

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Same thing-- European
Space Agency,

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.470 align:middle line:84%
also cuts the live
feed and various others

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:47.430 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:51.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was the Dog
Walkers' Rebellion in the '80s?

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: The Dog Walkers'
Rebellion in the '80s

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:58.470 align:middle line:84%
was in the Soviet Union, they
had the complete "Pravda"

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:00.780 align:middle line:90%
system of news.

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Every night at 6
o'clock in the evening,

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.680 align:middle line:84%
you had people refuse to
watch the 6 o'clock news.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds of millions of
people across three time

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:11.470 align:middle line:84%
zones throughout
the Soviet Union,

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:14.350 align:middle line:84%
they refused to watch
the evening news anymore

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:15.150 align:middle line:90%
at 6 o'clock.

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Because it was all
government-controlled "Pravda."

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:21.510 align:middle line:90%
They fought back, huh?

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:23.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: So they
simply withdrew.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:24.720 align:middle line:90%
They simply withdrew.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And at 6 o'clock every evening
all across the Soviet Union,

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.510 align:middle line:84%
people, instead of
sitting down for dinner

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:33.675 align:middle line:84%
to watch the evening news, they
all went and walked their dogs.

00:18:33.675 --> 00:18:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: And they
started noticing each other

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:38.670 align:middle line:90%
out there walking their dogs.

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And they started to find that
they could congregate and share

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:45.826 align:middle line:84%
news from the West while
walking their dogs.

00:18:45.826 --> 00:18:47.450 align:middle line:84%
The KGB wouldn't
bother them because it

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:48.960 align:middle line:90%
was an ordinary activity.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:52.290 align:middle line:84%
They could congregate
without being harassed.

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:53.874 align:middle line:90%
And so they started doing that.

00:18:53.874 --> 00:18:55.290 align:middle line:84%
At 6 o'clock, they
started sharing

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:57.420 align:middle line:84%
because even a
rumor from the West

00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.290 align:middle line:84%
was more likely to be true
than the "Pravda" news

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:01.500 align:middle line:90%
that they were exposed to.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, what happened
was towards the '80s,

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:09.090 align:middle line:84%
towards the end, they found
out that the only people

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:12.390 align:middle line:84%
watching "Pravda" news and
buying "Pravda" newspapers

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:14.404 align:middle line:84%
were government officials
towards the end.

00:19:14.404 --> 00:19:15.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There you go.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: So the Dog Walkers'
Rebellion was very successful.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:21.180 align:middle line:10%
And we need to repeat that
today because today, we're,

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:24.690 align:middle line:10%
again, in this sort
of Orwellian system

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:27.360 align:middle line:10%
of 100% corporate fake news.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.307 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is data flooding?

00:19:29.307 --> 00:19:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Data flooding--

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does that
have to do with this?

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Data flooding
is better for tyranny

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.510 align:middle line:90%
than secrecy ever was.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:41.085 align:middle line:84%
Secrecy can no longer
be used to hide things

00:19:41.085 --> 00:19:42.960 align:middle line:84%
from people because of
the interconnectedness

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.470 align:middle line:84%
of the world and the
internet, how it functions.

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Data flooding is the new
method that the nations

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:52.510 align:middle line:90%
use to cover information.

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:55.630 align:middle line:84%
They allow information
to be in plain sight,

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:59.110 align:middle line:84%
but then they cover
it with other layers

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:04.090 align:middle line:84%
of false information,
false news, false versions

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:05.890 align:middle line:90%
of the same story.

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:08.340 align:middle line:84%
So the truth is out there,
like Mulder used to say.

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:08.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's there.

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:09.070 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:09.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: It's out there.

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:10.876 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You got to find it.

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: It could be on
the internet, but so what?

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Because of data
flooding, it's populated

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:18.990 align:middle line:90%
by so many false versions of--

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:20.574 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it
like fake news now?

00:20:20.574 --> 00:20:22.615 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Fake news is
just a small part, yeah--

00:20:22.615 --> 00:20:23.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right--

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Because
all corporate news

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:25.705 align:middle line:90%
is fake news at this point.

00:20:25.705 --> 00:20:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
are the global shops?

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:28.990 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Global shops are
another part of data flooding.

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:36.100 align:middle line:84%
Global shops are these
operational units

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:40.420 align:middle line:84%
that are sponsored and put
forward by global authorities,

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:43.090 align:middle line:84%
by the EPIC, the Elite
Powers In Control.

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Set up on purpose--

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: On purpose.

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And what they do is they
take down any real instances

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.760 align:middle line:90%
that reveal the paranormal.

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:55.750 align:middle line:84%
They take them down, and they
replace them and substitute

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:58.630 align:middle line:84%
them with data flooding,
with false versions

00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:59.557 align:middle line:90%
of that same event.

00:20:59.557 --> 00:21:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to show
you, John, something

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:04.510 align:middle line:84%
from the Dome of the
Rock in Jerusalem.

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, we will
get involved with your comments

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:09.220 align:middle line:90%
on that.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:10.020 align:middle line:90%

>>DESOUZA: That was a
true, real UFO event.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:06.760 align:middle line:84%
It was genuinely
extraterrestrial,

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.440 align:middle line:90%
possibly extradimensional.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It hovered
over the Dome,

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:12.640 align:middle line:90%
took off like a rocket ship--

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.790 align:middle line:90%
people witnessed this.

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:14.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And when that happened-- this
happened in Jerusalem on 2011,

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.676 align:middle line:90%
January 29.

00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:27.300 align:middle line:84%
It was about 1:00 in the morning
in Jerusalem when it happened.

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.341 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It went all over
the country after that.

00:22:29.341 --> 00:22:32.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: It was captured
by numerous tourists

and other people.

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And another way that you know
it was a genuine occurrence was

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:40.180 align:middle line:84%
there were weather
cameras in Israel

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:42.307 align:middle line:84%
at the time that
captured the event.

00:22:42.307 --> 00:22:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everything captured it.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:44.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And also, I was working with an
intelligence squad on the East

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.650 align:middle line:90%
Coast when this occurred.

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:53.230 align:middle line:84%
I was with a gentleman who
had people on the ground

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:55.930 align:middle line:84%
in Jerusalem working on
some other operations

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:57.190 align:middle line:90%
unrelated to this.

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:01.720 align:middle line:84%
But that was put by the wayside
because they called him up

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.814 align:middle line:84%
from Jerusalem
shortly after 1:00

00:23:03.814 --> 00:23:05.230 align:middle line:84%
in the morning
when this happened,

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:08.860 align:middle line:84%
and they told him
that they're here.

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:12.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why hasn't this
story gotten the kind of press

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.230 align:middle line:90%
it needs to get worldwide?

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:15.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Ah.

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:18.190 align:middle line:84%
It's because of
these global shops.

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:21.850 align:middle line:84%
These global shops, as
I was told would happen,

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:23.810 align:middle line:84%
they immediately sprang
into action as soon

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:24.610 align:middle line:90%
as this happened.

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:26.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh my god,
damage control, right?

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:27.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yes.

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And what they did
was they took down

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.320 align:middle line:84%
some of the originals, which
have been put back up by now.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.470 align:middle line:84%
But they took down
the original videos

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:41.280 align:middle line:84%
and they put out faked
CGI versions of this video

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:42.080 align:middle line:90%
so that when--

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To what,
manipulate people?

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: So that when
there was a mad rush--

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mislead them?

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:47.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah, so that
when there was a mad rush

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:50.410 align:middle line:84%
of millions of people to
see "Dome of the Rock UFO,"

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:53.607 align:middle line:84%
they would be confronted
with this fake CGI version--

00:23:53.607 --> 00:23:54.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right--

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: That had
breadcrumbs of CGI in it.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:58.835 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What we just
saw is the original.

00:23:58.835 --> 00:24:00.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: That's
one of the real ones.

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:01.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:05.080 align:middle line:84%
But there are dozens
and dozens of versions

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:08.410 align:middle line:84%
on the net of this incident,
and a lot of them are fake.

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:09.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah.

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:10.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: That's the problem.

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:13.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was this an
orb or a physical craft,

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:14.650 align:middle line:90%
in your opinion?

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I believe it was a
plasma vehicle, a UFO, a plasma

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:21.850 align:middle line:90%
craft.

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
it just took off.

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:25.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Which means
physical but not physical

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:28.000 align:middle line:84%
because plasma is
shifting state.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.110 align:middle line:90%
It's a shifting state of matter.

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:30.910 align:middle line:90%
And so yeah.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:32.020 align:middle line:90%
So the answer to that is--

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:33.936 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting
that it would happen over

00:24:33.936 --> 00:24:35.740 align:middle line:90%
such a religious site.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:36.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, interesting
because obviously, they

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.590 align:middle line:90%
wanted to capture attention.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:44.110 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to
get our attention,

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:47.590 align:middle line:84%
get it by doing something very
significant, very important.

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And also, I just think that if
any human powers were involved

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:57.070 align:middle line:84%
with this, they wouldn't have
picked the Dome of the Rock

00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:59.164 align:middle line:90%
to use as their site.

00:24:59.164 --> 00:25:00.080 align:middle line:90%
I just don't think so.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was an
interesting location.

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:01.645 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:25:01.645 --> 00:25:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Back to disclosure
for a moment, John--

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:05.890 align:middle line:84%
why doesn't government
come out and say,

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:08.350 align:middle line:90%
folks you saw this video.

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:10.010 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:12.044 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what these are.

00:25:12.044 --> 00:25:13.710 align:middle line:84%
We don't know where
they're coming, even

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:16.030 align:middle line:90%
though we think we do know.

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:17.320 align:middle line:90%
Why don't they say this?

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.320 align:middle line:84%
Why do they have to
hide and not disclose?

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Because
government follows orders.

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Basically, that's their
nature, that's what they do,

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:28.630 align:middle line:84%
and that's what they're
always going to do.

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:30.670 align:middle line:90%
And they have been ordered--

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:33.160 align:middle line:84%
not just our government
but all the governments

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:38.950 align:middle line:84%
have been ordered never to
allow anything real about UFOs

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:41.355 align:middle line:84%
or alien visitors
to be disclosed.

00:25:41.355 --> 00:25:42.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
they afraid of?

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:44.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I believe
the reason for that

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:48.130 align:middle line:84%
is because the alien
visitors themselves

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:52.300 align:middle line:84%
want to be the ones to give
revelation when the time comes.

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:53.800 align:middle line:84%
They don't want any
interpretations.

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.330 align:middle line:90%
They don't want any middlemen.

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:58.900 align:middle line:84%
They don't want anyone else to
advise who and what they are.

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something has
been going on at the South

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.330 align:middle line:90%
Pole, Antarctica.

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:03.130 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:04.639 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
investigated that?

00:26:04.639 --> 00:26:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I've looked into it,
and I have gotten information

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.110 align:middle line:90%
on what's going on.

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:08.910 align:middle line:90%
And it's--

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:10.679 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's happening?

00:26:10.679 --> 00:26:12.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: It's
pretty amazing stuff.

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:17.230 align:middle line:84%
It appears that many government
and religious leaders have been

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:21.790 align:middle line:84%
summoned to Antarctica
in recent...

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.650 align:middle line:90%
24 months or so.

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing
because they're being

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:32.260 align:middle line:84%
summoned by someone or something
that we don't know what it is.

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And it appears
that there has been

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:39.790 align:middle line:84%
a discovery of some sort
of underground civilization

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:43.150 align:middle line:84%
that leads directly into
hollow Earth theories.

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:45.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, which also
talks about Admiral Richard

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:49.010 align:middle line:84%

into the hollow Earth.

>>MAN 2: Thumbs up
to this gentleman.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:00.720 align:middle line:84%

our plans in pairing you,

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Admiral Byrd, as the officer
in charge of the expedition

00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:08.640 align:middle line:84%
and you, Admiral Cruzen, as
the task force commander.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.110 align:middle line:90%
And we get everything we need.

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:14.880 align:middle line:84%
That makes Operation Highjump
the greatest expedition

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.050 align:middle line:90%
in history.

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:17.633 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD BYRD:
Admiral, time is going

00:27:17.633 --> 00:27:19.950 align:middle line:90%
to be our greatest handicap.

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:24.280 align:middle line:84%
By the time we get through
this very difficult icepack,

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:28.860 align:middle line:84%
the summer will have ended
and the fall will have set in.

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Never before has
anyone attempted

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.680 align:middle line:84%
to take a fleet of
thin-skinned steel ships

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:38.250 align:middle line:84%
through 300 miles or
more of crushing icepack.

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MAN 2: I have great faith
in your skill, courage,

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.795 align:middle line:90%
and determination.

00:27:44.795 --> 00:27:47.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, just a
little snippet of Admiral

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Byrd-- it's one of the first
times I've seen him like that.

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:53.170 align:middle line:90%
What an investigation.

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:56.800 align:middle line:84%
He discovered something very
strange with the hollow Earth.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: He did.

00:27:57.610 --> 00:28:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And he was never
allowed to directly talk

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:03.800 align:middle line:84%
about what happened to him
during Operation Highjump.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: But he was
given a flotilla of Naval

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:11.200 align:middle line:84%
ships to go and
invade Antarctica

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:15.340 align:middle line:84%
because as a direct
confrontation against the Nazis

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:19.210 align:middle line:84%
that supposedly had a base
there, Neuschwabenland.

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because the North
Pole episode that he was on

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:25.010 align:middle line:84%
was done through the
North Pole, right?

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:25.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When he went into
the hollow Earth there--

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:30.820 align:middle line:84%
so then all of a sudden, he
got reassigned to do something

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:31.960 align:middle line:90%
at the South Pole.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Right.

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's where he
saw these other anomalies.

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:35.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Right.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.510 align:middle line:10%
And based on clues--

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:39.700 align:middle line:10%
because he gave
little interviews

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:43.820 align:middle line:10%
with little snippets of
things that were on his mind

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:45.580 align:middle line:10%
after the operation.

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And based on clues and
things we can put together,

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:52.150 align:middle line:84%
it appears that his
flotilla to the Antarctica

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:56.110 align:middle line:90%
was attacked by UFOs--

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:56.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow--

00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:58.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: And basically
just taken apart.

00:28:58.790 --> 00:28:59.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Destroyed?

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Partially,
partially destroyed--

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.620 align:middle line:84%
we'll never know
how many lives were

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:03.920 align:middle line:90%
lost, how many ships were lost.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:04.720 align:middle line:90%
That's all--

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did he report that?

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: No.

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:07.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not publicly.

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: No, none of
this was reported publicly.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:12.610 align:middle line:84%
But he gave little snippets
of interviews talking

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:17.590 align:middle line:84%
about different aspects about
UFOs and other experiences

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:20.740 align:middle line:84%
that we can put together a
picture of what happened.

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And it does appear that
his flotilla was basically

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:24.676 align:middle line:90%
partially destroyed--

00:29:24.676 --> 00:29:25.475 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez--

00:29:25.475 --> 00:29:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: By UFOs
that had capacities

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:29.440 align:middle line:90%
that were astounding to him.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And basically, his operation
was canceled because of that.

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:36.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As a former
special FBI agent,

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.690 align:middle line:84%
what does this all tell
you about what's happening

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:41.970 align:middle line:90%
and the shroud of secrecy?

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:46.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: It tells me
that we're in a good place

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:52.080 align:middle line:84%
because secrecy, it just doesn't
function anymore as a system

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.420 align:middle line:90%
to keep things from us.

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:55.770 align:middle line:90%
It really doesn't.

00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:57.930 align:middle line:84%
We're at a point now where
the interconnectedness

00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:00.330 align:middle line:84%
of the world, the
internet, the fact

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:03.690 align:middle line:84%
that we're all up on the
internet at all times--

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:05.410 align:middle line:90%
Antarctica's a perfect example.

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:07.545 align:middle line:10%
If you go to independent media--

00:30:07.545 --> 00:30:08.670 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You can't find it.

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:09.340 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: Not
mainstream media--

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:09.960 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You can't find it.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: But
independent media--

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Independent media, but
mainstream, you can't find it.

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:13.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Right.

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:14.430 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:16.800 align:middle line:84%
But in independent media,
you can find information

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:17.780 align:middle line:90%
about what's going on.

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But how do you
put it all together, John?

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:21.810 align:middle line:84%
How do you know what's
right and what isn't, what

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:25.320 align:middle line:84%
is a far-fetched story
and what might be reality?

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:26.610 align:middle line:90%
How do you hone in on that?

00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: You just have to
stay away from mainstream media.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:31.770 align:middle line:84%
That's the best advice
I can give anybody.

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:33.900 align:middle line:90%
Just don't accept.

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:34.980 align:middle line:90%
Don't participate in it.

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:36.240 align:middle line:90%
Don't look at it.

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.455 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you go to
independent sources,

00:30:38.455 --> 00:30:40.080 align:middle line:84%
and that's where
you're most to get it.

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, what I'm told
is going on at Antarctica is

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:48.030 align:middle line:84%
they're investigating the
possibilities of a huge craft

00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:53.340 align:middle line:84%
that is under the ice, a
city that was covered by ice

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:54.390 align:middle line:90%
that's down there--

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:55.640 align:middle line:90%
that's exciting all by itself.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yes.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No reason to hide that.

00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.434 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yes.

00:30:59.434 --> 00:31:01.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But something's
happening down there,

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:03.000 align:middle line:90%
a former Nazi base--

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:03.900 align:middle line:90%
submarine base.

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: And all of
those possibilities

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:09.340 align:middle line:84%
will be proposed and used as
cover stories in the months

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:10.140 align:middle line:90%
to come.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how do we know
which is believable and which

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:13.540 align:middle line:90%
isn't?

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: They're
all cover stories

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:18.420 align:middle line:84%
because what's really happening
there, what's really going on,

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:21.900 align:middle line:90%
is there is alien technology.

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:25.480 align:middle line:84%
That is the reason
why the nations

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:29.640 align:middle line:84%
in just a couple of years
have gone from five nations

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.859 align:middle line:84%
being there to 32
nations now being there.

00:31:31.859 --> 00:31:34.025 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Including visits
by governmental officials,

00:31:34.025 --> 00:31:34.350 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:36.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yes, and
that's because they're

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:40.860 align:middle line:84%
all jockeying for the division
of this alien technology.

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.360 align:middle line:84%
So whatever's going
on there, it has

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:44.130 align:middle line:84%
to do with an
alien civilization.

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:46.890 align:middle line:84%
But we're probably not going
to be allowed to know that.

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:48.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is EPIC?

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: EPIC is the name that
I use for the Elite Powers In

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.070 align:middle line:90%
Control, the acronym EPIC--

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah, OK--

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Because I
don't like to say--

00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:57.673 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You coined that phrase?

00:31:57.673 --> 00:32:00.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yes, I have
because we need fresh language

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:01.560 align:middle line:90%
in the paranormal.

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:05.700 align:middle line:10%
I don't like to use the word
"Illuminati," "NWO," things

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:09.840 align:middle line:10%
like that, because we need to
use different language to refer

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:10.680 align:middle line:10%
to these things.

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we're just
painting targets on ourselves.

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
exciting research.

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:18.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will we ever
get these answers?

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: We will.

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think we'll get
some of these answers

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:23.700 align:middle line:84%
sooner than we think
because of the work that's

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:28.060 align:middle line:84%
being done here at Gaia
and other places like this.

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, this
expedition in Antarctica

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:32.200 align:middle line:90%
is amazing all by itself.

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As people
continue to investigate it,

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:39.040 align:middle line:90%
maybe we'll get these answers.

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: I think we will.

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:43.890 align:middle line:84%
But we have to just put
together the right people

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:45.660 align:middle line:84%
to be able to go
forward with this stuff

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:49.920 align:middle line:84%
and show the way to
go forward in truth.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we have
the right people?

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Well, sometimes, I
feel like scientists are not

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:01.740 align:middle line:84%
the ones that you really need to
move forward in the paranormal

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:05.130 align:middle line:84%
with because, like
Boyd Bushman told me,

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:07.560 align:middle line:90%
they just follow the data.

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:08.490 align:middle line:90%
They follow the data.

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:12.950 align:middle line:84%
So when the data runs
out, basically, they're--

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It runs out.

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Everything runs out.

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, investigators,
though, are different,

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:21.190 align:middle line:84%
investigators like the great
Jim Marrs who just passed away

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:23.470 align:middle line:84%
and one of the greatest
investigative journalists who

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:24.270 align:middle line:90%
ever lived.

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:25.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:30.805 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Or law enforcement
people, we follow clues.

00:33:30.805 --> 00:33:31.680 align:middle line:90%
We don't follow data.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:32.550 align:middle line:90%
We follow clues.

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:33.690 align:middle line:90%
We follow patterns.

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:35.640 align:middle line:90%
We look for modus operandi.

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And when the data-- and
our data doesn't run out

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:41.280 align:middle line:84%
because we are able
to go out, reach out

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:46.530 align:middle line:84%
to cases and comparative
anecdotes and things

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:49.890 align:middle line:84%
that happen sometimes
across decades or centuries,

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:53.130 align:middle line:84%
and we're able to match things
that may originally not have

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:54.839 align:middle line:90%
been matchable to these things.

00:33:54.839 --> 00:33:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jim Marrs would have
loved the research that you do,

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:57.710 align:middle line:90%
John.

00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:58.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:33:58.380 --> 00:33:59.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He would have loved it.

00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:00.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:01.396 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's sorely missed.

00:34:01.396 --> 00:34:04.860 align:middle line:84%
So as you look at the
perspective of all these things

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:10.170 align:middle line:84%
that have been going on, what
can you conclude at this point?

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: At this
point, I think

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:14.219 align:middle line:90%
we're reaching a crescendo.

00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:16.110 align:middle line:90%
We're reaching a crescendo.

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:18.330 align:middle line:90%
Alien abductions are increasing.

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:19.770 align:middle line:90%
They're not leveling off.

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:23.820 align:middle line:84%
Observation cases, contact
cases, they're just increasing.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:27.090 align:middle line:84%
Cases like Antarctica,
where anybody

00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:30.300 align:middle line:84%
can go on Google
Satellite and see

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:31.889 align:middle line:90%
what's really going on there--

00:34:31.889 --> 00:34:34.469 align:middle line:84%
they can see these
pyramids that came up

00:34:34.469 --> 00:34:37.149 align:middle line:84%
out of nowhere that are the
size of the Pyramids of Giza.

00:34:37.149 --> 00:34:37.949 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:40.830 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: They can see these
stairways, these stairways that

00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:42.960 align:middle line:10%
are popping up out
of Antarctica that

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:45.929 align:middle line:10%
are as big as the stairs
on the Capitol steps,

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:49.860 align:middle line:10%
these entrances at Antarctica
that anyone could look at.

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:52.949 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm saying is we're
approaching a point where

00:34:52.949 --> 00:34:55.650 align:middle line:84%
this stuff can't be
contained anymore,

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:59.430 align:middle line:84%
even from the mainstream, even
from the majority of people.

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to have to
start looking at this stuff

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:04.965 align:middle line:84%
and really seeing that
we're approaching revelation

00:35:04.965 --> 00:35:05.765 align:middle line:90%
at this point

00:35:05.765 --> 00:35:08.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I'm so fortunate
that programs like ours,

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:12.120 align:middle line:84%
"Beyond Belief," that Gaia
is giving us the opportunity

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:14.010 align:middle line:84%
to get these kinds
of stories out

00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:17.370 align:middle line:84%
to people who might not ever
have had the opportunity

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:18.480 align:middle line:90%
to know what's going on.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.416 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Exactly.

00:35:19.416 --> 00:35:20.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we
will keep pushing

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:23.260 align:middle line:90%
and pushing and pushing.

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:28.102 align:middle line:84%
In terms of the FBI,
your former employer,

00:35:28.102 --> 00:35:29.310 align:middle line:90%
what's going to happen there?

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:30.750 align:middle line:90%
Any more developments?

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:33.540 align:middle line:84%
Any revelations
that will pop out?

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Well,
the FBI is always

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.450 align:middle line:84%
going to do what they
do, which is they do

00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:40.950 align:middle line:90%
their criminal investigations.

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:44.680 align:middle line:84%
They do their terrorism
investigations

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.640 align:middle line:84%
up to their point, to the
point of their investigative

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:48.720 align:middle line:90%
conclusions.

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And they're just
going to stay there.

00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:53.880 align:middle line:10%
But if you want to see some
of the extraordinary stuff

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:57.240 align:middle line:10%
that the FBI has done,
you can go directly

00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:03.480 align:middle line:10%
to vault.fbi.gov, where they
have the repository of all

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:06.750 align:middle line:10%
the cases that have been
declassified that people can

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:09.360 align:middle line:10%
look at for themselves
and they can download

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.520 align:middle line:10%
for themselves for free.

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And there is a section that's
called "Unexplained Mysteries."

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:19.980 align:middle line:84%
and under that, there
is "UFOs" and there's

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:21.480 align:middle line:90%
"Cattle Mutilations."

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And there are all kinds
of paranormal-type topics.

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And people can
see what the FBI's

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.830 align:middle line:90%
done over the last 100 years.

00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:32.591 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are "The X-Files" real?

00:36:32.591 --> 00:36:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: I believe they are.

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.180 align:middle line:84%
I believe they are because
I've seen them myself.

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are some of the
extraterrestrial UFO-type cases

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:44.220 align:middle line:84%
you've investigated that really
could be considered authentic?

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Well,
what I've noticed

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:50.190 align:middle line:84%
is that from the time of
World War II, thereabouts,

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:53.550 align:middle line:84%
there have been
several authentic UFO

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:58.290 align:middle line:84%
cases that carry some
similar traits that I

00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:00.170 align:middle line:90%
consider extradimensional.

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is,
during World War II,

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:05.260 align:middle line:90%
the Battle of Los Angeles--

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:06.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yes--

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Where we
had the whole coast--

00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was
something up there.

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:10.890 align:middle line:84%
We had the whole
coast militarized.

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, as everyone's
paranoid about Japanese zeros

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:17.831 align:middle line:84%
coming into California,
we have those two UFOs

00:37:17.831 --> 00:37:19.080 align:middle line:90%
that show up over Los Angeles.

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hovering--

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:20.535 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Hovering--

00:37:20.535 --> 00:37:21.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Pinging when
they shot at it--

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah,
hovering over there.

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And they just let loose all
kinds of ordnance against it.

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:32.397 align:middle line:84%
And it's just no harm
was done to the UFOs.

00:37:32.397 --> 00:37:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, they
couldn't knock it out or--

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:36.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: They couldn't,
as if they were actually

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:40.802 align:middle line:84%
plasma vehicles, shifting
states of matter.

00:37:40.802 --> 00:37:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The real deal?

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And I see an extradimensional
quality there

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:48.570 align:middle line:84%
to those ships that
happily just sailed away

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:51.630 align:middle line:84%
after several people
were killed on the ground

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:53.100 align:middle line:90%
from these ordnance.

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:56.460 align:middle line:84%
But the UFOs were
left untouched.

00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:57.596 align:middle line:90%
Betty and Barney Hill--

00:37:57.596 --> 00:37:58.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great case--

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:00.425 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: 1961, I see that as--

00:38:00.425 --> 00:38:01.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: New
Hampshire abduction.

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Exactly.

00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:05.952 align:middle line:84%
I see that as a genuine,
authentic situation.

00:38:05.952 --> 00:38:07.660 align:middle line:10%
And if anybody wants
to know what I mean,

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:09.870 align:middle line:10%
just look at the
interviews of Betty

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:11.950 align:middle line:10%
and Barney Hill that are
still available today.

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:14.550 align:middle line:84%
They're in black and white,
but they're available today.

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:15.780 align:middle line:90%
People can see them.

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:18.870 align:middle line:84%
You can see the pain
in their voices.

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:23.400 align:middle line:84%
Not people looking for fame, not
people looking for notoriety--

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.590 align:middle line:84%
they were genuine in
what they went through.

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:28.110 align:middle line:90%
They were real.

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:30.780 align:middle line:90%
1975, Travis Walton case--

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.240 align:middle line:10%
Passed a lie detector test--

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:36.660 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: Oh, yeah, and so did
many of his comrades, as well.

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:42.690 align:middle line:10%
And that was something where he
was in the Sitgreaves National

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:44.710 align:middle line:10%
Forest in Arizona.

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:47.086 align:middle line:90%
And he ran underneath that UFO--

00:38:47.086 --> 00:38:48.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Got beamed aboard.

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:49.920 align:middle line:84%
It was like a
plasma vehicle and--

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:50.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Took him right up--

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:51.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Taken aboard.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:51.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
believe these abduction

00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:53.250 align:middle line:90%
cases are the real deal?

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Absolutely,
except turns out today--

00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:59.490 align:middle line:84%
and Travis Walton
agrees with this,

00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:02.230 align:middle line:84%
that his was not an
abduction case at all.

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:05.130 align:middle line:84%
It was a rescue
operation, apparently.

00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:09.160 align:middle line:84%
He had been struck dead on the
ground by this bolt of energy.

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:09.960 align:middle line:90%
And they actually--

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: His buddies
thought he was dead.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.201 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah, exactly.

00:39:12.201 --> 00:39:13.680 align:middle line:90%
Everyone believed he was dead.

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:17.220 align:middle line:84%
But they actually brought him
aboard in order to revive him.

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about these
animal mutilation cases?

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:20.850 align:middle line:90%
What's going on there?

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Animal
mutilations, I believe

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:28.530 align:middle line:84%
they are very much similar to
alien abductions, in that they

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:32.130 align:middle line:84%
are not really mutilations, just
like alien abductions aren't

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:34.400 align:middle line:90%
really primarily abductions.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.950 align:middle line:84%
They're harvestings,
harvestings of animal tissue,

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:39.290 align:middle line:90%
just like human abductions.

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:41.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're using
the tissue for some reason.

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:41.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Oh, yeah.

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.600 align:middle line:90%
They're saving it in the bank.

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:46.530 align:middle line:84%
They've got banks that they
are saving all this tissue.

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:48.757 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why don't they
just take the animal?

00:39:48.757 --> 00:39:51.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Ah, because they
don't need the whole animal.

00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:54.330 align:middle line:84%
They just need these
portions of soft tissue

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:56.820 align:middle line:84%
that somehow, through
their technology,

00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:59.400 align:middle line:84%
they're able to work
with these tissue

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.830 align:middle line:84%
very well to get
everything they want.

00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever come
across your own personal UFO

00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:05.790 align:middle line:90%
case?

00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Well, I had my UFO
experience when I was a kid.

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:12.420 align:middle line:84%
I was about 10 years
old, and my parents

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:15.610 align:middle line:84%
took me to New York City,
some sort of a party.

00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:21.480 align:middle line:84%
I was by myself out at night
in a part of New York City

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:23.140 align:middle line:90%
between two tall buildings.

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And I looked up, and
it was a starry night.

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:28.050 align:middle line:84%
But there was one area between
these two tall buildings

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:30.420 align:middle line:90%
that was black cloud.

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:32.334 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to
look at this cloud,

00:40:32.334 --> 00:40:33.750 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly, there
are spotlights

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:34.140 align:middle line:90%
coming out the bottom.

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:36.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Always in a cloud--
they're always in a cloud.

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:36.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And it came out the
bottom, the spotlights,

00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:42.090 align:middle line:84%
and it was a flying saucer
that came towards me.

00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And I felt that beam of
light, that bluish-greenish--

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:47.340 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to many witnesses
that felt that spotlight.

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And it feels like
it's scanning you,

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.610 align:middle line:84%
like it's scanning every
fiber of your being.

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:51.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You never
forgot that story.

00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:52.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Oh, yeah.

00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:55.020 align:middle line:90%
And I just felt that scan.

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And me and the UFO changed
our minds at the same moment.

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:01.050 align:middle line:84%
I stepped back, and the thing
reversed course and went

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:03.260 align:middle line:90%
back up into the clouds.

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you had any
episodes like that since?

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I had an
experience at my home weeks

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:12.450 align:middle line:84%
after that, almost as if
they got my information,

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:15.270 align:middle line:84%
took it back, and then
decided to visit me at home.

00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And I did have an
experience where

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:23.850 align:middle line:84%
I had a couple of entities that
came to my home late at night.

00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, I felt hands
at my feet and my head.

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:30.810 align:middle line:84%
They're lifting me up, and
they were lifting me up

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:33.030 align:middle line:84%
and I saw the ceiling
coming closer to me.

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:34.440 align:middle line:90%
Again, I was about 10 years old.

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: And I saw the ceiling
coming closer and closer,

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:43.050 align:middle line:84%
and they were apparently passing
through the ceiling easily.

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:45.810 align:middle line:84%
But my forehead bumped
against the ceiling

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:47.850 align:middle line:90%
and would not go through.

00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And they seemed very
perplexed by this.

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And they kept on
checking, and then I

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:55.170 align:middle line:84%
was able to see my
parents' bedroom, which

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:56.310 align:middle line:90%
was next to mine.

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:59.250 align:middle line:84%
But the door was wide
open, and I saw one of them

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:03.030 align:middle line:84%
on the ground holding my
parents asleep with their hands

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:06.990 align:middle line:84%
over the bed in some
kind of a stasis field.

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And the one on the ground
that was closest to me,

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:13.890 align:middle line:84%
I saw him look at me with
those black, wrap-around eyes.

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And all I heard were
the words, "he's awake."

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And then I looked at
the thing, and that

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:21.720 align:middle line:90%
was like the cord was cut.

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:24.481 align:middle line:84%
And I fell in the bed,
and they were gone.

00:42:24.481 --> 00:42:25.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Simple as that.

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:28.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah-- never had
another experience after that.

00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If somebody
came to you and said,

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:34.040 align:middle line:84%
look, you're a special
FBI investigator.

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:35.600 align:middle line:90%
You've looked at the paranormal.

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:38.000 align:middle line:90%
You've looked at the unusual.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.920 align:middle line:90%
Do you believe that UFOs exist?

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:42.140 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe that
we're being visited?

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:43.658 align:middle line:90%
What would you say to them?

00:42:43.658 --> 00:42:45.366 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I would
say, absolutely, I do.

00:42:45.366 --> 00:42:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, at the same time, you
have to bear in mind probably

00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:54.110 align:middle line:84%
about 95% of observation
cases, contact cases,

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:58.100 align:middle line:84%
can be not supernatural,
can be explained

00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:01.620 align:middle line:84%
through physical means or
explained through other means.

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And just they
aren't supernatural.

00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:09.620 align:middle line:84%
But that still leaves
5% of cases every year

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:14.340 align:middle line:84%
that are genuinely unexplainable
and possibly extraterrestrial

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:15.590 align:middle line:90%
in nature or extradimensional.

00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think it
is so great that we

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:21.020 align:middle line:84%
have had special agents
like you interested

00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:22.710 align:middle line:90%
in this kind of subject matter.

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:27.770 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: Well, it's very
important for investigators

00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:32.480 align:middle line:10%
to look at this stuff
because nobody else is really

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.850 align:middle line:10%
going to be able
to make the leap

00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:38.750 align:middle line:10%
to connect these things in the
way that people can understand,

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:41.120 align:middle line:10%
people can see, and
people can really

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:45.920 align:middle line:10%
grasp outside of the men
in the white lab coats.

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:50.120 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: There you have it,
a special agent for the FBI--

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:54.800 align:middle line:10%
retired-- John Desouza,
who actually believes

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:58.630 align:middle line:10%
we are being visited
from extraterrestrials

00:43:58.630 --> 00:44:00.910 align:middle line:10%
from another
source, whether it's

00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:04.000 align:middle line:10%
extradimensional or planetary.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that is
truly beyond belief.

00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:09.780 align:middle line:90%
