00:00:12.276 --> 00:00:14.400 align:middle line:84%
>> [BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.870 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.494 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:17.494 --> 00:00:20.970 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.314 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:24.314 --> 00:00:26.510 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:33.450 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>>And now the host of the
nationally syndicated Coast

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.130 align:middle line:84%
to Coast AM and Gaiam TV
bring you "Beyond Belief"

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.146 align:middle line:90%
with George Noory.

00:00:41.146 --> 00:00:42.720 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE NOORY: Well, hello.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.580 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.205 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:45.205 --> 00:00:48.980 align:middle line:84%
You know, the mind is
an incredible apparatus.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.740 align:middle line:84%
It can be trained to do some
truly remarkable things.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.290 align:middle line:84%
But as you will find
out, it can also

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.890 align:middle line:84%
be trained to do some very
horrible, dark things.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Our guest today
on "Beyond Belief"

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.250 align:middle line:84%
is the son of the late
congressman Nick Begich, Sr.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.550 align:middle line:84%
He's a noted author, "Angels
Don't Play This HAARP."

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.310 align:middle line:90%
Please welcome Nick Begich.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.387 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:13.387 --> 00:01:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Hey, Nick.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.800 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.540 align:middle line:90%
>> NICK BEGICH: Good to see you.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.970 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You're looking well.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.261 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Thank you very much.

00:01:17.261 --> 00:01:17.960 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.360 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What's new with you?

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.930 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Just busy.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.260 align:middle line:90%
A lot of traveling these days.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.720 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Traveling.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.820 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Yeah.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.028 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Studying and stuff.

00:01:24.028 --> 00:01:27.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, as we will find out, you
study some very strange things.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.230 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Absolutely.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Nick, before we really
get going, as I introduced you,

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.630 align:middle line:84%
the son of the late
congressman Nick Begich, Sr,

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.510 align:middle line:84%
I know you don't like
to dwell on that,

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.792 align:middle line:84%
but he died in a very tragic
episode with Hale Boggs.

00:01:42.792 --> 00:01:43.500 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Right.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.833 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Tell us what happened.

00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: Well, he was
flying from Anchorage to Juno.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.192 align:middle line:84%
And it was a campaign
trip, actually.

00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:51.150 align:middle line:84%
Hale Boggs was the majority
leader at the time.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.194 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
before Watergate.

00:01:55.194 --> 00:01:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Boggs, the night
before in a fundraiser,

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.200 align:middle line:84%
had just started talking
about this big thing

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.740 align:middle line:90%
brewing in Washington.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.900 align:middle line:84%
Next morning, they flew
out on a small Cessna

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.300 align:middle line:84%
and disappeared off
the radar screen

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.281 align:middle line:84%
about 10 minutes
into the flight.

00:02:07.281 --> 00:02:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Biggest search in the
history of the world

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.840 align:middle line:84%
at that time, and
absolutely nothing

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.960 align:middle line:84%
was found after several
months of searching.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And then I think it was
about 20 years later,

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.719 align:middle line:84%
1993, where they actually ran
into some telexes from the FBI

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:25.010 align:middle line:84%
indicating that they actually
did know where they were,

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.340 align:middle line:90%
but they were never recovered.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.440 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Why not?

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: Well, it was the
very end of the first time that

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.570 align:middle line:90%
Nixon was in office.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And so his term was up, and he
was running for a second term.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Hale Boggs was a very,
very strong opponent

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.890 align:middle line:84%
to what the FBI was
doing at the time.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.584 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of pretty
shady things going on.

00:02:45.584 --> 00:02:47.750 align:middle line:84%
They were tapping all the
congressional phone lines.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.310 align:middle line:84%
They were interfering really
with the political process.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And so he was an enemy, if
you will, of the Nixon camp.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.429 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Who wasn't?

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:57.470 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Yeah, exactly.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And it created a
lot of controversy.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And there were major issues
in Alaska time on land, oil

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.730 align:middle line:84%
and gas, big minerals
issues on the table.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.550 align:middle line:84%
That really was the
root of it, I think,

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.390 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that Boggs
wanted to reopen the Warren

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.890 align:middle line:90%
Commission.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.090 align:middle line:90%
That was a big deal--

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.140 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It was huge.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: --to reinvestigate
the Kennedy investigation.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Your brother's
now a US Senator.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.040 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: That's right.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.282 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So the political life
runs in your blood, no doubt.

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:19.990 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Right.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: At any point did your
family think somebody tampered

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.280 align:middle line:90%
with this plane?

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.150 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: That's come up.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.980 align:middle line:84%
But when those
telexes came out--

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.680 align:middle line:84%
my mother had been involved in
politics up until that time--

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.642 align:middle line:90%
she quit.

00:03:32.642 --> 00:03:33.600 align:middle line:90%
That was the end of it.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.974 align:middle line:84%
And she felt that if this
could happen to a United States

00:03:35.974 --> 00:03:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Congressman, it
wasn't a government

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.690 align:middle line:90%
that she wanted to serve in.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.990 align:middle line:84%
For the children, for
us, it was a motivator,

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.441 align:middle line:84%
I think, to stay engaged,
to make the kind of changes

00:03:45.441 --> 00:03:46.940 align:middle line:84%
that need to be
made in the country.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully Mark
and the Senate

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.310 align:middle line:84%
will do some things
that my father--

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.310 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Let's hope so.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.897 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: --would
have finished.

00:03:52.897 --> 00:03:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Has that episode,
regardless of what happened,

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.096 align:middle line:84%
has that changed your
entire outlook and direction

00:04:00.096 --> 00:04:01.470 align:middle line:84%
for the career
that you've taken?

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.565 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Oh, yeah.

00:04:03.565 --> 00:04:04.940 align:middle line:84%
When the plane
first disappeared,

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.860 align:middle line:84%
it totally altered--
I was 14 years old.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:07.080 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: It
certainly altered--

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.400 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And did you
understand what was going on?

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.945 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Oh, absolutely.

00:04:09.945 --> 00:04:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You did.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: And it wasn't
the first time dad was down.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.010 align:middle line:84%
It's not an uncommon
situation in Alaska.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.630 align:middle line:90%
It was the Vietnam era, too.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.390 align:middle line:84%
A lot of my friends had
family members in Vietnam.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.012 align:middle line:84%
And it was similar
to what people

00:04:23.012 --> 00:04:24.720 align:middle line:84%
were experiencing with
missing in action.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.595 align:middle line:90%
You just didn't know.

00:04:25.595 --> 00:04:28.500 align:middle line:90%
You didn't have any finality.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Not having that finality,
as you grow older,

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.180 align:middle line:90%
you kind of reconcile.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.732 align:middle line:84%
I think by the time I hit
my 30s, I finally did.

00:04:35.732 --> 00:04:37.190 align:middle line:84%
But no, I think it
was a motivator.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.615 align:middle line:84%
I'd always been
involved and my family

00:04:38.615 --> 00:04:40.406 align:middle line:84%
had always been involved
in public service.

00:04:40.406 --> 00:04:43.800 align:middle line:84%
That's the hallmark of what we
are in our region of the world.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.206 align:middle line:90%
And I think it was a motivator.

00:04:46.206 --> 00:04:47.580 align:middle line:84%
It certainly
changed my life, one

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.920 align:middle line:84%
of the most horrible situations,
but at the same time one

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.900 align:middle line:84%
that absolutely I
can point to as being

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.400 align:middle line:84%
a key element in making me
the person that I am today.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.266 align:middle line:84%
So as bad as it was, it had
that silver lining, if you will.

00:05:01.266 --> 00:05:03.640 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And I've got to say,
knowing Nick as I have all

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.557 align:middle line:84%
these years, you are a
remarkable human being.

00:05:05.557 --> 00:05:06.681 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Well, thank you.

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And we need about 10
million people like you on this

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.840 align:middle line:84%
planet, spread out
all over the place.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.280 align:middle line:84%
You started getting
involved in looking

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.950 align:middle line:84%
at the human mind and the
control of the human mind.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think you've
uncovered some things that

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.400 align:middle line:84%
are very positive about that
control but also very dark.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Right.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Tell me about your
involvement in mind control.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.330 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: Well, my interest
started really before I ever

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.456 align:middle line:84%
started writing or did
any of the public work.

00:05:35.456 --> 00:05:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was very
interested in what

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.820 align:middle line:84%
you could do to stimulate
the brain for meditation,

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.770 align:middle line:84%
for accelerated learning, for
these kinds of applications.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.520 align:middle line:84%
When I ran into the
HAARP story, of course

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.180 align:middle line:84%
there was that
component, the fact

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.350 align:middle line:84%
that the signals that can be
generated from this device

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.421 align:middle line:84%
could actually interfere
with brain function

00:05:53.421 --> 00:05:55.170 align:middle line:84%
in a way that was
pretty disturbing to me.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And that really got me to
start to look at this issue

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.121 align:middle line:84%
more closely and also to advance
the issue into the public's

00:06:03.121 --> 00:06:03.620 align:middle line:90%
view.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And of course, Coast to Coast
and you and your predecessors

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.930 align:middle line:84%
have been instrumental in
getting that issue out there.

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.370 align:middle line:90%
So it's always been appreciated.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's changed a lot
of perspectives on what we can

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.410 align:middle line:84%
do with the human mind
and has brought it

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.510 align:middle line:84%
into the general
population as the dark side

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.510 align:middle line:84%
and the bright side
of this technology.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's talk about some
of the things they're doing.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And who might they
be, by the way?

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.090 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Right.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.464 align:middle line:84%
DARPA's doing a
lot of this work.

00:06:32.464 --> 00:06:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And they do primarily research
for the various branches,

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.960 align:middle line:90%
the military.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.580 align:middle line:84%
Going back even further, it was
Central Intelligence Agency,

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.880 align:middle line:84%
which still has a great interest
in this type of technology.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:47.750 align:middle line:84%
The Navy has projects, Marines,
Air Force all have projects

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.290 align:middle line:84%
in this area, all
under different names,

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:51.780 align:middle line:90%
all under different programs.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.680 align:middle line:84%
But what we've
done over the years

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.490 align:middle line:84%
is really compile the data
from the public record academic

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:57.990 align:middle line:90%
records.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And you've got academic
institutions, of course,

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.510 align:middle line:84%
heavily involved as
military contractors

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:04.480 align:middle line:90%
in this kind of work.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.590 align:middle line:84%
Most recently, DARPA
let two contracts, now

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.015 align:middle line:84%
about a year, year
and a half ago,

00:07:10.015 --> 00:07:11.640 align:middle line:84%
to the University of
California to look

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.410 align:middle line:84%
at electronic telepathy,
as an example.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.085 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of things
going on in the area,

00:07:16.085 --> 00:07:18.510 align:middle line:84%
and they continue to go on
for, essentially decades

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.480 align:middle line:90%
this has been going on.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What do they do to
try to control the human mind?

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Because they're building,
I think, a force of people

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.740 align:middle line:84%
to do some of these
strange things.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:28.725 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Right.

00:07:28.725 --> 00:07:33.000 align:middle line:84%
The original ideas actually go
back to the hypnotherapy labs

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.450 align:middle line:84%
at Harvard University
in the 1920s and '30s.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And a guy named
Estabrooks had come up

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.710 align:middle line:84%
with this idea of creating
what we would call today

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.200 align:middle line:84%
a Manchurian Candidate,
a sleeper, if you will,

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.710 align:middle line:84%
someone that you could plant in
another country that would have

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:49.560 align:middle line:84%
absolutely no recollection of
who they were but would act

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.720 align:middle line:90%
as a super spy.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And that was his
general concept.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.790 align:middle line:84%
Now that idea advanced
into the '30s.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:59.020 align:middle line:84%
By the 1940s and
'50s, he was doing

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.850 align:middle line:90%
classified work in this area.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.107 align:middle line:84%
By the '50s, right
after the Korean War,

00:08:03.107 --> 00:08:04.440 align:middle line:90%
is where the real interest came.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's when our
prisoners of war came back.

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And these were patriotic
young men and women

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:10.940 align:middle line:84%
that all of a sudden
they're handing out

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:15.070 align:middle line:84%
communist leaflets on corners,
and the term brainwashing

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:15.680 align:middle line:90%
was coined.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of where
the CIA got real excited,

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.624 align:middle line:84%
and then many projects started
to emerge at that point.

00:08:21.624 --> 00:08:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: There were some
who believe Sirhan Sirhan,

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.510 align:middle line:84%
the convicted assassin
of Robert Kennedy,

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.570 align:middle line:84%
might have been a
Manchurian Candidate.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Right.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He originally
said that he had done it,

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:37.036 align:middle line:84%
and then all of a sudden
his recollection was gone.

00:08:37.036 --> 00:08:37.744 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Right.

00:08:37.744 --> 00:08:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And at this point,
I know his attorney William

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Pepper-- they claim that he
has no recollection of what

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:50.370 align:middle line:84%
happened, and they think that
somebody else was involved.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:53.460 align:middle line:84%
They're not sure what
Sirhan's involvement was,

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.050 align:middle line:90%
but he can't remember anything.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:57.154 align:middle line:90%
Is it things like that?

00:08:57.154 --> 00:08:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Yeah.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.110 align:middle line:90%
That's possible.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is the thing that
is the most remarkable.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.762 align:middle line:84%
When you consider
the fact that--

00:09:04.762 --> 00:09:06.970 align:middle line:84%
and I think this is, again,
going back to Estabrooks,

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:08.910 align:middle line:84%
about 20% of the
population, he felt,

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:11.640 align:middle line:84%
could be driven deeply
enough into a hypnotic state

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.460 align:middle line:84%
and over about 10 months create
this sort of altar personality,

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.172 align:middle line:84%
this split personality
if you will,

00:09:18.172 --> 00:09:19.505 align:middle line:90%
and really have no recollection.

00:09:19.505 --> 00:09:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And he by the 1960s said
he had achieved this,

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:26.240 align:middle line:84%
had accomplished
this successfully

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.990 align:middle line:84%
and was pretty excited
about it, actually.

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How do you train
someone to do something they

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:31.430 align:middle line:90%
don't want to do?

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:34.900 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: Well, in hypnotherapy
they say if it's not

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:35.950 align:middle line:90%
your normal thing--

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:36.770 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:40.510 align:middle line:84%
You can't train someone to go
kill someone under hypnosis,

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:43.090 align:middle line:84%
they say, if you're
not a killer.

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:45.065 align:middle line:90%
But there's a but.

00:09:45.065 --> 00:09:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: The but is if you
condition the person to where

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.790 align:middle line:84%
they are threatened or a
family member's threatened,

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.510 align:middle line:84%
and so that part of
that training is, OK,

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.927 align:middle line:84%
you're under a threat that
you're going to respond to with

00:09:55.927 --> 00:09:56.468 align:middle line:90%
deadly force.

00:09:56.468 --> 00:09:57.520 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Or an ideology.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.410 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Or an ideology.

00:09:58.410 --> 00:09:59.326 align:middle line:90%
And that's exactly it.

00:09:59.326 --> 00:10:01.840 align:middle line:84%
So when you take that
kind of framework

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.354 align:middle line:84%
around that individual,
what would motivate them?

00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And then you embed that
into the consciousness, too.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.477 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How long does it take
to manipulate a brain to do

00:10:09.477 --> 00:10:10.310 align:middle line:90%
something like that?

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: This method was
about a 10-month process--

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.080 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's it?

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.007 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: --is what
Estabrooks said.

00:10:14.007 --> 00:10:14.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And that was pretty
intensive work.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.670 align:middle line:84%
But there was a lot
of work beyond his.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:23.020 align:middle line:84%
There was work at Laurentian
University up in Canada.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:26.620 align:middle line:84%
There was work by CIA
literally around the world.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And they were actually
cooperating with the FBI

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:34.040 align:middle line:84%
and finding what they termed
unwitting victims, really,

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:34.790 align:middle line:90%
is what they were.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:39.130 align:middle line:84%
They were people who had very
little contact with others.

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:40.350 align:middle line:90%
They were sort of isolated.

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And they began to play
with those individuals

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:43.790 align:middle line:90%
without their consent.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And none of that has
really been-- anyone's

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.620 align:middle line:84%
been fully held
accountable for that,

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:54.080 align:middle line:84%
even after all of these years
and after committee hearings

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.310 align:middle line:84%
in the Congress in
the '70s and then

00:10:56.310 --> 00:11:00.180 align:middle line:84%
in the 1976 report of the
President's Commission

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.680 align:middle line:84%
on the CIA where a
lot of this stuff

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.888 align:middle line:90%
was starting to be uncovered.

00:11:02.888 --> 00:11:05.340 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now obviously that
stuff's not going on anymore,

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:05.900 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:06.775 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Oh, it is.

00:11:06.775 --> 00:11:10.550 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in I think
it was 2006 the Navy

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:13.780 align:middle line:84%
introduced a new protocol
for human experimentation.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And in that protocol
they actually call out

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.510 align:middle line:84%
mind control is the
phrase they use.

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And that has to be approved by
an undersecretary of the Navy

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.640 align:middle line:84%
in order to engage those
kinds of experiments.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.400 align:middle line:90%
But they are ongoing.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.430 align:middle line:84%
There was a contract,
it was a request

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:34.020 align:middle line:84%
for proposals that expired in
2009 by the Air Force looking

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:37.000 align:middle line:84%
for new modeling and then the
most recent DARPA contracts

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.010 align:middle line:84%
I just mentioned in
California looking

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:41.480 align:middle line:84%
for methods of sort
of mapping the brain.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.450 align:middle line:84%
In fact, MIT's "Technology
Review" in this very month

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:47.712 align:middle line:84%
has an article on brain mapping
and what it might lead to,

00:11:47.712 --> 00:11:49.170 align:middle line:84%
and that's part of
that DARPA work.

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And then the other side is
being able to then create

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.380 align:middle line:84%
complex signals that you
could then transfer and do

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.440 align:middle line:84%
another human brain and
create very specific thoughts

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.300 align:middle line:90%
or effects.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
the Air Force now

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:03.835 align:middle line:84%
calls controlled effects, which
a major article was written in

00:12:03.835 --> 00:12:08.650 align:middle line:84%
June 2004 in "Technology
Horizons," which

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:11.220 align:middle line:84%
the article was written by the
electromagnetic directorate

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.250 align:middle line:84%
of the Air Force, which
most people don't even

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:14.910 align:middle line:84%
know such an
organization exists.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:17.285 align:middle line:84%
But these are the people that
really get involved in this

00:12:17.285 --> 00:12:19.650 align:middle line:84%
and looking at how to
model energetically

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:22.410 align:middle line:84%
the human body and mind
and be able to affect

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.840 align:middle line:84%
the basic organs of the
body or the mind itself.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the
big shift in technology,

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:31.350 align:middle line:84%
what they call a revolution in
military affairs, a shift where

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:35.190 align:middle line:84%
energy instead of bullets and
bombs become the primary mover,

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:37.110 align:middle line:84%
whether you're attacking
hardware, software,

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:38.099 align:middle line:90%
or the human operator.

00:12:38.099 --> 00:12:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.681 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's take some
questions from our audience

00:12:40.681 --> 00:12:41.315 align:middle line:90%
for you, Nick.

00:12:41.315 --> 00:12:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Just raise your hands, and
I'll just point to you.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.570 align:middle line:84%
Who's got a question
for Nick Begich

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:47.610 align:middle line:84%
as we talk this segment
about mind control?

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:49.704 align:middle line:90%
Yes, way in the back there.

00:12:49.704 --> 00:12:50.370 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:53.050 align:middle line:84%
With all the stuff that you've
done with your early work

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.570 align:middle line:84%
with sound
technologies and stuff,

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:59.100 align:middle line:84%
you know a lot about the
standing waves and cancellation

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.170 align:middle line:84%
waves and stuff like
that with the government

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:03.440 align:middle line:90%
work and everything else.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.330 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering,
have you ever thought

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:08.310 align:middle line:84%
about developing machines
that do cancellation

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:11.030 align:middle line:84%
with all the invisible
frequencies that

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.850 align:middle line:90%
are in the air?

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: You know, that's a
question that comes up often.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.510 align:middle line:84%
With all of the things
that are happening,

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:18.680 align:middle line:90%
can you cancel signals?

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.970 align:middle line:90%
And of course you could.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:22.520 align:middle line:84%
The problem is the
range of frequencies

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.852 align:middle line:84%
in which these systems can
operate are pretty broad.

00:13:24.852 --> 00:13:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And what you're
really dealing with

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:29.740 align:middle line:84%
is a pulsed signal that
couples with the body.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.950 align:middle line:84%
In order to do that,
the kind of equipment

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:36.340 align:middle line:84%
that would be necessary
and the kind of range

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.950 align:middle line:84%
is just greater than most
people could ever achieve.

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:43.080 align:middle line:84%
So countermeasures are pretty
limited, at least in my view.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure as our governments
have moved forward

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.560 align:middle line:84%
in this technology,
countermeasures are a big part.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.810 align:middle line:84%
Because whatever we
develop, our adversaries

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:52.082 align:middle line:90%
also develop as well.

00:13:52.082 --> 00:13:53.290 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's unfortunate.

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Because if we could
develop countermeasures,

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.654 align:middle line:84%
it could help us in the
long run, couldn't it?

00:13:57.654 --> 00:13:58.570 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Absolutely.

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And I know that's an area of
interest for a lot of people.

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Again, the problem is
you can deliver this

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:05.510 align:middle line:90%
through any system.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:07.470 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Russians
had an article.

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:09.380 align:middle line:84%
It was later published
in "Perimeters,"

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.510 align:middle line:84%
which is produced by
the US Army War College.

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And the article was "The
Mind Has No Firewalls."

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And they say any
electromagnetic carrier,

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.750 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the power
grid, whether it's

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:23.970 align:middle line:84%
internet, telephones, anything
that carries a signal,

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:28.700 align:middle line:84%
you can embed a signal that will
influence behavior of people

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:29.920 align:middle line:90%
in contact with that signal.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:34.084 align:middle line:84%
And that really is the
ultimate info warfare,

00:14:34.084 --> 00:14:35.000 align:middle line:90%
if you think about it.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's thinking
about hacking computers,

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:39.370 align:middle line:84%
but hacking the human
operator is really

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:41.340 align:middle line:90%
where this technology goes.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's really quite simple.

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:44.960 align:middle line:90%
It can be done very simply.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I somewhat find it
surprising, but not entirely,

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.040 align:middle line:84%
when horrible episodes
occur, shootings in schools,

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:54.090 align:middle line:84%
mass situations,
the Boston bombing,

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:57.740 align:middle line:84%
that people immediately say
these people have been mind

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.320 align:middle line:84%
controlled, these people
have been trained,

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.450 align:middle line:84%
these people have been
hypnotized to do these things.

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:07.772 align:middle line:84%
And as I've told so many people,
not everything is a conspiracy.

00:15:07.772 --> 00:15:08.480 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Right.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You do have to
look at the possibilities.

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And is there any
question that government

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.280 align:middle line:84%
is taking advantage of
episodes that occur?

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.190 align:middle line:90%
Obviously they are.

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:23.320 align:middle line:84%
But in cases like that, why
do people rush to conclusion

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:28.010 align:middle line:84%
that everything that has
occurred the person involved

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:29.589 align:middle line:90%
has been mind controlled?

00:15:29.589 --> 00:15:31.380 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: I think
there's several reasons.

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:32.480 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I
think more people

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.820 align:middle line:84%
realize that the technology's
out there to do this.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And so people kind
of drift that way.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.650 align:middle line:84%
The other is for most
people it's so horrendous.

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:42.814 align:middle line:84%
We can't imagine it happening
by someone's choice.

00:15:42.814 --> 00:15:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.771 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: And I think that
really is part of that sort

00:15:45.771 --> 00:15:47.770 align:middle line:84%
of wrestling with our
own set of values.

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:50.260 align:middle line:84%
But you can't measure
your set of values

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.865 align:middle line:84%
against another person,
because everyone has their own.

00:15:52.865 --> 00:15:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: And unfortunately,
the fact that the technology

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:58.670 align:middle line:84%
does exist and government
does take advantage--

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:01.150 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing that happens
that there's not a contingency

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:03.035 align:middle line:90%
plan to pull out.

00:16:03.035 --> 00:16:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Being in a political family for
my whole life, I can tell you--

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.110 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's all laid out.

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:09.651 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: It's all laid out,
and there's always opportunity.

00:16:09.651 --> 00:16:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And so these become
opportunities

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:12.970 align:middle line:84%
for various interests
to exploit for

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:14.560 align:middle line:90%
their own political purposes.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.300 align:middle line:84%
The idea of exploiting
mind control technologies

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.700 align:middle line:84%
for political
purposes was a subject

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:23.420 align:middle line:84%
of Zbigniew Brzezinski, who
was once national security

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.070 align:middle line:90%
adviser to Carter.

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:26.960 align:middle line:84%
While at Columbia
University, he had

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.730 align:middle line:84%
written a book called
"Between Two Ages,"

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:30.690 align:middle line:84%
and he actually
talked about the idea

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:32.440 align:middle line:90%
of manipulating human behavior.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And he was quoting
from an earlier work

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:38.190 align:middle line:84%
by a geophysicist at UCLA,
JF Gordon MacDonald, who

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:41.700 align:middle line:84%
had written that if we could
ever figure out, for instance,

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.880 align:middle line:84%
how to stroke the ionosphere
in just the right way,

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.035 align:middle line:84%
we'd return this to the
Earth that would manipulate

00:16:46.035 --> 00:16:47.660 align:middle line:84%
the behavior of people
over huge areas.

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:48.770 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They'd
love to do that.

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: And
they would love it.

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:50.180 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:51.805 align:middle line:84%
They actually created
that technology,

00:16:51.805 --> 00:16:53.180 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
HAARP technology--

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:54.540 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Which we'll
talk about in a second.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.527 align:middle line:84%
Let's take another
question for Nick Begich.

00:16:56.527 --> 00:16:57.110 align:middle line:90%
Who's got one?

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:58.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes, right there.

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I was wondering
if you are able to tell--

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.460 align:middle line:84%
because in the
pawns of the brain,

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.140 align:middle line:84%
for these serial killers
and mass murders and people,

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:10.230 align:middle line:84%
there's actually a difference
that you can tell on the MRIs.

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.329 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't sure
with mind control

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:14.280 align:middle line:84%
if people are victims
of that if they're

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.604 align:middle line:84%
able to do imaging of the
brain with the new advances

00:17:17.604 --> 00:17:19.770 align:middle line:84%
that we've had, like with
the PET imaging and things

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:23.650 align:middle line:84%
like that, to where you can
actually see the differences.

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:26.030 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: I don't know
that you would actually--

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:29.020 align:middle line:84%
if you had a system operating
and you were trying to monitor

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.630 align:middle line:84%
whether you were
being controlled,

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:middle line:84%
any operator's going to
shut that system down.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:37.650 align:middle line:84%
That's the dilemma is how
do you match the operator

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:40.700 align:middle line:84%
against the victim
of a technology?

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.080 align:middle line:90%
And so I would say probably not.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.850 align:middle line:84%
They use advanced
imaging in modeling

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:48.520 align:middle line:84%
the brain now for development
of gaming, for instance.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And so when people
are developing games

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.570 align:middle line:84%
that kids are playing, they're
stimulating certain portions

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:55.950 align:middle line:84%
of the brain that are also
the same portions of the brain

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:59.810 align:middle line:84%
associated with sex drive,
addictive behaviors.

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:03.914 align:middle line:84%
So they actually make games
that are no longer beta tested

00:18:03.914 --> 00:18:06.080 align:middle line:84%
in the traditional sense
of answering questionnaires

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.510 align:middle line:84%
but by imaging the
brain in real time.

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:11.070 align:middle line:84%
As a form of mind control, I
think we have to consider that.

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:14.804 align:middle line:84%
Because the effect on young
people in desensitizing them

00:18:14.804 --> 00:18:17.470 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time stimulating
this kind of addictive behavior

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:19.360 align:middle line:84%
for commercial
purposes is something

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.180 align:middle line:90%
that ought to be restricted.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And Nick, since the
beginning of time, mankind has,

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:28.030 align:middle line:84%
even without technology,
tried to manipulate the mind.

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:29.010 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Sure.

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Whether it's
somebody who's a control freak

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.990 align:middle line:84%
or an advertising agency
that wants to sell a product

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:40.680 align:middle line:84%
or subliminal messaging, the aim
is to control the human mind.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And they have become experts
at this, haven't they?

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:43.778 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Right.

00:18:43.778 --> 00:18:47.135 align:middle line:84%
In fact, even with media, in
most schools of psychology

00:18:47.135 --> 00:18:49.710 align:middle line:84%
they teach what's called
Frequency Following Response,

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:53.060 align:middle line:84%
or FFR, where an external
signal you'll lock onto,

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:56.220 align:middle line:84%
and then your brain will
fall into a parallel state,

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:59.110 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, with
flickering light.

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
your television screen

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.390 align:middle line:84%
when it's playing and you look
at the white wall behind you,

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:04.330 align:middle line:90%
you'll get a flicker rate.

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:04.955 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:19:04.955 --> 00:19:07.700 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: If you can hold that
flicker rate for about 20 or 30

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.119 align:middle line:84%
seconds in a specific
frequency range--

00:19:10.119 --> 00:19:11.660 align:middle line:84%
and when a person's
in front of a TV,

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:15.102 align:middle line:84%
many people are in a
semi-trance state anyway.

00:19:15.102 --> 00:19:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Glued to
the television, right?

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:18.275 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: Well, and your
spouse is yelling at you and you

00:19:18.275 --> 00:19:21.160 align:middle line:84%
don't even hear them, because
you are in a very light trance.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, at that
point an advertiser

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:25.690 align:middle line:84%
by just affecting
the lighting can

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:27.852 align:middle line:84%
anchor the message
much more profoundly.

00:19:27.852 --> 00:19:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And they use this, because
it's not restricted.

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:30.820 align:middle line:90%
There's no law against it.

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:31.050 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Exactly.

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:33.508 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: But when you talk
about political campaigns that

00:19:33.508 --> 00:19:37.060 align:middle line:84%
are very close or you talk about
advertising wanting to push you

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.460 align:middle line:84%
to make a decision between
Product A or Product B,

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.010 align:middle line:90%
very effective technology.

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:42.520 align:middle line:90%
And that is why it's used.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:43.100 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's a science.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.465 align:middle line:84%
It's an incredible
science now, isn't it?

00:19:44.465 --> 00:19:45.506 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Absolutely is.

00:19:45.506 --> 00:19:46.410 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely is.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And when you think about
Frequency Following Response

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:51.780 align:middle line:84%
just as a triggering
event, many remember

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:56.250 align:middle line:84%
back several years ago there
was an event in Japan where

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:58.639 align:middle line:84%
kids were watching a cartoon
and then 700 kids went to--

00:19:58.639 --> 00:20:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They got
sick, didn't they?

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:00.420 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Yeah.

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:01.210 align:middle line:90%
They had epileptic seizures.

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:01.690 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I remember that.

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: And it was the
flicker rate was held just long

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:07.840 align:middle line:84%
enough to trigger that kind
of an episode in really masses

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:08.340 align:middle line:90%
of children.

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.631 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And they knew that
could happen, didn't they?

00:20:10.631 --> 00:20:11.330 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Sure.

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:14.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that phenomenon,
people with epilepsy

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.200 align:middle line:84%
are told don't go into
clubs with flickering

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.220 align:middle line:84%
light and the strobes and this
kind of thing for that reason.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.950 align:middle line:84%
But not even
something so intense,

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:25.000 align:middle line:84%
just the flicker
rate of a cartoon.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.289 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:20:26.289 --> 00:20:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: I know
Persinger did some work--

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:28.375 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Remarkable.

00:20:28.375 --> 00:20:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: --at Laurentian
University where he said you

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.920 align:middle line:84%
could put a signal out in the
airwaves that would create

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.810 align:middle line:84%
a general sense of sort
of dis-ease or anxiety.

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And then just by running
the normal news broadcast

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:39.790 align:middle line:84%
and pumping in a
press release that

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:41.870 align:middle line:84%
indicts some specific
group for being

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:44.830 align:middle line:84%
responsible for your ills, a
certain amount of that anxiety

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:45.790 align:middle line:90%
gets directed that way.

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So you create an opportunity
to push public opinion

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.010 align:middle line:84%
in a specific direction,
and that is control.

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And the temptation to
use this technology

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:56.747 align:middle line:84%
by the Left or the Right,
they use different rationale

00:20:56.747 --> 00:20:59.080 align:middle line:84%
for doing it, but it's really
to further political ends.

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
the temptation lies,

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.410 align:middle line:84%
and that's where the risk lies
for the general population.

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When we first met,
we were talking about your work

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:06.650 align:middle line:90%
HAARP.

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:07.358 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Right.

00:21:07.358 --> 00:21:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: "Angels
Don't Play This HAARP,"

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:13.570 align:middle line:84%
this array of
whatever in Alaska,

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:15.625 align:middle line:84%
and there are few more
now around the country

00:21:15.625 --> 00:21:16.500 align:middle line:90%
and the world, right?

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:17.830 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Right.

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Exactly what
does HAARP stand for?

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:22.410 align:middle line:90%
H-A-A-R-P.

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:23.170 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Right.

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:25.560 align:middle line:84%
It's the High Frequency Active
Auroral Research Project,

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:29.240 align:middle line:90%
and it has a very broad mission.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:33.452 align:middle line:84%
But one of the effects
is what's called

00:21:33.452 --> 00:21:34.910 align:middle line:84%
Earth-penetrating
tomography, which

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:36.820 align:middle line:84%
happens to work within
the same frequency

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.160 align:middle line:84%
range as predominant
brainwave activity.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And this is where they use
a signal-- high frequency

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:45.920 align:middle line:84%
signal is literally pulsed
into the ionosphere, which

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.830 align:middle line:84%
is about 30 miles above
the Earth's surface.

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:49.540 align:middle line:84%
It begins to punch
the ionosphere,

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.440 align:middle line:84%
and as it does the
ionosphere begins

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.235 align:middle line:84%
to vibrate in harmony with
that punch or that pulse rate.

00:21:54.235 --> 00:21:55.110 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Boom, boom.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.390 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Right.

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And now that changes
the ionosphere.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:00.440 align:middle line:84%
This electromagnetic
layer begins

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.600 align:middle line:84%
to act as a broadcast
antenna, sends

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.030 align:middle line:84%
an ELF, an Extremely
Low Frequency signal,

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:06.800 align:middle line:90%
back through the Earth and sea.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.180 align:middle line:84%
But that same ELF can
couple with the human mind

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.990 align:middle line:84%
in a way that changes people's
emotional state from highly

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:16.650 align:middle line:90%
passive to aggressive.

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:18.974 align:middle line:84%
And this is what Persinger
was talking about,

00:22:18.974 --> 00:22:19.890 align:middle line:90%
this kind of a signal.

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:23.450 align:middle line:84%
This is what JF Gordon
MacDonald at UCLA in the '60s

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:25.040 align:middle line:84%
was talking about
and what Brzezinski

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.520 align:middle line:84%
was talking about
in his writings.

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:29.920 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What is the range
of this bombardment up there?

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.765 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: Oh, this
hit thousands of miles,

00:22:32.765 --> 00:22:34.390 align:middle line:84%
when you talk about
when it comes back.

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So it could blanket
the whole country, basically.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:36.776 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Absolutely.

00:22:36.776 --> 00:22:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's on a
hemispheric basis.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.410 align:middle line:90%
And this is huge possibility.

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And the research says
it'll affect probably

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:46.240 align:middle line:90%
70% of the population.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.490 align:middle line:84%
At least that's what's
in the public domain.

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And there's probably
some reasons for that.

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Signals that are close in, that
are close in and more intense,

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.190 align:middle line:84%
the body will tend
to lock onto those

00:22:56.190 --> 00:23:00.730 align:middle line:84%
and ignore background noise in
the room, the weaker signals.

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:02.310 align:middle line:84%
But in the general
population, this

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:03.810 align:middle line:84%
would have a pretty
profound effect.

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Why Alaska?

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:05.470 align:middle line:90%
Why'd they build it there?

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:07.845 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: Well, they built
it there for several reasons.

00:23:07.845 --> 00:23:10.220 align:middle line:84%
One, you need enormous
supplies of fuel

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.380 align:middle line:84%
as you expand this
array across the Arctic.

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.150 align:middle line:84%
The other is you want
to be close to where

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:16.360 align:middle line:84%
the magnetic field lines
intersect the Earth for some

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.720 align:middle line:84%
of the other applications
of this technology.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And if you remember
from high school

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:23.675 align:middle line:84%
how a bar magnet has those
magnetic field lines,

00:23:23.675 --> 00:23:25.270 align:middle line:90%
well, the Earth does also.

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Those lines enter at
the polar regions,

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:29.100 align:middle line:84%
and so the closer you
get, the less energy you

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.500 align:middle line:84%
need to pump into those
magnetic field lines.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:34.496 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What was the original
intent, Nick, for this?

00:23:34.496 --> 00:23:35.370 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: For HAARP?

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:36.030 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:39.890 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: HAARP was
designed by Dr. Ben Eastlund,

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:42.830 align:middle line:84%
who up until his death we had
become fairly good friends.

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:45.000 align:middle line:84%
But it was really
for a weapon shield.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.260 align:middle line:84%
This idea of plugging energy
into the magnetic field lines

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.540 align:middle line:84%
and then being able to
use them as wave guides

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.550 align:middle line:84%
to send energy around
the Earth would

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:54.400 align:middle line:84%
create an energetic
shield so that

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.850 align:middle line:84%
intercontinental
ballistic missiles passing

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:58.952 align:middle line:84%
through that energy
field would be disrupted

00:23:58.952 --> 00:24:01.410 align:middle line:84%
in terms of their avionics,
things that control the flight,

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:02.040 align:middle line:90%
and they would crash.

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of
where it started.

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:07.090 align:middle line:84%
But then there were a
myriad other applications

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:09.040 align:middle line:84%
that were developed in
conjunction with that.

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And Eastlund got very interested
in the mind effects issue

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:14.900 align:middle line:84%
when he approached Tony
Tether, who at the time

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:16.321 align:middle line:90%
was the head of DARPA.

00:24:16.321 --> 00:24:17.820 align:middle line:84%
They were friends,
and he brought up

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:21.090 align:middle line:84%
this mind control
idea and this issue.

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And what he said to me is
no one's laughing at DARPA

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:24.350 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:25.162 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Ah ha.

00:24:25.162 --> 00:24:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: And then he
participated in a closed

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.820 align:middle line:84%
conference on mind effects
when I was executive director

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:32.750 align:middle line:84%
of the Lay Institute that we put
together in Dallas along with

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:35.400 align:middle line:84%
a lot of experts from
around the world.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.490 align:middle line:90%
It is no laughing matter.

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:40.730 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the next leap that
every one of these scientists

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:44.110 align:middle line:84%
agree was coming is
sort of this opening

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:46.270 align:middle line:84%
of the human mind to
these higher capabilities

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:48.020 align:middle line:84%
that I'm sure we'll
get to in the program.

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did they know when
they turned HAARP on that it

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:52.872 align:middle line:90%
could affect the human mind?

00:24:52.872 --> 00:24:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: I absolutely
believe they did.

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And when the program manager
was approached with this

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:01.120 align:middle line:84%
by CBC TV in
Canada, he basically

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.890 align:middle line:84%
said we're not
concerned about that.

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:04.420 align:middle line:90%
It's a side effect.

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:05.970 align:middle line:84%
We're operating
within the frequency

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:07.550 align:middle line:84%
range we've been
granted, and we're

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:09.970 align:middle line:84%
operating within the power
rangers we've been authorized.

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:12.500 align:middle line:84%
The fact is they've exceeded
those power ranges from time

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:17.560 align:middle line:84%
to time and violated their
own permits from time to time.

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And they've claimed, oh, sorry,
yeah, we won't do it again.

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:24.690 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is, as a side
effect or deliberate affect,

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:26.852 align:middle line:90%
the problem is still there.

00:25:26.852 --> 00:25:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How often do
they turn this thing on?

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:31.090 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: HAARP
is intermittent.

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Many people are
under the impression

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:33.465 align:middle line:90%
it runs all the time.

00:25:33.465 --> 00:25:34.250 align:middle line:90%
It does not.

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:36.480 align:middle line:84%
They use it for
specific campaigns.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.576 align:middle line:84%
It's open to academics in
various branches of research

00:25:39.576 --> 00:25:40.950 align:middle line:84%
from around the
world, because it

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:43.000 align:middle line:90%
is a developmental prototype.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.340 align:middle line:90%
So it was the first one of many.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:47.672 align:middle line:84%
They have now several of
these around the world.

00:25:47.672 --> 00:25:49.130 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And more
advanced, I bet.

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:50.588 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: Very
much more advanced.

00:25:50.588 --> 00:25:52.650 align:middle line:84%
In fact, just since
HAARP was developed,

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:55.540 align:middle line:84%
the size of the arrays
originally anticipated

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:59.950 align:middle line:84%
have shrunk by kilometers
to be just as effective

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:02.350 align:middle line:84%
at the smaller level as
they were anticipated

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:03.815 align:middle line:90%
on a much larger scale.

00:26:03.815 --> 00:26:05.250 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's dramatic.

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:07.970 align:middle line:84%
It's dramatic what they do
and what they have out there.

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:10.239 align:middle line:84%
Do we know when
HAARP is turned on?

00:26:10.239 --> 00:26:12.530 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: Well, if the people
were monitoring the high

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:15.730 align:middle line:84%
frequency signal and the broad
range of signals that are

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:17.830 align:middle line:84%
generated-- is it
primary or secondary?--

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:21.405 align:middle line:84%
it covers 16 decades, which
is from ultra low frequency

00:26:21.405 --> 00:26:22.260 align:middle line:90%
to visible light.

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:23.920 align:middle line:84%
This is all the
things that we're

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.700 align:middle line:84%
familiar from radio, TV,
everything in between.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:31.270 align:middle line:84%
To monitor that would take a
pretty sophisticated setup.

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And to my knowledge, to
monitor that whole system,

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.790 align:middle line:84%
no one's really
doing that, maybe

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:38.040 align:middle line:84%
our adversaries, but certainly
not anybody independent

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:38.890 align:middle line:90%
that I'm aware of.

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What about
weather manipulation, Nick?

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:42.610 align:middle line:84%
Does it have anything
to do with that?

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:43.276 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Yeah.

00:26:43.276 --> 00:26:44.710 align:middle line:90%
This is an issue that comes up.

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:46.626 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the other
things that Ben Eastlund

00:26:46.626 --> 00:26:48.510 align:middle line:84%
in his patents
originally talked about.

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:50.880 align:middle line:84%
They thought it would
take a much larger array.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Prior do his death in
2005, he did a paper

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:58.710 align:middle line:84%
for University of Pennsylvania
on weather modification,

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:01.910 align:middle line:84%
utilizing systems like HAARP
and HAARP specifically.

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:08.171 align:middle line:84%
And what he said is it needs
1,600 times less energy--

00:27:08.171 --> 00:27:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: To
manipulate the weather.

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:11.830 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: --than he originally
anticipated when he first

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:12.360 align:middle line:90%
designed it.

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:16.890 align:middle line:84%
So the technology had advanced
between the '80s and 2005

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:20.960 align:middle line:84%
to the point where 1,600
times less energy to affect

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.885 align:middle line:84%
gravitational waves that then
would drive weather systems

00:27:23.885 --> 00:27:24.910 align:middle line:90%
and weather patterns.

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:25.890 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely yes.

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:28.480 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Some people believe
that HAARP is used to create

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.520 align:middle line:90%
earthquakes in other countries.

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:31.029 align:middle line:90%
Possible?

00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:32.070 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: It's possible.

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:35.250 align:middle line:84%
This comes, again, from
some of the research.

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Actually, when Secretary
of Defense William Cohen

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:43.220 align:middle line:84%
was in office, April 27, 1997
he did a DOD news briefing right

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:45.160 align:middle line:84%
after a lecture on
international terrorism

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.980 align:middle line:84%
and weapons of mass destruction
at the University of Georgia

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:50.310 align:middle line:84%
where he said that even
terrorist states were

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:52.650 align:middle line:84%
developing technologies
where they could trigger

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:56.680 align:middle line:84%
volcanic eruptions, earthquakes,
or weather modification

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.610 align:middle line:90%
utilizing electromagnetic waves.

00:27:58.610 --> 00:27:59.940 align:middle line:90%
And this is the stuff of HAARP.

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:04.820 align:middle line:84%
We used actually that
material in the course

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:07.320 align:middle line:84%
of raising this issue
throughout Europe,

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.830 align:middle line:84%
and of course, we had some
success in Europe on this.

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What's amazing,
so many people probably

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:15.150 align:middle line:90%
aren't even aware of HAARP.

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:17.000 align:middle line:84%
I know people who
watch this show, people

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.052 align:middle line:84%
who listen to Coast to
Coast, they're in on it.

00:28:19.052 --> 00:28:19.760 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Right.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They know
what's going on.

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:21.648 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Right.

00:28:21.648 --> 00:28:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But I would say that
most Americans, most Canadians,

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:29.131 align:middle line:84%
most people on this planet
would have no idea what's going

00:28:29.131 --> 00:28:29.630 align:middle line:90%
on here.

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:30.170 align:middle line:90%
Would you agree?

00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:31.420 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: I absolutely agree.

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And we've been at this a
long time on these issues,

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:40.490 align:middle line:84%
now 17 years, and I've done
3,000 radio broadcasts,

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:42.360 align:middle line:84%
80 of them with
you guys at Coast,

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:46.310 align:middle line:84%
and lots of television, lots
of things, and lots of print,

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:49.900 align:middle line:84%
but these kinds of issues just
escape most people's attention.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:50.750 align:middle line:90%
It's technical.

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:52.400 align:middle line:90%
People kind of ignore it.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.710 align:middle line:84%
But in our societies
and our cultures today,

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:56.330 align:middle line:84%
having a base
knowledge of science

00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:57.520 align:middle line:90%
is incredibly important.

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.300 align:middle line:84%
What makes governments
powerful in the 21st century

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:02.490 align:middle line:84%
is command and control
of high technology.

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:04.520 align:middle line:84%
When you think of the Congress,
when you think of the Senate,

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.910 align:middle line:84%
how many scientists do we have
there making the decisions

00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:08.065 align:middle line:90%
for us?

00:29:08.065 --> 00:29:08.940 align:middle line:90%
None, virtually none.

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:12.650 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: This is a problem
in a technological world where

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:14.402 align:middle line:90%
so much is driven by technology.

00:29:14.402 --> 00:29:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You know how sometimes
in the morning you wake up

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:18.250 align:middle line:90%
and you just feel great, right?

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Right.

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:22.370 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And then other days
you feel a little sluggish.

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:25.650 align:middle line:84%
You just feel like you're
off kilter a little bit.

00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Could it be because technology
like HAARP is turned on

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:32.274 align:middle line:90%
and it's affecting us somehow?

00:29:32.274 --> 00:29:33.190 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Absolutely.

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:37.015 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the idea that this
is being tested generally,

00:29:37.015 --> 00:29:38.890 align:middle line:84%
it's being tested by
not just our government.

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:41.115 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese government
has advanced technologies

00:29:41.115 --> 00:29:41.900 align:middle line:90%
in this area.

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:45.790 align:middle line:84%
The CIA released some documents
from their military journals

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:46.990 align:middle line:90%
that were pretty revealing.

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:48.780 align:middle line:90%
They parallel us exactly.

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.750 align:middle line:84%
The Russians
actually pre-date us

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:53.050 align:middle line:84%
on a lot of this technology
because of the method

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:55.320 align:middle line:84%
in which they integrated
their science.

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:58.280 align:middle line:84%
But they're the leaders in
this type of technology.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.451 align:middle line:84%
And when you think about
it, people sort of downplay

00:30:00.451 --> 00:30:01.825 align:middle line:84%
these countries
and say, oh, they

00:30:01.825 --> 00:30:03.658 align:middle line:84%
don't have that much
money in their budgets.

00:30:03.658 --> 00:30:04.640 align:middle line:90%
It's not a big deal.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:09.310 align:middle line:84%
But look at what you buy in
China for the same dollar.

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:12.000 align:middle line:84%
You get a technician over
there for $1,000 a month,

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.530 align:middle line:84%
maybe if they're lucky, that
you might pay $10,000 a month

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:17.010 align:middle line:90%
for same skill set in the US.

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:19.030 align:middle line:84%
So you get a lot more
bang for your buck.

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:20.530 align:middle line:84%
You've got a
centralized government.

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:22.620 align:middle line:84%
You've got centralized
intelligence, really,

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.470 align:middle line:84%
because the brightest
minds end up

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:28.170 align:middle line:84%
in these kinds of fields working
for military applications.

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:30.410 align:middle line:84%
In the US, our
government does not

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:33.590 align:middle line:84%
engage in fundamental
research by military budgets

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:36.100 align:middle line:84%
for anything but
military applications,

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.230 align:middle line:90%
not for basic science.

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is where this issue
has become increasingly more

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:44.670 align:middle line:84%
important for the general public
because the science is being

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:48.450 align:middle line:84%
advanced also by private parties
and non-governmental entities.

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is there something
that could go wrong with HAARP

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:56.010 align:middle line:84%
or mind control technology
with the dark side of some kind

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:58.339 align:middle line:90%
of horrible mistake?

00:30:58.339 --> 00:31:00.130 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: There's
always that possibility.

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:03.790 align:middle line:84%
The idea that operators
are experimenting

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:06.440 align:middle line:84%
without constraint, the
fact that it happens.

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:09.910 align:middle line:84%
Secretary of Energy O'Leary said
over half a million US victims

00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:12.920 align:middle line:84%
of human experimentation
in the United States

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:16.010 align:middle line:84%
never notified, never talked
to, never consented to.

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:20.380 align:middle line:84%
The fact that they would
experiment on mass populations,

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:21.300 align:middle line:90%
this is the case.

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And the rationale is, oh, but
the aftereffect is harmless.

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:26.850 align:middle line:84%
The triggering
effect, suppose you

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:29.240 align:middle line:84%
create a general
sense of anxiety

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.490 align:middle line:84%
when there's other
events going on,

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and then you trigger
perhaps a riot,

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:36.540 align:middle line:84%
just because the tension's
already building,

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:39.840 align:middle line:84%
and then you add that extra
straw on the camel's back.

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Those are the kinds
of things that

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:43.950 align:middle line:84%
would be highly
disconcerting to all of us.

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We used to laugh when
people would say I hear voices.

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:48.579 align:middle line:90%
I hear voices.

00:31:48.579 --> 00:31:49.620 align:middle line:90%
People are talking to me.

00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:51.431 align:middle line:90%
You thought they were nuts.

00:31:51.431 --> 00:31:52.680 align:middle line:90%
I don't laugh at that anymore.

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.263 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: No.

00:31:53.263 --> 00:31:55.040 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's
some good technology,

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.540 align:middle line:84%
and later in the
program we're going

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:59.110 align:middle line:84%
to demonstrate some
that's hardwired.

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:04.680 align:middle line:84%
But Woody Norris was a scientist
that won the MIT-Lemelson Award

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:07.280 align:middle line:84%
in 2005, I believe
it was, and it

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:10.106 align:middle line:90%
was for acoustic heterodyning.

00:32:10.106 --> 00:32:11.730 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did he
invent the flying car?

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:12.640 align:middle line:90%
Was that the same guy?

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: I don't know
if it's the same guy.

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:14.720 align:middle line:90%
He's pretty prolific inventor.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:15.803 align:middle line:90%
He's done a lot of things.

00:32:15.803 --> 00:32:19.374 align:middle line:84%
But in this technology, he could
send a signal across a room,

00:32:19.374 --> 00:32:21.290 align:middle line:84%
hitting a particular
person in your audience--

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Aim right at them.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: --aim right at them,
and they would hear a voice

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:24.993 align:middle line:90%
in their head.

00:32:24.993 --> 00:32:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And they sold that
technology or licensed it

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:30.632 align:middle line:84%
to the military
for security fences

00:32:30.632 --> 00:32:32.340 align:middle line:84%
so that when you got
into a certain range

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:35.494 align:middle line:84%
you'd hear this voice from
nowhere telling you what to do.

00:32:35.494 --> 00:32:37.410 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You would think
it was godly, right?

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:38.394 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Absolutely.

00:32:38.394 --> 00:32:38.935 align:middle line:90%
And internal.

00:32:38.935 --> 00:32:41.980 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't originate
here with the ears,

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:43.850 align:middle line:90%
so it's like it's in your head.

00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:46.160 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, when we
think as human beings,

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:48.300 align:middle line:84%
whether you're driving
a car or whatever,

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:53.060 align:middle line:84%
that person who is you, you can
hear that voice talking to you,

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:53.560 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:57.470 align:middle line:84%
When you make a right-hand
turn and you do it naturally,

00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:00.550 align:middle line:84%
but you can sometimes hear
your voice of yourself just

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:03.310 align:middle line:90%
saying turn or do this, do that.

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:05.232 align:middle line:90%
Is it that kind of thing?

00:33:05.232 --> 00:33:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: It could
be as subtle as that.

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:10.870 align:middle line:84%
It could even be below the
level of conscious awareness

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:12.280 align:middle line:84%
and still have a
profound effect.

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.915 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there was a technology
used to dissuade shoplifters.

00:33:14.915 --> 00:33:16.280 align:middle line:90%
It was used in Japan.

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:19.525 align:middle line:84%
And in seven languages
they had these messages.

00:33:19.525 --> 00:33:20.150 align:middle line:90%
And they were--

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Bombarding them.

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:22.416 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: --below
the level of hearing,

00:33:22.416 --> 00:33:23.900 align:middle line:84%
so you didn't really
perceive them.

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:26.320 align:middle line:84%
But they had a 40%
reduction in theft.

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Amazing.

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:28.360 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: And so it works.

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:29.670 align:middle line:90%
Now why only 40%?

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:33.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, most theft, people
say, in shoplifting

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:34.795 align:middle line:84%
is professional
gangs who've already

00:33:34.795 --> 00:33:36.170 align:middle line:90%
suspended their consciousness.

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:37.740 align:middle line:84%
They've already
made the decision.

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:38.570 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They're
there to steal.

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:40.528 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: They don't
care what the message is.

00:33:40.528 --> 00:33:43.520 align:middle line:84%
The other 40% is probably
people, mostly children,

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:45.960 align:middle line:84%
young people, who are making
bad decisions who still have

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.095 align:middle line:84%
a consciousness that's
working that says,

00:33:48.095 --> 00:33:49.120 align:middle line:90%
oh, I shouldn't do this.

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And then they get the message
in their own language saying

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:52.276 align:middle line:90%
don't do it, and they don't.

00:33:52.276 --> 00:33:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Could you bombard
people if you wanted to make

00:33:55.060 --> 00:34:00.790 align:middle line:84%
them go home early, curfews
for example, and just shoot it,

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:04.140 align:middle line:84%
go home, get off the street
without a big megaphone?

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:05.999 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: You could
do all of that,

00:34:05.999 --> 00:34:07.540 align:middle line:84%
and you would have
a profound effect.

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:09.998 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure it would parallel
the same kind of effect they

00:34:09.998 --> 00:34:11.299 align:middle line:90%
had.

00:34:11.299 --> 00:34:12.340 align:middle line:90%
Some people aren't going.

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:14.260 align:middle line:90%
They're not going to cooperate.

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.230 align:middle line:84%
But I think that is
exactly the case.

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:17.954 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
it on a mass scale,

00:34:17.954 --> 00:34:20.120 align:middle line:84%
again when you think about
it from advertising, when

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.690 align:middle line:84%
you think about it from--
for political purposes,

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:26.290 align:middle line:84%
or, say, in a situation
where general unrest,

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:28.610 align:middle line:84%
would our government use
that to calm a population?

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:30.230 align:middle line:90%
I think absolutely yes.

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:31.639 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt in my mind.

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:36.090 align:middle line:84%
Coming out of government, two
generations of government,

00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:37.350 align:middle line:90%
they would indeed.

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Because it's considered less
intrusive than tear gas,

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.929 align:middle line:84%
where people do die from
that, have lung disorders--

00:34:43.929 --> 00:34:44.090 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Exactly.

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:44.400 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: --and so on.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Does not
knock down buildings.

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:46.912 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Right.

00:34:46.912 --> 00:34:48.370 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
rebuild anything.

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Exactly.

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: From a
lot of perspectives,

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.929 align:middle line:90%
this is the idealized weapon.

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:56.640 align:middle line:84%
Even during the first Gulf
War, and if you remember in

00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:58.890 align:middle line:84%
that there was, I think it
was the fourth largest army

00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:01.505 align:middle line:84%
in the world at the time, and
they were giving up en masse.

00:35:01.505 --> 00:35:02.750 align:middle line:90%
No one could figure it out.

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And it was Scottish
media that reported

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:07.380 align:middle line:84%
that we used a signal
that we embedded

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:09.897 align:middle line:84%
on the broadcast bringing
the Muslim music and prayers

00:35:09.897 --> 00:35:11.730 align:middle line:84%
that they were all
listening to that created

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:14.610 align:middle line:84%
a general sense of anxiety
and fear to the point

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:17.934 align:middle line:84%
where people were surrendering
en masse to two or three--

00:35:17.934 --> 00:35:19.100 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Just giving it up.

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Just giving it up.

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:20.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That was
amazing technology.

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: And that
is a technology.

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Have we gotten
too far technologically?

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:25.810 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: I think we have.

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:27.910 align:middle line:84%
I think the domain of
interfering with human brain

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:30.830 align:middle line:84%
performance, it's a
violation of free will.

00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:34.260 align:middle line:84%
Most religious traditions say
that God won't even do that,

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:37.580 align:middle line:84%
and yet here's man playing
with the consciousness

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:39.420 align:middle line:84%
of other individuals
without their consent.

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:43.990 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the greatest
threat to freedom, to liberty,

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:48.840 align:middle line:84%
to the things that we hold
sacred in this country,

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:51.680 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's the wrong
direction for government to go.

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And it also, because
it's classified

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:58.120 align:middle line:84%
it denies other researchers
in the health sciences

00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.670 align:middle line:84%
opportunities to
access information

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:02.790 align:middle line:84%
that might help address brain
disorders, other things.

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:05.290 align:middle line:84%
Because we're learning a lot,
and then we're classifying it.

00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:07.120 align:middle line:90%
That's a big loss.

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And then we're not having
the public debate about where

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:12.390 align:middle line:84%
this technology really fits
in, like we are about privacy

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:14.850 align:middle line:84%
issues today and beginning
that more lively debate.

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:17.410 align:middle line:84%
These are fundamental
privacy issues.

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:20.390 align:middle line:84%
This is the root of all
privacy, is the human mind.

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The president wants
to spend $100 million on brain

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:25.070 align:middle line:90%
research.

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Right.

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.820 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: One would
say, hey, this is great.

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:31.632 align:middle line:84%
Another thought would
be, what's going on here?

00:36:31.632 --> 00:36:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Right.

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I suspect everything
we've talked about right now is

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:38.040 align:middle line:90%
primarily black ops budgets?

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.230 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Yeah, it is.

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:middle line:84%
In fact, back in the '90s
up to 40% of the equipment

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.280 align:middle line:84%
budget for the Air
Force was black,

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.779 align:middle line:84%
where even the Congress didn't
know what they were funding.

00:36:46.779 --> 00:36:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And here's the thing about
when the Congress goes

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:52.300 align:middle line:84%
into these closed hearings
that are classified hearings,

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:53.710 align:middle line:90%
they can't bring their staff.

00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:55.180 align:middle line:90%
They can't take notes.

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:57.906 align:middle line:84%
They can't talk about
this to anyone else.

00:36:57.906 --> 00:36:59.364 align:middle line:84%
So here we have a
bunch of people--

00:36:59.364 --> 00:37:00.860 align:middle line:84%
it would be the equivalent
of putting a five-year-old

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:02.670 align:middle line:84%
in the room, because they don't
have the technical knowledge

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:05.140 align:middle line:84%
even to challenge what
they're being presented

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:07.410 align:middle line:84%
and ask the kind of
questions that we

00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:09.230 align:middle line:84%
expect our
representatives to ask.

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:10.730 align:middle line:90%
This is where the hole is.

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:13.330 align:middle line:84%
The secrecy syndrome
has driven us completely

00:37:13.330 --> 00:37:16.490 align:middle line:84%
in the wrong direction without
the experts in the right place

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:18.870 align:middle line:84%
with the right power
to make the judgments.

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And so it's left
to bureaucracies

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:21.890 align:middle line:90%
to make those judgments.

00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And their mission,
the military's mission

00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:25.394 align:middle line:90%
is a paranoid mission.

00:37:25.394 --> 00:37:27.060 align:middle line:84%
People who would deal
with these issues,

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:28.184 align:middle line:90%
we're always accusing them.

00:37:28.184 --> 00:37:29.250 align:middle line:90%
You're paranoid.

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:32.110 align:middle line:84%
The military's job is to look
at every possibility that

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:35.400 align:middle line:84%
can come against the country
and devise a plan against it.

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.870 align:middle line:90%
That's paranoid thinking.

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:39.380 align:middle line:84%
That's why we keep the
military in the closet

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:42.480 align:middle line:84%
and the civilian sector in
this country makes decisions.

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.170 align:middle line:84%
But how can you make
decisions and how

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:46.207 align:middle line:84%
can you hold them accountable
when you can't ask

00:37:46.207 --> 00:37:47.040 align:middle line:90%
the right questions?

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Or you even
know what's going on.

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:49.320 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Right.

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.260 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How about the senator?

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:51.190 align:middle line:90%
How does he react?

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Knowing you, you're his
brother and all this knowledge

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:57.341 align:middle line:84%
that you possess,
what does he do?

00:37:57.341 --> 00:37:58.340 align:middle line:90%
How does he handle that?

00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: Well,
Mark is a freshman.

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.950 align:middle line:84%
He's up for
re-election next year.

00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:04.040 align:middle line:84%
I think with his
re-election he's

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.920 align:middle line:90%
established his credibility.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.230 align:middle line:84%
What we've talked
about a lot is the idea

00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:10.290 align:middle line:90%
of bringing forward the science.

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And some of his colleagues
have asked for our information.

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:14.300 align:middle line:90%
We've passed it on.

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:16.850 align:middle line:84%
I think that's eventually
going to happen.

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:18.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a controversial issue.

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:18.500 align:middle line:90%
It's going to take--

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:18.710 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's huge.

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: --a lot of work.

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:20.566 align:middle line:84%
And it is something
that you can't

00:38:20.566 --> 00:38:24.614 align:middle line:84%
do without now
non-governmental organizations.

00:38:24.614 --> 00:38:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.821 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: Because you've got
535 people you got to establish

00:38:27.821 --> 00:38:28.870 align:middle line:90%
communication with.

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:31.329 align:middle line:84%
That's a big task, between 100
in the Senate and the House.

00:38:31.329 --> 00:38:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And some
won't even believe this.

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Right.

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:35.410 align:middle line:90%
The science is good.

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:36.420 align:middle line:90%
We've documented it.

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:38.327 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who's read our
material recognizes

00:38:38.327 --> 00:38:40.160 align:middle line:84%
that we footnote
everything, and they're not

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:41.600 align:middle line:90%
conversations in phone booths.

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:44.320 align:middle line:84%
They're legitimate
academic records.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.990 align:middle line:84%
There are those that have
started to come forward.

00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:49.060 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going
to see more of that.

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.580 align:middle line:84%
What we really need is
whistleblower mechanisms,

00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:53.330 align:middle line:84%
not just for this area
but for many areas,

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:55.705 align:middle line:84%
not just for government but
for the private sector, which

00:38:55.705 --> 00:38:57.910 align:middle line:84%
is exempt from the Freedom
of Information Act, where

00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:59.820 align:middle line:90%
a lot of this gets farmed out.

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:02.994 align:middle line:84%
We need a more open society,
not a more closed one.

00:39:02.994 --> 00:39:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And we are headed absolutely
in the wrong direction,

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.310 align:middle line:84%
the opposite direction
of where we need to go.

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:09.685 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's take some more
questions for Nick Begich.

00:39:09.685 --> 00:39:11.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes, right up here in the front.

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Having
this level of awareness

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:17.360 align:middle line:84%
of the manipulations and what
you would might call the dark

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:21.760 align:middle line:84%
side, what keeps
you going every day?

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: I get asked
that a lot over the years.

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a pathological optimist
is the way I've described it.

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I knew you were
a pathological something.

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: And really, I like
the technologies that I study.

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:38.100 align:middle line:84%
I study a broad range
of technologies,

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:40.430 align:middle line:84%
and they're exciting to
me at a lot of levels.

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:44.520 align:middle line:84%
The thing I look at in this
is the potential for enhancing

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:47.180 align:middle line:84%
our performance
is so phenomenal.

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:50.170 align:middle line:84%
The next evolution, the next
leap that many are looking at

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:52.440 align:middle line:84%
is what we used to call
extrasensory perceptions

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:55.885 align:middle line:84%
or the military now calls
anomalous human capacities

00:39:55.885 --> 00:39:57.540 align:middle line:90%
or capabilities.

00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:58.709 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that is our next leap.

00:39:58.709 --> 00:40:00.875 align:middle line:84%
When you think about making
government accountable--

00:40:00.875 --> 00:40:03.310 align:middle line:84%
and they're experimenting with
electronic telepathy today--

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:04.185 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Constantly.

00:40:04.185 --> 00:40:07.759 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: --imagine if we
knew what our leaders thought.

00:40:07.759 --> 00:40:09.050 align:middle line:90%
Now that would change the game.

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:11.174 align:middle line:84%
It would also create an
environment where all of us

00:40:11.174 --> 00:40:13.605 align:middle line:90%
had our judgement day, right?

00:40:13.605 --> 00:40:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Because we have to be
forgiving of ourselves,

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.896 align:middle line:84%
we have to be
forgiving of others,

00:40:16.896 --> 00:40:18.687 align:middle line:84%
high characteristics
for human beings.

00:40:18.687 --> 00:40:20.520 align:middle line:84%
The challenge is to
address our technologies

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:24.000 align:middle line:84%
to enhance the human
potential, not to restrict it.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.370 align:middle line:90%
And this is a huge opportunity.

00:40:27.370 --> 00:40:31.760 align:middle line:84%
It is the next wave of challenge
that can change this planet.

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.495 align:middle line:84%
It is what will
change this planet.

00:40:33.495 --> 00:40:34.787 align:middle line:90%
So that's what keeps me going.

00:40:34.787 --> 00:40:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And Nick, we also use
high technology here

00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:40.970 align:middle line:84%
on "Beyond Belief," so let's
take a question from somewhere

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:42.974 align:middle line:90%
out there for Nick Begich.

00:40:42.974 --> 00:40:43.890 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Hi, Nick.

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:46.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm Tricia from Idaho,
and I was wondering

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:47.890 align:middle line:84%
what the positives
versus the negatives

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:51.334 align:middle line:84%
are when it comes
to mind control.

00:40:51.334 --> 00:40:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: A great question.

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:54.749 align:middle line:84%
And again, getting to the
positive, some of the things

00:40:54.749 --> 00:40:57.780 align:middle line:84%
that you can do
with mind effects.

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:01.196 align:middle line:84%
The idea of
enhancing learning is

00:41:01.196 --> 00:41:02.570 align:middle line:84%
one of the
fundamentals, the idea

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:05.710 align:middle line:84%
of being able to put
your brain into a state

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:08.780 align:middle line:84%
where you can absorb
information more readily.

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.830 align:middle line:90%
You can commit it to memory.

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:14.725 align:middle line:84%
Children that are
hyperactive or brain activity

00:41:14.725 --> 00:41:17.380 align:middle line:84%
is running slow,
running too slow,

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:21.410 align:middle line:84%
you can actually train them
through biofeedback techniques

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:23.982 align:middle line:84%
to hit that ideal
zone of learning.

00:41:23.982 --> 00:41:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Can you make
smarter people that way?

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:26.780 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Absolutely.

00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:27.955 align:middle line:84%
And not only can you
make smarter people,

00:41:27.955 --> 00:41:30.460 align:middle line:84%
but you can take children that
are having these difficulties

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:32.880 align:middle line:84%
that we're now drugging
on a mass scale--

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.770 align:middle line:84%
and the place where
this has been done,

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:37.300 align:middle line:84%
as many as 80% of the
student population that were

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:39.984 align:middle line:84%
on psychoactive drugs were
able to get off of them--

00:41:39.984 --> 00:41:40.900 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's good.

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: --and then go right
to that super learning state

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:46.350 align:middle line:84%
at will with just a
little bit of training.

00:41:46.350 --> 00:41:49.300 align:middle line:84%
That's exciting to
me and for all of us.

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:51.369 align:middle line:84%
Think about trying
to think clearly

00:41:51.369 --> 00:41:52.410 align:middle line:90%
when you're under stress.

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:53.390 align:middle line:90%
Most of us are.

00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:56.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the thing that inhibits
our reaching our higher states

00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:01.330 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness is stress,
because your brain cannot reach

00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:04.435 align:middle line:84%
the slower rhythmic levels as
long as you're in that state.

00:42:04.435 --> 00:42:06.435 align:middle line:84%
So if you really want to
control the population,

00:42:06.435 --> 00:42:09.880 align:middle line:84%
the most simple way is keep
a sense of general anxiety

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:10.660 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:11.590 align:middle line:90%
That's the enemy.

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:12.340 align:middle line:90%
Fear is the enemy.

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:13.214 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Absolutely.

00:42:13.214 --> 00:42:15.374 align:middle line:84%
And they do a good job
at that, don't they?

00:42:15.374 --> 00:42:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: Whether it's an
advertiser worrying about

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:20.870 align:middle line:84%
your deodorant or your teeth,
or whether it's a politician,

00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:22.640 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's
the news broadcast,

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.260 align:middle line:90%
that's really the root.

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:29.730 align:middle line:84%
If we can begin to find ways
to combat, and there are ways,

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:32.760 align:middle line:84%
that's where, again, we can
reach these higher capacities

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:35.520 align:middle line:84%
where our brains function
more efficiently, where

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.790 align:middle line:84%
we make better decisions,
where we perhaps

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:39.940 align:middle line:84%
trigger these anomalous
capabilities as well.

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I've wondered, even in
my radio show Coast to Coast AM

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:47.230 align:middle line:84%
if I went on every night,
every night and went, well,

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:49.890 align:middle line:84%
everything's going well
today, and it was a nice day,

00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:53.970 align:middle line:84%
dah dah dah dah dah-- you have
to look at all those other

00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:57.490 align:middle line:84%
aspects of darkness
and danger and stuff.

00:42:57.490 --> 00:43:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And even though sometimes
we don't intentionally

00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:01.587 align:middle line:90%
try to panic people--

00:43:01.587 --> 00:43:02.170 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: No.

00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: --government, I think,
has used it in order to do

00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:06.030 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:08.950 align:middle line:84%
I'll always remember
the tragedy of 9/11

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:13.420 align:middle line:84%
and that color-coded system,
which I was so opposed to.

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Every day you heard code
yellow, code red, and people

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:21.762 align:middle line:90%
were just paranoid about that.

00:43:21.762 --> 00:43:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Right.

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:23.760 align:middle line:90%
And look what it did.

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:26.125 align:middle line:84%
We passed the
so-called Patriot Act.

00:43:26.125 --> 00:43:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Absolutely.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: And 99 senators
stood up and voted for that.

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And yet within the year when
everyone calmed back down--

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:37.350 align:middle line:84%
including the Senate, see,
were affected by fear--

00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:41.982 align:middle line:84%
over 300 local governments
said, hey, what are we doing?

00:43:41.982 --> 00:43:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:44.560 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: And yet
it's still there.

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Through the Bush
administration, through

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:48.670 align:middle line:84%
the current administration,
nothing's changed.

00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: More so.

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:50.490 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Absolutely.

00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:55.470 align:middle line:84%
More intrusions into our
lives than ever before,

00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:58.860 align:middle line:84%
and the general sense of
anxiety higher than ever before.

00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is inhibiting our
capacity as human beings

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:03.894 align:middle line:84%
to not only solve our
problems but to awaken

00:44:03.894 --> 00:44:05.060 align:middle line:90%
to our higher possibilities.

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: People are
wound up like a spring.

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:08.453 align:middle line:84%
Let's take another
question for Nick Begich.

00:44:08.453 --> 00:44:09.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir, right over here.

00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Back on the
thought of the HAARP affecting

00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:15.990 align:middle line:84%
the weather, I was wondering if
there's any connection at all

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:21.130 align:middle line:84%
of the possibility of HAARP
causing any of these loud booms

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:23.920 align:middle line:84%
and noises that's been going
on around America that Linda

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:26.630 align:middle line:84%
Moulton Howe has
been investigating.

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: I understand
that that's occurring,

00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:33.330 align:middle line:84%
but I don't how you might create
an acoustic signal using HAARP.

00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:34.970 align:middle line:84%
I just don't have
that information.

00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:35.880 align:middle line:90%
But I appreciate the question.

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Something's going
on around this planet.

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:39.230 align:middle line:90%
He's absolutely right.

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And the stories that Linda's
been reporting on Coast

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:44.590 align:middle line:84%
to Coast, all around
the country, probably

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:47.962 align:middle line:84%
the planet, people are
hearing these loud explosions.

00:44:47.962 --> 00:44:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Right.

00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I don't know
if something's blowing up

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:54.970 align:middle line:84%
in the atmosphere or whether
it's a meteor, meteorite,

00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:56.641 align:middle line:90%
but something's happening.

00:44:56.641 --> 00:44:58.890 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: There's a lot of
things that could possibly

00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:03.250 align:middle line:84%
explain it, stealth aircraft
now passing through the sound

00:45:03.250 --> 00:45:03.750 align:middle line:90%
barrier.

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:04.480 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: This kind of
technology is out there.

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Maybe.

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:08.350 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: There's
a lot going on.

00:45:08.350 --> 00:45:11.460 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of what happens,
too, with military

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:15.000 align:middle line:84%
is how they sort of tell
the public don't worry.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.890 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the UFO
phenomenon is a big one.

00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Because when they
experiment with aircraft

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.830 align:middle line:90%
that's sort of the default.

00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:21.330 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Those cases go way up.

00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: It's this.

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:22.210 align:middle line:90%
It's not us.

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:23.110 align:middle line:90%
It's the other guy.

00:45:23.110 --> 00:45:25.510 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of it is us, and
a lot of these phenomena

00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:29.412 align:middle line:84%
that people report,
it's us doing something.

00:45:29.412 --> 00:45:30.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not a natural phenomena.

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Because all of a sudden it
occurs in a frame of time,

00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:37.470 align:middle line:90%
not before, not after, but here.

00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:39.490 align:middle line:84%
This is where experiments
are taking place.

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:42.600 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I'm sure as people saw
drones 10 years ago when they

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.370 align:middle line:90%
were experimenting with them.

00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:46.264 align:middle line:84%
And they look like
UFOs, don't they?

00:45:46.264 --> 00:45:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Absolutely.

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And they have all
different configurations,

00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:53.180 align:middle line:84%
drones from the size of
insects all the way up

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:57.730 align:middle line:84%
to the large drones
being used in combat.

00:45:57.730 --> 00:46:00.256 align:middle line:84%
And it was in the literature
over 10 years ago.

00:46:00.256 --> 00:46:01.880 align:middle line:84%
There just weren't
many of them around.

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:04.647 align:middle line:84%
But anybody who saw this kind
of stuff would say, what's that?

00:46:04.647 --> 00:46:06.480 align:middle line:84%
The military is going
to deny its existence,

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:09.300 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time
you sort of default,

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:13.700 align:middle line:84%
and, again, how people
default to this other picture.

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:15.229 align:middle line:90%
UFOs become part of that.

00:46:15.229 --> 00:46:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I suspect what
if something's happening

00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:21.290 align:middle line:84%
to the core of the planet and
it's creating these vibrations

00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:22.680 align:middle line:90%
and these explosions?

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: Well, prior to
earthquakes you get extremely

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:30.240 align:middle line:84%
low frequency signals that if
you monitor them-- in fact,

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:32.170 align:middle line:84%
one of our authors,
Elizabeth Rauscher,

00:46:32.170 --> 00:46:34.500 align:middle line:84%
she's a geophysicist
and an astrophysicist,

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:37.021 align:middle line:84%
is doing a book on earthquake
modeling and prediction.

00:46:37.021 --> 00:46:38.520 align:middle line:84%
But the idea that
the Earth is going

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:40.710 align:middle line:84%
through huge and
dramatic changes,

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:42.450 align:middle line:84%
I think we all can
acknowledge that.

00:46:42.450 --> 00:46:44.020 align:middle line:90%
We've seen it.

00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:46.302 align:middle line:84%
How that all connects
is what we haven't seen.

00:46:46.302 --> 00:46:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's because of the
way we compartmentalize

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:51.170 align:middle line:84%
our science, geophysicists
looking at this,

00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:53.450 align:middle line:84%
and you've got astrophysicists
looking at that.

00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:55.720 align:middle line:84%
They all need to get
together and start

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:58.970 align:middle line:84%
talking about the phenomena
and how they interact,

00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:00.480 align:middle line:84%
and that needs to
happen more often.

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:02.665 align:middle line:84%
In fact, military
science in our country

00:47:02.665 --> 00:47:05.030 align:middle line:84%
is compartmentalized,
separated deliberately.

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:07.590 align:middle line:84%
In the former Soviet Union,
it was blended in the way

00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:09.590 align:middle line:90%
that I'm talking about now.

00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:12.941 align:middle line:84%
And the blending of it
gave us a real adversary.

00:47:12.941 --> 00:47:15.190 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have the money
or the production capacity,

00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:17.030 align:middle line:84%
but they had really
good science,

00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:19.520 align:middle line:84%
because they benefited by
that cross-fertilization

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:20.472 align:middle line:90%
between disciplines.

00:47:20.472 --> 00:47:21.430 align:middle line:90%
And we don't have that.

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's, again,
one of the big missing links

00:47:24.610 --> 00:47:27.570 align:middle line:84%
for looking at all these
various drivers, including

00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:28.800 align:middle line:90%
climate change.

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.370 align:middle line:90%
What all contributes to that?

00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:33.006 align:middle line:84%
We hear from atmospheric
scientists one thing.

00:47:33.006 --> 00:47:34.880 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps there's other
mechanisms that we just

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:36.094 align:middle line:90%
don't understand quite yet.

00:47:36.094 --> 00:47:38.010 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You brought a
sound device with you,

00:47:38.010 --> 00:47:38.890 align:middle line:90%
and we're going to look at that.

00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:40.390 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
conduct an experiment

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:42.590 align:middle line:84%
in just a moment
on "Beyond Belief."

00:47:42.590 --> 00:47:46.220 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:46.928 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Great.

00:47:46.928 --> 00:47:51.266 align:middle line:90%


00:47:51.266 --> 00:47:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And welcome
back to "Beyond Belief."

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:55.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, of course,
with our guest Nick Begich.

00:47:55.770 --> 00:47:57.200 align:middle line:90%
Nick, you brought us some toys.

00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:57.520 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Right.

00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:58.950 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What are these things?

00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: What I've
got is a sound wave.

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:03.507 align:middle line:84%
This was developed by
my colleague in Germany.

00:48:03.507 --> 00:48:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And we used it actually
in the European Parliament

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:07.860 align:middle line:84%
to demonstrate this
whole idea of infrasound,

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:10.480 align:middle line:84%
the idea of putting
sound into the body

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:14.170 align:middle line:84%
from an external signal, but one
that doesn't involve the ears.

00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:17.909 align:middle line:84%
So this we used to
demonstrate and to show this.

00:48:17.909 --> 00:48:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, what we
ended up with from the European

00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Parliament was not just a
resolution opposing HAARP

00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:27.830 align:middle line:84%
but also standing in the way of
manipulation of human beings.

00:48:27.830 --> 00:48:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And this was important
for us as a threshold.

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:32.280 align:middle line:90%
But it's a demonstration.

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:33.850 align:middle line:84%
In the earlier
segment, we talked

00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:35.850 align:middle line:84%
about Woody Norris is
doing this wirelessly.

00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:37.100 align:middle line:90%
This is the hardwired version.

00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:37.940 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: This is the hardwire.

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:38.648 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Right.

00:48:38.648 --> 00:48:40.971 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
simple circuit.

00:48:40.971 --> 00:48:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What kind
of sound does it emit?

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:46.210 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: Well, what I've got
is I'm using a regular disc

00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:48.389 align:middle line:84%
player, so I've got some
Bach playing on this.

00:48:48.389 --> 00:48:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:49.150 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: OK.

00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:51.040 align:middle line:84%
So what's going to
happen is this sound

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:53.260 align:middle line:84%
goes through our
circuit and then comes

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:55.250 align:middle line:90%
out these two transducers.

00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And these are
piezoelectric transducers,

00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:59.920 align:middle line:84%
so what they create is a little
bit of a drumming affect.

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:03.670 align:middle line:84%
So you'll hear with the external
ear a little bit of sound.

00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:07.600 align:middle line:84%
So I'll ask our volunteer
to block their ears.

00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And then what will happen
is the sound will transit

00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:12.441 align:middle line:84%
through either the
nervous system--

00:49:12.441 --> 00:49:14.940 align:middle line:84%
it could be another energetic
system of the body-- it enters

00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:16.920 align:middle line:84%
the brain, and you
perceive the sound.

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:21.280 align:middle line:84%
You'll hear Bach music as if it
were emanating from internally

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:24.470 align:middle line:84%
inside of your head as opposed
to an external signal normally

00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:26.860 align:middle line:90%
coming in from the ear.

00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:30.800 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Once you do it, what
happens to the human being?

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:31.720 align:middle line:90%
What's the purpose?

00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:34.800 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: In this case, this
was developed for a couple

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:35.600 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:37.875 align:middle line:84%
With a slightly
different signal,

00:49:37.875 --> 00:49:39.750 align:middle line:84%
you could actually use
this for certain kinds

00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:41.040 align:middle line:90%
of hearing impairments.

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:44.027 align:middle line:84%
But you would need a
much different signal

00:49:44.027 --> 00:49:45.360 align:middle line:90%
than what we generate currently.

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And the reason we
don't with this device

00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:48.740 align:middle line:90%
is it creates RF interference.

00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:51.725 align:middle line:84%
It'll mess with your cameras,
mess with your microphones.

00:49:51.725 --> 00:49:53.600 align:middle line:84%
Until we can figure out
a way to shield that,

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:56.060 align:middle line:84%
we really can't explore
that application.

00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:59.590 align:middle line:84%
But it sends energy
through the body,

00:49:59.590 --> 00:50:03.000 align:middle line:84%
so the mind will actually
lock onto the signal.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.750 align:middle line:84%
You can use this for
accelerated learning,

00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:08.000 align:middle line:84%
for instance, by putting
learning information in here.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:08.750 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Amazing.

00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: So any
audio information.

00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:13.530 align:middle line:84%
You can also take
people in a circle,

00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:16.120 align:middle line:90%
and this requires contact.

00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:18.083 align:middle line:84%
And you'll hear a
slight demodulation.

00:50:18.083 --> 00:50:19.124 align:middle line:90%
Maybe people can hear it.

00:50:19.124 --> 00:50:20.165 align:middle line:90%
[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]

00:50:20.165 --> 00:50:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Maybe not.

00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If you wanted
to learn a language,

00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:28.070 align:middle line:84%
could you use a system like
this and go to sleep with it on?

00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: Not so much sleep,
but you could certainly--

00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:31.804 align:middle line:90%
you're not going to focus on it.

00:50:31.804 --> 00:50:32.720 align:middle line:90%
You're going to relax.

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:36.130 align:middle line:84%
You're going to let the
mind fall into its most

00:50:36.130 --> 00:50:37.126 align:middle line:90%
relaxed states.

00:50:37.126 --> 00:50:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And then you're essentially
feeding programming in,

00:50:39.250 --> 00:50:41.132 align:middle line:84%
and you're in control
of that programming.

00:50:41.132 --> 00:50:43.340 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of other
technologies that can do this.

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:46.040 align:middle line:84%
Light and sound
devices can do this.

00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:49.885 align:middle line:84%
Certain signals can create
that accelerated learning

00:50:49.885 --> 00:50:50.385 align:middle line:90%
possibility.

00:50:50.385 --> 00:50:52.180 align:middle line:90%
This is just one of them.

00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:53.930 align:middle line:84%
But that, again, is
one of the areas where

00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:56.810 align:middle line:84%
I get really excited, the idea
of linking people together

00:50:56.810 --> 00:50:59.420 align:middle line:84%
where they're all harmonizing
at the same signal.

00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:01.250 align:middle line:84%
You can do this with
this kind of device,

00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:04.289 align:middle line:84%
which creates some
possibilities experimentally

00:51:04.289 --> 00:51:05.580 align:middle line:90%
that can be pretty interesting.

00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So this is the
good part of the experiment?

00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Yeah.

00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:09.545 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What's the
dark side of this?

00:51:09.545 --> 00:51:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: The dark side of
this is think about this from

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:15.600 align:middle line:84%
the wireless application, where
you can target an individual

00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:16.100 align:middle line:90%
in a crowd.

00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:18.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, all of a sudden
they hear the voice of God

00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:19.620 align:middle line:84%
talking to them to
go do something.

00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying,
hey, don't you hear it?

00:51:21.010 --> 00:51:21.360 align:middle line:90%
Don't you hear it?

00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And
they've got that now.

00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: They have that now.

00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And everyone around them
goes, no, we don't hear it.

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You could
literally target one person?

00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:29.230 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Absolutely.

00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:29.890 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Or the masses?

00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:30.848 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Or the mass.

00:51:30.848 --> 00:51:33.240 align:middle line:90%


00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:34.770 align:middle line:84%
So you had these
things break out,

00:51:34.770 --> 00:51:37.600 align:middle line:84%
like we were talking about
earlier where somebody acts out

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:39.381 align:middle line:90%
in a really bizarre way.

00:51:39.381 --> 00:51:41.130 align:middle line:84%
They say, well, it was
a voice in my head.

00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:44.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, was it psychosis
or was it technology?

00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If you wanted
to experiment on someone,

00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:51.740 align:middle line:84%
could you have one of those
wireless devices in a van drive

00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:55.050 align:middle line:84%
by their house-- because you
already know they're in there

00:51:55.050 --> 00:51:58.640 align:middle line:84%
with this infrared technology,
like they did when they caught

00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:04.090 align:middle line:84%
the Boston bomber-- could you
then bombard that individual

00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:09.250 align:middle line:84%
and test it to see if you can
make that guy rob a bank or do

00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:10.500 align:middle line:90%
something like that?

00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.541 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: The kind of
technologies we're talking

00:52:12.541 --> 00:52:15.430 align:middle line:84%
about, yeah, that's
exactly what you could do.

00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:18.200 align:middle line:84%
With acoustic heterodyning,
you would need line of sight.

00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:20.060 align:middle line:90%
You'd need actual contact.

00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:22.630 align:middle line:84%
But the idea that
there's a number of ways

00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:26.370 align:middle line:84%
to carry a signal, any
electromagnetic carrier, this

00:52:26.370 --> 00:52:27.150 align:middle line:90%
is very, very--

00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:28.665 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And the poor person
at home who would have no idea

00:52:28.665 --> 00:52:29.070 align:middle line:90%
what was happening.

00:52:29.070 --> 00:52:29.861 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: No clue.

00:52:29.861 --> 00:52:32.459 align:middle line:84%
And again, you
have predisposition

00:52:32.459 --> 00:52:33.875 align:middle line:84%
or some conditioning
to get people

00:52:33.875 --> 00:52:36.182 align:middle line:84%
to do something they
normally wouldn't do.

00:52:36.182 --> 00:52:39.780 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, this is, again, the
possibility of that change,

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:41.900 align:middle line:84%
or things that aren't
really so relevant, maybe

00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:43.970 align:middle line:84%
the decision on do
you vote for this guy

00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:45.580 align:middle line:90%
or do you vote for that guy.

00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:47.755 align:middle line:90%
And we hear this way too much.

00:52:47.755 --> 00:52:50.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a choice between
two evils, all right?

00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:54.700 align:middle line:84%
So those kinds of push
events to create a change

00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:58.381 align:middle line:84%
in outcomes, that's where
this gets manipulative.

00:52:58.381 --> 00:53:00.880 align:middle line:84%
That's where it violates what
I think are the ethical rules.

00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:01.990 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Absolutely
unbelievable.

00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:04.540 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: In fact, even mind
control as an issue was a cover

00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:10.040 align:middle line:84%
story-- I think it was May
2002-- in "The Economist"

00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:11.790 align:middle line:90%
on the ethics of mind control.

00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:13.930 align:middle line:84%
Because even now
11 years ago they

00:53:13.930 --> 00:53:15.740 align:middle line:84%
were looking at the
ethical consequences

00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:17.490 align:middle line:84%
of exactly what we're
talking about today.

00:53:17.490 --> 00:53:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So if we drove
by the masses and went,

00:53:19.490 --> 00:53:23.000 align:middle line:84%
you will watch "Beyond Belief,"
you will watch "Beyond Belief,"

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:23.870 align:middle line:90%
it would work?

00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:24.940 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: It could work.

00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:25.900 align:middle line:90%
And it would work.

00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And here's the thing
about it is when

00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:29.820 align:middle line:84%
you've talked about the
technologies in Japan

00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:31.700 align:middle line:84%
for dissuading
shoplifters, now imagine

00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:34.029 align:middle line:84%
if that store got
the idea, well, this

00:53:34.029 --> 00:53:36.070 align:middle line:84%
is a good way to get rid
of obsolete merchandise.

00:53:36.070 --> 00:53:36.750 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:37.360 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:39.234 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: Now is that
the right thing to do?

00:53:39.234 --> 00:53:40.947 align:middle line:84%
I think most people
would agree not.

00:53:40.947 --> 00:53:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But what
a great sales tool.

00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Yeah.

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.680 align:middle line:84%
You might end up with
a fluorescent tie,

00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:46.530 align:middle line:84%
like the one I saw
in the other room.

00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's
take a volunteer.

00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:48.510 align:middle line:84%
You want to try
this on somebody?

00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:48.770 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Yeah, let's do it.

00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:48.910 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Anybody
want to volunteer?

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:52.190 align:middle line:90%
You, right here, come on up.

00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:52.987 align:middle line:90%
What's your name?

00:53:52.987 --> 00:53:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Noelle.

00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:55.430 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Noelle, have a seat.

00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:56.457 align:middle line:90%
This is Nick Begich.

00:53:56.457 --> 00:53:57.040 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Hi.

00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:57.700 align:middle line:90%
Nice to meet you.

00:53:57.700 --> 00:53:58.250 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE:
Pleasure to meet you.

00:53:58.250 --> 00:53:59.330 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Nick, do what you do.

00:53:59.330 --> 00:53:59.810 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: All right.

00:53:59.810 --> 00:54:00.540 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You're not going
to hurt her now, right?

00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: No, this isn't
going to hurt at all.

00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:02.890 align:middle line:84%
What I'm going to
do is I'm going

00:54:02.890 --> 00:54:04.750 align:middle line:84%
to place these or
ask you to place

00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:06.890 align:middle line:90%
these just on your cheeks.

00:54:06.890 --> 00:54:09.581 align:middle line:84%
Block your ears at the same
time so that you can kind of

00:54:09.581 --> 00:54:10.830 align:middle line:90%
perceive where this signal is.

00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:14.679 align:middle line:84%
And then tell everyone what
you hear and where it's at.

00:54:14.679 --> 00:54:19.772 align:middle line:90%


00:54:19.772 --> 00:54:20.730 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Is it on now?

00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:21.270 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: It's on.

00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:22.353 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I've got it running.

00:54:22.353 --> 00:54:24.627 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:54:24.627 --> 00:54:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I hear music.

00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: All right.

00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:27.390 align:middle line:90%
And where is it?

00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:28.890 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: But
it's weird, though,

00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:31.160 align:middle line:84%
because you don't really
hear it through your ears.

00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:31.680 align:middle line:90%
It's like right--

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:32.240 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Is it strange?

00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:33.823 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: It's
right in your brain.

00:54:33.823 --> 00:54:35.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:35.330 --> 00:54:37.974 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is it almost like
a voice from some place?

00:54:37.974 --> 00:54:39.890 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: It's like
when you get radiohead,

00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:42.559 align:middle line:84%
when you wake up with
an annoying song stuck

00:54:42.559 --> 00:54:43.100 align:middle line:90%
in your head.

00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:43.875 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What kind
of music was it?

00:54:43.875 --> 00:54:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: It was
classical music.

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Yes, it is.

00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:45.750 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:46.720 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Try it on me.

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:47.594 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: All right.

00:54:47.594 --> 00:54:49.640 align:middle line:90%
Block your ears tightly, George.

00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:51.806 align:middle line:84%
Just block your ears so you
don't have the external.

00:54:51.806 --> 00:54:54.542 align:middle line:90%


00:54:54.542 --> 00:54:55.500 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's weird.

00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:57.760 align:middle line:90%
I have a talking cheek.

00:54:57.760 --> 00:54:59.230 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:59.230 --> 00:55:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: And the
thing about this,

00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:02.680 align:middle line:84%
when you think
about this kind of--

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That is strange.

00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: --technology, and
it's what they used to call

00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:08.080 align:middle line:84%
infrasound, the idea of
putting sound into the body

00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:10.700 align:middle line:90%
in a different way.

00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:13.376 align:middle line:84%
This was extraordinarily
compelling

00:55:13.376 --> 00:55:15.250 align:middle line:84%
when we presented to
the European Parliament,

00:55:15.250 --> 00:55:17.750 align:middle line:84%
because they'd heard about,
they'd read about literature,

00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:19.520 align:middle line:90%
but no one ever had tried one.

00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:20.720 align:middle line:90%
It made a huge difference.

00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Because this is made by a
non-governmental technician.

00:55:25.210 --> 00:55:29.051 align:middle line:84%
This is not something coming out
of a billion-dollar laboratory.

00:55:29.051 --> 00:55:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That is weird.

00:55:30.050 --> 00:55:32.652 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's first of
all hear it for Nicole.

00:55:32.652 --> 00:55:33.152 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:33.152 --> 00:55:33.648 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Noelle.

00:55:33.648 --> 00:55:34.144 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Noelle.

00:55:34.144 --> 00:55:35.352 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Thank you, Nicole.

00:55:35.352 --> 00:55:38.608 align:middle line:90%


00:55:38.608 --> 00:55:39.610 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:55:39.610 --> 00:55:43.890 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That sound, how
can you hear it in the cheek?

00:55:43.890 --> 00:55:47.075 align:middle line:84%
Are we picking it up in the ear,
or it's going through our body?

00:55:47.075 --> 00:55:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: It's going
through the body.

00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:50.158 align:middle line:84%
You can put it down
a little lower.

00:55:50.158 --> 00:55:51.816 align:middle line:90%
The signal gets a little weaker.

00:55:51.816 --> 00:55:54.634 align:middle line:84%
The power level on this is
about 60 volts peak to peak,

00:55:54.634 --> 00:55:56.050 align:middle line:84%
if you were to
look at the signal.

00:55:56.050 --> 00:55:58.410 align:middle line:84%
To get one that would transit,
say, through your feet,

00:55:58.410 --> 00:56:01.740 align:middle line:84%
you'd need about 3,000
volts peak to peak.

00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:03.440 align:middle line:84%
You're going to feel
a slight tingling,

00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:05.710 align:middle line:84%
but it's not going to be
like getting electrified,

00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:07.800 align:middle line:90%
because it's very low amperage.

00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:10.630 align:middle line:84%
But that creates a signal
that has a very quick rise

00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:12.680 align:middle line:90%
time and a very sharp spike.

00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:14.950 align:middle line:84%
So what it does is
every time it spikes

00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:18.680 align:middle line:84%
it creates a Radio
Frequency, RF, discharge that

00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:21.840 align:middle line:84%
then affects
cameras, microphones.

00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:24.640 align:middle line:84%
The earliest versions
that were produced of this

00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:27.770 align:middle line:84%
go back to the 1960s
by another inventor.

00:56:27.770 --> 00:56:29.260 align:middle line:90%
And he actually developed one.

00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:30.776 align:middle line:84%
This was before
microcircuits when

00:56:30.776 --> 00:56:32.150 align:middle line:84%
you could run this
kind of device

00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:33.233 align:middle line:90%
without that interference.

00:56:33.233 --> 00:56:36.180 align:middle line:90%
But the technology's advanced.

00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:39.650 align:middle line:84%
The idea that you can do this
wirelessly, the idea that you

00:56:39.650 --> 00:56:42.450 align:middle line:84%
can use other carriers
to embed a signal,

00:56:42.450 --> 00:56:44.500 align:middle line:84%
whether it's radio,
TV, internet,

00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:46.410 align:middle line:84%
that's where the
technology is today.

00:56:46.410 --> 00:56:51.300 align:middle line:84%
When you talk about sort of
where the info wars ultimately

00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:53.410 align:middle line:84%
target, it's going to be
hardware and software,

00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:54.985 align:middle line:90%
like we've all heard.

00:56:54.985 --> 00:56:56.610 align:middle line:84%
But it's also going
to be human beings.

00:56:56.610 --> 00:56:58.640 align:middle line:84%
Because, ultimately, if you
can shut down the human being,

00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:00.190 align:middle line:90%
the hardware doesn't matter.

00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's where that
technology is headed.

00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are you are you
bullish on this technology?

00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:07.910 align:middle line:90%
Or are you afraid of it?

00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: I'm excited about
the positive applications.

00:57:10.330 --> 00:57:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And this is, again, as
you bring those forward

00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:15.420 align:middle line:84%
and you move things
into the public domain,

00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:16.670 align:middle line:90%
it gets pretty exciting.

00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:19.450 align:middle line:84%
The wireless-type
technologies I'd

00:57:19.450 --> 00:57:21.700 align:middle line:84%
be a lot more cautious
on, because that's

00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:24.790 align:middle line:84%
where you are then
manipulating other people,

00:57:24.790 --> 00:57:26.330 align:middle line:84%
because the temptation
is too great.

00:57:26.330 --> 00:57:28.364 align:middle line:84%
Something that requires
a physical contact,

00:57:28.364 --> 00:57:29.780 align:middle line:84%
this is something
where people are

00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:30.505 align:middle line:90%
going to have a conversation.

00:57:30.505 --> 00:57:33.180 align:middle line:84%
You're not just going to show
up and put something on someone

00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:35.080 align:middle line:90%
without their consent.

00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:36.900 align:middle line:84%
So I think we need
to look at that.

00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:39.537 align:middle line:90%
We need to recognize the risks.

00:57:39.537 --> 00:57:40.620 align:middle line:90%
And then we need to limit.

00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:42.411 align:middle line:84%
Certain technologies
do need to be limited.

00:57:42.411 --> 00:57:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps on some ways
of carrying the signal,

00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:47.070 align:middle line:84%
we need to definitely
regulate that.

00:57:47.070 --> 00:57:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But this could be
used for evil applications.

00:57:50.110 --> 00:57:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Absolutely.

00:57:51.250 --> 00:57:54.537 align:middle line:84%
The idea of accelerating
the learning

00:57:54.537 --> 00:57:55.495 align:middle line:90%
in the wrong direction.

00:57:55.495 --> 00:57:58.246 align:middle line:90%


00:57:58.246 --> 00:58:00.120 align:middle line:84%
One of the big things
with controlled effects

00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:01.578 align:middle line:84%
that the military
is looking for is

00:58:01.578 --> 00:58:03.150 align:middle line:84%
the idea of creating
memory sets.

00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:06.570 align:middle line:84%
In fact, "MIT Technology
Review" this month,

00:58:06.570 --> 00:58:08.220 align:middle line:84%
talking about people
who lose memory

00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:11.250 align:middle line:84%
and then being able to recreate
memory and give it to them.

00:58:11.250 --> 00:58:13.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, who's in control
of your memory?

00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And what do you
want to put in there

00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:17.850 align:middle line:84%
that now becomes your
sense of awareness?

00:58:17.850 --> 00:58:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is the problem is even
in educational applications,

00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:22.420 align:middle line:90%
which are coming.

00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:24.640 align:middle line:84%
The idea of who's doing
the programming-- when

00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:26.810 align:middle line:84%
you can take information,
literally download it

00:58:26.810 --> 00:58:29.140 align:middle line:84%
into a human brain, which
is where this technology one

00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:32.680 align:middle line:84%
day will be, who's going
to write the curriculum?

00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:34.820 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to set
the value judgments?

00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to make
those decisions?

00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:39.840 align:middle line:84%
What comes out of
this research in 10,

00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:43.470 align:middle line:84%
15 years is going to drive
educational institutions.

00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:45.630 align:middle line:84%
That's why we've got
to be involved now.

00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Because those outcomes
are much, much different.

00:58:48.170 --> 00:58:51.032 align:middle line:84%
PBS even did a thing that
says within 80 years--

00:58:51.032 --> 00:58:52.740 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's much
shorter than that--

00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:55.156 align:middle line:84%
that we'll have something
called the worldwide mind where,

00:58:55.156 --> 00:58:57.990 align:middle line:84%
like we link computers today,
we'll link consciousness then.

00:58:57.990 --> 00:58:59.270 align:middle line:90%
I think we already do that.

00:58:59.270 --> 00:59:00.480 align:middle line:90%
I think we do that naturally.

00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:01.880 align:middle line:90%
We're just not very aware of it.

00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:05.050 align:middle line:84%
But what we do naturally we're
trying to do synthetically

00:59:05.050 --> 00:59:07.240 align:middle line:84%
on a scale that would
be unprecedented.

00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:08.969 align:middle line:84%
And that's the direction
of the science.

00:59:08.969 --> 00:59:10.510 align:middle line:84%
That's where it goes
in the long run.

00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, and as you know,
sometimes in these movies you

00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:18.090 align:middle line:84%
see Big Brother up on a screen
in the middle of a city beaming

00:59:18.090 --> 00:59:20.570 align:middle line:84%
things down on people,
telling people.

00:59:20.570 --> 00:59:23.192 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, you won't
need that big screen.

00:59:23.192 --> 00:59:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Right.

00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:26.191 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It would just be
going on on a regular basis.

00:59:26.191 --> 00:59:28.870 align:middle line:84%
>> BEGICH: On a regular basis
at a level where most people

00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:29.870 align:middle line:90%
aren't even aware of it.

00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:30.953 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What technology.

00:59:30.953 --> 00:59:32.814 align:middle line:90%
Let's hear it for Nick Begich.

00:59:32.814 --> 00:59:33.314 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:33.314 --> 00:59:34.605 align:middle line:90%
>> BEGICH: Thank you very much.

00:59:34.605 --> 00:59:35.699 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Thank you, Nick.

00:59:35.699 --> 00:59:39.040 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:40.580 align:middle line:90%
So you've heard it.

00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:43.980 align:middle line:84%
You can alter the mind to
do some incredible things,

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:48.190 align:middle line:84%
but you can also alter it
to do some very dark things.

00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Let's hope that Nick
Begich and his people

00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:53.100 align:middle line:84%
continue to push
it in the good way.

00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:55.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:59:55.850 --> 01:00:18.902 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]
