00:00:05.295 --> 00:00:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>> [BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.878 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.878 --> 00:00:10.684 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.684 --> 00:00:13.220 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.255 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:26.579 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.450 align:middle line:10%
You know, we take it
for granted, the Sun.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.590 align:middle line:10%
Every day we wake up.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.960 align:middle line:10%
It sets at night.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.140 align:middle line:10%
But what is really
going on in the Sun?

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Jay Weidner, of course,
the noted filmmaker,

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.330 align:middle line:84%
has been looking at this, and
he says it's not all you think.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Jay, welcome back
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.370 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY WEIDNER: Hey,
George, good to be here.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.245 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, we
do take it for granted.

00:00:48.245 --> 00:00:50.850 align:middle line:84%
The Sun is always there,
good, old, dependable Sun.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.250 align:middle line:84%
What happens if something
ever changes on the Sun?

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.700 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: Well, you know,
that's a good question.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.950 align:middle line:10%
Because when I was growing
up and taking science classes

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.800 align:middle line:10%
in college and high
school, we were

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.202 align:middle line:10%
told that the Sun was a stable
star, not a variable star.

00:01:06.202 --> 00:01:06.910 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.534 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: And that
it had been like it

00:01:08.534 --> 00:01:10.887 align:middle line:10%
has been for millions of years.

00:01:10.887 --> 00:01:12.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we had
five billion years

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.880 align:middle line:90%
to even worry about anything.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.935 align:middle line:84%
Five billion years
before we even

00:01:15.935 --> 00:01:18.080 align:middle line:84%
have to worry if it's
even going to change.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.970 align:middle line:10%
And so with that in mind, I
started my original research--

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.590 align:middle line:10%
I got involved in all of
this woo-woo, I guess,

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.580 align:middle line:10%
was I discovered a cross
in the south of France,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.790 align:middle line:10%
a 400-year-old cross
called the Cross

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.440 align:middle line:10%
of Hendaye, which is on
the screen right there.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.209 align:middle line:90%
The church yard--

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big is that?

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: That's
about 12 feet tall.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And has a pedestal,
and then a pillar, and then

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.340 align:middle line:90%
a cross on the top.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And the pedestal on the
bottom has four engravings.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.050 align:middle line:84%
The engraving I'm
most interested in

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.120 align:middle line:90%
is this one right here.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.550 align:middle line:90%
This is called the angry Sun.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And the Cross of Hendaye,
once you interpret it,

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.930 align:middle line:84%
which my first book is
about and my first time I

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:59.760 align:middle line:90%
appeared on your show--

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Many years ago.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.360 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, many years ago.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.910 align:middle line:84%
I thought that the
Cross of Hendaye

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.740 align:middle line:84%
was saying that sometime
in the future, near future,

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.670 align:middle line:84%
that we would face gigantic
solar flares or CMEs,

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.300 align:middle line:84%
and the Earth would
get baked by them.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And that sent me
searching in the past

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.410 align:middle line:84%
to see if there had been--
this is 10 years ago, 15

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.380 align:middle line:84%
years ago now-- seeing if there
had been CMEs, Coronal Mass

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.780 align:middle line:90%
Ejections, going on in the past.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.605 align:middle line:84%
And I found, yeah, the
Harrington Effect in 1859.

00:02:30.605 --> 00:02:31.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.420 align:middle line:84%
Wiped out the telegraph
and everything else.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.086 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Wiped out
all the telegraphs.

00:02:34.086 --> 00:02:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And I went back, and I found
that the forests in Canada

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.910 align:middle line:90%
had burned 12,000 years ago.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.810 align:middle line:84%
There's a layer of
ash this thick, where

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.150 align:middle line:84%
all the forests had burned
as if solar flares had

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.370 align:middle line:90%
struck the Earth.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And I started going public on
your show and other places.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Was heavily criticized,
especially by NASA, people

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.170 align:middle line:84%
calling me a Chicken
Little and this.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And then the book
came out in 1999.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.430 align:middle line:84%
About 2003, 2004, NASA
began changing their tune.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And they did have SOHO up
by then, their satellite,

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.390 align:middle line:84%
so they started learning
a lot of things.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And they began changing
their tune and saying,

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.710 align:middle line:84%
yes, the Sun does emit
gigantic solar flares

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.740 align:middle line:90%
which strike the Earth.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And if you look, you
can't see the two stars.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.040 align:middle line:84%
There's four stars
around the Sun.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's two up.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.920 align:middle line:84%
There's two up, and
they're in the shadow.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.711 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And what I
believe that's saying

00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:31.550 align:middle line:84%
is that the Sun does something,
and it affects the inner four

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.067 align:middle line:90%
planets of the solar system.

00:03:33.067 --> 00:03:34.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's no doubt.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, Earth--

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No doubt.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: --Mars,
Venus, and Mercury.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And also if you look, you'll
see that the Sun looks

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.507 align:middle line:84%
like it's expanding a little
bit, the angry sun looks--

00:03:43.507 --> 00:03:44.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's growing out.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Growing
up, yeah, growing out.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.270 align:middle line:84%
So I went around
thinking that this

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.470 align:middle line:84%
was the interpretation
of the Cross of Hendaye.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And I still believe that that's
a very viable interpretation,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.140 align:middle line:84%
that a group, a secret society,
built a monument that we would

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.460 align:middle line:84%
decipher that would warn us
about this periodic thing that

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.960 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.654 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would
they know this then?

00:04:06.654 --> 00:04:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well,
that's a good question.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.290 align:middle line:84%
I went into--
after-- My research

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.860 align:middle line:84%
into the Cross of Hendaye
took me into Free Masonry.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.839 align:middle line:84%
And I found out that at the very
basis of Free Masonry is this

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:23.280 align:middle line:84%
same prediction, that Free
Masonry originally started out,

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.050 align:middle line:84%
I believe, as a father-to-son
passing down of this

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.120 align:middle line:84%
information, that beware,
there is a periodic change that

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.640 align:middle line:84%
happens with the Sun, and
you're going to face it,

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.720 align:middle line:84%
just like my
 great-great-great-great-grandfather

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.880 align:middle line:90%
faced it.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:36.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.610 align:middle line:90%
It's a cycle?

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: It's a cycle.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And the whole point of Free
Masonry at the beginning

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.380 align:middle line:84%
was to pass down
this information.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.570 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sure of this, actually.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And I believe a Freemason
built the Cross of Hendaye.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that, of course,
later the secret society got

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.410 align:middle line:84%
involved in politics and ruling,
and the original predictions

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.870 align:middle line:84%
kind of went away, and
everyone kind of forgot

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.460 align:middle line:90%
the whole point of the program.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.750 align:middle line:84%
So everything was fine, and
this was my interpretation.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.030 align:middle line:84%
I was glad that NASA was coming
along and following along--

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Following you for that.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.603 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: --and warning people.

00:05:08.603 --> 00:05:12.260 align:middle line:84%
Because if a solar flare
hit today, right now,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.090 align:middle line:90%
if a massive--

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: An x-size, you mean.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.186 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: --an
x-size solar flare

00:05:15.186 --> 00:05:18.620 align:middle line:84%
hit, it would knock out all
of the nuclear power plants.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.954 align:middle line:90%
It would go flat, and we'd all--

00:05:19.954 --> 00:05:20.911 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The grid goes.

00:05:20.911 --> 00:05:21.680 align:middle line:90%
Everything goes.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.263 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: The grid
goes, and we would

00:05:23.263 --> 00:05:25.360 align:middle line:84%
have meltdowns,
incredible meltdowns.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.640 align:middle line:84%
There's over 90 nuclear
power plants in France alone.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.140 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.775 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we've
got like 120, right?

00:05:31.775 --> 00:05:32.400 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And every one of them would
go into immediate meltdown.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.680 align:middle line:84%
So there are people now lobbying
Congress and the Nuclear

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.490 align:middle line:84%
Regulatory Commission to put
generators outside every power

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.709 align:middle line:90%
plant with gasoline tanks.

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To keep it cool.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: To keep it going
until we can figure out,

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.680 align:middle line:84%
once the grid goes down,
how to get it back.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it
could be years, Jay.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: It could be years.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have any
electricity to fix it.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.980 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
your grid is down,

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.355 align:middle line:84%
you can't use the computers
to fix your computers.

00:06:01.355 --> 00:06:01.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.075 align:middle line:84%
And if the transmission
systems go--

00:06:05.075 --> 00:06:06.200 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Which they will.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --we don't have
replacements for those things.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:08.770 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: We don't.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And so we could literally
be sixth century BC

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.170 align:middle line:90%
in five minutes.

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:14.335 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I agree.

00:06:14.335 --> 00:06:15.910 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And so
this is a very--

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Millions would die.

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER:--very
serious problem.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Millions would die.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.670 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Absolutely.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:24.400 align:middle line:84%
But I am now-- I believe that
that is a legitimate thing,

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.030 align:middle line:84%
and we should be very
worried about it.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.010 align:middle line:84%
But I've now changed my mind
about the Cross of Hendaye.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I've
changed my mind

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.220 align:middle line:84%
is-- and you're old
enough to remember

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.210 align:middle line:84%
this-- the Sun
used to be yellow.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm a photographer.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.370 align:middle line:84%
I've been shooting photographs
since I was 10 years old.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.270 align:middle line:84%
I've been photographing the
Sun since I was 10 years old.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.130 align:middle line:90%
The Sun used to be yellow.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.490 align:middle line:84%
I have to use special filters,
neutral density filters now,

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.450 align:middle line:84%
to get good, crisp images of
the Sun because it's white.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:53.930 align:middle line:90%
It's hot white.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is an indication
that dust is falling down--

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.280 align:middle line:84%
interstellar dust is falling
onto the surface of the Sun,

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.511 align:middle line:90%
heating it up.

00:07:03.511 --> 00:07:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And another thing that
people have noticed

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.379 align:middle line:84%
is the UV, the ultraviolet,
is much hotter now

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:09.170 align:middle line:90%
than it used to be.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, sure.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.870 align:middle line:90%
More melanoma cases and stuff.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:11.580 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Exactly.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.163 align:middle line:84%
If you stand out in
80-degree weather,

00:07:13.163 --> 00:07:15.740 align:middle line:84%
and you feel like
it's 100 degrees out,

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.590 align:middle line:90%
and that's the UV coming.

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And I asked myself, well,
where would the UV come?

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And the ultraviolet would come
from this dust falling down

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.320 align:middle line:90%
onto the surface of the Sun.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.260 align:middle line:84%
It's called a T Tauri
star in astronomy.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And the dust falls down on the
surface, and if you add ultra--

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:38.900 align:middle line:84%
if you do a color scheme, and
you add ultraviolet to yellow,

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.875 align:middle line:84%
it turns it white,
which is exactly--

00:07:40.875 --> 00:07:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
what's happening.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.268 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: --going
on with the Sun.

00:07:43.268 --> 00:07:47.330 align:middle line:84%
So I began looking
into this even more.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And I've come to the
conclusion, mainly

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.760 align:middle line:84%
because a person from NASA
told me this 25 years ago,

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.350 align:middle line:84%
that the Sun itself
was changing.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.640 align:middle line:84%
That there's something that
they could not understand

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.274 align:middle line:84%
was occurring with the Sun,
and they were actually scared.

00:08:01.274 --> 00:08:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's nothing
they can do about it.

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:05.689 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: There's nothing they
can-- this was 25 years ago.

00:08:05.689 --> 00:08:06.320 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.200 align:middle line:84%
Yesterday, the
newspaper for Boulder,

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.580 align:middle line:84%
a letter to the editor
is saying that--

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:17.040 align:middle line:84%
a military pilot was
admitting that for 37 years,

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.005 align:middle line:90%
he sprayed aerosols on to--

00:08:20.005 --> 00:08:22.239 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A chemtrail
witness, finally.

00:08:22.239 --> 00:08:23.280 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: He came forth.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And I've called the guy,
and I'm going to try to--

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's get him.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I'm going to try
to get him on your show,

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:29.570 align:middle line:84%
OK, because I think it's really
important we get somebody

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:31.475 align:middle line:90%
from the military to say this.

00:08:31.475 --> 00:08:33.270 align:middle line:90%
There's chemtrails right there.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:36.190 align:middle line:84%
So we now have a guy from
the military admitting

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:37.970 align:middle line:84%
that they're spraying
this stuff, right?

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:41.610 align:middle line:84%
So my question is, well, what
is this that they're doing?

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.950 align:middle line:10%
And my answer is that they-- and
NASA has admitted, by the way,

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:47.230 align:middle line:10%
recently that they
are spraying aerosols.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:50.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what we've always
heard, Jay, on "Coast to Coast"

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:55.670 align:middle line:84%
is weather manipulation,
dumbing us down,

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:58.069 align:middle line:90%
some other heinous purpose.

00:08:58.069 --> 00:08:59.360 align:middle line:90%
And what have you come up with?

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.524 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well, I
think that they-- I know

00:09:02.524 --> 00:09:04.190 align:middle line:84%
that they know that
the Sun is changing,

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:05.600 align:middle line:90%
and they don't know why.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.470 align:middle line:84%
I think the Sun is
actually going into a phase

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:09.940 align:middle line:90%
that we don't understand.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:10.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fast.

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:11.520 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Fast.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
they are panicking.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:17.210 align:middle line:84%
It was NASA that discovered
that the Sun was changing.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:20.480 align:middle line:84%
It's NASA that's admitted that
they're spraying the aerosols.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.040 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.320 align:middle line:90%
We see the aerosols.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.405 align:middle line:90%
What do the aerosols do?

00:09:23.405 --> 00:09:25.780 align:middle line:84%
Notice that the Sun in that
picture is white, by the way.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.101 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: What do
these aerosols do?

00:09:28.101 --> 00:09:30.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, they start
out as a thin line,

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.160 align:middle line:90%
and then they slowly spread.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon you
have a silver sky,

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.830 align:middle line:84%
where all the
sunlight is muted out.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:40.950 align:middle line:10%
I think that they're trying to--

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.380 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Block, blocking?

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:42.880 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: --block the sunlight.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.360 align:middle line:10%
But there's another thing
that's even more important.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.150 align:middle line:10%
In this letter to the
editor in the paper,

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:50.960 align:middle line:10%
he said they were doing it to
block the sunlight and mind

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.810 align:middle line:10%
control.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:55.520 align:middle line:10%
Now, how could chemtrails
cause mind control?

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, what people
don't realize is

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.320 align:middle line:84%
that your consciousness
is governed by light.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.337 align:middle line:84%
Light comes in through
your eyes and hits

00:10:03.337 --> 00:10:04.420 align:middle line:90%
your pineal gland, which--

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:05.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You have to have that.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:06.160 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: You have to have it.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And the pineal gland is the
center of consciousness.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.830 align:middle line:84%
It's the center of the
soul, Descartes said.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:11.550 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And so light, the
color of light,

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.400 align:middle line:90%
changes your consciousness.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And if the Sun is
changing, then it's

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.290 align:middle line:84%
possible that our
consciousness is changing.

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.030 align:middle line:84%
It could be that
the changing nature

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:26.180 align:middle line:84%
of the Sun over
the last 20 years

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.280 align:middle line:84%
is what's causing the great
awakening that's happening.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And they know that the great
awakening is happening.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Previous to our other
conversation about Archons.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.224 align:middle line:84%
What if the Archons realize that
this changing nature of the Sun

00:10:38.224 --> 00:10:39.890 align:middle line:84%
was going to wake
people up, and they're

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.420 align:middle line:90%
going to find out about them?

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.320 align:middle line:90%
What do they do?

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.350 align:middle line:90%
That's what they do.

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:47.117 align:middle line:90%
They spray the skies.

00:10:47.117 --> 00:10:47.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everywhere.

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:48.610 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Everywhere.

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:50.940 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend who just
was traveling through Europe

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.310 align:middle line:84%
last week, two weeks
straight in Europe.

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:55.700 align:middle line:90%
I go to Europe all the time.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.490 align:middle line:84%
I used to never see
chemtrails in Europe.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.456 align:middle line:84%
He said the skies
were filled with them.

00:10:59.456 --> 00:11:01.830 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend lives in South
Africa, Michael Tellinger.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.210 align:middle line:90%
Same thing, he tells me.

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:05.230 align:middle line:84%
The skies are filled
with chemtrails now.

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:06.690 align:middle line:84%
It used to just be the
United States, he said.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:07.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's no
clear days anymore.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: There's no
clear days anymore.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And they've upped it-- I
don't know if you've noticed,

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.730 align:middle line:90%
but they've upped it.

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:15.360 align:middle line:84%
It's now much more spraying
than there used to be,

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.790 align:middle line:90%
say, three years ago.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:18.060 align:middle line:90%
And the spraying is different.

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.510 align:middle line:84%
They've really
gotten sophisticated.

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:20.470 align:middle line:90%
This is some of the new--

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:21.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thicker, everything.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Thicker,
like that middle cloud

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:24.200 align:middle line:90%
there in that photograph.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:29.460 align:middle line:84%
They've really gotten good with
whatever technology they're

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:34.440 align:middle line:84%
using here, because now the
skies are blocked all the time.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's more
than one plane, right?

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I've seen 17 jets
in the sky at once, counted

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:42.040 align:middle line:90%
17 jets in the sky.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.222 align:middle line:90%
This is just a few weeks ago.

00:11:45.222 --> 00:11:46.567 align:middle line:90%
And I think they're drones.

00:11:46.567 --> 00:11:47.650 align:middle line:90%
I think now they're just--

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:48.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now they're
doing it with drones.

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: There's just
drones flying back and forth.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And how much does
this operation cost?

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.020 align:middle line:90%
I ask you.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:56.850 align:middle line:90%
Gazillions?

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how much can
it cost to fly planes

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.945 align:middle line:84%
all over the Earth
dropping aerosols on top

00:12:01.945 --> 00:12:02.180 align:middle line:90%
and into the atmosphere.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.638 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And why
do they hide this?

00:12:03.638 --> 00:12:05.500 align:middle line:90%
Why do they suppress this?

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.892 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Because we'd panic.

00:12:06.892 --> 00:12:08.600 align:middle line:84%
We would go into a
panic if we found out.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.660 align:middle line:10%
Also, if they're suppressing
our consciousness,

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.040 align:middle line:10%
then they don't want us to know.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:16.700 align:middle line:10%
So they ridicule us who bring it
up, and they say, you're crazy.

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:20.770 align:middle line:84%
You're a tinfoil hat
person and all this.

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:24.490 align:middle line:10%
Yet, if we get one guy, and
hopefully I will have this guy,

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:28.030 align:middle line:10%
come forth and admit it,
that he was in the military,

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:31.600 align:middle line:10%
that he did it,
then it's game over.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.514 align:middle line:10%
People like voices, like your
show, we can get this out,

00:12:34.514 --> 00:12:36.180 align:middle line:10%
and we can start
lobbying the government

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.540 align:middle line:10%
to stop this spraying.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:38.366 align:middle line:10%
We have to stop it.

00:12:38.366 --> 00:12:39.240 align:middle line:10%
They're dumping tons.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.260 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Or at
least tell us about.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.510 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they have to
spray, Jay, you know?

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:42.340 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Well, may be true.

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.580 align:middle line:90%
But at least they should tell.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:44.121 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:12:44.121 --> 00:12:47.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And tell us why,
because I want to know why.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And if there is a mind
control aspect to it,

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.234 align:middle line:84%
like the guy that talked
about HAARP, Nick--

00:12:52.234 --> 00:12:52.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Begich.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:53.733 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: --Begich.

00:12:53.733 --> 00:12:56.830 align:middle line:84%
He says that they're reflecting
stuff off these chemtrails

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:58.590 align:middle line:84%
through HAARP, and
that it's having

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:01.590 align:middle line:84%
an electromagnetic effect on
us, which could also be true,

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:03.240 align:middle line:84%
that it might also
be the mind control

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.230 align:middle line:84%
aspect that this
gentleman's talking about.

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:05.926 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:13:05.926 --> 00:13:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
remember years ago

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.880 align:middle line:84%
when the Olympics were
in China, and people

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.510 align:middle line:84%
were concerned
about the weather.

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:14.190 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese government
came out and said,

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:15.960 align:middle line:90%
don't worry about the weather.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.260 align:middle line:90%
We have that covered.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: And they did.

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:19.740 align:middle line:90%
There was no weather problems.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They knew
what they were doing.

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:21.483 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: They did.

00:13:21.483 --> 00:13:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And this happens a lot,
the recent flooding all

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.074 align:middle line:90%
over the world.

00:13:28.074 --> 00:13:29.490 align:middle line:84%
They are messing
with the weather.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:30.310 align:middle line:10%
We know they are.

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.480 align:middle line:10%
Scott Stevens'
been on your show.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.780 align:middle line:10%
He's a meteorologist.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.360 align:middle line:10%
He openly admits
it, that this is

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.270 align:middle line:10%
weather manipulation
of the highest kind.

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:37.853 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:13:37.853 --> 00:13:40.110 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: And so we
have to ask ourselves,

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:42.290 align:middle line:10%
what is going on here?

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:44.300 align:middle line:10%
And if the Sun is
changing, if they

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.480 align:middle line:10%
know that the Sun is changing,
I want to know about it,

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.850 align:middle line:10%
because I want to prepare
and help my family

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:51.481 align:middle line:10%
prepare for this thing.

00:13:51.481 --> 00:13:52.314 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If you can.

00:13:52.314 --> 00:13:52.903 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: If we can.

00:13:52.903 --> 00:13:55.220 align:middle line:84%
If not, then I want to party
down, have a nice time.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:55.565 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:13:55.565 --> 00:13:55.910 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:56.370 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's what they're
concerned about, Jay.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.005 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: I think that is.

00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're concerned
about how many people

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.030 align:middle line:90%
are going to go into work.

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:07.890 align:middle line:84%
How many people are going to
march to the government's tune

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:11.410 align:middle line:84%
if they know that
there's a clock ticking?

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:12.820 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:16.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you knew you were
going to die on Tuesday,

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.080 align:middle line:84%
believe me, the
next couple days--

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:18.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I would
be eating ice cream.

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --would be
one heck of a party.

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:21.020 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.590 align:middle line:84%
I'd be eating ice cream
and doing all the things--

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Doing
whatever you want.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: --I'm not
supposed to do, right.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:26.714 align:middle line:84%
Exactly what's
going to happen is

00:14:26.714 --> 00:14:28.410 align:middle line:84%
we would no longer
be good slaves,

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:29.750 align:middle line:90%
and we would all just quit.

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Religions
with collapse.

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:32.691 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Everything
would collapse,

00:14:32.691 --> 00:14:36.720 align:middle line:84%
and it would be a
spectacular meltdown.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, Fulcanelli, who
wrote the original book

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.430 align:middle line:84%
on the Cross of Hendaye,
he says that this

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:45.860 align:middle line:84%
is coming, that there is going
to be this incredible change

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.380 align:middle line:84%
that's going to happen,
and it's going to be soon.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:52.210 align:middle line:84%
He wrote the book in 1926,
but interestingly enough,

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:54.580 align:middle line:84%
the book he wrote, "Mysteries
of the Cathedrals,"

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.560 align:middle line:84%
didn't have the Cross of
Hendaye chapter in it.

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:00.790 align:middle line:84%
It was only when they reprinted
the book in the late '50s

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:03.700 align:middle line:84%
that this chapter, mysterious
chapter, had been added.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And no one really knows
who wrote it, really,

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:07.910 align:middle line:90%
or how it got into the book.

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that it
was a group of insiders,

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:13.550 align:middle line:84%
whistleblowers, maybe
you could call them,

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:17.620 align:middle line:84%
who decided to add this chapter
into the book in the late

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:20.782 align:middle line:84%
'50s because time was getting
short, and it was now time--

00:15:20.782 --> 00:15:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they knew.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:22.260 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: They did.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.093 align:middle line:84%
And another thing about
the Cross of Hendaye

00:15:24.093 --> 00:15:26.120 align:middle line:84%
which is really
interesting is that Hitler

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.970 align:middle line:90%
visited Hendaye, France in 1940.

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing he
did when his train pulled

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:34.477 align:middle line:84%
into the station is--
he was a big walker.

00:15:34.477 --> 00:15:35.185 align:middle line:90%
He liked to walk.

00:15:35.185 --> 00:15:37.430 align:middle line:84%
He grabbed his two dogs,
his German shepherds,

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:40.590 align:middle line:84%
and walked straight up the
street to the Cross of Hendaye

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:41.550 align:middle line:90%
and visited it.

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he was
into this in a big way.

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And he was into
the occult in a big way.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:46.720 align:middle line:84%
So you have to wonder
what's going on.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And this, I think, also
explains the underground shelter

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.400 align:middle line:84%
that Richard Sauter talks
about and maybe even

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.655 align:middle line:84%
Denver Airport,
what's going on there.

00:15:54.655 --> 00:15:55.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's going on there.

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And I think
this whole thing--

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:58.530 align:middle line:84%
and if you go to Denver
Airport and look at the murals

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:00.600 align:middle line:84%
that we've talked about
on your show before,

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.520 align:middle line:84%
again, there's one mural
called "The Extinction Mural."

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Has all the extinct
animals, the dodo bird,

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:11.630 align:middle line:84%
and it's got three humans, a
white kid, a Native American,

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:14.170 align:middle line:84%
and a black girl, and
they're dead in the coffin.

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:15.564 align:middle line:90%
This is in an airport now.

00:16:15.564 --> 00:16:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dead in the coffin?

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:19.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Hm mm,
with fire consuming

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.085 align:middle line:84%
all of the forests
behind them on Earth.

00:16:21.085 --> 00:16:21.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How bizarre.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: It was
originally how I discovered

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:25.890 align:middle line:84%
the high weirdness
of Denver airport.

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:28.497 align:middle line:84%
I was walking through traveling,
and I saw it and I said,

00:16:28.497 --> 00:16:29.080 align:middle line:90%
this is weird.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.454 align:middle line:84%
This is like a prediction
like the Cross of Hendaye.

00:16:31.454 --> 00:16:32.620 align:middle line:90%
Then I started looking more.

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And then I started talking
to people who'd laid drywall

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.110 align:middle line:84%
or did painting,
and they told me

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:40.870 align:middle line:84%
they went down these shaft
elevators for like 18 minutes

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:43.130 align:middle line:84%
to get down to someplace
below the airport.

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And there was big rooms
down there with soldiers

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.330 align:middle line:84%
and military people
running around,

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:50.270 align:middle line:84%
and trains going into
the Rocky Mountains.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.062 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, really?

00:16:52.062 --> 00:16:53.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Strange stuff.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.811 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: So if Hitler
knew about it, then

00:16:54.811 --> 00:16:56.390 align:middle line:90%
probably they all knew about it.

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And they're all
watching this, trying

00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:59.300 align:middle line:90%
to figure out what's going on.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.540 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that was the whole
reason NASA got started.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:04.721 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's happening,
Jay, you're so right, too fast.

00:17:04.721 --> 00:17:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Way too fast.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Too fast.

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:09.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I remember,
you remember the days

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:13.300 align:middle line:84%
when we landed on
the moon, 1969.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:19.339 align:middle line:84%
Look how far we've gone in
50 years, 46 years, which

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:21.819 align:middle line:90%
is nothing in space-time.

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:22.610 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Nothing.

00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:22.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:23.829 align:middle line:90%
But look what's happened.

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:25.037 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Look at the world.

00:17:25.037 --> 00:17:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And what you see in the world is
like a plethora of distraction,

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.390 align:middle line:84%
weapons of mass distraction,
you might call them.

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And they're distracting
us constantly

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.770 align:middle line:84%
with all these
things that we never

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:40.090 align:middle line:90%
can see what's really happening.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And so people don't
even look up at the sky

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:43.750 align:middle line:90%
and see these things.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:45.112 align:middle line:90%
You say, look up, you see that?

00:17:45.112 --> 00:17:46.653 align:middle line:84%
And they go, I don't
want to look up.

00:17:46.653 --> 00:17:48.280 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to see it, right?

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.120 align:middle line:84%
And besides, those are
just clouds anyway.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:50.450 align:middle line:90%
It's like--

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:51.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're afraid.

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah,
they are afraid,

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:57.710 align:middle line:84%
and fear is the worst
enemy of humanity.

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And we need to buck
up and get courage,

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:02.760 align:middle line:84%
because we have
to take the reins

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.140 align:middle line:84%
and start controlling
our destiny here

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.420 align:middle line:84%
and quit being
followers and quit

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.720 align:middle line:90%
being people who are victims.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.620 align:middle line:84%
They've tried to
make us victims.

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:14.600 align:middle line:84%
They make being a
victim be cool now.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.570 align:middle line:90%
So who's victimizing you?

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a victim, that
means you need help now,

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:21.370 align:middle line:90%
and who's going to help you?

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:22.943 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's going to be
the government that's

00:18:22.943 --> 00:18:25.401 align:middle line:84%
going to come in and help you
because you're a poor victim,

00:18:25.401 --> 00:18:27.420 align:middle line:84%
and you can't even
take care of yourself.

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:30.270 align:middle line:84%
This is the message we're
constantly being sent.

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:32.170 align:middle line:84%
Except for Gaiam TV
and "Coast to Coast,"

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:34.140 align:middle line:84%
you're constantly getting
this in the media.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.750 align:middle line:90%
And I say, no more victims.

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:39.860 align:middle line:84%
It's time for us to rise
up, take back this planet

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.477 align:middle line:90%
because we're losing it.

00:18:41.477 --> 00:18:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Back to the
Cross of Hendaye.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.210 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes.

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Obviously, the
creators of that cross,

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.940 align:middle line:84%
those who sculptured
it, knew something,

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:55.030 align:middle line:84%
were told something of
probably events to come,

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:57.140 align:middle line:84%
or events that had
happened, or both.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:58.140 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Both.

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:01.960 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's kind of
amazing that Fulcanelli

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.950 align:middle line:84%
says about the builder
of the Cross of Hendaye

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:07.420 align:middle line:84%
that he had knowledge even
beyond what we have today.

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.660 align:middle line:84%
Somehow he acquired
this knowledge.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And my belief is
that, like I said

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:13.945 align:middle line:84%
before, there's
a secret society.

00:19:13.945 --> 00:19:18.200 align:middle line:84%
It started out
completely pro-human

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:23.860 align:middle line:84%
that had this information of a
continuous cycle of something

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:24.840 align:middle line:90%
with the Sun.

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And they were passing this
information down from father

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:34.340 align:middle line:84%
to son or mother to daughter,
and they forgot to tell us.

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.040 align:middle line:90%
They forgot the information.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.620 align:middle line:90%
If you look at the writing--

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:38.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or something
happened to them.

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:40.518 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Or something
happened to them.

00:19:40.518 --> 00:19:42.340 align:middle line:84%
They got taken
over or something.

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Which a lot of people
say, as you know,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.390 align:middle line:84%
that they got taken
over in the 1800s

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.850 align:middle line:84%
by a nefarious,
evil group, and now

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:50.700 align:middle line:84%
they're hiding all
the information.

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.196 align:middle line:84%
Which the Cross of
Hendaye would say,

00:19:53.196 --> 00:19:54.570 align:middle line:84%
yeah, that's
probably true, which

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:57.095 align:middle line:84%
is why Fulcanelli even came
out and told us about it,

00:19:57.095 --> 00:19:59.470 align:middle line:84%
because he's a whistleblower,
and he's inside this group.

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:00.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A book of secrets?

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, like
a book of secrets.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.120 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
Cross of Hendaye is.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.078 align:middle line:90%
It's a book of secrets.

00:20:04.078 --> 00:20:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And every time that you
do an interpretation

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:08.970 align:middle line:84%
of the Cross of Hendaye,
you discover more secrets.

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is NASA
doing right now, publicly

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:12.730 align:middle line:90%
and privately, in your opinion?

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well,
privately they're

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.560 align:middle line:84%
telling their people
that there's something

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.370 align:middle line:84%
so serious with the
Sun that they actually

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:24.570 align:middle line:84%
have to rewrite the rules
of physics, carbon dating,

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:25.660 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:29.410 align:middle line:84%
Carbon dating is the
slow deterioration

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:32.222 align:middle line:84%
of atomic material that
they can watch over time,

00:20:32.222 --> 00:20:34.180 align:middle line:84%
and then they can date
things that are organic.

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
pretty close, too.

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:36.605 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: They
are pretty close,

00:20:36.605 --> 00:20:38.070 align:middle line:90%
to about 5,000 years ago.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:41.580 align:middle line:84%
But what NASA is saying now
that anything beyond 5,000

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.170 align:middle line:90%
is probably not legit.

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:45.240 align:middle line:84%
They can't do it,
because they found out

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.760 align:middle line:84%
that the rate of
decay is not stable.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.670 align:middle line:84%
It's unstable, and it's due
to the Sun, the changing

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:53.140 align:middle line:90%
nature of the Sun.

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:53.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:53.860 --> 00:21:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And I've had people
in NASA tell me

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:03.250 align:middle line:84%
that they've seen
stuff from SOHO, which

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:06.800 align:middle line:84%
was so frightening and
freaky that they are tempted

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.360 align:middle line:84%
to just quit and
just start partying.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some of that
leaks out on the internet.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.151 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: It does.

00:21:12.151 --> 00:21:14.912 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we just don't know
if it's real or not, right?

00:21:14.912 --> 00:21:16.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: I think it's real.

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.930 align:middle line:90%
I think those rumors are real.

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:21.560 align:middle line:84%
I think the rumors of sudden
quitting or disappearing

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.940 align:middle line:84%
of people in NASA, I
think those are all real.

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.290 align:middle line:90%
I think that they see it.

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:27.510 align:middle line:84%
They realize that their
lives are at stake.

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:28.930 align:middle line:84%
Their family's
lives are at stake.

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:29.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Their
jobs are at stake.

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:30.486 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Their jobs.

00:21:30.486 --> 00:21:32.029 align:middle line:84%
And then they
just-- they lose it.

00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:33.570 align:middle line:84%
They lose it, because
the information

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:35.074 align:middle line:90%
is too much for them to handle.

00:21:35.074 --> 00:21:35.990 align:middle line:90%
I really believe that.

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's one thing
we really can't stop.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:41.810 align:middle line:84%
We can slow, but we
can't stop, and that's

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:43.021 align:middle line:90%
Earth-changing events.

00:21:43.021 --> 00:21:44.020 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't
stop a tornado.

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:47.900 align:middle line:84%
It's rolling
through the Midwest.

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:50.480 align:middle line:90%
Mother Nature does what it does.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.939 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to stop the
Sun from doing what it's doing.

00:21:52.939 --> 00:21:54.938 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: You can slow
it down with chemtrails.

00:21:54.938 --> 00:21:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Slow it
down, preserve it.

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.831 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, that's all
you can do is slow it down.

00:21:58.831 --> 00:22:02.070 align:middle line:84%
But you cannot, in any way,
change what's about to happen.

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:04.670 align:middle line:90%
And it may be a good thing.

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:05.840 align:middle line:90%
It may not be a bad thing.

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.210 align:middle line:90%
It may be a very good thing.

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:10.850 align:middle line:84%
It may be a
consciousness-raising event,

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:12.920 align:middle line:84%
that they quit
spraying the chemtrails

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:16.890 align:middle line:84%
and let the real sunlight in
that we might change as humans.

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Just like we changed
from Cro-Magnon

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.730 align:middle line:84%
to what we are today, we can
go through another change.

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, the
change from Cro-Magnon

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:27.430 align:middle line:84%
to humans occurred
about 30,000 years ago,

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:30.400 align:middle line:84%
26,000 years ago,
occurred at another time

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.420 align:middle line:84%
when there was a great
change in the Sun.

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:35.940 align:middle line:84%
So Robert Felix, the
meteorologist, he

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.822 align:middle line:84%
says that evolution is guided
by the Sun, and I believe that.

00:22:38.822 --> 00:22:40.780 align:middle line:84%
I actually believe that
that's what's going on.

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Got a friend of mine
who gets very depressed when

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.390 align:middle line:84%
he doesn't have sunlight after
a certain amount of time.

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And that happens
to a lot of people.

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:49.681 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: It does.

00:22:49.681 --> 00:22:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have to have
the Sun for a lot of reasons.

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:56.720 align:middle line:84%
It turns, your body
system, into vitamin D.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.880 align:middle line:90%
You got to have that.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.432 align:middle line:90%
What happens if that's all gone?

00:23:00.432 --> 00:23:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well, it's
funny you say that.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.910 align:middle line:84%
I used to live in Seattle,
and we went through a period

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:07.657 align:middle line:84%
where we had 94
days of no sunshine.

00:23:07.657 --> 00:23:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People would
get whacked out.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:09.700 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Oh, they were.

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:11.390 align:middle line:84%
The murder rates
were skyrocketing.

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.237 align:middle line:90%
Suicide rates were skyrocketing.

00:23:13.237 --> 00:23:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And then, finally,
we got a sunny day,

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:17.507 align:middle line:84%
and it was the top headline
in the Seattle Times.

00:23:17.507 --> 00:23:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:18.965 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Sunny Day.

00:23:18.965 --> 00:23:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And crime
probably stopped, right?

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:22.370 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Nobody went to work.

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:23.520 align:middle line:90%
Everybody took the day off.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.230 align:middle line:90%
It was like incredible.

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:26.180 align:middle line:90%
Nobody went to school.

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Everyone said, I'm
staying home today.

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:28.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's have a good day.

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:29.526 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:23:29.526 --> 00:23:30.580 align:middle line:90%
So no, it's horrible.

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.290 align:middle line:90%
It's horribly depressing.

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they drink
so much caffeine in Seattle

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:36.884 align:middle line:84%
and Portland is
because it's so foggy.

00:23:36.884 --> 00:23:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:38.510 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know that.

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:38.650 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:39.670 align:middle line:90%
Because you're not getting--

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:41.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Starbucks
must love that city.

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: It's
where they started.

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:42.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:43.030 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:44.940 align:middle line:84%
That's where their
corporate headquarters

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:46.400 align:middle line:90%
is because it's so cloudy.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:46.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.140 align:middle line:90%
And so, yeah, it is depressing.

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think that SAD, it's
called SAD, Seasonally

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:59.110 align:middle line:84%
Adjusted Depression, and people
get very sad in the winter

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:00.172 align:middle line:90%
because there's no sun.

00:24:00.172 --> 00:24:00.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:06.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And I think that
this proof that the Sun changes

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:08.910 align:middle line:84%
us and can make us
happy, can make us sad,

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:10.430 align:middle line:90%
this is all brain chemistry.

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Light hits your eyes,
hits the pineal gland,

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.500 align:middle line:84%
changes chemicals
inside your brain.

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Serotonin suddenly
erupts in your brain.

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:19.520 align:middle line:84%
You get happy in the
morning when you wake up.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.420 align:middle line:10%
That's all part
of consciousness,

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.610 align:middle line:10%
and it's all guided by
the Sun because it's

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:24.580 align:middle line:10%
like a mirror of us.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:27.970 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You can predict the
moods of people by the weather.

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes, you can.

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:31.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I know that when
you get through Thanksgiving

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:35.080 align:middle line:84%
and into Christmas,
people can handle

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:38.090 align:middle line:90%
cold weather, snow, clouds.

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:40.297 align:middle line:84%
And then after Christmas,
they're done with that.

00:24:40.297 --> 00:24:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: They are.

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:42.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They got to
have some sunlight.

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:42.990 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: They are.

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:44.364 align:middle line:84%
That's when people
take vacations

00:24:44.364 --> 00:24:46.390 align:middle line:90%
to the Caribbean and everything.

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:49.115 align:middle line:84%
But people also get really
depressed in January

00:24:49.115 --> 00:24:54.240 align:middle line:84%
and February in the north part
of the world because of that.

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:58.320 align:middle line:84%
They're able to hold the
dark until Christmas, right?

00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And Christmas is kind
of a celebration,

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:00.794 align:middle line:90%
looking forward to--

00:25:00.794 --> 00:25:02.251 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They can
get through that.

00:25:02.251 --> 00:25:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: They get-- but then
after that comes the crash,

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:06.900 align:middle line:90%
and it's dark and it's dreary.

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And the Sun sets at 5:15
and doesn't get up--

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Sun doesn't rise until
late, near 8 o'clock

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:14.780 align:middle line:90%
in the deep winter.

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And people are so depressed and
just waiting for springtime.

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:20.690 align:middle line:90%
And then when spring comes--

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:20.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Things change.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: --everybody's
happy again.

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:22.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.394 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And this is
all guided by the Sun.

00:25:24.394 --> 00:25:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I used to
breed horses in Illinois

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:29.315 align:middle line:84%
as a hobby--
expensive hobby, Jay.

00:25:29.315 --> 00:25:29.940 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes.

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And my trainer
would always say,

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.740 align:middle line:84%
we have to turn the lights
on at night for the horses.

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what are
you talking about?

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And he said, George, it is
so dreary here in Illinois

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:46.000 align:middle line:84%
that the mares will not breed
unless there's sunlight.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.970 align:middle line:84%
So they tricked them by
keeping lights on all the time.

00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:50.660 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:51.368 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: It is.

00:25:51.368 --> 00:25:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And we do that with
ourselves, where

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:58.330 align:middle line:84%
we will go to
tanning salons and do

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:01.560 align:middle line:84%
all these things to
stop the depression.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And now people are changing
their lights in their houses

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.720 align:middle line:84%
so that they're full spectrum
so they're more like sunlight

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.550 align:middle line:90%
because they're starved.

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And we have a serious
vitamin D shortage

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:13.247 align:middle line:90%
because we don't go outside.

00:26:13.247 --> 00:26:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And we're being told
not to go outside

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:16.380 align:middle line:90%
because the sun is bad for you.

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:17.735 align:middle line:90%
The sun is not bad for you.

00:26:17.735 --> 00:26:22.330 align:middle line:84%
The sun is good for you, and
you need to go out in the sun.

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:25.811 align:middle line:84%
And putting heavy chemicals
and sunscreens on you and--

00:26:25.811 --> 00:26:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the long
run, it doesn't work.

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:28.320 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: It doesn't work.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.180 align:middle line:90%
You need to go out.

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.970 align:middle line:84%
You need to go out
early in the spring,

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:35.120 align:middle line:84%
and so you don't
get burned, right?

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.070 align:middle line:84%
If you stay indoors,
and in June you go out--

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
going to get burned.

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: You're going
to get seriously burned.

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:43.100 align:middle line:84%
So you have to let your-- you
have to slowly get into it.

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And then you can go out in
June and not get burned and not

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:48.945 align:middle line:84%
get melanoma because you
build up enough melanin

00:26:48.945 --> 00:26:51.992 align:middle line:84%
in the skin, tan,
what makes you tan,

00:26:51.992 --> 00:26:53.200 align:middle line:90%
so that you don't get burned.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.555 align:middle line:84%
So human beings are
supposed to be outside.

00:26:54.555 --> 00:26:55.680 align:middle line:84%
We're not supposed
to be indoors.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.596 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:26:56.596 --> 00:26:59.800 align:middle line:84%
I remember going down to
Miami once, and I said,

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.800 align:middle line:84%
you know what, I'm going
to get a tan right now.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:02.585 align:middle line:90%
And I got burned--

00:27:02.585 --> 00:27:03.290 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Oh, boy.

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:03.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --Jay.

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:04.610 align:middle line:90%
It turned into a fever.

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:05.443 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Oh, yeah.

00:27:05.443 --> 00:27:07.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had the shakes,
the chills all night.

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.090 align:middle line:90%
You got to do it gradually.

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: You can die from
that, yeah, sun exposure.

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.410 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people do that.

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:16.760 align:middle line:84%
People from England will
frequently, in the winter,

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:19.335 align:middle line:84%
go to Southern
Italy, and they call

00:27:19.335 --> 00:27:22.250 align:middle line:84%
them roast beef, the Italians
do, because they show up,

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:23.980 align:middle line:90%
and they're getting red.

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:25.110 align:middle line:90%
And then they start--

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:26.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As a beet.

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:26.300 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:27.674 align:middle line:84%
As they start
sitting in the sun,

00:27:27.674 --> 00:27:30.115 align:middle line:84%
they just turn into
like rare roast beef.

00:27:30.115 --> 00:27:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And they say you can
tell who they are,

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:33.120 align:middle line:84%
they say, you walk around,
they're just like--

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.078 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You touch them,
you can see the white.

00:27:35.078 --> 00:27:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER:
--blood-red from being

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:41.136 align:middle line:84%
in all that fog and clouds
into the hot, harsh sunshine.

00:27:41.136 --> 00:27:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And you really
shouldn't do that.

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chills and
fevers waiting to happen.

00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:45.106 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Absolutely.

00:27:45.106 --> 00:27:46.500 align:middle line:90%
It's just an awful thing to do.

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:48.460 align:middle line:84%
So the Sun is a very
important thing.

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:49.418 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's critical.

00:27:49.418 --> 00:27:52.680 align:middle line:84%
So where do we go with the Sun,
knowing that it's acting up?

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.352 align:middle line:90%
The solar system is heating up.

00:27:54.352 --> 00:27:55.060 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: It is.

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And so to
me, global warming

00:27:58.090 --> 00:27:59.252 align:middle line:90%
is solar system warming.

00:27:59.252 --> 00:27:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: It is.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something that's
happening to the Sun.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:02.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:03.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we
prepare for this?

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:04.710 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:06.918 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I don't know,
but it's a really good point

00:28:06.918 --> 00:28:08.820 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
have cars on Mars.

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.970 align:middle line:84%
If the temperature's
gone up 14 degrees--

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.674 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: --at
the equator, it's

00:28:12.674 --> 00:28:15.870 align:middle line:84%
actually balmy in the summer
at the equator on Mars.

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:18.329 align:middle line:84%
This is 48, 55 degrees
at the equator.

00:28:18.329 --> 00:28:19.870 align:middle line:84%
You could walk around
with your shirt

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:21.565 align:middle line:84%
off if you didn't
die of asphyxiation.

00:28:21.565 --> 00:28:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And the same thing's
true with Venus is heating up.

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:28.590 align:middle line:84%
We know that Jupiter is heating
up, and Saturn's heating up.

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:32.220 align:middle line:84%
Why is this happening if
it's caused by humans?

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is it's
not caused by humans,

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.804 align:middle line:90%
but you can't tax the Sun.

00:28:36.804 --> 00:28:38.095 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't tax the Sun.

00:28:38.095 --> 00:28:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:39.862 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And nobody
wants pollution.

00:28:39.862 --> 00:28:40.945 align:middle line:90%
It's a different argument.

00:28:40.945 --> 00:28:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: It is a
different argument.

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And the global warming
caused by humans is a hoax.

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:47.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a complete hoax.

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:50.300 align:middle line:84%
You had Robert Zimmerman
on a few weeks ago talking

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:51.400 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.830 align:middle line:90%
It is just a hoax.

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:57.452 align:middle line:84%
And it's a cover-up for
what's going on with the Sun.

00:28:57.452 --> 00:28:59.910 align:middle line:84%
Since they don't want to tell
us that something's happening

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:01.640 align:middle line:84%
with the Sun, then
they tell us it's

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.380 align:middle line:84%
your fault, again,
making us the victim.

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:05.560 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you know, we did it.

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We did it.

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:05.960 align:middle line:90%
It's our fault.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: We're the bad
people because we're trying--

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:09.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And now we
have to pay for it.

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:09.990 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: And we have to pay.

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Because we're
getting in our cars

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:13.870 align:middle line:84%
and going to work to make money
to get food for our families,

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:17.000 align:middle line:84%
it's our fault that the
world is getting warmer.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's just
classic way to blame us

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.920 align:middle line:90%
for everything that's going on.

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:27.080 align:middle line:84%
The Sun is so much more powerful
than all the humans on Earth.

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.190 align:middle line:10%
If you took all
the pollution that

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:33.080 align:middle line:10%
has come out of
automobiles and factories,

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.152 align:middle line:10%
that is one volcano, one--

00:29:35.152 --> 00:29:35.860 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:37.620 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: --big, like Vesuvius.

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:41.170 align:middle line:10%
Mount Vesuvius put
more junk into the air

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:44.380 align:middle line:10%
than all humans have
done from the beginning

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:46.500 align:middle line:10%
of the first human until now.

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And people
want more information

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.980 align:middle line:90%
on the Cross of Hendaye.

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Is your original
book still available?

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:52.378 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: It is.

00:29:52.378 --> 00:29:54.740 align:middle line:10%
It's "Inner
Traditions," and you can

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:56.990 align:middle line:10%
go to my site, jayweidner.com,
if you want to buy it.

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:58.198 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Spell it out for us.

00:29:58.198 --> 00:30:00.320 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER:
J-A-Y-W-E-I-D-N-E-R.com,

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:06.654 align:middle line:10%
sacredmysteries.com to
get my films and videos.

00:30:06.654 --> 00:30:07.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:09.729 align:middle line:84%
I see you as a watchdog
for the human race.

00:30:09.729 --> 00:30:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I feel like
that I'm a watchdog.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.615 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, actually I do.

00:30:12.615 --> 00:30:12.805 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:30:12.805 --> 00:30:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:14.830 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Hey, no problem, man.

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:15.320 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Good to be here.

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How about that?

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:18.360 align:middle line:10%
We have an expert out
here who is looking

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.690 align:middle line:10%
at chemtrails,
activity on the Sun,

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:23.930 align:middle line:10%
passing that
information on to you,

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:26.430 align:middle line:10%
so at least you know
what you can do about it.

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:30.976 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thank you
for watching "Beyond Belief."
