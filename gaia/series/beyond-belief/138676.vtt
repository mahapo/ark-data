>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.180 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.470 align:middle line:10%
And we have given you
some incredible programs

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.520 align:middle line:10%
over the years.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.490 align:middle line:84%
But what you're about
to see in this program

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.550 align:middle line:84%
will stun you because of
what it is and how it works.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.550 align:middle line:84%
Our special guest
is Lyn Buchanan.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.940 align:middle line:90%
He's with the military.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.520 align:middle line:90%
He was a remote viewer.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Years later he decided to
continue his remote viewing

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.130 align:middle line:84%
practice into what is now called
controlled remote viewing.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.740 align:middle line:90%
Lyn, welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LYN BUCHANAN: Well,
thank you for inviting me.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What an
exciting endeavor

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.100 align:middle line:90%
you have had over the years.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.120 align:middle line:10%
>> BUCHANAN: Oh, listen, when
I went into the military unit

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.660 align:middle line:10%
and they read me on as
to what they really do,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.550 align:middle line:10%
I thought I was on
"Candid Camera," you know?

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.860 align:middle line:10%
I thought this was a joke.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.460 align:middle line:84%
It was the most exciting,
fascinating part

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.320 align:middle line:84%
of the military I have
ever seen in my life.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have
got to tell us, first

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.910 align:middle line:90%
of all, what remote viewing is.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.150 align:middle line:84%
Now you and I have talked over
the years, not only on "Coast

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.020 align:middle line:84%
to Coast," but we've done a
"Beyond Belief" program before.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.170 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people want to know
exactly what is remote viewing.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.970 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: OK.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Basically the military
took on the project

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.820 align:middle line:84%
of getting psychic spies, but
they didn't want psychics.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And so they went out to
Stanford Research Institute,

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.240 align:middle line:84%
they did a study,
and they found out

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.420 align:middle line:84%
that a part of your
subconscious mind

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.700 align:middle line:84%
connects with whatever is
psychic, whatever psychic is.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.460 align:middle line:84%
But your subconscious doesn't
talk to your conscious mind.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.210 align:middle line:84%
So they developed a methodology
of interview and report

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.660 align:middle line:84%
so that your conscious mind
can interview your subconscious

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.490 align:middle line:90%
and report what it says.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.360 align:middle line:84%
They taught it for
basically psychic spying.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.400 align:middle line:84%
The fact is, your
subconscious knows

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.320 align:middle line:84%
why you do those things
you don't want to do

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.210 align:middle line:84%
and why you don't do
the thing-- you know.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And it knows
everything about you.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And so the tools
and the methodology

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.960 align:middle line:84%
works for everything
that's in your sub--

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.830 align:middle line:84%
it knows where your car
keys are, and so on.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did we
follow up on what

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.130 align:middle line:90%
the Soviets were doing first?

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Is that how all
this really started?

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: We did it as a
reaction to what the Soviets

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.840 align:middle line:90%
were doing.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.810 align:middle line:84%
When Hitler lost the war, Great
Britain, France, and the US

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.270 align:middle line:84%
took all the nuclear
scientists, rocket scientists,

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.260 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.250 align:middle line:90%
He had a huge project.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Operation
Paperclip, right?

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:53.740 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Hitler also had a project called
Doktor Gruenbaum, green tree,

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.980 align:middle line:84%
which he was fascinated
with the Kabbalah.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:03.910 align:middle line:90%
Nobody wanted it.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.620 align:middle line:90%
Russia took it.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And in the '60s, the Soviets
were getting our classified

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.610 align:middle line:90%
information like crazy.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.100 align:middle line:84%
One of their people
defected and brought

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.260 align:middle line:84%
with him documentation
that showed what they were

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.030 align:middle line:90%
doing with their psychic spies.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And everybody here
had a laugh about it.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.830 align:middle line:84%
But then they read the documents
and they said hey, this works.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
something to this.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.840 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.130 align:middle line:84%
The spy group is different
from the rest of the military.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.630 align:middle line:84%
Anything that works
they're going to do it.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And so they decided
OK, we're going

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.900 align:middle line:90%
to find out how to do this.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And so they went out
to Stanford Research,

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:50.320 align:middle line:84%
had them do a study
on how this works.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.974 align:middle line:90%
And a man named Ingo Swann.

00:03:52.974 --> 00:03:53.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Know the guy.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.410 align:middle line:84%
God rest his soul, but
he was one of the best.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: He was, yeah.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.280 align:middle line:84%
He developed a protocol
for the conscious mind

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.860 align:middle line:84%
to interview the subconscious
and report the information

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:09.800 align:middle line:90%
back.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So when they
got the data, when

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.230 align:middle line:84%
they were able to start
getting information,

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.782 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they believed that
something to this, right?

00:04:16.782 --> 00:04:19.073 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: They knew there
was something to it, yeah.

00:04:19.073 --> 00:04:21.850 align:middle line:90%


00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.400 align:middle line:84%
The first remote viewer was
a guy named Joe McMoneagle.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he's
still doing it.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.470 align:middle line:84%
He's still out there
doing it, as you are too.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.894 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:04:30.894 --> 00:04:32.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he's
teaching it, but he's

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.152 align:middle line:90%
doing it professionally.

00:04:34.152 --> 00:04:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you have
since switched now--

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.660 align:middle line:84%
now that you're out
of the military--

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.310 align:middle line:84%
into what is called
controlled remote viewing.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.630 align:middle line:90%
Now what is that?

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:42.430 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: OK.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.490 align:middle line:84%
It was called co-ordinate
remote viewing.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And when it came
out to the public--

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.520 align:middle line:90%
see, they gave his coordinates.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.280 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to tell
us what the target was

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.330 align:middle line:84%
because that would kick in
your logic and everything else.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.730 align:middle line:84%
So they would say,
for example, this

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.200 align:middle line:90%
is Project 970304, question 3.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.466 align:middle line:90%
What's the answer?

00:05:06.466 --> 00:05:08.170 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:14.560 align:middle line:84%
So using coordinates like that,
when it came out to the public,

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.757 align:middle line:84%
psychics started using
coordinates and calling

00:05:16.757 --> 00:05:17.965 align:middle line:90%
it coordinate remote viewing.

00:05:17.965 --> 00:05:19.390 align:middle line:90%
Well, it wasn't.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.760 align:middle line:84%
So Ingo said, hey, the one word
they won't take is controlled.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.530 align:middle line:84%
So he called it
controlled remote viewing,

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.630 align:middle line:84%
and that's what it's
been called ever since.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Specifically,
what is that?

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: OK.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.520 align:middle line:84%
That is that you control
the remote viewing.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As opposed to the
remote viewing doing it to you.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:40.420 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And one of the complaints
that psychics have

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.130 align:middle line:90%
is that they're at its mercy.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, in controlled
remote viewing,

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.090 align:middle line:84%
you remote view
in a set pattern.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.140 align:middle line:90%
You sit down at a certain place.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.380 align:middle line:90%
You do a certain procedure.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.460 align:middle line:90%
You get the information.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.390 align:middle line:90%
You finish.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.240 align:middle line:90%
You get up, and you're finished.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And so it's all under
your own control.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And so many people hear
controlled remote viewing

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.980 align:middle line:84%
and they think, oh, the
viewer is controlled

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.140 align:middle line:90%
by all these protocols.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.230 align:middle line:84%
No, the protocols are
there so the viewing

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.470 align:middle line:90%
is controlled by the viewer.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:24.530 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's an amazing tool.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.010 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.100 align:middle line:84%
I've practiced it because
of people like you who

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.570 align:middle line:90%
have given me some pointers.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.826 align:middle line:84%
I haven't taken your course
yet, but I want to do that.

00:06:34.826 --> 00:06:35.950 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Yeah, drop by.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:41.020 align:middle line:84%
In 1980, Lyn, there was a UFO
case in the United Kingdom.

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.200 align:middle line:90%
It was called Rendlesham.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.000 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.680 align:middle line:10%
- In December 1980, United
States military personnel

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.940 align:middle line:10%
located at the twin bases
of RAF Bentwaters and RAF

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.860 align:middle line:10%
Woodbridge in Suffolk, England
observed strange lights

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.080 align:middle line:10%
and one or more UFOs in
the adjoining woodland,

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.900 align:middle line:10%
known as Rendlesham Forest
and over the military bases.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.400 align:middle line:84%
At approximately 3:00
AM on December 26,

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.210 align:middle line:84%
security personnel on patrol
near the east gate of RAF

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Woodbridge observed
unusual lights

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.580 align:middle line:84%
which appeared to be
descending into the forest.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.700 align:middle line:84%
Upon leaving the base and
entering Rendlesham forest

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.550 align:middle line:84%
to investigate, several
military personnel

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.610 align:middle line:84%
observed a metallic,
triangular-shaped object

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.880 align:middle line:84%
with colored lights which
had landed in a clearing.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Two of the men approached the
object, and one of the men

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.750 align:middle line:90%
was able to touch it.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:33.550 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is an
amazing case, Lyn,

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.560 align:middle line:84%
because so many US
military personnel that

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.400 align:middle line:84%
were stationed out there in the
United Kingdom witnessed this,

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.870 align:middle line:84%
touched the craft,
as a matter of fact.

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Some have gotten
sick over the years.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: That's true.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Government
says, oh, no.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Has nothing to do
with that case.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.184 align:middle line:90%
You remote viewed it.

00:07:52.184 --> 00:07:53.350 align:middle line:90%
You took a quick look at it.

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:54.970 align:middle line:90%
Tell me, what did you do?

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: As always, I
got encrypted coordinates,

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.730 align:middle line:84%
so I had no idea
I was viewing it.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was viewing one
specific night of that,

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.590 align:middle line:90%
I found out later.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:10.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of the several nights.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.655 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: Of
the several nights.

00:08:12.655 --> 00:08:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the only
one I have viewed.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:20.560 align:middle line:84%
But during that, they had
me describe the craft.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And then they had me
go inside the craft--

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: And
draw the floor plans,

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.779 align:middle line:84%
draw the internal plans
and everything else.

00:08:29.779 --> 00:08:31.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did it look like?

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And what did the
inside look like?

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:36.220 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: What I got in the
beginning was just a control

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:41.840 align:middle line:84%
room, a control panel just like
you would expect for any flight

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.640 align:middle line:90%
deck.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it look
out of this world?

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.980 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Pretty much.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:48.700 align:middle line:90%
The entire thing was empty.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.040 align:middle line:84%
I went ahead and went
through the rest of the ship.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.540 align:middle line:90%
The entire ship was empty.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like it was a
drone craft of some sort.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: Yeah, but I
went into the computer.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.100 align:middle line:90%
I can read computers.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:04.120 align:middle line:84%
I went into the computer and
found that it was autonomous.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.770 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't controlled by anybody.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:07.210 align:middle line:90%
It was autonomous.

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And it was looking
for something,

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.000 align:middle line:90%
and several things in fact.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And when it found
it, when it found

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:19.560 align:middle line:84%
one of those things it was
looking for, a program to look

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.340 align:middle line:84%
for, it would sort of radio
back to somebody and say,

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:25.380 align:middle line:90%
I found it.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:29.239 align:middle line:84%
And then later they would
know exactly where to come.

00:09:29.239 --> 00:09:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lyn, describe
what the craft

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.320 align:middle line:90%
looks like from the outside.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: From the outside
it was shiny, of course.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And it did have a sort of
pointed area on one side.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it look like
anything we had at the time?

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Oh, no.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:49.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No way.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.410 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: No.

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And it was, of course, rounded
on top, rounded on bottom.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:55.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big--

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.798 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Flattened.

00:09:56.798 --> 00:09:58.634 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you think it was?

00:09:58.634 --> 00:10:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: It seemed
to me, on the outside,

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:08.160 align:middle line:84%
like it was maybe about five
or six times the size of a car.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Now when I got on the inside,
of course, if they were smaller,

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:13.400 align:middle line:90%
it would look--

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.240 align:middle line:90%
I would have shrunk to that.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:19.290 align:middle line:84%
But on the inside it
looked pretty big.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:22.500 align:middle line:84%
There were
compartments and things

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.570 align:middle line:84%
like that, and
this control panel,

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:27.150 align:middle line:90%
which was totally unmanned.

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And as you said
you were looking at it,

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:30.870 align:middle line:90%
it was empty.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:34.090 align:middle line:84%
So you didn't see any
extraterrestrial beings.

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:34.890 align:middle line:90%
No, I didn't.

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:36.181 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Nothing like that.

00:10:36.181 --> 00:10:37.720 align:middle line:90%
No, I didn't.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.340 align:middle line:84%
However, it was lit
on the inside too.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:40.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Are you looking at things in
real time when you remote view?

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So wherever
you might have

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:50.160 align:middle line:84%
been, remote viewing
this craft at that time,

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.460 align:middle line:84%
it was there at
that time, correct?

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Yes.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.860 align:middle line:84%
Now one of the things about
controlled remote viewing

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:59.850 align:middle line:84%
is that your conscious mind
works best present time.

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious mind can go
anywhere in time and space.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.530 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: And so
you give the command,

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.700 align:middle line:84%
move to that time
and that place.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:13.740 align:middle line:90%
Now what am I seeing here?

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And your conscious mind says,
oh, now I'm seeing, and so on.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if the ETs might
have been out of the craft

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.592 align:middle line:84%
at the time that you
were remote viewing,

00:11:23.592 --> 00:11:25.050 align:middle line:84%
that's entirely
possible, isn't it?

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:26.640 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: That's
entirely possible.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.152 align:middle line:84%
That's not what I got, but
that's entirely possible.

00:11:30.152 --> 00:11:32.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think it
might have been a time

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:35.080 align:middle line:90%
machine, our time machine?

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: I don't think so.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.660 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let
me make this clear,

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:44.710 align:middle line:84%
because I've got a government
to contend with here.

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:45.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I bet you do.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: I do.

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:53.350 align:middle line:84%
We were never officially
tasked with ETs or UFOs.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: During
the entire project.

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:56.434 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: During
the entire project,

00:11:56.434 --> 00:12:00.274 align:middle line:84%
we were never officially
tasked with those.

00:12:00.274 --> 00:12:02.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you telling
me something I should know?

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.890 align:middle line:84%
Like, you're stressing
the word officially here.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: I'm stressing
the word officially.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:14.990 align:middle line:84%
We were asked to do
things, special favors

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:17.774 align:middle line:90%
for different Congressmen.

00:12:17.774 --> 00:12:19.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like somebody,
like a president saying

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:24.710 align:middle line:84%
to one of his staff members,
someone rid me of this problem.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.090 align:middle line:90%
And then he walks away.

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: And walks away.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:33.830 align:middle line:90%
And so we had done a lot of ETs.

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And I never found one
that had any indicator

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.330 align:middle line:90%
that it was a time machine.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:44.350 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe, though?

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:46.760 align:middle line:90%
Can you rule it out?

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: I can't
rule it out, no.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your opinion, based
on that one remote viewing

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.270 align:middle line:90%
session--

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: For Rendlesham.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For Rendlesham.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.600 align:middle line:90%
What do you think this was?

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: I think it was
just a drone that was automated

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:07.970 align:middle line:84%
to go find things, and
a drone phone home.

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.335 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why there, Lyn?

00:13:09.335 --> 00:13:10.310 align:middle line:90%
Why Rendlesham?

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:11.649 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: I have no idea.

00:13:11.649 --> 00:13:13.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
it was looking for,

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:17.472 align:middle line:84%
but evidently it found
it at Rendlesham Forest.

00:13:17.472 --> 00:13:19.180 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Our dear
friend Ingo Swann wrote

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.150 align:middle line:10%
a book called Penetration.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:23.950 align:middle line:10%
It was about his work
in remote viewing,

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:28.000 align:middle line:10%
about looking at structures on
the far side of the moon which

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.076 align:middle line:10%
were absolutely incredible.

00:13:30.076 --> 00:13:31.200 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: They're there.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.075 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they're there.

00:13:33.075 --> 00:13:35.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: While you've been
remote viewing in your career,

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:38.020 align:middle line:84%
have you ever been
tasked with looking

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:41.740 align:middle line:84%
at the so-called
secret space program?

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:42.880 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Oh, yeah.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:43.680 align:middle line:90%
Many times.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
have we seen there?

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: We've seen that
we need to change the question

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.117 align:middle line:90%
to another subject.

00:13:51.117 --> 00:13:51.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:52.940 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Yes.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.485 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It seems like, Lyn--

00:13:54.485 --> 00:13:56.930 align:middle line:90%
and I've known you for years--

00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:59.810 align:middle line:84%
it seems like there are
some subjects that you

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:01.910 align:middle line:90%
feel to be taboo to talk about.

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:03.290 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:08.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to put you on the
spot, but you're in the spot.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.270 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: I still stay pretty
current on what's classified

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:18.230 align:middle line:84%
and what's not because when
the project was declassified,

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:22.190 align:middle line:90%
it was effectively declassified.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:25.950 align:middle line:84%
That's government
speak for we're not

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:27.570 align:middle line:84%
going to declassify
this, but we're

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:28.860 align:middle line:90%
going to look the other way.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.735 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It means, Lyn,
keep your mouth shut.

00:14:30.735 --> 00:14:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: It means that if
we ever decide to quit looking

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:39.220 align:middle line:84%
the other way and you have
told classified information,

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:40.470 align:middle line:90%
then we're going to get you.

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:42.515 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me ask you
this a different way.

00:14:42.515 --> 00:14:45.220 align:middle line:90%


00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.650 align:middle line:84%
I can't ask you if
you were tasked, then,

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:49.330 align:middle line:84%
to look at the
secret space program.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:50.710 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Sure, you can ask.

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:52.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You won't tell me.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.617 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:14:53.617 --> 00:14:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there other
things going on out there

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.130 align:middle line:84%
that the public just
doesn't know about?

00:14:58.130 --> 00:14:59.540 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Oh, yeah.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.555 align:middle line:84%
I believe in
security, I really do.

00:15:01.555 --> 00:15:03.740 align:middle line:90%
I believe in secrets.

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:09.200 align:middle line:84%
I believe that it's taken
way beyond what it should,

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.980 align:middle line:84%
and I believe there's a lot that
the public needs to know about.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:16.320 align:middle line:84%
The government says
when in doubt, classify.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.560 align:middle line:90%
That's official.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you live
by that rule still.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:24.126 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: No, I really don't.

00:15:24.126 --> 00:15:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then tell
me everything.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: If
they classify it,

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:29.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to talk about it.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
the case for this.

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: Which is
the case a lot of times.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:37.090 align:middle line:84%
There are things that I
think should be talked about.

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:39.190 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not going to jail.

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:41.854 align:middle line:90%


00:15:41.854 --> 00:15:43.429 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:15:43.429 --> 00:15:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As an American--

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:46.090 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: I
try to be careful.

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As an American,
are you glad that there

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:53.600 align:middle line:90%
is a secret program going on?

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: There are
many secret programs going

00:15:56.210 --> 00:16:01.350 align:middle line:84%
on, and some of
them I'm very glad.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:05.700 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are scary.

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure they
should be going on.

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:12.690 align:middle line:84%
It's not like there
is a secret program.

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:16.320 align:middle line:84%
There are many secret programs
going on, some of them

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.620 align:middle line:90%
extremely good.

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:22.940 align:middle line:84%
Some of them, eh, and
some of them are scary.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of our hosts
for Gaia is Corey Goode,

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.580 align:middle line:84%
and Corey has talked
about the secret space

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.200 align:middle line:90%
program in the past.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And he comes full out,
without any concern

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:38.500 align:middle line:84%
and regards for himself,
and says there's

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.630 align:middle line:90%
something that's been going on.

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:45.940 align:middle line:84%
It's ongoing, and it's been
going on for a long, long time.

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.820 align:middle line:84%
I would guess
you've been tasked,

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:51.430 align:middle line:84%
or you were tasked to see
if the Soviets, at the time,

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:52.694 align:middle line:90%
had something in place too.

00:16:52.694 --> 00:16:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Oh, sure.

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:54.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And did they?

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: We were spies.

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.910 align:middle line:90%
Well, the US doesn't have spies.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:02.140 align:middle line:90%
Bad people have spies.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:04.397 align:middle line:84%
We have intelligence
collection agencies.

00:17:04.397 --> 00:17:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Operatives.

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:06.579 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Operatives, yeah.

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:07.379 align:middle line:90%
They have things.

00:17:07.379 --> 00:17:09.640 align:middle line:90%
Every government has secrets.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The late Ingo Swann,
in his book Penetration,

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:16.130 align:middle line:84%
looked at structures on
the far side of the moon.

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk
about structures

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.579 align:middle line:90%
that could be on Mars.

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:26.349 align:middle line:84%
- We do have these 1970s Mariner
9 images that are untouched

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:30.130 align:middle line:84%
and undoctored
showing this, again,

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:33.940 align:middle line:84%
Martian airport-like
structure on Mars.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And you can see here,
this particular structure

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:39.190 align:middle line:84%
has been featured
in presentations

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:41.030 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Lyn, in
your remote viewing,

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.250 align:middle line:90%
have you seen anything on Mars?

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:47.100 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Oh, yeah.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:51.280 align:middle line:84%
There is a phenomenon in CRV
where you get so engrossed

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:55.750 align:middle line:84%
in the target that the room
around you gets totally ignored

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:58.510 align:middle line:84%
and you cannot tell that
you're not at the target.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:00.370 align:middle line:84%
The first time that
ever happened to me

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:03.590 align:middle line:90%
was a target on Mars.

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And I stood in an opening in
the side of a slanted stone area

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.910 align:middle line:90%
and looked out.

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:19.294 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I had no
idea what I was viewing.

00:18:19.294 --> 00:18:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
know it was Mars?

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:21.970 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: No, I didn't.

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:24.370 align:middle line:84%
We never know what
the target is.

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And so you know,
I saw things out.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.660 align:middle line:90%
And the sun was out.

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:34.350 align:middle line:90%
It was extremely cold.

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:35.310 align:middle line:90%
Cold wind.

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could have been the
desert here, on this planet.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:39.800 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Yes, but it was.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.680 align:middle line:90%
Different it was strange.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:50.070 align:middle line:84%
I found out later
the Sedona region,

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:55.030 align:middle line:84%
the pictures of that were still
were still secret and not out

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:55.830 align:middle line:90%
to the public yet.

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you did you see
via remote viewing the face

00:18:58.740 --> 00:18:59.790 align:middle line:90%
on Mars?

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:01.800 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: No I was
at this thing-- well,

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.710 align:middle line:90%
I saw something off to the side.

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And I was at a place and saw
the detailed picture of that

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:18.940 align:middle line:84%
before it came
out to the public.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.880 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden I looked
and I thought, hey,

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.370 align:middle line:84%
wait a minute,
that's what I saw.

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And I remembered
what I saw, and I

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:28.980 align:middle line:84%
looked on this overhead
picture, and everything

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.720 align:middle line:90%
was right in the place.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And it dawned on me,
hey, I stood on Mars.

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:36.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:39.790 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: This is called
perfect site integration

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:41.710 align:middle line:90%
or bilocation.

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:45.580 align:middle line:90%
And fascinating phenomenon.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And like I say, you can't
tell that you're not there.

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:54.560 align:middle line:84%
So in a very real way, I
stood on the surface of Mars

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.460 align:middle line:84%
and experienced standing
on the surface of Mars.

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Did you see any what you would
consider to be structures

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:04.800 align:middle line:90%
that were made by some entity?

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: I saw some
pyramid-looking things.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.500 align:middle line:90%
No, everything was dead.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Everything was eroded
and such as that.

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:16.670 align:middle line:84%
But I saw no life
anywhere there.

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:25.460 align:middle line:10%
Now at the time, my monitor
had me go into the place

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:30.200 align:middle line:10%
I was standing, and I found
living creatures there, yeah.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind
of living creatures?

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:36.020 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Sort of worm-like.

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:38.350 align:middle line:90%
Large, but sort of worm-like.

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:39.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big?

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.570 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Larger than me.

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:45.525 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Worms larger than you?

00:20:45.525 --> 00:20:49.090 align:middle line:84%
Did they look more
animal than intelligent?

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:49.890 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:52.240 align:middle line:84%
They didn't seem
intelligent, yeah.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.210 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
about remote viewing

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:59.050 align:middle line:84%
is that you adjust to the
size of where you are.

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:02.110 align:middle line:84%
So I could have been
the size of a pinhead

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:03.635 align:middle line:84%
and they would look
larger than me.

00:21:03.635 --> 00:21:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:04.820 align:middle line:90%
Like dinosaurs.

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: So there's no
real way to make an accurate

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:08.530 align:middle line:90%
measurement.

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:10.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But they were alive.

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:12.690 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How many of them?

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:15.580 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Many, yeah.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:16.596 align:middle line:90%
All in one place.

00:21:16.596 --> 00:21:19.400 align:middle line:90%


00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.640 align:middle line:90%
But that's what I saw.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That would be an
eerie sight, wouldn't it?

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:28.400 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: It was very eerie,
because I was in perfect sight

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.400 align:middle line:84%
integration and I was
right in there with them.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.940 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, it was pretty eerie.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Did you see anything, Lyn,
that would look like buildings

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:39.920 align:middle line:90%
or other structures like that?

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.560 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: All
I saw was eroded--

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:50.600 align:middle line:84%
when I was looking out, I saw
eroded hills and desolation out

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.100 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Natural looking.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: Pyramidal,
but natural looking.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:02.977 align:middle line:90%
Very pointed mountains, hills.

00:22:02.977 --> 00:22:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they look like
they were made by something?

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: I didn't get that
impression at the time during

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:13.610 align:middle line:84%
the session, but
could have been.

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:14.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:18.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do other remote
viewers talk amongst each other

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:19.730 align:middle line:90%
about what they've seen?

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:20.530 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: No.

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:22.010 align:middle line:84%
In the military
we weren't allowed

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:26.360 align:middle line:84%
to do that because that
would pollute each other.

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.360 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, these
days, remote viewers

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:33.440 align:middle line:84%
talk about what they found and
their experiences and all that.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:37.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What seems
to be, nowadays,

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:40.130 align:middle line:84%
the biggest subject
matter for remote viewing

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:42.080 align:middle line:90%
to try to look at?

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: The biggest subject
matter these days is generally

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:54.350 align:middle line:84%
police work, medical work,
and scientific research

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:55.167 align:middle line:90%
and development.

00:22:55.167 --> 00:22:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when
you say police work,

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:58.160 align:middle line:90%
what are they looking for?

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: Missing
children, missing evidence.

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:05.990 align:middle line:84%
I did a study one time
for one police department

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:09.410 align:middle line:84%
on drugs coming
across the border

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:12.590 align:middle line:84%
to predict when the next
big shipment of drugs

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:17.330 align:middle line:84%
would come across the border,
and exactly where and when.

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:19.850 align:middle line:84%
It's very unusual to
send out the troops

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:22.820 align:middle line:84%
on the word of a remote
viewer, but they actually did.

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And they caught a
huge shipment of drugs

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:30.170 align:middle line:84%
coming across the border at that
place, at that time predicted.

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:32.960 align:middle line:84%
The chief of police
in that department,

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:39.060 align:middle line:84%
scared him so bad that he
won't even talk to me anymore.

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:39.860 align:middle line:90%
It scared him.

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm sure, Lyn, you
have seen all kinds of things.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:43.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, getting back
to Ingo Swann's work

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:46.160 align:middle line:84%
on the far side of the
moon, how about you?

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.670 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever taken a
glance at the far side?

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:51.350 align:middle line:90%
What have you seen?

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:53.330 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Buildings and--

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you
basically corroborated

00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:57.530 align:middle line:90%
what Ingo says he saw.

00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:58.370 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:59.960 align:middle line:84%
Now like I say, I
didn't know what

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.510 align:middle line:84%
I was viewing at the time
I was tasked with it.

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:05.570 align:middle line:84%
I always try to be
blind in my tasking.

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you don't know
if it's the moon, Earth.

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:10.219 align:middle line:90%
You just don't know.

00:24:10.219 --> 00:24:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Moon or Manhattan.

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:13.210 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it
look like Manhattan?

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:16.320 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Not at all.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.120 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Describe what it
looked like for us.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:25.400 align:middle line:84%
It looked like totally
desolate, darkish brownish gray.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like abandoned?

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:28.250 align:middle line:90%
Nobody there anymore?

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: Yeah, but
there were lights in these

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:31.460 align:middle line:90%
structures.

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And the structures were
not like they are on Earth.

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They weren't
high rise buildings?

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: They were vertical,
but they weren't high rise

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:41.000 align:middle line:90%
buildings, no.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.760 align:middle line:90%
They were industrial-looking.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:49.250 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever looked at one
of these oil refineries that

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:54.200 align:middle line:84%
has the towers, that has the
cat walks around them and all

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.210 align:middle line:90%
that, it looked more like that.

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But clearly they
looked like they were made.

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of course, we
don't know whom, right?

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:07.220 align:middle line:84%
You didn't see any ETs or
any UFOs on the far side?

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:11.390 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Not there, no.

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
mean by not there?

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.000 align:middle line:84%
Sounds like you saw
it somewhere else.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:15.916 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Oh, yeah.

00:25:15.916 --> 00:25:24.080 align:middle line:84%
There are places on Earth
where the ETs have places,

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.240 align:middle line:90%
and we viewed those.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I've seen humans
working with ETs and so forth.

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've seen how
many different groups of ETs?

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: In the
remote viewing, several.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.890 align:middle line:90%
There's not us and them.

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Everybody says, well,
what do they want?

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, they want something
different from what they want

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:43.740 align:middle line:90%
and from what they want.

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And so there's us and
them and them and them.

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:50.589 align:middle line:84%
And each one is here with
their own different agenda.

00:25:50.589 --> 00:25:52.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've always
been told, Lyn,

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:57.680 align:middle line:84%
that there are Alien
Greys, the Nordics--

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:58.910 align:middle line:90%
they look like us--

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:02.480 align:middle line:84%
reptilians, praying
mantis types.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.485 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen
these types of ETs?

00:26:04.485 --> 00:26:05.285 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:26:05.285 --> 00:26:09.600 align:middle line:90%


00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.790 align:middle line:90%
And not in remote viewing, OK?

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:22.170 align:middle line:84%
But after service I was asked
to do a study on the comparison

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:27.000 align:middle line:84%
and contrasting of
ET psychic abilities

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.330 align:middle line:90%
with human psychic abilities.

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:32.700 align:middle line:84%
I was given access
to many things

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:38.250 align:middle line:84%
that the public will probably
never see in order to do this.

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And I came up with basically
you can cut all of them

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:46.680 align:middle line:90%
into four groups.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And now the grays will be
in each of the four groups,

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.690 align:middle line:84%
the insectoids will be in each
of the four groups and all

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:55.080 align:middle line:84%
in, because there
are grays there

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.440 align:middle line:84%
and there are greys
there and all in.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:03.240 align:middle line:84%
It turned out they had
friendly and unfriendly.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And in each of
those two groups you

00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:08.970 align:middle line:90%
had psychic and non-psychic.

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And from the
documentation that I got,

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:18.150 align:middle line:84%
I found out that the friendly,
non-psychic ones come here

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:20.250 align:middle line:90%
for trade.

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:22.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do they want?

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:23.100 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Stuff

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:25.351 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Elements, everything.

00:27:25.351 --> 00:27:26.350 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Everything.

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:27.349 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gold, probably.

00:27:27.349 --> 00:27:31.380 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: And I know
the guy who's in charge

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:33.030 align:middle line:90%
of the technology transfer.

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:34.900 align:middle line:90%
And he was laughing one day.

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:38.490 align:middle line:84%
He said, they're not
inventive people.

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Their culture is
old and all that.

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:42.030 align:middle line:90%
They're not inventive people.

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we get
stuff from them.

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:46.950 align:middle line:90%
We play with it.

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:49.470 align:middle line:84%
We find all these different
enhancements for it.

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And he said, these days,
we're trading them their stuff

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:55.437 align:middle line:84%
back to them, and they're
glad to get it in new ways.

00:27:55.437 --> 00:27:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they may not
even know it was theirs.

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.940 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, they're
here for trade.

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:06.630 align:middle line:84%
The non-psychic, non-friendly
ones don't come here.

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:08.250 align:middle line:90%
They don't like us.

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:10.042 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they--

00:28:10.042 --> 00:28:11.750 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: They're
all different types.

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.897 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they evil?

00:28:13.897 --> 00:28:14.980 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: I don't know.

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:15.880 align:middle line:90%
They don't like us.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.320 align:middle line:90%
Are they warring creatures?

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.236 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: I would
imagine some of them are.

00:28:19.236 --> 00:28:21.310 align:middle line:84%
But all of the
different groups will

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:25.060 align:middle line:90%
fall into that one category.

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:28.900 align:middle line:84%
The friendly psychic
ones want to help

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.730 align:middle line:90%
us develop our abilities.

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when you say
friendly psychic ones,

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.540 align:middle line:84%
what do you mean
by that exactly?

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:36.370 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: They have psychic
ability and they're friendly

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:36.760 align:middle line:90%
to us.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:37.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And they probably remote view
us as we remote view them?

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:44.470 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: I'm sure
they do, probably.

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And they want to help us
develop our abilities.

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And the non-friendly
psychic ones

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:54.400 align:middle line:90%
want us wiped off the planet.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:58.450 align:middle line:84%
They want us dead,
period, to the last human.

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't figure out
what the motivation is

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:05.140 align:middle line:90%
for each of those two groups.

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.900 align:middle line:84%
There was one
event that happened

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:13.780 align:middle line:90%
that finally made it click.

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:21.910 align:middle line:84%
This one event, a UFO came up
and abducted these guys that

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:25.090 align:middle line:90%
were out camping at a lake.

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:28.960 align:middle line:84%
They watched it come up,
and it got over them,

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:29.980 align:middle line:90%
and then they were--

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They froze.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.164 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: They froze.

00:29:32.164 --> 00:29:33.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who wouldn't?

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.540 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: And it well.

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:38.290 align:middle line:84%
It dawned on me from
that, and after reading

00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:43.570 align:middle line:84%
all this other
stuff, that group has

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:49.760 align:middle line:84%
more psychic power than we do,
but they have no range at all.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.160 align:middle line:84%
We can see across the
universe as easily

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.080 align:middle line:90%
as we can see across the room.

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do some of
these groups hate us?

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.470 align:middle line:90%
What's the hate?

00:29:57.470 --> 00:30:01.370 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: Well, the
conclusion that I came

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:10.150 align:middle line:84%
to on this study was that as
we get out into the universe,

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:14.170 align:middle line:84%
we have the psychic ability,
we have the creativity,

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:15.730 align:middle line:90%
we have all that.

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And we can be a powerful
force in the universe.

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
those friendly to us

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.580 align:middle line:90%
want us to develop that ability.

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's why those unfriendly
to us don't want us out there.

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And so this is my
conclusion, and that's

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:35.290 align:middle line:90%
what I wrote in the report.

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lyn, you have
looked at some disasters,

00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:42.280 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of disasters.

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:45.145 align:middle line:84%
What are some of those
that you have glanced at?

00:30:45.145 --> 00:30:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: We had a
guy come into the unit,

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:48.670 align:middle line:90%
and he was brand new.

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:50.460 align:middle line:90%
He had never seen this before.

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:53.950 align:middle line:90%
And this is on a Thursday.

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And the director
said, OK, describe

00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:00.370 align:middle line:84%
what's going to be in the
headlines in the newspaper

00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:04.120 align:middle line:84%
over the weekend, and bring
it in Friday, tomorrow.

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.280 align:middle line:90%
And so we brought it in.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.821 align:middle line:84%
And I brought in
that there was going

00:31:06.821 --> 00:31:12.580 align:middle line:84%
to be a massive nuclear
meltdown at a nuclear plant.

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:16.800 align:middle line:84%
We came back on Monday
and I was wrong.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.170 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't in the
paper and all that.

00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And it was the following
two or three days

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:26.160 align:middle line:84%
later that Iceland
started saying

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:30.060 align:middle line:84%
we're getting radioactive
cloud coming from Russia.

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:31.125 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, boy.

00:31:31.125 --> 00:31:32.000 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: And so--

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.520 align:middle line:84%
and this is the nature of the
military remote viewing, OK?

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.635 align:middle line:90%
I had predicted Chernobyl.

00:31:37.635 --> 00:31:40.440 align:middle line:90%
I had described it in detail.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:44.005 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You even took a look
at Chernobyl by remote viewing.

00:31:44.005 --> 00:31:44.805 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Yes.

00:31:44.805 --> 00:31:45.605 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:31:45.605 --> 00:31:47.605 align:middle line:90%
- April 26, 1986.

00:31:47.605 --> 00:31:52.380 align:middle line:84%
The Ukraine is seen in
this Russian documentary.

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Reactor number four at
Chernobyl explodes and burns,

00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:00.410 align:middle line:84%
pouring radioactive material
into the atmosphere.

00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:03.350 align:middle line:90%
31 people died on the spot.

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Children were found
to be most vulnerable.

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:10.230 align:middle line:84%
In the days after the
explosion, a cloud

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:13.470 align:middle line:84%
of radioactivity that
started out 200 times

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:17.430 align:middle line:84%
stronger than the Hiroshima
and Nagasaki bombs

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:19.660 align:middle line:90%
spread across Russia and Europe.

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:22.060 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:24.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lyn, what an absolute
disaster Chernobyl was.

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And I saw and described
it a week-- well,

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:32.160 align:middle line:90%
days before it happened.

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:35.260 align:middle line:84%
But this is the nature of
the military remote viewing.

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:38.580 align:middle line:84%
I was given a zero
for that because I

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:45.210 align:middle line:84%
was tasked with what will be in
the headlines of the Washington

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:48.030 align:middle line:90%
newspapers that weekend.

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was the following
week before it came to the US

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:53.072 align:middle line:90%
that there was ever a meltdown.

00:32:53.072 --> 00:32:54.654 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You missed
it by a week, Lyn.

00:32:54.654 --> 00:32:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: I
missed it by a week,

00:32:56.190 --> 00:33:00.750 align:middle line:84%
which gave me a zero because
I didn't do what I was tasked

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:02.190 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:03.540 align:middle line:90%
I accurately described it.

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:06.520 align:middle line:90%


00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:10.020 align:middle line:84%
But this was the nature of
the military remote viewing.

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:13.372 align:middle line:84%
We did what we
were tasked to do.

00:33:13.372 --> 00:33:14.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what a disaster.

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:17.700 align:middle line:90%
It's still plaguing this planet.

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:18.500 align:middle line:90%
Still plaguing.

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:19.740 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And God forbid with
Fukushima and Chernobyl,

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.370 align:middle line:84%
and who knows what else
is going to be out there.

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:28.680 align:middle line:84%
But of everything you've looked
at in your remote viewing

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:34.470 align:middle line:84%
career, what would be that one
episode that you'll just never

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:35.270 align:middle line:90%
forget?

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:37.870 align:middle line:90%


00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: Which one
of the one episode?

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.040 align:middle line:90%
There were several.

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.706 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I'm
sure there were many.

00:33:42.706 --> 00:33:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: Yeah,
there were many.

00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:50.690 align:middle line:84%
I think the one episode
that I will not forget--

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:54.410 align:middle line:84%
Russia was developing
a particle-beam weapon.

00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:56.990 align:middle line:90%


00:33:56.990 --> 00:34:01.640 align:middle line:84%
There were questions
about the weapon

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:05.510 align:middle line:84%
and some of the
questions were about what

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:07.760 align:middle line:90%
happens inside the beam.

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you
stick any instrument

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:15.080 align:middle line:84%
into the beam of a
particle-beam weapon,

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:17.600 align:middle line:84%
you've got a thousandth
of a second and it's gone.

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: And so somebody
had the bright idea of let's get

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:27.980 align:middle line:84%
a remote viewer or to step into
the beam and see what happens?

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Everybody kind of backed
off, and I thought--

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:31.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
I'll give it a try.

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: That's neat.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:33.409 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:35.780 align:middle line:90%
And so I volunteered for it.

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:39.139 align:middle line:90%
And I stepped into the--

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:41.870 align:middle line:84%
I got the bilocation
event so that I

00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:45.305 align:middle line:84%
couldn't tell I wasn't
there, stepped into the beam.

00:34:45.305 --> 00:34:48.900 align:middle line:90%


00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:55.139 align:middle line:84%
The word indescribable,
indescribably beautiful.

00:34:55.139 --> 00:35:01.490 align:middle line:84%
I have never seen
anything that I could even

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:03.256 align:middle line:90%
imagine to be that beautiful.

00:35:03.256 --> 00:35:04.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In the beam.

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:05.390 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: In the beam.

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And inside the beam,
the beam is so powerful

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:12.840 align:middle line:84%
that even time is messed
up inside the beam.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to see forward
and backward inside the beam,

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:26.730 align:middle line:90%
but the beam itself was just--

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:27.870 align:middle line:90%
I can't describe it.

00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:29.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it godlike to you?

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: No.

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:36.720 align:middle line:84%
It was-- probably I guess
the best description

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:40.680 align:middle line:84%
for it would be
totally psychedelic.

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:41.992 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Without the LSD.

00:35:41.992 --> 00:35:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Without the LSD.

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever had
a spiritual remote viewing

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:45.690 align:middle line:90%
session?

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:46.606 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Oh, yeah.

00:35:46.606 --> 00:35:48.120 align:middle line:90%
One of my fortes.

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:51.090 align:middle line:84%
All remote viewers have
strengths and weaknesses.

00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:55.890 align:middle line:84%
One of my strengths is
accessing people mentally.

00:35:55.890 --> 00:36:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And so many times I was tasked
to do either personality

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:10.200 align:middle line:84%
profiles or plans and
intentions of foreign leaders.

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Now plans and
intentions, you get in

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:15.120 align:middle line:84%
and you find their
plans and intentions.

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Personality profile, you sort
of access them, stand back,

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:26.310 align:middle line:84%
and describe their personality,
their actions, and all that.

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And I had been doing
these foreign leaders,

00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:32.980 align:middle line:84%
and it was wearing me
down and everything.

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I went into the
director, and I said,

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:38.550 align:middle line:90%
look, give me Mother Teresa.

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:39.930 align:middle line:90%
Give me Bozo the Clown.

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:41.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jesus, anybody, right?

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Anything, yeah.

00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And of course he said,
hey, you're a soldier.

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.070 align:middle line:90%
Do your job.

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Suck it up and go back
to work, you know?

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:55.110 align:middle line:84%
The following week I got
another personality profile,

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:58.920 align:middle line:90%
and accessed the person.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And my first words
were, whatever

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.260 align:middle line:84%
evil you think this guy
did, he didn't do it.

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:07.610 align:middle line:90%
This is one of the good guys.

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And who
was the good guy?

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:10.970 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: I did the session.

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:16.010 align:middle line:84%
By the end of the
session, my entire summary

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:20.420 align:middle line:84%
was, whatever evil you think
this guy did, he didn't do it.

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And the monitor
opened the envelope

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.730 align:middle line:90%
to see who the personality was.

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:29.690 align:middle line:84%
The director had handwritten
on a sheet of paper Jesus.

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:30.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, boy.

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:35.420 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: And this was one
of those bilocation events.

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And I stood there in front
of this small Jewish man,

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:43.400 align:middle line:90%
did the personality profile.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you witness
the physical Jesus?

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:46.580 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Yes.

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:47.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You did.

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:49.070 align:middle line:90%
What did he look like?

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: To my surprise,
he was wearing a business suit.

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And I never have
figured that one out.

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:57.290 align:middle line:90%
But he was small.

00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
think it was Jesus?

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:01.101 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: No, I didn't,
because he was wearing

00:38:01.101 --> 00:38:01.942 align:middle line:90%
a business suit.

00:38:01.942 --> 00:38:02.900 align:middle line:90%
I thought, who is this?

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:04.020 align:middle line:90%
Was he talking?

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:04.820 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: No.

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:11.450 align:middle line:84%
He never spoke to me, but he
looked around at me and smiled.

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And in that smile,
I just I realized

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:24.640 align:middle line:84%
that this guy was better than
I will ever be in my life.

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And I suddenly had
the understanding

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:33.300 align:middle line:84%
that no matter how much bad I
had ever seen, he's seen worse.

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:37.140 align:middle line:84%
No matter how much good I've
ever done, he's seen better,

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:39.755 align:middle line:84%
and that he accepted
me for being there.

00:38:39.755 --> 00:38:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lyn, you've looked
at a lot of events that

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.770 align:middle line:90%
have occurred on this planet.

00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:48.060 align:middle line:84%
One that has always puzzled me,
of course, was Saddam Hussein.

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:50.970 align:middle line:84%
Were you ever channeled
and tasked to look for him?

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:54.330 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: Oh, yeah,
constantly during the Gulf War.

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:57.710 align:middle line:90%
And we tracked him.

00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:59.720 align:middle line:90%
He didn't have a chance.

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:01.580 align:middle line:84%
We knew every day what
he was going to do

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:03.980 align:middle line:90%
the next day and all that.

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:06.319 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this was
while he was hiding?

00:39:06.319 --> 00:39:07.610 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Before that, even.

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:07.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Even before that.

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:09.320 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: All along.

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that always got to me

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:20.330 align:middle line:84%
was that when we drove
him out of Kuwait,

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:25.190 align:middle line:84%
they had tasked us with the
direction they should push.

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:29.540 align:middle line:84%
I had found in my session
if you push him north,

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:32.150 align:middle line:84%
he's going to burn all
those wells as he goes.

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As he did.

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:40.790 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: And I said,
push him west and then north,

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:43.652 align:middle line:84%
where he won't have a
way to burn those wells.

00:39:43.652 --> 00:39:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, he
burned the wells.

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:48.380 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: He
burned the wells.

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:50.510 align:middle line:90%
There were many, many times.

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And in my book, I
started off by saying

00:39:56.990 --> 00:40:01.530 align:middle line:90%
Hussein was not a bad person.

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:03.950 align:middle line:90%
He was very religious.

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:08.120 align:middle line:90%
He was just crazy as bed bugs.

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:12.500 align:middle line:84%
He really believed that God
wanted him to rule the world

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.660 align:middle line:84%
and that he should
kill anybody who got

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:17.330 align:middle line:90%
in the way of God's intentions.

00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:18.860 align:middle line:90%
And he was crazy.

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when we went
into Iraq the second time,

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:26.000 align:middle line:84%
did you find him
hiding in that hole?

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:26.800 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:29.750 align:middle line:90%


00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:35.300 align:middle line:84%
I didn't do the viewing to know
where the hole was, but yeah.

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
how we found it?

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:40.570 align:middle line:90%


00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Oh, who was it did a project
and got several remote viewers,

00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:48.770 align:middle line:90%
and they found--

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:50.120 align:middle line:90%
they described the hole.

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:51.830 align:middle line:90%
They described everything.

00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think that they
actually found where it was.

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:00.010 align:middle line:90%
I didn't share in that.

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:05.150 align:middle line:84%
But I think they actually
found where it was.

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:08.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lyn, as we wrap
this up, a lot of people

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:12.170 align:middle line:84%
are feeling that something
big is happening,

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:13.730 align:middle line:90%
is about to happen.

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:15.190 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what it is.

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:16.680 align:middle line:90%
We don't know if it's good.

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.500 align:middle line:90%
We don't know if it's bad.

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:22.610 align:middle line:84%
As a remote viewer, can
you shed any light on that?

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:26.240 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: I have been
tasked with the future, yeah.

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And what I keep finding,
even though I never

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:34.820 align:middle line:84%
know what the target is, what
I keep finding is that there is

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:40.840 align:middle line:84%
going to be basically a massive
die-off of the human race,

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:44.690 align:middle line:84%
that the end result will
be good for the human race.

00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:46.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How can that be good?

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: Because what
comes out of all of that--

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:53.300 align:middle line:90%
the survivors, the remnant--

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:56.480 align:middle line:90%
is going to have better lives.

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Basically the
cities will be sort

00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:01.310 align:middle line:84%
of emptied out
and just decaying.

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:03.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that the way
we want to live, Lyn?

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: We'll have all
the scientific advances--

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:09.500 align:middle line:84%
or they will have all
the scientific advances.

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:12.980 align:middle line:84%
But it'll be more
an agrarian society

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:16.880 align:middle line:84%
where people are totally
self-sufficient, where

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:20.300 align:middle line:90%
there's basically no needs.

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And so the survivors, the
remnants will have a good life.

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now did you see
what got us to that point

00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:29.480 align:middle line:90%
that something happened?

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.520 align:middle line:90%
Was there a calamity?

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:32.600 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Pretty much.

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.610 align:middle line:90%
It was caused.

00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:36.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like what?

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:37.790 align:middle line:90%
An asteroid?

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:38.720 align:middle line:90%
What would have done that?

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:39.761 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: No, it was--

00:42:39.761 --> 00:42:40.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Manmade?

00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:42.290 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Manmade, yeah.

00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:43.830 align:middle line:90%
An intentional die-off.

00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Remote
viewers have always

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:50.044 align:middle line:84%
told me that time is
very difficult to predict

00:42:50.044 --> 00:42:50.960 align:middle line:90%
when they remote view.

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:56.120 align:middle line:84%
They don't know time so
they can't predict dates.

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:59.330 align:middle line:84%
In this particular
case, can you?

00:42:59.330 --> 00:43:03.290 align:middle line:10%
>> BUCHANAN: In this
particular case, I was tasked,

00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:08.040 align:middle line:10%
I found out later, with moving
to the year 2050 and describing

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:08.840 align:middle line:10%
it.

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 2050.

00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:11.910 align:middle line:90%
So that's the time period.

00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:14.105 align:middle line:84%
>> BUCHANAN: That's the
time I viewed, I think.

00:43:14.105 --> 00:43:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we've
got a little time.

00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:18.270 align:middle line:84%
We've got a little breathing
room here to get ready.

00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Lyn, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:21.305 align:middle line:90%
>> BUCHANAN: Hey, any time.

00:43:21.305 --> 00:43:22.630 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for inviting me.

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:25.330 align:middle line:84%
I've always enjoyed
talking to you.

00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:26.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Remote viewing.

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:29.240 align:middle line:10%
It's an incredible
area for you to pave

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:31.580 align:middle line:10%
a path for your own
direction and life.

00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And I recommend that
you give it a try,

00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:37.640 align:middle line:84%
because it's much more than
just looking for lost car keys.

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:40.810 align:middle line:84%
It could really
shape your future.

00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:45.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and
this is "Beyond Belief."

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:51.467 align:middle line:90%
