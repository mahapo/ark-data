>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.630 align:middle line:10%
Bridget Nielsen is with us, a
spiritual guide and intuitive

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.360 align:middle line:10%
healer, who
specializes in uniting

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.170 align:middle line:10%
our metaphysical reality
with modern everyday life.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And for more than a decade,
she has hosted retreats

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.762 align:middle line:84%
at sacred sites
around the world.

Bridget, welcome back
to "Beyond Belief."

>>BRIDGET NIELSEN: Thanks
so much for having me back,

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.405 align:middle line:90%
George.

00:00:37.405 --> 00:00:39.895 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in intuitive healing?

00:00:39.895 --> 00:00:42.700 align:middle line:10%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah, it
was this perfect mix

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.170 align:middle line:10%
of timing and place.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.810 align:middle line:10%
So it was just
right after college.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.580 align:middle line:90%
I was in Southern California.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And my parents were deep
into spiritual circles.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.650 align:middle line:84%
Which I thought was
a little bit odd.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.810 align:middle line:84%
But I was like, OK,
let's take a look in.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.090 align:middle line:90%
And once I did, I just--

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You were hooked.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: I was hooked.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.130 align:middle line:84%
I did all kinds of
trainings in my early 20s.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't
stopped ever since.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you have this
one special teacher who

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.780 align:middle line:90%
really had an influence on you?

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: I did.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.450 align:middle line:10%
I had a shamanic teacher
that was just very powerful.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.630 align:middle line:10%
And I learned a lot from
her and many other people.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you teach
somebody intuitive healing?

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:19.670 align:middle line:90%
How do they start?

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: That's
a good question.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.920 align:middle line:84%
I think in tapping into
our innate abilities

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.950 align:middle line:90%
that we already have.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.240 align:middle line:84%
So our different clairvoyance
and sensitivities

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.780 align:middle line:84%
and really just starting to
listen to our deeper intuition.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what is
an intuitive healer?

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: An
intuitive healer is

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:43.490 align:middle line:84%
someone who uses the senses
beyond just our hearing,

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.230 align:middle line:84%
our five senses, to really tap
into the more that's going on

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.510 align:middle line:84%
with the person that
we're working with

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.960 align:middle line:84%
to know what is needed on
a deeper energetic level

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.886 align:middle line:90%
for healing and restoration.

00:01:55.886 --> 00:01:58.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what are
starseed connections?

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Starseed
connections are

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.500 align:middle line:84%
connections that we
make with the deep soul

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.910 align:middle line:90%
aspects of ourselves.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.449 align:middle line:84%
So by asking deep
within our hearts,

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:12.290 align:middle line:84%
deep within our souls to be
connected with different soul

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.540 align:middle line:84%
aspects that we've
had in the cosmos,

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.300 align:middle line:84%
we can start to
retrieve and bring

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.090 align:middle line:84%
in these memories,
these inspirations,

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.240 align:middle line:84%
these streams of
energy to connect us

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.635 align:middle line:90%
with more of our soul self.

00:02:24.635 --> 00:02:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're all
starseeds, aren't we?

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.710 align:middle line:90%
Deep down inside.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Deep
down inside, yes.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.285 align:middle line:90%
Do we have a mission?

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Yes,
there's a deep mission.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's to be of
service, to assist humanity

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.050 align:middle line:84%
and also to assist
Earth, which really

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.050 align:middle line:90%
requires deep inner work.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.310 align:middle line:90%
We have to do our work.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.750 align:middle line:84%
We have to do our
ancestral work.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.260 align:middle line:84%
We have to do physical
work here on the Earth

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.210 align:middle line:90%
to actually be of service.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.680 align:middle line:90%
So that's part of the mission.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bridget, as a starseed,
as an intuitive healer,

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.010 align:middle line:84%
do you tap into
energy in the cosmos?

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: I do.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.980 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:03.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I knew it.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: You caught me.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do you do that?

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: A lot of the time
for me it's through dreams.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.470 align:middle line:10%
I think what we're going
to be getting into too,

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.580 align:middle line:10%
going to certain places
activates those memories

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.060 align:middle line:10%
and just really being
present and being still

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.210 align:middle line:10%
and meditation to connect
with these deeper energies.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you talked
earlier about your parents

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:26.720 align:middle line:90%
being into this.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.030 align:middle line:84%
What about our
ancient ancestors?

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.425 align:middle line:90%
Do you tap into them too?

00:03:30.425 --> 00:03:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.100 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors are a
really important part

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.870 align:middle line:84%
of this because
they've cultivated

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.910 align:middle line:90%
the space for so long.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many treasures
that they pass along to us,

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.450 align:middle line:84%
different spiritual gifts
that they can give to us,

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.400 align:middle line:84%
as well as the
certain things that

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.010 align:middle line:84%
maybe caused pain or trouble
like in our ancestral past.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.060 align:middle line:84%
It's important for us to heal
so that those streams of energy

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.320 align:middle line:84%
through the cosmos can come
through to us genetically,

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.120 align:middle line:90%
energetically.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I understand you've
got a little Irish background

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.190 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah, I do.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:06.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's pretty
good, wasn't it?

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: That was good.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.942 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I thought you
were going to do a jig.

00:04:08.942 --> 00:04:09.665 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
about your heritage.

00:04:09.665 --> 00:04:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.970 align:middle line:84%
So I had a really amazing
experience recently.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.029 align:middle line:84%
I know that I have some
Northern Irish DNA.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.279 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't I had
any Southern Irish.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.769 align:middle line:84%
And so I was leading
a retreat in Ireland.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And I just felt this strong
connection to the place.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And my friend said,
well, why don't you

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.100 align:middle line:90%
look at your genealogy?

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.780 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there's more here for you.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:31.730 align:middle line:90%
So I looked back.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And I had ancestors from the
place where we were staying--

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.955 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: --that actually
lived and died in the castle

00:04:38.955 --> 00:04:39.755 align:middle line:90%
right outside.

00:04:39.755 --> 00:04:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They died
in the castle?

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Where we
were from 500 years ago.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they die
violently or just old age?

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Just old age, yeah.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.425 align:middle line:84%
Did they make an
impact on your life?

00:04:51.425 --> 00:04:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: It made a big
impact because I've been doing

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.090 align:middle line:90%
ancestral work for a long time.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And what was always
important were just the seven

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:59.780 align:middle line:90%
generations.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And what I realized in
this experience is actually

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.220 align:middle line:84%
when we have a resonance with
a certain ancestral stream,

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.320 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter
how long it's been.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.710 align:middle line:84%
It could be in this case
for me, 500, 600 years ago.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And these ancestors through
time space can feel their kin.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And so in that, they found
their way to me to communicate

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.520 align:middle line:84%
through the genealogy,
through the place to say, hey,

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.740 align:middle line:90%
you're a part of our family.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.180 align:middle line:90%
You're a part of this clan.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a support
that we can really

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.950 align:middle line:90%
tap into through time.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are there
so many ancient sites

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.460 align:middle line:90%
that seem to be so sacred?

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.865 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Because the
ancestors remembered.

00:05:40.865 --> 00:05:43.400 align:middle line:84%
They knew how to work with
the different Earth energy

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.560 align:middle line:84%
grids to harness and to
build upon what was already

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.290 align:middle line:84%
there in the magnetic
lines and the vortexes

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:56.300 align:middle line:84%
to commune with
spirit, to commune

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.375 align:middle line:84%
and activate fertility, all
different kinds of reasons.

00:05:59.375 --> 00:06:01.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are
they so powerful?

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Because they access
the natural Earth magnetics,

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.120 align:middle line:90%
what's already there.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the cultivated
space that happens over time.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.630 align:middle line:84%
So these devotional
places that have

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:19.320 align:middle line:84%
been holy spaces for hundreds,
sometimes thousands of years

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.760 align:middle line:90%
has a charge, has a field to it.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.810 align:middle line:84%
So then when we go there, we
can access those memories,

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.820 align:middle line:84%
those energies and have
spiritual experiences, healing,

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:30.840 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of things.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bridget, we're going
to look at a sacred site

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.260 align:middle line:84%
that you took a
group to Ireland.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And you had a stone
circle ceremony.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:38.860 align:middle line:90%
Talk us through this.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And tell us what
we're looking at.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:41.703 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Great.

00:06:41.703 --> 00:06:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is this?

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: This is the coast
of Southwest Ireland where

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.830 align:middle line:84%
I was, where I learned
that I have ancestors.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.690 align:middle line:90%
And this is actually the space.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.790 align:middle line:90%
This is outside of Killarney.

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
elemental Earth energies.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.980 align:middle line:84%
This is actually a
chapel that my ancestors

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.540 align:middle line:84%
built with an ancient yew
tree that's very famous.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And these yew trees hold
these spiritual energies

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:06.930 align:middle line:90%
that we can connect with.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.050 align:middle line:84%
So we're connecting
with the Earth energies.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And then this is
Lough Gur, which

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.870 align:middle line:84%
is a really powerful ancient
stone circle, one of the most

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.290 align:middle line:84%
preserved ones actually
in Western Europe.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And so when we're
in these spaces,

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.609 align:middle line:84%
we're connecting with the
ancient Earth energies but also

00:07:23.609 --> 00:07:24.567 align:middle line:90%
the celestial energies.

00:07:24.567 --> 00:07:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How old
is that, Bridget?

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:26.690 align:middle line:90%
How old is that?

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:27.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Oh, that one--

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's one of those things
where they clock these things,

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.290 align:middle line:84%
as you know, as a few
thousand years old.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.180 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of these sites are
tens of thousands of years old.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:38.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kind of reminds
me of Stonehenge.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Exactly, yeah.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did they
move those stones?

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Many different ways.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some were
physically lifted.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.202 align:middle line:84%
But some were using
frequency technologies.

00:07:48.202 --> 00:07:49.452 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Some were pretty big.

00:07:49.452 --> 00:07:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah, some use
frequency technologies

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:53.380 align:middle line:90%
to move these massive stones.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what was
happening in that stone

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.397 align:middle line:90%
circle with those people?

00:07:57.397 --> 00:07:58.230 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing?

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: So this is
a convergence point.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.330 align:middle line:84%
So when you have these
paramagnetic stones

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:07.530 align:middle line:84%
that are moved in this circle,
we can access time space.

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:09.150 align:middle line:90%
We're connecting stargates.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.940 align:middle line:84%
We're connecting an
opening portal energies,

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.150 align:middle line:84%
which allows greater
access, greater energy,

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:19.510 align:middle line:84%
to DNA activation, to
healing, all kinds of things.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:23.010 align:middle line:84%
So we were tapping in and
grounding in these deeper

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.525 align:middle line:90%
energies in that moment.

00:08:24.525 --> 00:08:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
significance of a stone circle?

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:31.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Stone circles
primarily were used

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:35.520 align:middle line:84%
for fertility of the
land and to also access--

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.340 align:middle line:84%
again, to astral
travel, to lucid dream,

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.350 align:middle line:84%
to heal, all kinds
of different things.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can being in a
circle backfire on you,

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:45.285 align:middle line:84%
that it's like the
wrong place to be?

00:08:45.285 --> 00:08:46.537 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah, it can be.

00:08:46.537 --> 00:08:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:48.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:49.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
different people that

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.890 align:middle line:84%
go to these certain sites
with malevolent intents.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:56.097 align:middle line:84%
And so these places hold
energy just like stones do,

00:08:56.097 --> 00:08:57.014 align:middle line:90%
just like crystals do.

00:08:57.014 --> 00:08:58.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're like
magnets, aren't they?

00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Exactly.

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.890 align:middle line:84%
So it is important to be
there at the right time,

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:02.730 align:middle line:90%
the right space.

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Ask permission to know if it
is that best time and space.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.410 align:middle line:90%
And you'll know.

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:11.760 align:middle line:84%
It will feel not so good, or
it'll be a big yes invitation

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.835 align:middle line:84%
to move into that space and
to be able to really connect.

00:09:14.835 --> 00:09:17.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you feel
the vibration of energy

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:18.270 align:middle line:90%
when you're in that circle?

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Oh, absolutely.

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could blindfold
me and other people

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.980 align:middle line:84%
and go into those spaces,
whether it's a ley line,

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:30.000 align:middle line:84%
stone circle, and feel
the actual energy currents

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.170 align:middle line:90%
going through our bodies.

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go get a blindfold.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:32.745 align:middle line:90%
Let me try this.

00:09:32.745 --> 00:09:33.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: OK, let's do it.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Push you
in those circles.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:35.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Push
me in the circles.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the circles
all over the planet

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:38.535 align:middle line:90%
or just in certain areas?

00:09:38.535 --> 00:09:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: There are
circles all over the planet

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:45.840 align:middle line:84%
because some cultures use
standing stones, some use stone

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.120 align:middle line:84%
circles, some use different
formations, pyramids, right?

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: So they're all
doing a similar thing, creating

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:54.435 align:middle line:90%
this scalar timeless space.

00:09:54.435 --> 00:09:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
ever been in a circle

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.530 align:middle line:84%
and you wished
you weren't there.

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: I have.

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And I've been in
stone circles where

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:06.420 align:middle line:84%
I knew that if I
really let myself go,

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.775 align:middle line:90%
I felt like I could teleport.

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:11.520 align:middle line:84%
There was a visceral
buzzing that

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.280 align:middle line:84%
happened where I
knew that I could

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.050 align:middle line:90%
disappear from this reality.

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't quite
ready to do that.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.086 align:middle line:90%
So they can be very powerful.

00:10:19.086 --> 00:10:19.695 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mean
like poof disappear?

00:10:19.695 --> 00:10:21.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Poof
disappear or teleport.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.103 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't quite
know how to use

00:10:23.103 --> 00:10:25.686 align:middle line:84%
the technology because it was
my first time in a stone circle.

00:10:25.686 --> 00:10:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you wouldn't
know how to get back either.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:28.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Exactly.

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:30.520 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what I was
getting into at the time.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And so I just let
the experience go.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.885 align:middle line:84%
But there's a very powerful
charge that I experienced.

00:10:36.885 --> 00:10:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, how
do those exercises

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:40.605 align:middle line:90%
help your intuitive healing?

00:10:40.605 --> 00:10:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Those exercises
create that extra energy that's

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.280 align:middle line:90%
necessary for healing.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.910 align:middle line:84%
So for healing to happen,
we need the energy

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:54.150 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do it because
we're creating a healed field.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And so we're bringing healing
to whatever parts are distorted

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:00.180 align:middle line:90%
or needing restoration.

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And so that energy charge
from the stone circles

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:06.250 align:middle line:84%
or from these certain places
helps to assist that healing.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when
you're in these circles,

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:13.137 align:middle line:84%
do you instantly know, this is
for me, I gel in this thing?

00:11:13.137 --> 00:11:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah, I think
that you would know.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.380 align:middle line:84%
There are certain places
where it's just, oh, there's

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:19.920 align:middle line:90%
not much of a resonance.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.960 align:middle line:84%
But if you felt the
call to a certain place,

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.220 align:middle line:84%
there's probably a
reason that you're there.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:29.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's really, I think,
the prework, the precall,

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:33.710 align:middle line:84%
the presynchronicities that
lead you to these certain places

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:37.100 align:middle line:84%
that then make that
experience possible.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And for the most
part because you're

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:41.667 align:middle line:84%
listening to your intuition
and going to these places

00:11:41.667 --> 00:11:43.250 align:middle line:84%
that you feel called
to, there's going

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:46.610 align:middle line:84%
to be something there for you
or else you wouldn't have gone.

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:48.755 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bridget, how many
sites have you been to?

00:11:48.755 --> 00:11:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: I've been to
a lot of different sites.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:53.780 align:middle line:84%
I've been to a lot of
different built sites.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:58.730 align:middle line:84%
So places that ancient ones or
humans built like Angkor Wat in

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Cambodia, the Great Pyramids
of Egypt, these different stone

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:02.007 align:middle line:90%
circles.

00:12:02.007 --> 00:12:03.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh, you've
been all over the map.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.843 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: I've been
all over the map.

00:12:04.843 --> 00:12:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And also I've been
to places that

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:11.390 align:middle line:84%
are natural temples, which I
think don't get as much press.

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And John Muir in
the 19th century

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.900 align:middle line:84%
talked a lot about these places,
these places that are now

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.940 align:middle line:84%
the national parks
in the United States

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:23.390 align:middle line:84%
and places around the world
like Yosemite or Sedona,

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Mount Shasta, Bryce
Canyon, that we

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:29.600 align:middle line:84%
can go there and just
like a built sacred site

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.265 align:middle line:90%
have a spiritual experience.

00:12:31.265 --> 00:12:32.765 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
like holy places?

00:12:32.765 --> 00:12:34.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: They're holy places.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:35.330 align:middle line:90%
They're Earth's temples.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.610 align:middle line:90%
They're Earth's natural spaces.

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was just actually at
Bryce Canyon in Southern Utah

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:41.880 align:middle line:90%
with my brother.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And he had a visceral
spiritual experience--

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened to him?

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: --in
a natural temple.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.930 align:middle line:84%
He would call it-- he
used the word biblical,

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:55.140 align:middle line:84%
where it was biblical
transcendent, a place that

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:59.550 align:middle line:84%
was very silent, where you
could hear everything and be

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:00.930 align:middle line:90%
connected to everything.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And he hadn't
experienced that before.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And so these
natural Earth places

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:08.970 align:middle line:84%
are just as significant
as the ones that have

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:10.230 align:middle line:90%
been built by the ancients.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:12.007 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It must be
refreshing to feel.

00:13:12.007 --> 00:13:13.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah,
it's very refreshing.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:15.840 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, my little
nephew was there too.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And I said, do you feel
anything different?

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.110 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And he had a rowdy night
and didn't sleep much.

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:24.240 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I should be tired.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.010 align:middle line:90%
But I don't feel tired.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:29.305 align:middle line:84%
And so there's an uplifting,
a rejuvenating energy

00:13:29.305 --> 00:13:30.105 align:middle line:90%
to these places.

00:13:30.105 --> 00:13:32.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, we all
know what DNA is.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.920 align:middle line:90%
But what is DNA activation?

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.640 align:middle line:90%
And what does that mean?

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: A DNA
activation happens

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:41.100 align:middle line:84%
when there's this
convergence between spirit,

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.910 align:middle line:84%
maybe even a cosmic
intelligence and your soul

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:49.600 align:middle line:84%
that a higher aspect of your
DNA is meant to turn on.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's the availability,
the experience

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:55.950 align:middle line:84%
that's really paradigm shifting,
an experience you'll never

00:13:55.950 --> 00:14:00.870 align:middle line:84%
forget that allows access to
that expansive part of more

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:01.830 align:middle line:90%
of your genetics.

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:03.125 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Give us an example.

00:14:03.125 --> 00:14:06.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: So for me, I've
had quite a few of these DNA

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.480 align:middle line:84%
activations that are
very, very powerful.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.330 align:middle line:90%
And they can look different.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.460 align:middle line:84%
For me, in some of
these experiences,

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.530 align:middle line:84%
they were almost
like sober, DMT,

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:18.110 align:middle line:90%
or psychedelic experiences.

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:19.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like ayahuasca?

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:21.957 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah, except it
was without any substance.

00:14:21.957 --> 00:14:23.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Without anything.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.065 align:middle line:84%
It's just you and
energy coming out.

00:14:25.065 --> 00:14:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: And again,
these were often

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.750 align:middle line:84%
facilitated by place, of
being in the right place

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:33.840 align:middle line:84%
at the right time and
this pure intention where

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.770 align:middle line:90%
it was able to activate.

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And so different abilities
turned on for me,

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:41.550 align:middle line:84%
my clairvoyance turned on,
different memories activated,

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:46.110 align:middle line:84%
different galactic energies
in my DNA activated.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we go through
a physical change?

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah, there's
a big physical change.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.310 align:middle line:84%
So there's a release
of a lot of hormones--

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:55.910 align:middle line:90%
so serotonin, dopamine, DMT.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:15:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And there's also a genetic
expression alteration.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.350 align:middle line:84%
So the higher form of
our genetic expression

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:06.300 align:middle line:84%
is then made available
for us to experience.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.555 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is remarkable.

00:15:07.555 --> 00:15:08.585 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: It really is.

00:15:08.585 --> 00:15:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you alter
the DNA activation?

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:12.680 align:middle line:90%
Or is it set?

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: It is a possibility.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:19.140 align:middle line:84%
So we then have that
threshold of what is possible.

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And then it is up to
us and our lifestyle

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:23.780 align:middle line:84%
and our intentions,
our thoughts, how

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:27.410 align:middle line:84%
we live to continue
to cultivate that

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:30.230 align:middle line:84%
as an everyday
experience, something that

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:32.600 align:middle line:90%
is more permanent and embodied.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's really important to
have an embodiment experience

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:39.020 align:middle line:84%
and not just the peak
experience that we

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.760 align:middle line:84%
get to think back
on but something

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.010 align:middle line:84%
that we really want to
integrate deep into our bodies

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:46.755 align:middle line:84%
as a solidified
anchored lifestyle.

00:15:46.755 --> 00:15:49.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Dalai Lama
would talk about oneness.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.270 align:middle line:90%
What does he mean by that?

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Oneness is
our interconnection

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.400 align:middle line:84%
and this visceral
remembrance that we

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.440 align:middle line:90%
are one with everything.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that's
hard in the day to day

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:03.850 align:middle line:84%
where you're just driving to
work and doing your thing.

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And so having these activations,
being in these certain nature

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:10.650 align:middle line:84%
places reminds us
of our oneness,

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:12.075 align:middle line:90%
reminds us of our connection.

00:16:12.075 --> 00:16:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You
interviewed a physicist

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:17.320 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Dan Winter
on your YouTube channel,

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.990 align:middle line:84%
which I want you by
the end of the show

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:21.030 align:middle line:84%
to tell us how
people can watch you.

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And he explains how
the Indigenous cultures

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:26.430 align:middle line:84%
connected with the
magnetic lines of Earth

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.140 align:middle line:90%
that you had mentioned.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:31.950 align:middle line:10%
>>DAN WINTER: What we believe is
when the Indigenous people said

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:36.450 align:middle line:10%
a specific magnetic line
dream line song track was

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:37.840 align:middle line:10%
your ancestors' memory--

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.170 align:middle line:10%
so when Auntie Lorraine
died in Mullumbimby,

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:43.610 align:middle line:10%
the magnetic line that had
a storm across the continent

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:48.840 align:middle line:10%
at the time of her death was
her family's pet magnetic line,

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:53.190 align:middle line:10%
which they have been singing to
for like 100,000 generations.

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:55.850 align:middle line:10%
So that particular magnetic
line had become self-aware

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:57.350 align:middle line:10%
and was a family pet.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:03.380 align:middle line:10%
So it was more like for the
Hopi, that particular strain

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.589 align:middle line:10%
of corn, which would only
germinate if you sang

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:09.319 align:middle line:10%
the right song to that corn.

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:11.540 align:middle line:10%
The DNA of that corn
was their family pet.

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:14.030 align:middle line:84%
So how did that DNA
become a family pet?

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Or how did that magnetic
line across the continent

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.200 align:middle line:90%
become a family pet?

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.180 align:middle line:84%
We now know what that
magnetic line is.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.250 align:middle line:84%
It's called longitudinal
interferometry.

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.380 align:middle line:10%
It's a coherence into a
grid, the longitudinal nodes,

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:26.180 align:middle line:10%
obviously.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.750 align:middle line:10%
So this is a picture of how
we think magnetic lines become

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:31.250 align:middle line:10%
self-aware--

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:34.820 align:middle line:10%
physics of God, nondestructive
turning inside out,

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.200 align:middle line:10%
recursive implosion,
lots of names for that.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:41.450 align:middle line:10%
But what happens is if it
turns inside out enough times,

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:45.240 align:middle line:10%
so like this, the
implosion at the core

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.740 align:middle line:10%
becomes multiply connected.

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.690 align:middle line:10%
And we would say
impedance matches

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:50.470 align:middle line:10%
to the longitudinal array.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:53.400 align:middle line:10%
So at the turning
inside out point,

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.860 align:middle line:10%
John Dee called
it scintillation.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.100 align:middle line:10%
John Dee would actively
use the scintillation point

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:02.190 align:middle line:10%
where the light turned inside
out just like a pinhole camera.

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:04.950 align:middle line:10%
And he used that spark
at the scintillation

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:08.180 align:middle line:10%
point to make phone
calls to ancestors.

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:12.060 align:middle line:10%
We've been teaching these kids
to see without their eyes.

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.670 align:middle line:10%
And it's very clear
that the moment they

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:18.300 align:middle line:10%
begin to see without their
eyes, they develop a very

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.890 align:middle line:10%
specific frequency signature.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:23.970 align:middle line:84%
So the guy that's teaching
kids to do exactly this in New

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:25.140 align:middle line:90%
Zealand, he's wonderful.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.490 align:middle line:90%
But he says, oh, yeah.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, in the East,
regularly, it's common.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:34.945 align:middle line:84%
It's normal that just after
kids learn how to do just that,

00:18:34.945 --> 00:18:35.820 align:middle line:90%
they get this trance.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.380 align:middle line:90%
They get this bliss.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:41.362 align:middle line:84%
They also begin to
see their ancestors.

00:18:41.362 --> 00:18:44.645 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, how do you
make an ancestral phone call?

00:18:44.645 --> 00:18:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Well,
that's part of it.

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:49.880 align:middle line:10%
So what Dan was just talking
about is getting to this point

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.450 align:middle line:10%
where we're implosive,
where we're highly charged,

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:56.630 align:middle line:10%
where we're in that
space of connectivity

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:59.840 align:middle line:10%
with ourselves, with place,
where we can really expand

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.400 align:middle line:10%
and embed in our auras.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.110 align:middle line:10%
And then in that place--

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:05.840 align:middle line:10%
and ideally we're
in locations that

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.260 align:middle line:10%
have been cultivated magnetic
lines where we can just

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:10.980 align:middle line:10%
call from our hearts.

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And energetically
and clairaudiently,

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:15.780 align:middle line:90%
they'll come to us.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.900 align:middle line:84%
We'll be able to hear what
the ancestors are saying.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.070 align:middle line:90%
And this was a common thing.

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:22.670 align:middle line:84%
This is what most traditions
around the world always did.

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:24.740 align:middle line:90%
They could hear the ancestors.

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And in the West, we've broken
those lines within the land.

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:30.180 align:middle line:90%
We've broken those connections.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.370 align:middle line:90%
And so we've forgotten.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:34.130 align:middle line:84%
But it is very
innate for us to be

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:38.960 align:middle line:84%
able to call upon the ancestors
and receive from their wisdom.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that like tapping
into ancestral memory?

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah, it is.

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:48.900 align:middle line:84%
So when people pass away,
there's the legacy of maybe

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.800 align:middle line:84%
they got certain land for
their kids and passed on money,

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.040 align:middle line:84%
or they have a legacy
of a body of work.

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.590 align:middle line:84%
But there's also
a spiritual legacy

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.570 align:middle line:90%
that happens when someone dies.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:02.400 align:middle line:90%
So all that is cultivated.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.520 align:middle line:84%
The virtues, the energies,
the pure intention

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:09.180 align:middle line:84%
can then be locked
in into the Akashic.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And that memory can
then be accessible.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:15.750 align:middle line:84%
So you can think of it almost
like Pocahontas and Grandmother

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:18.660 align:middle line:84%
Willow where you can
hear her in the trees.

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:20.800 align:middle line:84%
You can feel it
in the mountains.

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And so our genetics,
our ancestors

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.200 align:middle line:84%
are intertwined with
the land spaces.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And when we pass away, we have
that opportunity to embed,

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:34.530 align:middle line:84%
to share where our soul then
is accessible through time

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:39.315 align:middle line:84%
for other people to harness
to act as guidance for.

00:20:39.315 --> 00:20:41.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they have
any kind of technology

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:42.245 align:middle line:90%
available to them?

00:20:42.245 --> 00:20:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah, they did.

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:44.250 align:middle line:90%
They had--

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:44.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did they?

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: They had
that remembrance.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:50.070 align:middle line:84%
They had the connection to all
the elementals, to the Earth,

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:51.610 align:middle line:90%
to the cosmos.

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And so in that,
they remembered how

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:59.220 align:middle line:84%
to utilize these land spaces,
these energies to heal,

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:04.470 align:middle line:84%
to remain intact through
time, to bring more healing

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:07.016 align:middle line:84%
and restoration for
future generations.

00:21:07.016 --> 00:21:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, we know what
chakras are for ourselves.

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:11.875 align:middle line:84%
But the planet has
chakras too, doesn't it?

00:21:11.875 --> 00:21:12.675 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:21:12.675 --> 00:21:14.385 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How many?

00:21:14.385 --> 00:21:17.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: It has many different
chakras because as we have--

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:19.080 align:middle line:90%
there's the seven major chakras.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.570 align:middle line:84%
But there's many more
chakras to that--

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:22.510 align:middle line:90%
than that.

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And so there's many different
chakra points, which

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.660 align:middle line:90%
is where the energy comes in.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And then there's vortices points
where the energy goes out,

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:33.120 align:middle line:84%
like the Great
Pyramids, like Sedona.

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And so there's these
different Earth sites

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:36.570 align:middle line:90%
that are on the planet.

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And they're also reflected
microcosmically in our bodies.

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:43.110 align:middle line:90%
So we are the Earth.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.988 align:middle line:90%
And the Earth is us.

00:21:43.988 --> 00:21:45.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're connected.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:46.155 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: We're connected.

00:21:46.155 --> 00:21:47.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:50.440 align:middle line:84%
What's the significance of
ley lines on this planet?

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.240 align:middle line:90%
And there are many.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Yes, there
are many ley lines.

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
are very intact.

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:57.120 align:middle line:90%
And some of them are broken.

00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:00.300 align:middle line:84%
So like war in a certain
place can break the energy

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:01.830 align:middle line:90%
of the flow of the ley lines.

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And then some of them are
very intact like a lot

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.730 align:middle line:84%
of the ones that run
through a lot of Europe.

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And so in those
spaces, that's where

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.640 align:middle line:84%
we can make these
ancestral phone calls.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:16.140 align:middle line:84%
We can access heightened levels
of energy to be able to heal.

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.210 align:middle line:84%
A lot of different
things can happen

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:19.845 align:middle line:90%
in these certain magnetic lines.

00:22:19.845 --> 00:22:23.335 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's an island
called Skellig Michael Island.

00:22:23.335 --> 00:22:24.135 align:middle line:90%
Where is that?

00:22:24.135 --> 00:22:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: That's off
the coast of Ireland.

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And that is one of the
significant vortices points

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.680 align:middle line:84%
that has a ley line
running through it

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.917 align:middle line:84%
that runs through Europe
and runs through many sites.

00:22:33.917 --> 00:22:35.625 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I bet
you visited there too.

00:22:35.625 --> 00:22:37.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Yes, I
have visited there.

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:39.253 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we happen
to have you on tape.

00:22:39.253 --> 00:22:40.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Oh, do you?

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:40.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here we go.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:41.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: OK.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm on Skellig
Michael in Ireland.

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:46.710 align:middle line:90%
And it is beyond words here.

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:50.370 align:middle line:84%
I have never been
somewhere so extraordinary.

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:52.390 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond words.

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:53.280 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond belief.

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.020 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.900 align:middle line:84%
It's been a sacred
place of pilgrimage

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.230 align:middle line:84%
since the beginning of
Christianity really.

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:05.400 align:middle line:84%
The first monks came and
actually settled this island

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.870 align:middle line:90%
as well as up in Dingle.

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And they created lives for
themselves dedicated to prayer,

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.180 align:middle line:90%
dedicated to the sacred.

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And so it has that transcendent
quality which is so beautiful.

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.590 align:middle line:90%
And it is a vortex.

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:21.810 align:middle line:84%
So the energy is
actually coming up.

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's spiraling
into the heavens.

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:27.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not as intense as
say somewhere like Sedona.

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:32.220 align:middle line:84%
It has more of a soft
energy yet still very wild.

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.350 align:middle line:90%
And it has 100-mile radius.

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:36.360 align:middle line:84%
So even if you're
just in proximity,

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.850 align:middle line:84%
you'll be taken
in by the energy.

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:40.860 align:middle line:90%
And it extends through.

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:42.560 align:middle line:90%
I was just and Dingle yesterday.

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:43.760 align:middle line:90%
And it extends through.

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.070 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of other
beehive huts there.

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.620 align:middle line:90%
And the energy is amazing there.

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:49.550 align:middle line:90%
And you can feel that.

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:51.350 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
same rock formations

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and feel a similar kind
of different energy.

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:57.410 align:middle line:84%
But it's all this
surrounding area around Kerry

00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:59.580 align:middle line:90%
that's really amazing.

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:01.400 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
about being here

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:07.280 align:middle line:84%
that beckons the spirit, beckons
the energy within to go deeper,

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:11.720 align:middle line:84%
to go within ourselves and even
mixed with that whole "Star

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:12.530 align:middle line:90%
Wars" energy.

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:15.350 align:middle line:84%
It's like the force
finding and cultivating

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:18.960 align:middle line:84%
that energy, that vitality,
that divinity within ourselves.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.640 align:middle line:84%
So I'm fascinated
by these awakenings

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.220 align:middle line:84%
within the collective
story and within ourselves.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:28.752 align:middle line:84%
And visiting these places is
just incredible because you

00:24:28.752 --> 00:24:30.710 align:middle line:84%
can feel it, because
these were the people that

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:32.235 align:middle line:90%
actually did it.

00:24:32.235 --> 00:24:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These beehive huts
are riveting, aren't they?

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah,
they're remarkable.

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:38.815 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are they used for.

00:24:38.815 --> 00:24:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: They're
used for meditation.

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:43.660 align:middle line:84%
But their energy
is something that

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.960 align:middle line:84%
allows the aura to really
strengthen and become

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.910 align:middle line:84%
very coherent for
spiritual experiences.

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:50.702 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that like
pyramid power almost?

00:24:50.702 --> 00:24:51.702 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes, exactly.

00:24:51.702 --> 00:24:52.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:54.760 align:middle line:84%
How did they know
this stuff Bridget?

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.815 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: They
remembered this stuff.

00:24:56.815 --> 00:24:58.670 align:middle line:84%
They were in this
place where they

00:24:58.670 --> 00:24:59.920 align:middle line:90%
could receive these downloads.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who taught them?

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:02.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Well,
spirit taught them.

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And they also looked and
mimicked what happened before.

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:07.390 align:middle line:84%
So, for instance,
Skellig Michael

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:10.180 align:middle line:84%
and some of these sites
out in Western Ireland,

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:12.830 align:middle line:90%
they're ancient Atlantean sites.

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:16.600 align:middle line:84%
They've been used for thousands
of years for teaching,

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.950 align:middle line:90%
for initiation.

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really a building
upon the past and continuing

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:26.140 align:middle line:84%
going to these places that
usher in the remembrance

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:29.038 align:middle line:84%
of these schools of
mystery and spirit

00:25:29.038 --> 00:25:30.580 align:middle line:84%
that have been there
for a long time.

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bridget, what
is the Earth star chakra?

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:36.422 align:middle line:90%
So the Earth star chakra is--

00:25:36.422 --> 00:25:38.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of your
favorites, isn't it?

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:39.672 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: It is
one of my favorites.

00:25:39.672 --> 00:25:40.610 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you caught me.

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:44.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's one of my favorites
because the Earth star

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:48.260 align:middle line:84%
chakra is about a
foot below the Earth.

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.300 align:middle line:90%
So it's below our feet even.

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:52.860 align:middle line:84%
But it's a part of
our own chakra system.

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And so because it's
below the Earth,

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.890 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that
it does is it stabilizes.

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:01.865 align:middle line:84%
It's the foundation of our
whole energetic chakra system.

00:26:01.865 --> 00:26:03.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And is it everywhere?

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:06.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: It's within our
own body energy system.

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:09.680 align:middle line:84%
But because it's
under the Earth,

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.210 align:middle line:90%
it is connected to everywhere.

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:13.190 align:middle line:84%
It's connected to
the whole Earth grid.

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And so that really
stabilizes and anchors

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:19.940 align:middle line:84%
us to be able to go high,
to go into the stars,

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:22.820 align:middle line:84%
to have these powerful
connections but be

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:25.490 align:middle line:84%
able to bring them
down and integrate

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:29.930 align:middle line:84%
and embody them in a way that
isn't destabilizing or creates

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:32.240 align:middle line:84%
ascension symptoms
but really can

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.120 align:middle line:90%
be breathed into embodiment.

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And so the Earth star
chakra is really important

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.380 align:middle line:84%
to cultivate and
develop for that.

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:41.255 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Without
it, what happens?

00:26:41.255 --> 00:26:43.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Oh gosh.

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:48.872 align:middle line:84%
Airy-fairy spiritual
discordance, maybe even like--

00:26:48.872 --> 00:26:49.955 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Discombobulation.

00:26:49.955 --> 00:26:51.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: --discombobulation.

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:52.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's the word.

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:54.082 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah, or challenges.

00:26:54.082 --> 00:26:56.538 align:middle line:84%
Like a lot of where
it's like, well,

00:26:56.538 --> 00:26:57.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing all the right things.

00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:59.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm having these
spiritual experiences.

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:00.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm meditating.

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.890 align:middle line:84%
But they're not
grounding into that way

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:06.770 align:middle line:84%
that we can then stabilize
those experiences.

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:09.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Grounding is
that important, isn't it?

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:10.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:12.650 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, grounding is
really important.

00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And it helps, like
we were just saying,

00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:18.530 align:middle line:84%
to digest these higher
streams of frequency

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:20.990 align:middle line:84%
and cosmic energies
that are coming through.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:24.050 align:middle line:84%
We're able to process
them, to digest them,

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:28.820 align:middle line:84%
to assimilate them in the
physical body, in the genetics,

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:31.025 align:middle line:84%
in our energy fields,
and in our auras.

00:27:31.025 --> 00:27:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is amazing.

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:33.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah, it is.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:36.385 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
practice this yourself?

00:27:36.385 --> 00:27:37.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:40.800 align:middle line:84%
Actually before we filmed,
I went and found grass out

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:41.600 align:middle line:90%
by trees.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And I was barefoot,
sitting on the Earth,

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:47.330 align:middle line:84%
anchoring myself,
my energy field

00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:50.000 align:middle line:90%
so that I can be an embodiment.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do what you do.

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:52.850 align:middle line:90%
Does it energize you?

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:54.005 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: It does.

00:27:54.005 --> 00:27:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And it very much so grounds
because coming here I'm

00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.330 align:middle line:84%
on a plane in a lot
of different energies.

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And so it really stabilizes
and returns me back

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:05.630 align:middle line:90%
to my natural energy.

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And even as I was preparing
for this conversation with you,

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:13.400 align:middle line:84%
I was able to stream
that much more.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.090 align:middle line:84%
I was able to be more clear and
be more connected with myself

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:19.430 align:middle line:84%
when I'm in those places
grounded with Earth.

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:22.305 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you don't ground
yourself, do you feel weaker?

00:28:22.305 --> 00:28:23.105 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:28:23.105 --> 00:28:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do?

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:25.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Drained?

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Drained.

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
scientific study on this where

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.000 align:middle line:84%
inflammation goes
up, blood pressure

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.390 align:middle line:84%
goes up, a lot of the
body issues come up.

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And that goes into
being too in our heads

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:40.430 align:middle line:90%
or confused or anxious.

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And so just by being barefoot--
and it is recommended that

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:48.320 align:middle line:84%
it's at least 20 to 40 minutes
a day or just once a week,

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.990 align:middle line:84%
going out and having more
immersive time in nature--

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:54.440 align:middle line:84%
is something that can really
help us on a physical level

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.080 align:middle line:84%
and help us
spiritually to navigate

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:59.540 align:middle line:84%
these different energies
coming in at this time.

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that why walking
on beach sand feels good too?

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:04.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:05.900 align:middle line:90%
That's a great example--

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:06.817 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It really is.

00:29:06.817 --> 00:29:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: --because there's
the negative ions that

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:11.970 align:middle line:90%
are also a part of the ocean.

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And when we're in the trees and
with nature, it's just natural.

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:20.930 align:middle line:84%
It's inherent to our
equilibrium, to our balance.

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:23.973 align:middle line:84%
And this helps us on
all levels-- physically,

00:29:23.973 --> 00:29:25.015 align:middle line:90%
emotionally, spiritually.

00:29:25.015 --> 00:29:27.605 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you eat
specially too, different?

00:29:27.605 --> 00:29:29.105 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Yes, I
do eat different.

00:29:29.105 --> 00:29:30.563 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
have your own diet?

00:29:30.563 --> 00:29:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: I do
have my own diet.

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:35.440 align:middle line:84%
Diet is a really
important part for me

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:39.130 align:middle line:84%
in making sure that my
vessel is able to hold

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:40.915 align:middle line:90%
and embody these big energies.

00:29:40.915 --> 00:29:42.775 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does that
change your DNA?

00:29:42.775 --> 00:29:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes, it does.

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:45.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How does that happen?

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Well,
the DNA of the food

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:53.510 align:middle line:84%
then merges or is discoherent
with the DNA of our bodies.

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:58.150 align:middle line:84%
So when we're eating say like
angry, monoculture, genetically

00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:01.090 align:middle line:84%
modified foods,
then our genetics

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:04.010 align:middle line:84%
starts to get disrupted
and angry itself.

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:06.470 align:middle line:90%
So it's really important for me.

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that I
always recommend is quality,

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:14.165 align:middle line:84%
is getting local food that's
cultivated in a way that

00:30:14.165 --> 00:30:14.965 align:middle line:90%
is in balance.

00:30:14.965 --> 00:30:15.765 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Organic.

00:30:15.765 --> 00:30:17.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah, organic.

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:18.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Non-GMO.

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:19.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Non-GMO.

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:21.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes, those things.

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And that really helps
then our genetics.

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And eating more
plants, more fruits,

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:29.291 align:middle line:84%
more living food
really helps our light,

00:30:29.291 --> 00:30:30.166 align:middle line:90%
helps our light body.

00:30:30.166 --> 00:30:31.208 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you a vegan?

00:30:31.208 --> 00:30:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: I'm not a
vegan, no, because one

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:36.050 align:middle line:84%
of the things that
also helps our DNA,

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:38.990 align:middle line:84%
our mitochondria are
really healthy fats.

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:40.970 align:middle line:84%
So there's also a
lot of nutrients.

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of building
blocks to our energy structure

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.200 align:middle line:84%
as well as our physical
body that can hold

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.550 align:middle line:90%
a lot with animal products.

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:52.160 align:middle line:84%
So I've been vegetarian
a lot of my life, been

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.360 align:middle line:90%
vegan a lot of my life.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And there's different
times for different things.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.310 align:middle line:84%
But I do find that some
of the animal products

00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:02.270 align:middle line:84%
helps stabilize my physical
structure to hold more.

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bridget,
you're an artist also.

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:06.980 align:middle line:84%
What kind of
paintings do you do?

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: I do energetic
spirit paintings.

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:10.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: So one
of the forms that I

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:16.430 align:middle line:84%
like talking about is
veil painting, which

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:20.720 align:middle line:84%
is a cocreative way of
connecting with the unseen.

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:22.910 align:middle line:90%
And so it's a way of divining.

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:26.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a way of channeling that
was fostered and brought forth

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:28.550 align:middle line:90%
by the great Rudolf Steiner.

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And so through
this, the way that I

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:35.450 align:middle line:84%
use it is that I could get
a certain inspiration that

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:37.460 align:middle line:84%
might be a certain
color or a vision

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:39.980 align:middle line:84%
and bring that through
from the other world,

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:44.900 align:middle line:84%
or I might paint a certain
color onto the board.

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.210 align:middle line:90%
And then a figure can emerge.

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:50.705 align:middle line:84%
And then I just bring that
figure into this reality.

00:31:50.705 --> 00:31:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
inspires your work?

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:56.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Spirit, the
unseen, the mystery

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:58.055 align:middle line:90%
is really the main catalyst.

00:31:58.055 --> 00:32:00.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it come
to you like that?

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:00.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: It does.

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:03.470 align:middle line:90%
I feel this impulse from spirit.

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:05.420 align:middle line:84%
It's like, hey, you
need to go paint this.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:06.860 align:middle line:90%
You need to go draw this.

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got
some images I want you

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:11.390 align:middle line:90%
to explain as we look at these.

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:12.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Great.

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:15.790 align:middle line:84%
So this is an
example, was something

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:19.030 align:middle line:84%
that I just created a little
bit of blue watercolor.

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:22.420 align:middle line:84%
But then as the blue
watercolor started to dry,

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:25.220 align:middle line:84%
the veil painting idea
started to emerge.

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.712 align:middle line:84%
So as an example, this
figure at the top,

00:32:27.712 --> 00:32:29.545 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you see
this kind of female.

00:32:29.545 --> 00:32:30.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I see the head.

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah, the head,
the like bird-like wing,

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:34.640 align:middle line:90%
and the hair coming down.

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.890 align:middle line:90%
And then she's holding a bird.

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It looks like
an offering or something.

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:40.030 align:middle line:90%
And so I didn't paint that.

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:41.920 align:middle line:84%
That's something
that just emerged

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.480 align:middle line:90%
as I put the color down.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And then I enhanced to bring
that forth into this reality.

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:49.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's bridging
the unseen realm

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:52.930 align:middle line:84%
and bringing this beautiful
goddess energy into this. form.

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It looks
like we're looking

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:57.235 align:middle line:84%
at an overview of
an island somewhere.

00:32:57.235 --> 00:32:58.425 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes, it does.

00:32:58.425 --> 00:32:59.258 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Doesn't it?

00:32:59.258 --> 00:33:00.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:02.620 align:middle line:84%
These are very
multidimensional too

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:05.210 align:middle line:84%
because you can see
many different things.

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
like the idea of them

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:11.500 align:middle line:84%
being divining tools where
it's whatever you're needing.

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.290 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a
tarot card in that way.

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:14.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:16.670 align:middle line:84%
The next one is what you
would call your whale eye.

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:17.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:19.020 align:middle line:90%
And so similar thing.

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:23.420 align:middle line:84%
I just was painting different
fluid movements of blue paint.

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And then this whale eye
emerged from the painting

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:29.690 align:middle line:90%
that I didn't plan on.

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:34.070 align:middle line:84%
But I felt those Sirian
galactic cosmic energies.

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:36.125 align:middle line:90%
And then this form emerged.

00:33:36.125 --> 00:33:37.505 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
great color scheme.

00:33:37.505 --> 00:33:38.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Thank you.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:39.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big is the Canvas?

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: This
one's pretty big.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.620 align:middle line:84%
I think this is 3
foot, 3 or 4 feet.

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:44.495 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:33:44.495 --> 00:33:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: I like
doing big ones.

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:46.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you sell these?

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:47.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes, I do.

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:47.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what
would that go for?

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: It depends but
a couple thousand at times.

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:53.840 align:middle line:90%
It depends how--

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:54.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:56.240 align:middle line:90%
I was a professional--

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you sign your
name on the bottom of it

00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:58.660 align:middle line:90%
like an artist?

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah, I was
a professional artist

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:01.815 align:middle line:90%
in my early 20s.

00:34:01.815 --> 00:34:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're still
doing it, though?

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah, I am.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:07.040 align:middle line:84%
There's been a lot of more
painting inspiration coming

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:07.840 align:middle line:90%
through.

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the next one
we have is called ancestral.

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.704 align:middle line:90%
Explain what this is, Bridget.

00:34:12.704 --> 00:34:13.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:17.290 align:middle line:84%
So this is, again, like
a divining painting.

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:19.120 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of different
figures and forms

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.199 align:middle line:90%
coming through here.

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is some of what I see
when I'm in the astral realm.

00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:29.080 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm in the astral
perception before sleep

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:32.889 align:middle line:84%
or in meditation, a lot of
these different spirit forms

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:36.610 align:middle line:84%
will emerge in my third
eye, in my vision.

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And so this is like
a gateway into seeing

00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:41.320 align:middle line:90%
into that unseen space.

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I can see how some
people looking at your pictures

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:48.280 align:middle line:84%
would have some kind
of powerful experience.

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:49.270 align:middle line:90%
Has that happened?

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Yes,
that has happened.

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:53.949 align:middle line:84%
One of my patrons that has
a couple of my paintings,

00:34:53.949 --> 00:34:55.719 align:middle line:90%
he had one in his guest bedroom.

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And a guest came and stayed and
was falling asleep and looking

00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:59.710 align:middle line:90%
at the painting.

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:00.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like this.

00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Like this.

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And an actual physical orb
flew out of the painting.

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:06.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:06.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And he got freaked out because
he didn't know anything

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.070 align:middle line:90%
about spiritual stuff.

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:15.150 align:middle line:90%
He just was a layperson to this.

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:16.520 align:middle line:90%
And so he ran out of the room.

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:17.603 align:middle line:90%
And he went to his friend.

00:35:17.603 --> 00:35:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And he was like, this
light thing, orb came out

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:23.145 align:middle line:90%
of the painting.

00:35:23.145 --> 00:35:23.945 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cool.

00:35:23.945 --> 00:35:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: My patron was
like, yeah, that's the idea.

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:31.215 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How original art
that you do creates energy?

00:35:31.215 --> 00:35:32.090 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:32.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:36.770 align:middle line:84%
So anything we create is
created with a certain energy.

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:40.640 align:middle line:84%
But the Daoists have a
really beautiful practice

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:45.260 align:middle line:84%
where the Qigong masters
actually infuse with their life

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:49.190 align:middle line:84%
force energy, the energy they've
cultivated, they infuse that

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:52.040 align:middle line:84%
into the painting
as it's drying.

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.630 align:middle line:84%
So then when it's
on the wall, it

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:56.532 align:middle line:84%
holds and emanates and
puts off that energy.

00:35:56.532 --> 00:35:58.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It just comes
sparking out like crazy.

00:35:58.490 --> 00:35:59.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Exactly.

00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what I like
to do with my paintings.

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:05.030 align:middle line:84%
I use different pigment
and crystal paints.

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:08.330 align:middle line:84%
So then the crystals can
hold that energy imprint

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:10.400 align:middle line:90%
and then overflow that.

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your artwork, how
does it relate to ancestry?

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: So it's one of
the ways that I communicate.

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:20.540 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the ways
that I connect and heal

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:24.180 align:middle line:84%
with the ancestors
depending on what's needed.

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:27.720 align:middle line:84%
For example, I had this
really powerful astral dream

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.520 align:middle line:90%
experience--

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That looks like a face.

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: --where
I was connected

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:36.290 align:middle line:84%
with my Native American
ancestors that I have.

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And it was shown to me that they
had some traumatic things that

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:41.450 align:middle line:90%
happened to them.

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And they needed more
healing because they

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:45.060 align:middle line:90%
were in this lonely space.

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the
ways that I was

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:52.350 align:middle line:84%
working to heal them and work
with them is by painting them.

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a picture
of one of my ancestors

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:59.405 align:middle line:84%
but from this greater
kind of spirit sense.

00:36:59.405 --> 00:37:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He doesn't
look too happy.

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: No,
there's pain that has

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:06.570 align:middle line:90%
happened in humanity as well.

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And so by feeling that pain
and by assimilating that,

00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:12.320 align:middle line:84%
that's one of the ways that
we can really bring healing.

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:13.695 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, the
other one looks

00:37:13.695 --> 00:37:16.040 align:middle line:84%
like some kind of
Native American chief.

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:19.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes, my ancestor was.

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And there's this connection
too of the elemental qualities

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:29.900 align:middle line:84%
of their connection to the sun,
their connection to the Bear

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:33.020 align:middle line:84%
Clan, their connection
as the red race

00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:36.510 align:middle line:84%
empowering that purpose of
that soil and that energy.

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:40.770 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot that came
through for them in this

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:41.570 align:middle line:90%
and feel--

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:43.550 align:middle line:84%
it felt different
as I was doing it.

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How often
are you painting?

00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: I'm
painting more now.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.740 align:middle line:84%
I didn't for a lot
of years because I

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:52.490 align:middle line:84%
was doing more video content
and traveling, as you can see.

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:53.930 align:middle line:90%
But I'm doing a lot now.

00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:56.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you get
yourself into a certain mode

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:57.890 align:middle line:90%
before you start to paint?

00:37:57.890 --> 00:38:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Yes, the mode finds
me where all of a sudden,

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.310 align:middle line:84%
I just move into
an altered state.

00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And then I can just be
painting for hours at a time.

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how do
you apply all of this

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:13.535 align:middle line:90%
to intuitive healing?

00:38:13.535 --> 00:38:16.830 align:middle line:10%
>>NIELSEN: So I work with
people with the artwork as well.

00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:19.040 align:middle line:10%
So one of the things
I do at my retreats

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:23.210 align:middle line:10%
that anyone can do at any
time is use these forms.

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:27.170 align:middle line:84%
That's why art therapy exists,
for instance, but even any kind

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:28.530 align:middle line:90%
of creative therapy.

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I take
people through this.

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And you don't need any skill
to do it, which is wonderful.

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:38.060 align:middle line:84%
It's just a way of using
color to change and heal

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:41.000 align:middle line:84%
our frequency, as well
as using form and seeing

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.270 align:middle line:84%
what emerges as a way of
communicating with the deeper

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:46.927 align:middle line:84%
parts of ourselves and
communicating with the unseen.

00:38:46.927 --> 00:38:48.635 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
find you, Bridget?

00:38:48.635 --> 00:38:51.680 align:middle line:10%
>>NIELSEN: People can find
me through my website,

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:54.960 align:middle line:10%
I'm on YouTube, and through
my podcast or my main forums.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:56.210 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What is your website?

00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:57.515 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: bridgetnielsen.com.

>>NOORY: Thanks for being
back on "Beyond Belief."

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Thanks so much
for having me, George.

>>NOORY: The tapping into
Earth chakras and your own,

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:10.100 align:middle line:10%
combining the two together
creates an individual of just

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:12.040 align:middle line:10%
incredible scope.

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And when you watch
"Beyond Belief,"

00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:17.960 align:middle line:84%
you will realize that
you can do this too.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.990 align:middle line:90%
