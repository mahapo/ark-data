>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.140 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory,
and in this program,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.720 align:middle line:10%
we're going to talk about
wealth inequality-- what

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.520 align:middle line:10%
does that mean?

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.230 align:middle line:10%
How does that affect all of
us-- with our special guest,

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.110 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Peter Phillips.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.460 align:middle line:84%
He is a professor of sociology
at Sonoma State University

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.530 align:middle line:84%
and the past director
of the Censored Project.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.570 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.900 align:middle line:84%
>>A major reason behind the
immense power of the global 1%

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.830 align:middle line:84%
is the lack of
transparency surrounding

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.230 align:middle line:84%
their role in the world's
financial systems.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.520 align:middle line:84%
By keeping the other
99% of us in the dark,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.160 align:middle line:84%
they are able to maintain
their grip on those systems.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.810 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Peter Phillips,
a sociology professor

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.750 align:middle line:10%
at Sonoma State University
and a prolific author,

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:02.880 align:middle line:10%
wants to change that.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.710 align:middle line:10%
He is perhaps best known for
highlighting media failures

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.690 align:middle line:10%
and oversights for the
award-winning organization

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.860 align:middle line:10%
Project Censored.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.850 align:middle line:84%
In recent years,
Dr. Phillips has

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.270 align:middle line:84%
turned his tenacious
research skills

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.990 align:middle line:84%
to uncovering the composition
of the elites, how they maintain

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.360 align:middle line:90%
and channel power.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.730 align:middle line:84%
He shares the secrets they
hope you'll never learn today,

on "Beyond Belief."

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So welcome
back to "Beyond Belief"

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.460 align:middle line:90%
with our guest, Peter Phillips.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.510 align:middle line:10%
Peter, wealth inequality--
what the heck is that?

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.980 align:middle line:10%
And how did you personally
get involved in that?

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.605 align:middle line:10%
>>DR. PETER PHILLIPS:
Wealth inequality

00:01:35.605 --> 00:01:38.280 align:middle line:10%
reflects the concentration
of capital in the world.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.350 align:middle line:10%
And though since
the Occupy movement,

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.699 align:middle line:10%
we've had the 99% versus the 1%,
the 1% being the richest people

00:01:45.699 --> 00:01:47.490 align:middle line:10%
in the world,
multi-millionaires and that--

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.950 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Controlling everything.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.160 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Well yeah,
but actually the 1%--

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.910 align:middle line:84%
the bottom tier of the 1%,
it's really only half a million

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:54.960 align:middle line:90%
dollars.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.410 align:middle line:84%
It's the upper tiers of the
1%, the one thousandth of 1%,

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.240 align:middle line:84%
or the one hundredth
of 1%, these

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.990 align:middle line:84%
are the multi-millionaires,
the multi-billionaires.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And most of that's in
money management firms.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.170 align:middle line:84%
It's in central banks, very
centralized corporations,

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.872 align:middle line:84%
or a place like
BlackRock, which is

00:02:12.872 --> 00:02:14.330 align:middle line:84%
one of the largest
money management

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.340 align:middle line:90%
corporations in the world.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.710 align:middle line:84%
They manage-- just a few
thousand people manage--

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.780 align:middle line:90%
$100 trillion worth of wealth.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.890 align:middle line:10%
That's close to half
the wealth of the world.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's their
game plan, Peter?

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.219 align:middle line:90%
What do they want to do?

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Well, they're
caught in this trap

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.320 align:middle line:84%
of acquiring capital
and then needing

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.340 align:middle line:90%
to see it grow and expand.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.940 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, capital, they want
to get a 7% to 10% return.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.110 align:middle line:84%
So they're always looking for
ways of investing anywhere

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.910 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they
conspire together

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.320 align:middle line:84%
to do that, in various ways,
to maximize their return.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And then it ends up
concentrating even more.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.660 align:middle line:84%
We did a study on
the financial core

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.580 align:middle line:84%
of the transnational
capitalist class.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.082 align:middle line:84%
So these people
are transnational.

00:02:58.082 --> 00:02:59.540 align:middle line:84%
They're not just
one nation state--

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.160 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS:
--they're globalized.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're everywhere.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.840 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: They operate
all over the world.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.006 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They're everywhere.

00:03:03.006 --> 00:03:07.580 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: And so we took the
10 largest money management

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.495 align:middle line:10%
firms and the 10 largest,
most concentrated corporations

00:03:11.495 --> 00:03:14.030 align:middle line:10%
in the world, and we put
that two lists together.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.560 align:middle line:10%
There's only 13 firms.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.377 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's it?

00:03:16.377 --> 00:03:17.710 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: They're the biggest.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.510 align:middle line:10%
They're the core.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.220 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right, planet-wide.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.070 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: Just those 13
firms alone manage $25 trillion

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.870 align:middle line:10%
worth of wealth.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:26.870 align:middle line:90%
That was four years ago.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.050 align:middle line:84%
It's probably $30 trillion
to $40 trillion now.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And they have 161
people that are

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.360 align:middle line:90%
on their boards of directors.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.400 align:middle line:84%
So they could fit
in our studio here.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.760 align:middle line:90%
It's a small enough group.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.190 align:middle line:90%
And they know each other.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.020 align:middle line:10%
They interact in various
transnational groups,

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.110 align:middle line:10%
like the Bilderberger Group,
and the Trilateral Commission,

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.910 align:middle line:10%
and the Counc--

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:47.010 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.900 align:middle line:10%
And they go to the Bohemian
Grove and have a good time.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.441 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: And they go to the
same kinds of places, exactly.

00:03:51.441 --> 00:03:52.870 align:middle line:90%
So they have similar interests.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And their interest is to
protect capital worldwide,

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.380 align:middle line:84%
to see it grow and expand,
and to absorb and take

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.970 align:middle line:90%
over even more wealth.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are these good people?

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.350 align:middle line:90%
Nice people?

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.725 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Well, they're
often very nice, very friendly,

00:04:07.725 --> 00:04:10.660 align:middle line:84%
very nice to talk
to and be around.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:16.269 align:middle line:84%
But they make decisions
that impact the world.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.459 align:middle line:84%
And looking in the
world today, we

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.090 align:middle line:84%
have 3 billion people who
live on less than $3 a day.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What?

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: 3 billion people
live on less than $3 a day

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:27.530 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.738 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do they do that?

00:04:28.738 --> 00:04:30.320 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Not very well.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And 35,000 of them die, daily,
from malnutrition or very

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.350 align:middle line:90%
easily curable diseases.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:39.975 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Diseases
and things like that.

00:04:39.975 --> 00:04:44.180 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: So it's 10
World Trade Center collapses

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.310 align:middle line:84%
daily, among people in
the world who are dying,

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.807 align:middle line:84%
that don't need to die if
wealth was better spread around.

00:04:51.807 --> 00:04:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Men, women,
children-- all of them.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: But
capitalism will even

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:00.080 align:middle line:84%
go to the point of trying to
market stuff to those people.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.070 align:middle line:84%
Those billions of
people, we're trying

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.640 align:middle line:84%
to sell them a cigarette
or a Coca-Cola.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.247 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or a
cellphone, or something.

00:05:06.247 --> 00:05:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Well, they
don't buy cellphones.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.200 align:middle line:84%
They don't have enough
money to do that.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.620 align:middle line:84%
But we'll try to
sell them a Coke.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:21.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's very concentrated, and
the consequences for people

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.140 align:middle line:90%
worldwide are very negative.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, as
it concentrates more,

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.162 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing a decline in
the middle class worldwide.

00:05:31.162 --> 00:05:32.870 align:middle line:84%
There's jobs that just
aren't accessible.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.630 align:middle line:90%
There are surplus people.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.250 align:middle line:84%
They don't have anything
to do, any work to do.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.132 align:middle line:84%
That capital's running
the world and expanding.

00:05:40.132 --> 00:05:41.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long
though, Peter, can they

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.240 align:middle line:84%
continue to keep the lid
on something like this

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.220 align:middle line:90%
before it explodes?

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.360 align:middle line:84%
You can only hold
people back so long.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And then they just
say, that's it.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.900 align:middle line:90%
We're fed up.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.739 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: They're
very worried about it.

00:05:54.739 --> 00:05:56.030 align:middle line:90%
They are very worried about it.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.490 align:middle line:84%
The Occupy Movement-- any
kind of democracy movement

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.930 align:middle line:84%
from the grassroots, the
bottom up, they're afraid.

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.680 align:middle line:84%
The Occupy Movement was heavily
infiltrated across the United

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.740 align:middle line:84%
States by the national
security state-- police

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.300 align:middle line:90%
departments, FBI, everybody.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And the Arab Spring,
and anywhere that people

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.910 align:middle line:84%
are acting and trying to
act in a democratic way

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.340 align:middle line:84%
to make their own power,
to expand their own control

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.010 align:middle line:84%
over their lives and
their society, that

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.240 align:middle line:84%
threatens the transnational
capitalist class.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.260 align:middle line:90%
It threatens those elites.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.610 align:middle line:10%
And when there's leaders of
countries that do that like

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.580 align:middle line:10%
Qaddafi-- he was proposing
that all the oil be--

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.189 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And Saddam, right?

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:43.980 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: Yeah, he
was proposing that oil

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.874 align:middle line:10%
be sold in gold, from Africa.

00:06:45.874 --> 00:06:47.290 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That was
his big mistake.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:48.480 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: Well, they
wanted to get rid of him.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.435 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, that
was his mistake.

00:06:50.435 --> 00:06:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Saddam
Hussein was selling oil

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.880 align:middle line:90%
in euros and not dollars.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.510 align:middle line:84%
So when the heads
of state do that,

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:02.430 align:middle line:84%
then that's time
for regime change.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:06.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The word to leaders--
don't dump your dollars

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:07.310 align:middle line:90%
for oil.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.230 align:middle line:84%
Keep that monetary
system the same, right?

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:13.840 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Keep the
capital system the same,

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.720 align:middle line:84%
and don't interfere with
the central banks, certainly

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.590 align:middle line:84%
the central banks in
Europe and America.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's amazing that they
would take out leaders merely

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.727 align:middle line:90%
because of things like that.

00:07:26.727 --> 00:07:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Well, there
will be policy formations.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:32.500 align:middle line:84%
So if you go to the
World Economic Forum,

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.950 align:middle line:84%
they're doing reports from
there that this is a concern.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:40.280 align:middle line:10%
Land prices in Africa are
going up too fast, or whatever.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.840 align:middle line:10%
Then governments will take
a look at these policy

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.270 align:middle line:10%
recommendations from
these global elites,

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.220 align:middle line:10%
and then act on them.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.820 align:middle line:10%
So the US has set up Africom.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.614 align:middle line:10%
So we have troops in 134
nations now, around the world--

00:07:53.614 --> 00:07:55.030 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We're all
over the place.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:56.830 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: --a
thousand military bases.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.030 align:middle line:10%
And that's tied into NATO.

00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:59.730 align:middle line:10%
So NATO's part of that.

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:02.100 align:middle line:84%
You have this
surplus of capital,

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.050 align:middle line:84%
and it's concentrated
in just less than 1%

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.386 align:middle line:90%
of the world population.

00:08:06.386 --> 00:08:08.010 align:middle line:84%
They manage these
hundreds of trillions

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:09.290 align:middle line:90%
of dollars' worth of wealth.

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:11.600 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for
places to invest

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.600 align:middle line:84%
it and/or to spend it so
that they get a return

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.190 align:middle line:90%
and get even more wealth.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.560 align:middle line:84%
So war is one way
that that happens.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.930 align:middle line:84%
So if the military
empire, US-NATO empire,

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:25.030 align:middle line:84%
starts a war somewhere, they
buy the stuff for the war.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:30.130 align:middle line:84%
So that simulates a lot of
profits for many corporations.

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:31.481 align:middle line:90%
They destroy a bunch of stuff.

00:08:31.481 --> 00:08:33.730 align:middle line:84%
Then you have to go back in,
and fix it, and built it.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:35.159 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They love doing this.

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:36.130 align:middle line:84%
That's how they
make their money.

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: That's
permanent war.

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:42.809 align:middle line:84%
That's tied into concentration
of global capital.

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:44.270 align:middle line:90%
And they're worried about it.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they worry about
democracy movements

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.390 align:middle line:84%
emerging that will undermine
and destroy their wealth.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And they are literally
afraid of that.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And they work entirely towards
protecting that wealth.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
military empire's

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.630 align:middle line:84%
about, and private
mercenaries, and public media.

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:04.170 align:middle line:84%
It's all about
protecting world capital.

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you said this,
Peter, to the average person,

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.114 align:middle line:84%
that this was really going
on, what would they say?

00:09:12.114 --> 00:09:13.030 align:middle line:90%
Would they believe it?

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:14.260 align:middle line:90%
Would they understand it?

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.410 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Well,
there's zero coverage.

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:19.855 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people know about
the Trilateral Commission,

00:09:19.855 --> 00:09:21.455 align:middle line:84%
or they know about
Eisenhower's--

00:09:21.455 --> 00:09:22.746 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Bilderbergs, yeah.

00:09:22.746 --> 00:09:26.914 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: --warning of the
military-industrial empire.

00:09:26.914 --> 00:09:28.830 align:middle line:84%
They know that there's
elites in this country.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:31.980 align:middle line:84%
But they often don't
understand, nor has there

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.740 align:middle line:84%
been a lot of work
on, transnational,

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.710 align:middle line:90%
globalized capital.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And for the last 20
years, sociologists

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.880 align:middle line:84%
have been researching the
transnational capitalist class.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And there's some really
good work in that area.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.150 align:middle line:84%
David Rothkopf did a book
called "The Superclass."

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.010 align:middle line:90%
He used to work for Kissinger.

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:52.980 align:middle line:84%
So he would go to the
Bilderberger Group,

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.900 align:middle line:84%
and he would see this kind
of interaction going on.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.850 align:middle line:10%
And so we have a
number of good books.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.930 align:middle line:10%
William Robinson is probably
one of the best right now.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:04.680 align:middle line:10%
He's a professor at UC Santa
Barbara who does books.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.130 align:middle line:10%
His latest is
called "Capitalism--

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:07.740 align:middle line:10%
The Crisis of Humanity."

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:11.490 align:middle line:10%
And he was talking
about how humanity--

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.240 align:middle line:10%
the poverty is happening.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.060 align:middle line:10%
But to control those masses,
there's increased police state.

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:21.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he really talks about
creeping fascism in the world.

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They actually
will kill people

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.580 align:middle line:84%
if things get out
of hand, won't they?

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.930 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Oh, everywhere.

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:28.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Even here?

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.550 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: There are more
private mercenaries in Honduras

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:34.260 align:middle line:84%
than there is Honduras
government people.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And they had their coup
back there six years ago,

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:40.560 align:middle line:84%
and took over the democratically
elected government.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And then now, there's
free-flowing neoliberal

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:44.630 align:middle line:90%
capitalism going on.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:46.380 align:middle line:90%
People resist, they get killed.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about Venezuela?

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Now that Chavez has died,
the place is a mess.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.350 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Well, our media
keeps telling us it's a mass.

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:59.470 align:middle line:84%
The price of oil collapsed,
so that was deliberate.

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And Maduro still has the
support of the people.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.350 align:middle line:84%
He would be reelected
today, probably, 2 to 1,

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.270 align:middle line:90%
if they had an election.

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Peter, is
this a game for them?

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:13.820 align:middle line:90%
What do they really want?

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:17.140 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a
return of 7% to 10%.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.460 align:middle line:90%
It's control, isn't it?

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:19.750 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: It's power.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:23.260 align:middle line:84%
It's power at the
highest levels.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And you have, in each
state, security forces,

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:35.110 align:middle line:84%
or what Peter Dale Scott
calls the deep state, people

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:37.350 align:middle line:84%
who act behind the scenes
that make things happen.

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:42.970 align:middle line:84%
So October surprises,
assassinations,

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.400 align:middle line:84%
wealth diminishing
or problems arising,

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.810 align:middle line:84%
investigations on
people you don't like,

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:52.680 align:middle line:84%
exposures, entrapments
happen all the time.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.250 align:middle line:90%
So they're manipulating.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:58.950 align:middle line:84%
These people in deep state
politics, behind the scenes,

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:00.610 align:middle line:90%
are in service to capital.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:02.815 align:middle line:90%
They know who their bosses are.

00:12:02.815 --> 00:12:04.940 align:middle line:84%
It's not like the bosses
are telling them directly,

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.600 align:middle line:90%
you go assassinate somebody.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.890 align:middle line:90%
They know what to do.

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And as long as they
get the job done,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.820 align:middle line:84%
then they're allowed to continue
to exist to do what they do.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And who
do they report to?

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Well, every
government agency,

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:21.770 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the
CIA, or the FBI,

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:24.020 align:middle line:84%
or NSA, or military
intelligence,

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:25.380 align:middle line:90%
has chains of command.

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.960 align:middle line:84%
But inside those
organizations, there

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.530 align:middle line:84%
are units of activity
that are semi-independent.

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
rogue, aren't they?

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:35.630 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Well, "rogue"
is an interesting word.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.740 align:middle line:84%
If they get caught, then
they say they're rogue.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:43.320 align:middle line:84%
But they are institutionalized
inside of these organizations.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And there's money
that can be used.

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.380 align:middle line:90%
Some of it's drug money.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And so there's
billions of dollars

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:53.810 align:middle line:84%
available for these
deep state actors

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:57.090 align:middle line:84%
to engage in global
power manipulation.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had heard that
when the Taliban was in charge

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.120 align:middle line:84%
of Afghanistan, they put the lid
on the poppy seed production,

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:04.920 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.878 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: There was no
poppy seed production,

00:13:06.878 --> 00:13:09.670 align:middle line:84%
except in the north,
which they didn't control.

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then, once we
took over, it increased.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.814 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Full-blown poppy
production again, right.

00:13:15.814 --> 00:13:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:19.030 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: 800 tons of--

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:22.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's all
illegal drug money.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.570 align:middle line:90%
What do they do with the money?

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: It goes
in the central banks.

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:30.910 align:middle line:84%
In 2008, with the crisis we
had, the collapse of the housing

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:33.320 align:middle line:84%
market, it was the
drug money that kind of

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.450 align:middle line:90%
kept the banks afloat.

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.290 align:middle line:90%
The public doesn't get it.

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:40.655 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Half
a billion-- no, I

00:13:40.655 --> 00:13:43.800 align:middle line:84%
mean half a trillion-- dollars
in drug money annually.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like-- the DEA is
trying to control drugs, right?

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:50.460 align:middle line:90%
That's their job.

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:51.750 align:middle line:90%
That's their task force.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.750 align:middle line:84%
But in Honduras, or
Mexico, or whatever,

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.830 align:middle line:84%
it's sort of like
controlling-- it's more

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.390 align:middle line:90%
like regulating the drug flow.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:01.380 align:middle line:10%
There are certain
people, certain cartels,

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:05.250 align:middle line:10%
certain government officials
that are in the drug business

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.690 align:middle line:10%
and always have been.

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.340 align:middle line:10%
And they're not to be bothered.

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:11.680 align:middle line:10%
You go after the small fry.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.470 align:middle line:10%
You go after ones that are
challenging the most powerful.

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Peter, I want to take
a look at a clip on the Bohemian

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:18.730 align:middle line:90%
Grove.

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:19.290 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: OK.

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:21.456 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then we'll
come back and talk about it.

00:14:21.456 --> 00:14:24.000 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this first.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>>Located within the redwoods
of Sonoma County, California,

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.950 align:middle line:84%
Bohemian Grove is the
stuff of conspiracy legend.

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:33.560 align:middle line:84%
The Grove is owned by
the all-male Bohemian

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Club, which was founded
in San Francisco in 1872.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.560 align:middle line:84%
Today it is one of the most
exclusive clubs in the United

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.360 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.040 align:middle line:84%
The waiting list for
membership is decades long,

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.820 align:middle line:84%
and the membership
roster includes

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.590 align:middle line:84%
numerous influential
men, US presidents,

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:51.210 align:middle line:84%
foreign dignitaries,
writers like Mark Twain,

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:53.240 align:middle line:90%
and businessmen like Henry Ford.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Each year, the members
gather with their guests

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:58.910 align:middle line:84%
for a 16-day-long
closed door celebration.

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:01.160 align:middle line:10%
Rumors about this
meeting run wild,

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.350 align:middle line:10%
from allegations of
hedonistic partying

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:06.970 align:middle line:10%
to outright human sacrifice
and worship of a gigantic owl

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:07.880 align:middle line:10%
statute.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.820 align:middle line:84%
For years, members
of the public have

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.610 align:middle line:84%
tried to infiltrate
this gathering

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:13.520 align:middle line:84%
and learn what's
actually going on.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.890 align:middle line:90%
Are the rumors true?

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:16.770 align:middle line:84%
Could the leaders
of the United States

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:19.330 align:middle line:84%
really meet in secret
once a year for rituals

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:20.980 align:middle line:90%
and obscure celebrations?

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:24.190 align:middle line:84%
It seems far fetched, but
here's where it gets crazy.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:28.870 align:middle line:84%
It's true-- or at least some of
it, including the owl statute.

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:31.210 align:middle line:84%
In 1989, journalist
Phillip Weiss

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:33.220 align:middle line:90%
managed to sneak into the Grove.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.220 align:middle line:10%
In his article for
"Spy" magazine,

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:37.300 align:middle line:10%
Weiss describes the situation.

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.100 align:middle line:84%
CEOs, celebrities, and
government officials

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.470 align:middle line:84%
were partying with
elaborate performances,

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:45.470 align:middle line:84%
round-the-clock drinks,
songs, and speeches.

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:48.370 align:middle line:10%
The opening ceremony, called
the cremation of care,

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:50.540 align:middle line:10%
is one of the
strangest performances.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.910 align:middle line:10%
In this ceremony, people
dressed as priests

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:55.850 align:middle line:10%
bear the crypt of a
symbolic Mr. Dull Care

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:57.650 align:middle line:10%
to the edge of the Grove's lake.

00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:01.190 align:middle line:84%
More characters emerge at the
base of a 40-foot-tall statue

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:02.010 align:middle line:90%
of an owl.

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:04.570 align:middle line:84%
These characters sing
a ceremonial song,

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:06.360 align:middle line:90%
and more spectacles occur.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.180 align:middle line:84%
Each year, the owl of
Bohemia instructs the members

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.210 align:middle line:84%
to burn the crypt
of Mr. Dull Care

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:15.250 align:middle line:84%
with the eternal
flame of fellowship.

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Peter, our buddy Alex
Jones infiltrated the Bohemian

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:20.430 align:middle line:90%
Grove many years ago.

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:24.740 align:middle line:84%
That's a strange,
strange place, isn't it?

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.480 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: I was there.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you infiltrate,
or invited guest?

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: I was
an invited guest.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:34.140 align:middle line:84%
I did my dissertation
on the Bohemian Grove.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And a good part of the
clip, it kind of exaggerates

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.000 align:middle line:90%
what they're about.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.309 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's a big men's party.

00:16:40.309 --> 00:16:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is, for sure.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:43.516 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: There's some
very powerful people there.

00:16:43.516 --> 00:16:44.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it a club?

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:46.563 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Yeah, it's
a private men's club.

00:16:46.563 --> 00:16:48.340 align:middle line:90%
It's for men only.

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.152 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
women membership.

00:16:50.152 --> 00:16:52.110 align:middle line:84%
They have a club in San
Francisco, a clubhouse.

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you still go?

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:55.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: No, no,
I wasn't a member.

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:56.691 align:middle line:84%
I just wrote my
dissertation on them.

00:16:56.691 --> 00:16:58.290 align:middle line:90%
I was invited as a guest.

00:16:58.290 --> 00:16:59.940 align:middle line:90%
So I you get to go to Grove.

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.340 align:middle line:84%
I saw the cremation
of care ceremony.

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:06.099 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed, literally,
hundreds of bohemians.

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:08.829 align:middle line:90%
They are powerful people.

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:11.170 align:middle line:84%
One out of five is
somebody very powerful

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:14.119 align:middle line:84%
in government or a
major corporation.

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:15.470 align:middle line:90%
They interact and play together.

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:16.270 align:middle line:90%
They drink a lot.

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:17.750 align:middle line:90%
They entertain each other.

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:21.778 align:middle line:10%
The cremation of care
ceremony is a little bizarre,

00:17:21.778 --> 00:17:23.319 align:middle line:10%
because they are
dressed up in robes,

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:25.000 align:middle line:10%
and they do burn the
skeleton of care.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.430 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Like "Eyes Wide Shut?"

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:27.250 align:middle line:10%
That kind of look?

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:28.440 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: Well--

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.940 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Ohh.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: That movie's a
little far-fetched as well.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:38.130 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it leads to
having a good time.

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:40.648 align:middle line:90%


00:17:40.648 --> 00:17:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And I was there during
care, and there's

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.734 align:middle line:84%
guys out in the
audience that are

00:17:43.734 --> 00:17:45.950 align:middle line:90%
kind of chuckling and stuff.

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:48.040 align:middle line:90%
But some take it very seriously.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.800 align:middle line:84%
But part of it, the seriousness
is that they're coming back

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.010 align:middle line:90%
to the same place every year.

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And they can talk
with the same people.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.715 align:middle line:84%
And they have little cabins
they can stay in, and camps.

00:17:57.715 --> 00:18:01.770 align:middle line:84%
There's 120 different camps,
and every camp has a bar.

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:03.690 align:middle line:90%
And they have lunch there.

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a big dining
area where they all go.

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:09.220 align:middle line:84%
But there's lots of
entertainment, lots of poetry,

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:12.240 align:middle line:84%
a lot of exchanges, and
then a lot of conversations

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.680 align:middle line:84%
about politics, and
business, and that.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.430 align:middle line:84%
They're not supposed
to do business there.

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:19.040 align:middle line:84%
They don't per se,
but I certainly

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:23.000 align:middle line:84%
heard plenty of men talking
about major business issues.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they do
weird things there?

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:28.020 align:middle line:84%
We've heard all kinds of
bizarre stuff come out of there.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Well, some of
that has come from Alex Jones.

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And he could have gone in one
time with my lawyer friend,

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:39.450 align:middle line:90%
but chose to sneak in instead.

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:43.180 align:middle line:90%
But my dissertation is online.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.950 align:middle line:90%
People read it all the time.

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:48.010 align:middle line:84%
It pretty much lays out
the work in that area.

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Bill Domhoff did a book on the
Bohemian Grove before that.

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:53.420 align:middle line:84%
He was on my
dissertation committee.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And so I think we
were pretty clear

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:57.800 align:middle line:84%
that it is a relative
advantage-- that

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:01.110 align:middle line:84%
was my subtitle-- to being
in a club like that in terms

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:05.680 align:middle line:84%
of your own personal gains and
access to the people in power.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.680 align:middle line:84%
But there's private men's clubs
like that all over the world.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.920 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, the British
Empire had them everyone.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the ones in
the US are modeled after.

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:18.270 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it's a place where
powerful people gather and do.

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:20.910 align:middle line:84%
But they're not making
policy decisions.

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:21.710 align:middle line:90%
They don't--

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not there.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: --issue
policy reports.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:27.729 align:middle line:84%
But the people there may belong
to the Trilateral Commission,

00:19:27.729 --> 00:19:30.020 align:middle line:84%
or they may belong to the
Council on Foreign Relations.

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:32.530 align:middle line:90%
In fact, a lot of them do.

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And the Council, CFR, is
making reports annually

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:42.050 align:middle line:84%
that are team-based, scholarly
reports on policy direction.

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:46.860 align:middle line:84%
So when Obama went to Cuba,
it wasn't on his own volition.

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:51.480 align:middle line:84%
CFR, five years ago, said, it's
time to break down the barriers

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.280 align:middle line:90%
with Cuba.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.980 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We should have
done that years ago.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:54.660 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: Oh, of
course we should have.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.076 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I mean, the fact that
you can't get a Cuban cigar

00:19:57.076 --> 00:19:59.260 align:middle line:10%
here legally is crazy, right?

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.670 align:middle line:90%
And that's another story too.

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:05.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the entire Fidel
Castro overthrowing Batista,

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:10.160 align:middle line:84%
losing a relationship with
us, it goes way, way back.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And of course, as
you all know, they

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:14.590 align:middle line:90%
wanted to kill Castro for years.

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:16.370 align:middle line:10%
The Kennedy
administration tries.

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:17.580 align:middle line:10%
Eisenhower tried.

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:20.520 align:middle line:90%
This guy was Teflon.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: And they supported
terrorist attacks on Cuba.

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:28.360 align:middle line:84%
So those are all stories at
Project Censored, our research

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.240 align:middle line:84%
group that I managed for
16 years, at Sonoma State,

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.570 align:middle line:90%
would cover.

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And so Project Censored has
been around for 40 years now.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.090 align:middle line:84%
We put out an annual
book called "Censored,"

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:40.300 align:middle line:84%
and that's where I
publish my research

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.611 align:middle line:84%
work on the transnational
capitalist class.

00:20:42.611 --> 00:20:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are these people--
the elitists, what are they

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:46.890 align:middle line:90%
really worried about?

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Because there's some
underlining tone of concern.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.242 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:20:53.242 --> 00:20:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Well,
they're certainly

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:59.967 align:middle line:84%
worried about-- think about
it like you're the plantation

00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:01.800 align:middle line:84%
owner, and you live in
the big, white house,

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.339 align:middle line:90%
and you're surrounded by slaves.

00:21:04.339 --> 00:21:06.380 align:middle line:84%
You're kind of afraid,
and you're always worried.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're afraid,
one day, you'll wake up,

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.230 align:middle line:84%
and the slaves will try
to break your house down.

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:11.581 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: Exactly.

00:21:11.581 --> 00:21:12.830 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But you created that.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:13.940 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: We're
talking, it's globally.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.690 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But you
created the slaves.

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:16.700 align:middle line:90%
You hired them.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:17.700 align:middle line:90%
You kidnapped them.

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.170 align:middle line:90%
You did whatever you had to.

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: And you
supported create capitalism

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:22.850 align:middle line:90%
at the global level.

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And wealth gets concentrated,
and then it's expanded,

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.010 align:middle line:90%
and it's put into derivatives.

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:30.170 align:middle line:84%
It's no longer wealth invested
in a factory to make things.

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:31.990 align:middle line:10%
It's wealth investing
in wealth to see

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.670 align:middle line:10%
if it can make money in return.

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:35.960 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Why do they need more?

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS:
Capitalism needs more.

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:41.300 align:middle line:84%
If it stops, then
it just stagnates.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.480 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happens.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see massive
economic collapse.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why can't
they take care

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.700 align:middle line:84%
of these billions of people
who are living on $3 a day

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:51.510 align:middle line:90%
that you've said?

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Well, that's
a pretty good question.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.120 align:middle line:90%
Why can't that?

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:54.850 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They could,
couldn't they?

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:55.808 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: Absolutely.

00:21:55.808 --> 00:21:57.220 align:middle line:10%
We could restructure the world.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:58.236 align:middle line:10%
Everybody could be fed.

00:21:58.236 --> 00:22:00.110 align:middle line:10%
Everybody could have a
place to eat and live.

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:04.630 align:middle line:10%
Everybody could be engaged
in gainful, good activities.

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And wealth could,
in fact, be shared

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.827 align:middle line:90%
in a much more democratic way.

00:22:07.827 --> 00:22:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: That's
called democracy.

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:10.970 align:middle line:90%
It's called grassroots power.

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:12.950 align:middle line:84%
It's called people
making decisions

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:14.610 align:middle line:90%
at the lowest possible level.

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When I look at a
person sleeping on a bus bench

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:24.630 align:middle line:84%
because he or she has no place
to live or go, in this country,

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:27.630 align:middle line:84%
with the kind of wealth we have,
Peter, it's appalling to me.

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:28.902 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: It's a sin.

00:22:28.902 --> 00:22:32.530 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm a Catholic kid,
and I think about it that way.

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:33.330 align:middle line:90%
It's sinful.

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:34.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: And I mean,
that's just morally wrong.

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And as a sociologist, we
can study how this happens.

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:46.450 align:middle line:84%
People make bad decisions,
and they end up in bad ways.

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:47.692 align:middle line:90%
But it's structural.

00:22:47.692 --> 00:22:49.900 align:middle line:84%
There's not enough jobs for
everybody in this country

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:51.670 align:middle line:90%
or anywhere in the world.

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And the pay-- they give
them a salary to live on.

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:55.790 align:middle line:90%
So how are people going to live?

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Build them facilities
that they can sleep in.

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:00.770 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: Absolutely.

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:02.955 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Doesn't have
to be the Taj Mahal,

00:23:02.955 --> 00:23:03.830 align:middle line:10%
but create something.

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:06.730 align:middle line:84%
But where are
presidential candidates

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:09.530 align:middle line:84%
talking about things like that,
that really affect people?

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:11.590 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Presidential
candidates all

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:14.450 align:middle line:84%
work for the transnational
capitalist class,

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:17.112 align:middle line:90%
or they are respectful to that.

00:23:17.112 --> 00:23:19.570 align:middle line:84%
So when Hilary says that she
goes to the Council on Foreign

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Relations to get advice on the
State Department, she means it,

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:24.510 align:middle line:90%
she does.

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:27.440 align:middle line:84%
CFR is the adviser to
the State Department.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And because these organizations
and capital wealth

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:37.680 align:middle line:84%
is able to communicate, through
these various organizations,

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.700 align:middle line:84%
what their needs are, what
their policy should be,

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.940 align:middle line:90%
then, states will act on that.

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:45.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Peter, you've
mentioned the Trilateral

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:45.700 align:middle line:90%
Commission.

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.241 align:middle line:84%
I want to look at a video first,
and we can talk a little bit

00:23:48.241 --> 00:23:49.120 align:middle line:90%
about who they are.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.170 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:53.940 align:middle line:10%
>>According to their website,
the Trilateral Commission

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:58.320 align:middle line:10%
was founded in 1973, bringing
private sector leaders together

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.130 align:middle line:10%
to discuss global issues.

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:03.450 align:middle line:84%
This organization filled a
crucial gap in communication

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:06.150 align:middle line:84%
between Europe, North
America, and Asia.

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Originally, the founders
envisioned a need

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:12.280 align:middle line:84%
for closer cooperation in an era
of increasing interdependence

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.960 align:middle line:84%
as the US lost some
of its old influence.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays, the common term for
this sort of interdependence

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:19.330 align:middle line:90%
is "globalization."

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:22.800 align:middle line:84%
The group has three chairman
positions, one for each region.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.120 align:middle line:84%
The Trilateral Commission
is a small group,

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.430 align:middle line:90%
with around 390 members.

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:29.970 align:middle line:84%
So why do conspiracy
theorists think the group

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:31.930 align:middle line:90%
wants to take over the world?

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:33.460 align:middle line:90%
Here's where it gets crazy.

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:36.340 align:middle line:10%
According to conspiracy
theorists like Alex Jones,

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.340 align:middle line:10%
the Trilateral
Commission is attempting

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:40.330 align:middle line:10%
to create a
one-world government.

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:42.500 align:middle line:10%
Other groups such
as the Bilderbergers

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.370 align:middle line:10%
have also been accused of
pursuing similar goals.

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:47.940 align:middle line:10%
Jones isn't the only
one who believes this.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:51.210 align:middle line:10%
Several US politicians,
including Barry Goldwater,

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:54.110 align:middle line:10%
also believe the Trilateral
Commission is an attempt

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:56.250 align:middle line:10%
to consolidate
power and influence

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:59.030 align:middle line:10%
outside of the traditional
political structure,

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:03.700 align:middle line:10%
ultimately, with the goal
of overpowering governments.

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:06.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what about that
push for a one-world government?

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.130 align:middle line:84%
Is that part of
their agenda, Peter?

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:10.930 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: No, it's not.

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:15.910 align:middle line:84%
Their agenda is primarily to
protect capitalism worldwide.

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Militarily, that
happens, but they're not

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:24.230 align:middle line:84%
pushing for a UN, United
Nations one-world government.

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:25.770 align:middle line:90%
They don't need to.

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:29.139 align:middle line:84%
Governments cooperate
with them now.

00:25:29.139 --> 00:25:30.680 align:middle line:84%
If they don't
cooperate, then they'll

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.810 align:middle line:84%
get rid of the leaders
that are there.

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And where there's resistance,
like in Venezuela, or in Cuba,

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:39.490 align:middle line:84%
or certainly in China, or
North Korea, and other places,

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:42.084 align:middle line:84%
they're doing everything they
can to undermine those states.

00:25:42.084 --> 00:25:43.750 align:middle line:84%
But the rest of the
states in the world,

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:46.000 align:middle line:84%
pretty much, the elites
in those countries

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.820 align:middle line:90%
go along with the agenda.

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:50.640 align:middle line:84%
So they don't need
to replace them.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.270 align:middle line:10%
So it's sort of
like nation-states

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:57.750 align:middle line:10%
become population containment
zones for people in the world.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:00.980 align:middle line:10%
And then they're
utilized as labor forces

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.054 align:middle line:10%
at the lowest possible
salary levels.

00:26:03.054 --> 00:26:04.470 align:middle line:10%
So that's where
our companies will

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:08.150 align:middle line:10%
go around and make your
boxing shorts at the cheapest

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:09.160 align:middle line:10%
place they can.

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they love
doing that, don't they?

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:11.881 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: And they
love doing that.

00:26:11.881 --> 00:26:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And it helps them expand, but
it undermines working people

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:18.620 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Peter, what was it
that was the catalyst for this?

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:26.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was a time that
we here, in the United States,

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.520 align:middle line:84%
produced most of the
steel on the planet.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.820 align:middle line:84%
There was a time that we have
factories up and running,

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:34.360 align:middle line:90%
flourishing.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.120 align:middle line:90%
Most of them are gone now.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Now we get our steel from
China, and we get our goods out

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:40.930 align:middle line:90%
of Mexico and China.

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:41.850 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:42.840 align:middle line:90%
How did this happen?

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.770 align:middle line:84%
It just seems like it
collapsed overnight.

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:47.460 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Well,
part of it was where

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:50.609 align:middle line:84%
the new steel plants the
Japanese and the Chinese built

00:26:50.609 --> 00:26:52.150 align:middle line:84%
were more efficient
than ones we had.

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:53.760 align:middle line:90%
Ours were old.

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:58.010 align:middle line:90%
But the world is globalized now.

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:02.780 align:middle line:84%
So capital is everywhere in the
world, including even China.

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:06.010 align:middle line:84%
Their billionaires invest
in our capitalist system.

00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:08.610 align:middle line:84%
They put their
money in our banks.

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:11.645 align:middle line:90%
So it's transnational.

00:27:11.645 --> 00:27:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's managed by these
few thousand people that are

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.520 align:middle line:90%
in every country in the world.

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And so wherever steel
gets made or whatever,

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:24.675 align:middle line:84%
yeah, from a state perspective,
a working perspective,

00:27:24.675 --> 00:27:26.341 align:middle line:84%
we still think, oh,
in the United State,

00:27:26.341 --> 00:27:29.810 align:middle line:84%
we have to have this, this, and
this, and this, and all that.

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:31.410 align:middle line:84%
Those companies
don't care anymore,

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:32.850 align:middle line:90%
and capital doesn't care.

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:34.600 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Those days
are gone, aren't they?

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.266 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: They're
gone in terms of us,

00:27:36.266 --> 00:27:38.030 align:middle line:10%
the working people.

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And democracy or elections
don't change that.

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:44.000 align:middle line:84%
We have an election
to get a president in,

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.480 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't matter.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.360 align:middle line:84%
They have to go along
with that agenda.

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And if they challenge that
agenda or you challenge

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:52.792 align:middle line:84%
the deep state in
the US, you're going

00:27:52.792 --> 00:27:55.250 align:middle line:84%
to end up like John Kennedy,
and Robert Kennedy, and Martin

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:56.580 align:middle line:90%
Luther King.

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And out they go,
in one way or another.

00:27:59.130 --> 00:27:59.990 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Yeah.

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:01.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One way or another.

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:04.600 align:middle line:90%
Are these people insane?

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they've created
incredible wealth

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.510 align:middle line:90%
for themselves.

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:12.010 align:middle line:84%
They have all the
money they need.

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:15.310 align:middle line:90%
They have homes, places.

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:16.390 align:middle line:90%
They travel.

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:17.319 align:middle line:90%
They have fun.

00:28:17.319 --> 00:28:18.360 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Private jets.

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Private jets.

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:21.920 align:middle line:90%
I mean, why don't they stop?

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:23.170 align:middle line:90%
Enough is enough.

00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:24.930 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy your life.

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:26.830 align:middle line:90%
We're not here that long.

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:29.200 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: "Insane"
is a harsh word.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:31.995 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: But--

00:28:31.995 --> 00:28:34.120 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: There's something
wrong with these people.

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:37.960 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: --there's no
empathy for other human beings,

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:44.386 align:middle line:10%
a separation from-- kind of
a pathological separation--

00:28:44.386 --> 00:28:45.186 align:middle line:10%
as a human.

00:28:45.186 --> 00:28:46.900 align:middle line:84%
You're not a human
being, really.

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:49.640 align:middle line:90%


00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.522 align:middle line:90%
There's a sickness.

00:28:50.522 --> 00:28:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There is a sickness.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Yes.

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's no
doubt about that.

00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And they're all in that
sickness, as a group.

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: They're caught
up in that sickness.

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.704 align:middle line:84%
And they think, well, I
can't do anything about it.

00:29:02.704 --> 00:29:04.740 align:middle line:90%
I can't change it.

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And they will have to
change it, or we're

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:10.610 align:middle line:84%
going to collapse economically
and/or environmentally

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:13.397 align:middle line:84%
within our younger
generation's lifetime.

00:29:13.397 --> 00:29:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the planet is
already busting at the seams.

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:16.530 align:middle line:90%
You can feel it.

00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think social
network has contributed

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:24.240 align:middle line:84%
to that, where the average
person now has a voice where

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.210 align:middle line:90%
they never did before.

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Well,
they can, but they're

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:32.520 align:middle line:84%
countered by corporate
media in a very big way.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:36.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're talking about six
major corporations now, almost,

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:38.350 align:middle line:84%
in the world, but
certainly in the US,

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:39.621 align:middle line:90%
that are our corporate world.

00:29:39.621 --> 00:29:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And they're part
of the power elite.

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:44.690 align:middle line:84%
They're part of the
transnational class.

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:47.350 align:middle line:84%
A major part of their
content is put together

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:52.600 align:middle line:84%
by public relations and
propaganda firms, like 80%.

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:57.546 align:middle line:84%
And these big firms, WPP,
Omnicom, and Interpublic Group,

00:29:57.546 --> 00:29:59.420 align:middle line:84%
they employ a couple
hundred thousand people.

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:01.990 align:middle line:84%
They do $35 trillion
worth of wealth.

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:05.169 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that are
putting advertisements out.

00:30:05.169 --> 00:30:07.210 align:middle line:84%
But they also work for
the International Monetary

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:09.490 align:middle line:90%
Fund, the World Bank.

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:12.950 align:middle line:84%
They do the ads for the Navy,
and the Marines, and everyone

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:13.750 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:18.270 align:middle line:84%
If you've seen that ad,
it's from-- it was entitled

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:20.810 align:middle line:90%
"America's Navy, The Shield."

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:23.930 align:middle line:10%
And it came out first
during the Army-Navy game.

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:25.260 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And it was slick.

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:26.230 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: Very slick.

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:28.410 align:middle line:10%
And it's this family in
the middle of the street,

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:30.190 align:middle line:10%
and a cute little girl.

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:32.850 align:middle line:10%
And then there's surrounded
by all the different people

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:34.767 align:middle line:10%
in the Navy, and the
Marines, and women.

00:30:34.767 --> 00:30:36.350 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And you
feel safe and secure.

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:37.355 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: Feel
safe and secure.

00:30:37.355 --> 00:30:38.470 align:middle line:10%
It keeps running.

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:39.690 align:middle line:10%
That's a propaganda film.

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:41.140 align:middle line:10%
There's nothing else about it.

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:46.040 align:middle line:10%
It's that the national
security state is protecting us

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:48.049 align:middle line:10%
from them, the bad people.

00:30:48.049 --> 00:30:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, they probably
got the idea from Goebbels

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:52.380 align:middle line:84%
in Nazi Germany,
because that's all

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:55.075 align:middle line:84%
they did was come up
with propaganda films.

00:30:55.075 --> 00:30:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: They had
plenty of it then,

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:59.340 align:middle line:90%
but they're more subtle now.

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And so you have these massive
public relations and propaganda

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:05.014 align:middle line:84%
film that are interwoven
with government.

00:31:05.014 --> 00:31:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And they're the ones doing all
the advertising for product

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:09.320 align:middle line:90%
management and stuff like that.

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Our new study
coming out this year

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:12.870 align:middle line:84%
is going to-- we looked
at all their clients.

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:14.190 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's just amazing.

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:16.770 align:middle line:84%
Any supermarket you walk
into, everything there

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:19.360 align:middle line:84%
is managed by one of those three
firms in terms of their PR.

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.450 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And how to do
it, placement, everything.

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:22.190 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: Everything.

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:23.110 align:middle line:10%
It's just huge.

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:26.420 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They know human
psychology, don't they?

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:27.890 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Yeah, very much so.

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And so they're in service to the
transnational capitalist class,

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:35.000 align:middle line:90%
as are mercenary companies.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:44.820 align:middle line:84%
The second largest employer in
the world is WG4-- sorry, G4S.

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:48.450 align:middle line:90%
They employ 600,000 people.

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:49.790 align:middle line:90%
They're a securities firm.

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:51.590 align:middle line:90%
They're a mercenary company.

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:53.240 align:middle line:90%
They're based in Great Britain.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:56.030 align:middle line:84%
But they manage some
of our prisons here.

00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:57.510 align:middle line:90%
They do training of police.

00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:58.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:00.280 align:middle line:90%
Nice contracts, huh?

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: They're
a huge version

00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:02.950 align:middle line:84%
of-- well, a lot of
people know Blackwater,

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:04.950 align:middle line:90%
which is now Constellis.

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:07.842 align:middle line:84%
Triple Canopy, they
merged after the Iraq War.

00:32:07.842 --> 00:32:09.800 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
private mercenary companies

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.360 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:16.090 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, they are
the police for states,

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:16.890 align:middle line:90%
like Honduras.

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if they want
you to disrupt the nation,

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:20.840 align:middle line:90%
they hire them.

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: They hire them
to protect themselves.

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:27.200 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, if you're
incredibly wealthy,

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.810 align:middle line:84%
you can hire people
to protect you.

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:31.200 align:middle line:84%
You can create your
own green zone,

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:37.880 align:middle line:84%
and literally separate yourself
from the rest of the world.

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:43.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dwight Eisenhower, when
he left office back in 1961,

00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:46.000 align:middle line:84%
of course, when he
turned the gauntlet over

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.330 align:middle line:84%
to John F. Kennedy, warned us
about the military-industrial

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:51.130 align:middle line:90%
complex.

00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:52.805 align:middle line:90%


00:32:52.805 --> 00:32:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DWIGHT EISENHOWER:
We have been

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:56.560 align:middle line:84%
compelled to create
a permanent armaments

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:59.620 align:middle line:90%
industry of vast proportions.

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Added to this, 3 and 1/2
million men and women

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:07.730 align:middle line:84%
are directly engaged in
the defense establishment.

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:10.820 align:middle line:84%
We annually spend,
on military security

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:15.770 align:middle line:84%
alone, more than the net
income of all United States

00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:17.990 align:middle line:90%
corporations.

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, this conjunction of an
immense military establishment

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:26.910 align:middle line:84%
and a large arms industry is
new in the American experience.

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:32.170 align:middle line:84%
The total influence, economic,
political, even spiritual,

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:35.980 align:middle line:84%
is felt in every city, every
state house, every office

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:38.210 align:middle line:90%
of the federal government.

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:41.890 align:middle line:84%
We recognize the imperative
need for this development,

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:44.630 align:middle line:84%
yet we must not
fail to comprehend

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:47.130 align:middle line:90%
its grave implications.

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:51.680 align:middle line:84%
Our toil, resources, and
livelihood are all involved.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:55.430 align:middle line:84%
So in the very structure
of our society.

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:57.360 align:middle line:84%
In the councils
of government, we

00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:00.320 align:middle line:84%
must guard against
the acquisition

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:03.990 align:middle line:84%
of unwarranted influence,
whether sought or unsought,

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:07.640 align:middle line:84%
by the military-industrial
complex.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.969 align:middle line:84%
The potential for the disastrous
rise of misplaced power

00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:14.230 align:middle line:90%
exists and will persist.

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:16.699 align:middle line:84%
We must never let the
weight of this combination

00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:21.069 align:middle line:84%
endanger our liberties
or democratic processes.

00:34:21.069 --> 00:34:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't that
incredible coming

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:27.065 align:middle line:84%
from a person who was a
general during World War II?

00:34:27.065 --> 00:34:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: It was an
amazing statement, certainly,

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:33.130 align:middle line:84%
at the time, and of course,
has manifested itself

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:37.570 align:middle line:84%
as being true or
even beyond that now.

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:41.339 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think we
took it seriously enough.

00:34:41.339 --> 00:34:42.139 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: The next president
did, and paid with it

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.115 align:middle line:90%
for his life.

00:34:47.115 --> 00:34:50.139 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, no
question about that.

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:53.960 align:middle line:84%
At this point today, if you
listen to Eisenhower's words

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:58.360 align:middle line:84%
and apply it to what's
going on now, he was right.

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.256 align:middle line:90%
He was right on, wasn't he?

00:35:00.256 --> 00:35:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Well, he was right--
certainly, yeah, under Truman,

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.990 align:middle line:84%
the National Security
Act was passed

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:07.860 align:middle line:84%
that created the CIA,
which is kind of an OSS.

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:10.530 align:middle line:84%
The Dulles brothers
were involved.

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:15.690 align:middle line:84%
They were pretty much running
State and the CIA together.

00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:17.890 align:middle line:84%
So they were there
the deep state.

00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:20.050 align:middle line:90%
They were the ones pushing it.

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:23.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's no accident that
Dulles ran the commission

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:29.580 align:middle line:84%
after Kennedy was assassination,
the investigation, so to speak.

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:32.020 align:middle line:84%
So they were very powerful
people at that time.

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And they worked directly
for major corporations

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:36.460 align:middle line:84%
of the world, and
brought about coups

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:41.280 align:middle line:84%
in Guatemala and other
places, certainly, in Iran.

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:45.345 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did Kennedy have
to go according to them?

00:35:45.345 --> 00:35:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Definitely,
I think he did.

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Because he was
challenging the CIA.

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:52.060 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't going to go
along with a global war

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.880 align:middle line:90%
process of expanding military.

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And he was seriously
thinking about getting out

00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:01.050 align:middle line:84%
of and diminishing our
involvement in Vietnam.

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:05.250 align:middle line:90%
So that was a strong counter.

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:08.385 align:middle line:84%
But he particularly wanted
to dismantle the CIA.

00:36:08.385 --> 00:36:11.750 align:middle line:84%
He thought that they were a
threat to American freedoms.

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:12.940 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: He was right.

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:14.560 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: He was very right.

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.085 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And he paid for it.

00:36:16.085 --> 00:36:17.280 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: He paid for it.

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:17.780 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And his
brother paid for it.

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:19.988 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: His brother paid
for it, yes, absolutely.

00:36:19.988 --> 00:36:23.610 align:middle line:10%
David Talbot's work on
that, "The Brothers,"

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:25.440 align:middle line:10%
I have my students read
that in my classes,

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:26.942 align:middle line:10%
and it's an amazing work.

00:36:26.942 --> 00:36:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, David's been a
guest on the "Coast to Coast"

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.200 align:middle line:90%
radio show.

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.640 align:middle line:90%
He's a great person.

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:33.097 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: He's a good scholar.

00:36:33.097 --> 00:36:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So where do
we go from here, Peter?

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:35.950 align:middle line:90%
What happens next?

00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:37.325 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Well,
it's inevitable

00:36:37.325 --> 00:36:40.180 align:middle line:84%
that democracy movements
are going to continue

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:42.680 align:middle line:90%
to arise all over the world.

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.280 align:middle line:84%
It's inevitable
that capital will

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.639 align:middle line:84%
become so concentrated
that they're not

00:36:46.639 --> 00:36:47.680 align:middle line:90%
going to have some place.

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:50.640 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to see
continuing economic crises.

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.640 align:middle line:90%
So they're speculating.

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.380 align:middle line:84%
There's bubbles
all over the place

00:36:55.380 --> 00:37:00.420 align:middle line:84%
in terms of various commodities,
or land, or water, or whatever.

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:02.480 align:middle line:90%
Those are not sustainable.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:05.040 align:middle line:84%
So there's going to be
continuing economic unrest

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.484 align:middle line:90%
in a variety of ways.

00:37:06.484 --> 00:37:08.900 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be harder and
harder for, like, young people

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:13.810 align:middle line:84%
today to get jobs that will get
them out of their college debt,

00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:16.890 align:middle line:84%
and have them be able to buy
a home, and have a family.

00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:18.240 align:middle line:90%
It's just not going to happen.

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:21.782 align:middle line:84%
And these are people
that have expectations

00:37:21.782 --> 00:37:25.320 align:middle line:84%
of being able to have a
working middle class life.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And when your frustrations
are blocked like that,

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:32.390 align:middle line:84%
you're far more
likely to resist.

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And our research
on revolutions show

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:39.330 align:middle line:84%
that you're far more likely to
resist than the poorest people

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:40.960 align:middle line:84%
just uprising, unless
they're starving.

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:43.760 align:middle line:90%


00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.030 align:middle line:90%
There are food riots.

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:49.550 align:middle line:84%
But the resistance and
organized resistance

00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:52.890 align:middle line:84%
usually comes from
frustrated working class

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:53.730 align:middle line:90%
numbers of people.

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:55.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will we
get to that point,

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.070 align:middle line:90%
that frustrated working class?

00:37:57.070 --> 00:37:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: I think
it's inevitable.

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.610 align:middle line:84%
We're already
seeing it manifested

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:04.400 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the extremes
that are being voted for

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.700 align:middle line:90%
or pushing in this election.

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:10.200 align:middle line:84%
Both Democrat and Republican
Party, the traditions

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.330 align:middle line:84%
are hard to have
been maintained.

00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:16.730 align:middle line:84%
Trump is outside of those
traditions, as was Bernie.

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:18.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So is there
hope for people?

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.230 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Oh, I think so.

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:23.210 align:middle line:84%
I really believe in
democratic movements.

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And the people should need
to speak out and address it.

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think scholars have
to do this kind of work

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:33.330 align:middle line:84%
and really allow people to
understand what's happening.

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And we have to look
at it as global.

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:38.630 align:middle line:84%
It's not just here in
the US, it's national.

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And then we have to be
very suspicious of things

00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:44.615 align:middle line:84%
like, oh, we have to
have a war on terror.

00:38:44.615 --> 00:38:47.660 align:middle line:84%
The war on terror
is a fraud, and it

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:50.430 align:middle line:90%
has been from the beginning.

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:54.690 align:middle line:90%
And the war on drugs is a fraud.

00:38:54.690 --> 00:39:00.020 align:middle line:10%
Capital is invested in both of
those and benefits from them.

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:01.150 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They want terror.

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:02.370 align:middle line:10%
They have to have terror.

00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:06.380 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: It helps maintain
the expanded military empire--

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:07.780 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:09.640 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: --and the
spending in that area,

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.620 align:middle line:10%
so companies make
huge amounts of money.

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And the privatization
of war-- so

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:16.390 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing not
only privatization

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:20.310 align:middle line:84%
inside the military,
but privatization

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:24.280 align:middle line:84%
of mercenary forces that
can conduct war themselves.

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:27.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always
suspected that ISIS

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:31.830 align:middle line:90%
was financed by the complex.

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:32.970 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: It was.

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And the Saudis were
involved in that.

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And they opened up their
prisoners are said,

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:37.220 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
go fight in Syria,

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:37.550 align:middle line:90%
or we're going to execute you.

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:39.925 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's why they don't
have any problems in Saudi

00:39:39.925 --> 00:39:40.830 align:middle line:90%
Arabia, right?

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:43.320 align:middle line:84%
They pay them not
to do anything here.

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: And they
were funneling money

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:50.580 align:middle line:84%
into Afghanistan, as was
the CIA and Pakistan ISI.

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why, Peter, some of
these areas in the Middle East,

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:56.520 align:middle line:84%
like Bahrain,
Kuwait, the Emirates,

00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:00.550 align:middle line:84%
Saudi Arabia go
untouched with terrorism.

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Because these people
are being bought off

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:05.054 align:middle line:84%
to stay away from those
countries, aren't they?

00:40:05.054 --> 00:40:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: And they're
military states.

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:10.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you mess around
too much, you're gone.

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And they're allies of
the United States empire.

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:14.719 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:40:14.719 --> 00:40:16.260 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: And it's
about resources.

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:17.060 align:middle line:90%
It's about oil.

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:21.680 align:middle line:84%
It's about global resources
in that, and control of that.

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:25.310 align:middle line:84%
But it's also about
having zero resistance

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:28.504 align:middle line:84%
to the free flow of capital
anywhere in the world.

00:40:28.504 --> 00:40:30.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what
neoliberalism means.

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:32.310 align:middle line:90%
That's what the TPP's about.

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:35.835 align:middle line:84%
That's what NAFTA was about,
is free flow of capital.

00:40:35.835 --> 00:40:39.477 align:middle line:84%
It's restrictions on people, but
free flow of capital worldwide.

00:40:39.477 --> 00:40:41.810 align:middle line:84%
But when you have these wars,
and millions of people are

00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:45.790 align:middle line:84%
at unrest-- or in Iraq, as
we did, we created, like,

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:47.150 align:middle line:90%
5 million refugees--

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:48.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, instantly.

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: --of various
source, we killed a million

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:51.080 align:middle line:90%
and a half people.

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:51.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very sad.

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:52.790 align:middle line:90%
Very sad.

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:54.535 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel like,
knowing what you know,

00:40:54.535 --> 00:40:56.410 align:middle line:84%
you want to just stick
your head in the sand?

00:40:56.410 --> 00:41:00.030 align:middle line:84%
Is this something that you would
do just to have this go away

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:01.870 align:middle line:90%
and pretend it doesn't exist?

00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:03.600 align:middle line:10%
Or do you continue
to fight and let

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:05.480 align:middle line:10%
the word-- get the word out?

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:08.500 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: Well, I love
to kick liberal ostriches.

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:10.515 align:middle line:10%
I like to kick
them and have them

00:41:10.515 --> 00:41:11.890 align:middle line:10%
pull their heads
out of the sand,

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:13.830 align:middle line:10%
because that's
what we have to do.

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:17.940 align:middle line:10%
And there's no hiding from this.

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:22.530 align:middle line:84%
It's affecting our weather,
our way of life, our incomes.

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:26.340 align:middle line:84%
It threatens
long-term investments.

00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:27.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm a college professor.

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:30.130 align:middle line:84%
I'll have a retirement
through CalPERS,

00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:33.550 align:middle line:84%
but CalPERS is
invested in the market.

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:36.870 align:middle line:90%
So it impacts all of our lives.

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And the only way to
really address this

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:44.210 align:middle line:84%
is to democratic-- full
transparency, no censorship,

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:48.480 align:middle line:84%
news from the bottom up, and
truth telling as a way of life.

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.360 align:middle line:84%
We have a truth
emergency in the world.

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will we always live
in fear, or can we stop this?

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: I think
we can stop it.

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:01.704 align:middle line:84%
The power elites are
the one living in fear.

00:42:01.704 --> 00:42:02.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You think so?

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.494 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: They're
communicating fear to us.

00:42:04.494 --> 00:42:08.074 align:middle line:10%
They're trying to make us
afraid of different things.

00:42:08.074 --> 00:42:11.990 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Have they
created that fear?

00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:13.640 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: Yeah,
they really do.

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:17.480 align:middle line:10%
It's like, we grew up in a time
when the nuclear bombs could

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:18.800 align:middle line:10%
hit us at any time, right?

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.874 align:middle line:10%
And it was fearful.

00:42:20.874 --> 00:42:22.290 align:middle line:84%
What would I do
if the bombs came?

00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:27.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're actually closer
to using nuclear weapons today

00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:29.860 align:middle line:90%
than we were in the Cold War.

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:33.080 align:middle line:84%
Obama put a trillion dollars
into upgrading the nukes

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:35.400 align:middle line:84%
and created these
little mini-nukes

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:37.860 align:middle line:84%
so you can take out three
blocks instead of entire cities.

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:39.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Instead of this
whole whole city, yeah.

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:41.010 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Yeah.

00:42:41.010 --> 00:42:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And that makes them more viable
to be used, and that's sick.

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:46.620 align:middle line:90%
That's really--

00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what would you say
to a family raising children

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:54.410 align:middle line:90%
right now about their future?

00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:57.610 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Become involved.

00:42:57.610 --> 00:43:00.900 align:middle line:10%
Stand on the principles
that you believe in,

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:04.470 align:middle line:10%
your own moral values, your
own belief in democracy.

00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:05.690 align:middle line:10%
People believe in democracy.

00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:09.050 align:middle line:10%
They believe we have
one, which we don't.

00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:10.790 align:middle line:84%
But they don't
understand how elites,

00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:14.280 align:middle line:84%
and how the transnational
class, and global money

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:16.580 align:middle line:84%
controls their lives in
so many different ways

00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:18.200 align:middle line:90%
and how concentrated it is.

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:21.580 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What can they
do, the individual?

00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:22.380 align:middle line:10%
Anything?

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:24.670 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Build
your own security.

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:29.421 align:middle line:84%
Mobilize with neighbors in
terms of support and economics.

00:43:29.421 --> 00:43:30.976 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's got to be bottom up.

00:43:30.976 --> 00:43:32.100 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And don't give up.

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:33.280 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: And don't give up.

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.130 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Peter, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:35.410 align:middle line:10%
Appreciate it.

00:43:35.410 --> 00:43:36.785 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: I'm
happy to be here.

00:43:36.785 --> 00:43:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You heard
it, don't give up.

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:42.420 align:middle line:84%
We can't say much more than
that, because it's out there.

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:46.880 align:middle line:10%
The elitists are out there doing
what they're doing to control,

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.300 align:middle line:10%
and you need to be
able to fight back.

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:51.270 align:middle line:10%
But do it in the smart way.

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:52.180 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:54.390 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
