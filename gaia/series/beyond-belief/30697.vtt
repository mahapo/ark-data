>> [BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.129 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.774 align:middle line:84%
>> People are basically going
keep on to help uncover what

00:00:19.774 --> 00:00:20.440 align:middle line:90%
really happened.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>> We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.595 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:26.595 --> 00:00:32.680 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.300 align:middle line:84%

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.577 align:middle line:90%
with George Noory.

00:00:40.577 --> 00:00:42.660 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, since I was a little
boy I was just frightened

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.040 align:middle line:90%
by stories of witches.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.440 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, when I
watched "The Wizard of Oz"

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and saw the Wicked Witch, it
just scared the heck out of me.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're going to be
someone in a moment who

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.510 align:middle line:90%
is not the stereotypical witch.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:07.210 align:middle line:84%
She's an author, actress, rock
musician, pilot, sky jumper,

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.470 align:middle line:90%
and a witch.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.200 align:middle line:90%
Welcome Fiona Horne.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.912 align:middle line:90%
Fiona.

[APPLAUSE]

00:01:11.412 --> 00:01:13.245 align:middle line:90%
>> FIONA HORNE: Hey.

00:01:13.245 --> 00:01:14.370 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Hey, how are you?

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.494 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: George, I'm good.

00:01:15.494 --> 00:01:16.275 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you.

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:18.425 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You can cast
a spell on me anytime.

00:01:18.425 --> 00:01:19.610 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Oh, God bless.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.450 align:middle line:90%
Goddess bless, even.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.380 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What's new?

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.629 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: I'm, well, I'm good.

00:01:22.629 --> 00:01:24.420 align:middle line:84%
I've got-- I'm busy,
I've got books out.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.495 align:middle line:90%
I've got things going on.

00:01:25.495 --> 00:01:28.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm flying planes
instead of broomsticks

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.832 align:middle line:84%
now, which is a lot
more comfortable.

00:01:29.832 --> 00:01:30.790 align:middle line:90%
A bit more complicated.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.073 align:middle line:84%
A plane has a few
more things you've

00:01:32.073 --> 00:01:33.150 align:middle line:84%
got to do on it, rather
than a broomstick.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.233 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I actually thought
you were going to fly

00:01:35.233 --> 00:01:36.480 align:middle line:90%
in on a broom.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.169 align:middle line:84%
Why do people think
that about witches?

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:40.210 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Oh, I think
there's lot of stereotypes,

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.918 align:middle line:84%
and lots of misconceptions
about witches.

00:01:41.918 --> 00:01:43.325 align:middle line:90%
But a lot it's really good fun.

00:01:43.325 --> 00:01:45.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's fun-- I mean,
there's that "Wizard of Oz"

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.170 align:middle line:84%
movie out now, with that
awesome poster of the witch,

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.470 align:middle line:90%
and everything, you know.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.260 align:middle line:84%
I love the entertainment
aspect of witches

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.850 align:middle line:84%
and that sort of
imagery of them.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.940 align:middle line:84%
But if you approach witchcraft
as a modern spiritual path,

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.260 align:middle line:90%
well then, it's very different.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's not about warts on your
noses and bats and craziness.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a very rewarding
spiritual path.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.570 align:middle line:84%
It really is enhancing
a lot of people's lives

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.699 align:middle line:90%
right now-- men and women.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I don't see
any warts on your nose.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.565 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: No,
there was a pimple,

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:14.120 align:middle line:84%
but Susan took care of
that in the makeup room.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.350 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I love it.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: So Susan's awesome.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How did you get
interested in witchcraft?

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you weren't
born a witch, were you?

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.141 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: It's funny, that's
the very first line in the first

00:02:23.141 --> 00:02:24.540 align:middle line:90%
book I wrote about witchcraft.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.740 align:middle line:84%
I say, some say you
have to be born a witch,

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.420 align:middle line:84%
but I actually think
you can become one.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.400 align:middle line:84%
All you need is a
passion for nature,

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.190 align:middle line:84%
and an understanding
that nature is sacred,

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.630 align:middle line:84%
and we're part of an amazing
biological world that we

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.070 align:middle line:84%
can honor and consider
empowering in our lives.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And also understanding
that there

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.580 align:middle line:84%
can be a goddess
as well as a god.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.810 align:middle line:84%
There's a dualistic
principle of divinity.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And you know, a little-- a
healthy interest in spells

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.564 align:middle line:84%
and rituals doesn't
hurt, you know,

00:02:55.564 --> 00:02:56.980 align:middle line:84%
because that's
part of what we do.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And then there's also
aspects of divination.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:59.995 align:middle line:90%
Like I read tarot cards.

00:02:59.995 --> 00:03:02.232 align:middle line:84%
I've read cards for over a
quarter of a century now.

00:03:02.232 --> 00:03:03.190 align:middle line:90%
I've got the same deck.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.070 align:middle line:90%
I still use it.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.580 align:middle line:84%
But I think, when you say,
how did I sort of get into it,

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.200 align:middle line:84%
I was a teenager growing up in
a Catholic environment, very

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.720 align:middle line:90%
strict Catholic environment.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.040 align:middle line:90%
And I looked for alternatives.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
maybe find out what

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.060 align:middle line:84%
came before there were
Catholics in the world.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I
stumbled upon paganism

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.794 align:middle line:84%
and the spiritual
practices of the Celts

00:03:22.794 --> 00:03:25.946 align:middle line:84%
and the Teutonic tribes
of northern Europe.

00:03:25.946 --> 00:03:27.070 align:middle line:90%
And it all came from there.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.160 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why do people
think, if you're witch,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.600 align:middle line:90%
you believe in Satan?

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.380 align:middle line:90%
You're a devil worshiper?

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.460 align:middle line:84%
They really don't
understand the difference.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Well, I think people
are increasingly understanding

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.560 align:middle line:84%
the difference, because putting
it really simplistically,

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.705 align:middle line:84%
if you are going to believe
in the devil and Satan,

00:03:44.705 --> 00:03:46.190 align:middle line:90%
then you've got to be Christian.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.260 align:middle line:90%
And we're not.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.165 align:middle line:90%
So that takes care of that.

00:03:49.165 --> 00:03:49.790 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Good.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.248 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: It doesn't
have-- I mean,

00:03:51.248 --> 00:03:54.330 align:middle line:84%
I think the idea of
paganism being that it was

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.690 align:middle line:84%
pre-Christian, when the
Christian faith established

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.860 align:middle line:84%
itself as a dominant, I guess,
religious mindset in the world,

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.060 align:middle line:84%
particularly the Western world,
then what came before it had

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.870 align:middle line:90%
to be evil and debased.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And so that sort of threw
paganism into that bracket.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And then we even have an
image of a god concept.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.670 align:middle line:84%
I call it that,
because the way I

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.130 align:middle line:84%
experienced the craft
is the god/goddess.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.620 align:middle line:84%
However you kind of believe
it manifests and speaks

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.390 align:middle line:84%
most potently to
you in your life.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.680 align:middle line:84%
But we have the pagan god,
Lord of the Forest, Pan.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.680 align:middle line:90%
He's a horned god.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.434 align:middle line:90%
He's got horns.

00:04:29.434 --> 00:04:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And half of his
body is an animal.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's more
metaphorical than literal.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.370 align:middle line:84%
But that's where it was kind
of-- that image of Satan

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.310 align:middle line:84%
came from that image
of the horned god that

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.510 align:middle line:90%
came before Christianity.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.180 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's all
about education.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.440 align:middle line:84%
I feel privileged that I've been
able to write a number of books

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.300 align:middle line:84%
about the craft over
the last 20 years.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.160 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I've been
published since 1997.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.720 align:middle line:90%
So it's been awhile.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And having that
opportunity to dispel

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.350 align:middle line:84%
those negative
stereotypes and let people

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.460 align:middle line:84%
know that we're not
Satanists riding around

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.109 align:middle line:90%
on broomsticks at all, really.

00:05:02.109 --> 00:05:02.650 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: No.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:03.320 align:middle line:90%
There's a big difference.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.740 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Not at all.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.781 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Big difference.

00:05:04.781 --> 00:05:05.700 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm a believer in God, Fiona.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
the concept is yet.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe there's a little
man up there on a white cloud

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:15.880 align:middle line:90%
doing whatever he does.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.520 align:middle line:84%
But there's something
in the universe

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.100 align:middle line:90%
that controls our destiny.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.690 align:middle line:84%
There's no doubt
about it in my mind.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:23.910 align:middle line:90%
Are you a believer like that?

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.430 align:middle line:84%
Is that a little bit
of witchcraft is?

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: I'm so glad you
have asked me this question.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.465 align:middle line:84%
Being that I've been
out of the broom closet,

00:05:31.465 --> 00:05:33.840 align:middle line:84%
shall we say, in the public
eye, talking about witchcraft

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.060 align:middle line:84%
for a long time, I used to
call myself an atheist witch.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.535 align:middle line:84%
I used to say that gods and
goddesses are projections

00:05:39.535 --> 00:05:41.100 align:middle line:84%
of our consciousness,
and we don't

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.170 align:middle line:84%
have to consider them
separate from ourselves.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.420 align:middle line:84%
They are an expression
of our inner divinity.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And in order to understand
the concept of divinity,

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.240 align:middle line:84%
we kind of create these
exterior models of it.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.350 align:middle line:84%
But really, it comes
from within us.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.509 align:middle line:90%
But I have changed my mind.

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:55.800 align:middle line:90%
Which is a witch's prerogative.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.644 align:middle line:90%
It's anyone's prerogative.

00:05:57.644 --> 00:05:59.060 align:middle line:84%
I've had some
really-- I've always

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.620 align:middle line:84%
had profound
spiritual experiences.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm a very spiritual person.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm not religious, but
I am very spiritual.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And I've experienced
extraordinary paranormal

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.925 align:middle line:84%
phenomenon, and things
otherworldly an outside

00:06:09.925 --> 00:06:14.910 align:middle line:84%
of our normal realms of the five
or six senses, whatever it is.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.390 align:middle line:84%
I just in recent,
in the last year,

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.760 align:middle line:84%
really, have come to a
beautiful, peaceful acceptance

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.740 align:middle line:84%
that there is something bigger
than you, bigger than me,

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.500 align:middle line:84%
bigger than all of
us put together, that

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.000 align:middle line:84%
exists independently of us,
and of our conception of it

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.200 align:middle line:90%
and our understanding of it.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's a wise, loving,
benevolent presence.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:40.597 align:middle line:84%
And I feel my life is
incredibly enriched from this,

00:06:40.597 --> 00:06:42.930 align:middle line:84%
because from understanding
this, and just letting it be.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Like I was actually on a beach,
and I used the g-o-d word.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.050 align:middle line:84%
I didn't say goddess, I
didn't put-- I just said god.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.290 align:middle line:84%
I said, God, what would
happen if I stopped

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.260 align:middle line:84%
resisting you and
denying that you exist?

00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And as clear as day, a voice
presented itself in my head

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:02.714 align:middle line:90%
and said, well, we get to work.

00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And I had been thinking at the
time about the changes that

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.088 align:middle line:84%
were going on in my life,
big personal changes.

00:07:07.088 --> 00:07:08.590 align:middle line:90%
Lots of stuff going on.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And I had been thinking
about, how do I move forward?

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.310 align:middle line:90%
And what happens from here?

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.040 align:middle line:90%
And I felt so empty and lost.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And getting to work,
well, work was good.

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Work with something
that I could feel

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.480 align:middle line:90%
passionate and motivated about.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And it was just a
remarkable moment

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.130 align:middle line:84%
of connection and communion
with something that was bigger

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:30.410 align:middle line:90%
and that cared.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And you know, maybe people
in the audience and people

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.580 align:middle line:84%
watching at home have
experienced moments like that.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.485 align:middle line:84%
I've had moments,
but I've always

00:07:38.485 --> 00:07:40.360 align:middle line:84%
just felt like, well,
the buck stops with me.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.500 align:middle line:84%
If everything's
wrong in the world,

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.430 align:middle line:84%
that's because I
did something wrong.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.360 align:middle line:90%
And I've got to fix it.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.610 align:middle line:90%
And I was very hard on myself.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was nice to just
feel that God has my back.

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:49.070 align:middle line:90%
And I'm OK.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.310 align:middle line:90%
And everything's OK.

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.910 align:middle line:90%
And stuff happens in life.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:54.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, the sun
rises, it sets.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.250 align:middle line:90%
There are cycles everywhere.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:59.206 align:middle line:90%
There's darkness, there's light.

00:07:59.206 --> 00:08:02.350 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't have to feel so
very alone in all of that.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:03.200 align:middle line:90%
And it was lovely.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.730 align:middle line:90%
So, yes, I believe in God, too.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:07.700 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Fiona, Hollywood,
like the "Wizard of Oz"

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.380 align:middle line:84%
and so many other types of
movies and television shows,

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:15.527 align:middle line:84%
has portrayed witches
to be so darn evil.

00:08:15.527 --> 00:08:17.110 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: There's
some good ones, too.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And so ugly
and everything else.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Have they changed the perception
of people for their belief

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.734 align:middle line:90%
system of what a witch could be?

00:08:27.734 --> 00:08:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: It's an interesting
question, because, you know,

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:33.850 align:middle line:84%
I work in TV, and I put shows
together that present witches

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:36.169 align:middle line:90%
in a reality concept.

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And we try to sort of,
again, present-- I mean,

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.010 align:middle line:90%
it's-- people do bad things.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:42.330 align:middle line:90%
Not necessarily witches.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:43.549 align:middle line:90%
Christians can do bad things.

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:44.715 align:middle line:90%
Muslims going do bad things.

00:08:44.715 --> 00:08:45.690 align:middle line:90%
Jews can do bad things.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:47.680 align:middle line:84%
We can also, all of
us, can do good things.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.270 align:middle line:90%
People do bad things.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:52.940 align:middle line:84%
The entertainment
stereotype of what

00:08:52.940 --> 00:09:00.350 align:middle line:84%
a witch is, it's meant to
excite and tantalize and thrill

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:02.270 align:middle line:90%
and scare and all those things.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's good
witches portrayed, too.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.380 align:middle line:84%
But as a society,
we tend to be fed

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:12.550 align:middle line:84%
this massive diet of
destruction, war, fear.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And the producers
and people in power

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:17.906 align:middle line:84%
think that that sells more,
and so they emphasize that.

00:09:17.906 --> 00:09:20.405 align:middle line:84%
But I think, you know, that's
why something like Gaiam TV is

00:09:20.405 --> 00:09:23.777 align:middle line:84%
so exciting and beautiful,
because it's actually showing--

00:09:23.777 --> 00:09:24.610 align:middle line:90%
well, it's showing--

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:25.485 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's enlightening.

00:09:25.485 --> 00:09:26.410 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Yeah,
it's enlightening.

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:28.868 align:middle line:84%
It's showing the networks that
people actually don't always

00:09:28.868 --> 00:09:32.440 align:middle line:84%
want to watch destructive,
negative, crap on TV,

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.850 align:middle line:90%
or on the movie screens.

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:37.750 align:middle line:84%
But you know, look, I'm a
witch but I like a good scare

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:38.630 align:middle line:90%
as much as anyone.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.410 align:middle line:84%
So I'll watch a spooky
witch, for sure.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:41.640 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So I mean, what
do you do for Halloween?

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:42.765 align:middle line:90%
Do you dress up as a witch?

00:09:42.765 --> 00:09:44.723 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: I don't have
to, I'm already a witch.

00:09:44.723 --> 00:09:47.310 align:middle line:84%
I just get out the house in
my pajamas and go the day.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.390 align:middle line:90%
It's easy.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:52.380 align:middle line:84%
No, on Halloween, well, it's
funny you bring that one up,

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:56.390 align:middle line:84%
because there are special
sacred days in witchcraft.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:57.474 align:middle line:90%
And there's eight of them.

00:09:57.474 --> 00:09:58.556 align:middle line:90%
An they're called sabbats.

00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:00.390 align:middle line:84%
There's the lessor
ones the greater ones.

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:02.690 align:middle line:84%
They're spaced about six
to seven weeks apart.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Halloween, as it's
commercialized,

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.870 align:middle line:90%
is actually Samhain for us.

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And in the northern
hemisphere it's October 31st,

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:11.450 align:middle line:84%
and in the southern
hemisphere, it's

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:12.700 align:middle line:90%
the opposite time of the year.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.200 align:middle line:84%
Because really
what's important is,

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.740 align:middle line:84%
we're acknowledging that time
of we're moving into winter,

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.580 align:middle line:84%
we're moving into the
dark sleep of earth.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole story that
goes along with it, with gods

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.496 align:middle line:84%
and goddesses and
what's going on.

00:10:23.496 --> 00:10:27.869 align:middle line:84%
But in a nut shell, it's a
time to consider the role

00:10:27.869 --> 00:10:28.910 align:middle line:90%
that death plays in life.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:30.450 align:middle line:90%
A time to honor the dead.

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And we consider that
it's a great time

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:34.140 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with the dead.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And receive messages
from beyond.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a very special
time of the year for us.

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:41.449 align:middle line:84%
We would even consider
it our New Year,

00:10:41.449 --> 00:10:43.240 align:middle line:84%
because it is the
ultimate end of the year.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And at every ending
is another beginning.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, it's fun
to see all the Halloween

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:52.490 align:middle line:90%
kind of stuff going on.

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:55.069 align:middle line:84%
But to us, it's a very
sacred spiritual time.

00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:56.610 align:middle line:84%
So we'll always have
our moment where

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:58.480 align:middle line:84%
we celebrate with
like-minded people

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.355 align:middle line:90%
in a soulful and spiritual way.

00:11:00.355 --> 00:11:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And then we go out
to all the Halloween

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.700 align:middle line:84%
parades and trick-or-treat
and have fun.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Is there a coven?

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Is there a witches
coven out there?

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:07.980 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: A witches coven.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.438 align:middle line:84%
There's 100 million
witches covens.

00:11:09.438 --> 00:11:10.450 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, there are?

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:11.545 align:middle line:90%
And you all get together?

00:11:11.545 --> 00:11:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Oh,
well, that depends.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.294 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
different groups.

00:11:14.294 --> 00:11:16.750 align:middle line:84%
It's like, it's not too
dissimilar to any kind

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:21.136 align:middle line:84%
of construct where it might
be being brought up Catholic

00:11:21.136 --> 00:11:23.010 align:middle line:84%
there were different
churches we could go to,

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:24.600 align:middle line:84%
there was different
meetings and things.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.820 align:middle line:90%
People have Bible study groups.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:26.860 align:middle line:90%
All sorts of stuff like that.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:27.860 align:middle line:90%
It's not too dissimilar.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.770 align:middle line:84%
It's just groups of us
that will gather together

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:35.830 align:middle line:84%
to practice ritual, or to
learn, or to share knowledge.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:38.000 align:middle line:84%
I had a coven in Los
Angeles for a few years.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.004 align:middle line:84%
One of my books,
actually, "LA Witch"

00:11:40.004 --> 00:11:41.670 align:middle line:84%
talked about putting
that coven together

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:42.620 align:middle line:90%
and how to run a coven.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.536 align:middle line:84%
And what you could hope
to achieve having one.

00:11:44.536 --> 00:11:49.390 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, it's gathering
together to, you know,

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:53.110 align:middle line:84%
like I said, practice your
magic and do spiritual work that

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:57.654 align:middle line:84%
helps, heals, and empowers
people and yourselves and all

00:11:57.654 --> 00:11:58.320 align:middle line:90%
that good stuff.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do you have
leaders of the coven?

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: You generally
have someone that, yeah,

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.605 align:middle line:84%
there's someone that's kind
of keeping it together.

00:12:03.605 --> 00:12:05.690 align:middle line:84%
But the coven I had, the
leadership was shared.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.890 align:middle line:84%
We, each of us, took a turn at
kind of running the business.

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:11.850 align:middle line:84%
So, you know,
taking a lead in it.

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:13.840 align:middle line:90%
But it depends on the structure.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Like if there's a ritual
way you're casting circle,

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:19.140 align:middle line:84%
and you might have
someone in a role that's

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.200 align:middle line:90%
in charge of doing that.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.741 align:middle line:84%
But then someone
else might be taking

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:24.556 align:middle line:84%
care of the cakes and ale,
which is traditionally food

00:12:24.556 --> 00:12:25.930 align:middle line:84%
and drink that
you have after you

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:28.217 align:middle line:84%
do ritual work, to
ground your energy.

00:12:28.217 --> 00:12:29.050 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's take some
questions for Fiona--

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.830 align:middle line:84%
the good witch--
from the audience.

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:33.750 align:middle line:90%
Just raise your hand.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just pick
you, and point to you.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Who has got a question
for the witch?

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I was wondering,
what is the most concrete spell

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:47.200 align:middle line:84%
outcome you've ever had, that
you could actually see or could

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.054 align:middle line:90%
tell really occurred?

00:12:49.054 --> 00:12:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: That's
a great question.

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.927 align:middle line:90%
The most concrete spell outcome.

00:12:52.927 --> 00:12:55.260 align:middle line:84%
People have asked, you know,
what's your favorite spell.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.135 align:middle line:90%
And I go, oh my life.

00:12:56.135 --> 00:12:57.580 align:middle line:84%
It's a work of
magic in progress.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And you have that big
general kind of a thing.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.580 align:middle line:90%
Really specific stuff.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.587 align:middle line:84%
It was a spell I helped
another girl with.

00:13:05.587 --> 00:13:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was called the hurry
up and marry me spell.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And we had a bit
of fun creating it.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.680 align:middle line:84%
It involved a clock and
some ivy and some herbs,

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.130 align:middle line:84%
like the herbs that speed
up things, like cayenne

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:16.620 align:middle line:90%
pepper, and hot spicy stuff.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And she had been perpetually
engaged for like seven years.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And we were like, oh, let's
get this-- he kept saying he

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:24.080 align:middle line:90%
wanted to marry her.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.240 align:middle line:90%
Well, it worked.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.160 align:middle line:90%
And he did propose.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.639 align:middle line:84%
And we had given
it a time frame.

00:13:27.639 --> 00:13:29.930 align:middle line:84%
We had done the spell in the
new moon, to sort of avail

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:32.900 align:middle line:84%
ourselves of the building,
growing, waxing energy.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And then on the full moon, it
was literally on the full moon,

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:38.800 align:middle line:84%
he popped the question with
a reasonably nice ring.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:39.840 align:middle line:90%
And that was done.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.980 align:middle line:84%
So that was something
that was really tangible.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:46.645 align:middle line:84%
And I want to sort to
add, when you do spells,

00:13:46.645 --> 00:13:48.045 align:middle line:84%
because that's
such a tantalizing

00:13:48.045 --> 00:13:48.920 align:middle line:90%
aspect of witchcraft.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I can make people do things.

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And there's actually three
laws, very important.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.111 align:middle line:84%
Do what you want but
don't hurt anyone.

00:13:55.111 --> 00:13:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Do what you want
but don't interview

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:58.550 align:middle line:90%
with another person's free will.

00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:59.660 align:middle line:90%
That's very important.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:01.525 align:middle line:84%
And as you send out,
so returns threefold.

00:14:01.525 --> 00:14:03.400 align:middle line:84%
So she and I had a bit
of a discussion about,

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.490 align:middle line:84%
are we inferring
with his free will?

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.642 align:middle line:84%
You know, are we kind of
tricking things up, here?

00:14:07.642 --> 00:14:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And then we decided that
the odds were overwhelmingly

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.090 align:middle line:84%
in favor, when you've been
engaged for like seven

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:14.830 align:middle line:84%
years, that it's not
unreasonable to ask

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:17.602 align:middle line:84%
your fiance, mate, can we
just get business done?

00:14:17.602 --> 00:14:18.560 align:middle line:90%
And they're very happy.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.476 align:middle line:90%
They're still married.

00:14:19.476 --> 00:14:21.760 align:middle line:90%
So it's all good.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.860 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: With these
spells that you cast,

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.830 align:middle line:84%
do you need a little piece
of hair from somebody,

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:27.920 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that?

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.253 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Well, you can do that.

00:14:29.253 --> 00:14:32.740 align:middle line:84%
Actually, in my book, the
latest book that I've written,

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.529 align:middle line:84%
it's a work of
young adult fiction.

00:14:34.529 --> 00:14:35.320 align:middle line:90%
I had a lot of fun.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.653 align:middle line:90%
It was my first book of fiction.

00:14:36.653 --> 00:14:38.390 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of fun
with creating spells

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:40.340 align:middle line:84%
that were a bit more
dramatic and intense.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.740 align:middle line:84%
But I was thinking, oh,
I have to balance them

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.330 align:middle line:84%
with the ethical
aspect of it, even

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:47.160 align:middle line:84%
though this is the
world of fiction.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.010 align:middle line:84%
So instead of hair,
hair and blood,

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:55.174 align:middle line:84%
she got sand from a footprint
that a person had made.

00:14:55.174 --> 00:14:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Interesting.

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Yeah, but generally,
when people talk about using

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:02.440 align:middle line:84%
body parts in spells, like hair,
or nails, or any of that stuff,

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.370 align:middle line:84%
and people go, oh, I'm worried
some witch is going to sneak

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:08.285 align:middle line:84%
into the bathroom and take the
hair off my brush and do some

00:15:08.285 --> 00:15:09.100 align:middle line:90%
spell with it.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:13.760 align:middle line:84%
The whole purpose of that
is the genetic material,

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.240 align:middle line:84%
like the stuff of
their physical nature.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Again, that lends
itself to thinking,

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:20.830 align:middle line:84%
well, are we interfering
with free will,

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:22.170 align:middle line:90%
if we're doing things like that?

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:23.930 align:middle line:90%
So I mean, look.

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.230 align:middle line:84%
There's always going to
be people that break laws.

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:28.200 align:middle line:84%
But the laws of
witchcraft are there

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:33.210 align:middle line:84%
to sort of keep the collective
consciousness pure, to as much

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:34.870 align:middle line:90%
of a degree as it can be.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:37.110 align:middle line:84%
Because when, like
anything in life,

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:39.760 align:middle line:84%
if you do something from a
place of insecurity, fear,

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.590 align:middle line:84%
and thinking, I can't have
it unless I manipulate.

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Then you're not
ever really going

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:46.676 align:middle line:84%
to have that
intrinsic power that

00:15:46.676 --> 00:15:48.050 align:middle line:84%
allows you to
experience a really

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:50.620 align:middle line:84%
full and happy
and abundant life.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.102 align:middle line:84%
Whether, you know, just
without needing props of it.

00:15:53.102 --> 00:15:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Like without needing money,
without needing anything,

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:58.770 align:middle line:84%
you can have a life that
feels fulfilling and peaceful

00:15:58.770 --> 00:15:59.670 align:middle line:90%
and joyous.

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:00.690 align:middle line:90%
And it's full of love.

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And you can
experience that love.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.630 align:middle line:84%
If you're making decisions
not from a place of fear,

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:09.040 align:middle line:84%
insecurity, lack, and
thinking that-- or even

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.780 align:middle line:84%
jealousy-- so I guess that's,
when I'm talking to people

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.030 align:middle line:84%
about casting spells, I
always say, have a really good

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:18.730 align:middle line:84%
think about why you
want to do this.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:23.306 align:middle line:84%
Because for you have the power
to really transform your life,

00:16:23.306 --> 00:16:24.680 align:middle line:84%
you can't be in
this tiny little,

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.400 align:middle line:84%
[GASP] insecure
place full of fear.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.490 align:middle line:90%
And [CHATTERING].

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:29.810 align:middle line:90%
You've got to be relaxed.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And you got to let
this energy flow.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:32.610 align:middle line:84%
There's tons of
energy in the world.

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:33.610 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Do that again.

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:34.507 align:middle line:90%
[CHATTERING]

00:16:34.507 --> 00:16:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: But there's tons
of energy in the world.

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And you can avail yourself
of it, if you open up to it.

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's really where,
over a quarter of a century,

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.330 align:middle line:84%
I've been sort of actively
talking and promoting

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:49.030 align:middle line:90%
this stuff, that's what works.

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:52.410 align:middle line:84%
The stuff that's angry
and negative doesn't work.

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:55.317 align:middle line:84%
It just kind of implodes,
or it backfires.

00:16:55.317 --> 00:16:56.150 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.858 align:middle line:84%
Let's take some more
questions for Fiona.

00:16:57.858 --> 00:16:59.950 align:middle line:90%
There you go, sir.

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah, a couple
of questions, actually.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:04.130 align:middle line:84%
First of all, do you
need props, such as

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:08.450 align:middle line:84%
a long pointed black
hat, candles, things?

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:10.909 align:middle line:84%
And have you ever been
said, hey, you're wrong.

00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:11.950 align:middle line:90%
You need to be converted?

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:14.538 align:middle line:90%
Or something of that nature?

00:17:14.538 --> 00:17:15.079 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: OK.

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:16.560 align:middle line:90%
Well, what was the first one?

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.819 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Candles,
candles and things.

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: The candles and props.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.569 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we definitely
can use and do

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:26.810 align:middle line:84%
use candles, incense, different
herbs, crystals, objects,

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:29.450 align:middle line:90%
talismans, items.

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Putting it simply,
the four elements

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.960 align:middle line:84%
that we consider sacred
air, earth, fire, and water

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.589 align:middle line:84%
can be represented in a sacred
space, of just in everyday life

00:17:37.589 --> 00:17:38.380 align:middle line:90%
with certain items.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.180 align:middle line:90%
So fire is obviously a candle.

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:43.170 align:middle line:84%
Air can be incense, or a feather
if you're not burning anything.

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:45.730 align:middle line:84%
Earth can be crystals, or
anything of the earth, or even

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:49.180 align:middle line:84%
salt, or brass, even
a brass pentacle.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:50.680 align:middle line:90%
And water is obviously water.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And you can sometimes,
that can just

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:53.601 align:middle line:84%
be like having a vase
with a flower in it,

00:17:53.601 --> 00:17:55.934 align:middle line:84%
and just acknowledging that
that's the element of water.

00:17:55.934 --> 00:17:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And you have this kind
altar space in the house

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:00.265 align:middle line:84%
that no one knows
is really an alter.

00:18:00.265 --> 00:18:03.217 align:middle line:84%
You know, a feather, a flower
in a vase, and a crystal,

00:18:03.217 --> 00:18:04.050 align:middle line:90%
and a little candle.

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:05.320 align:middle line:90%
There's an alter right there.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:08.560 align:middle line:84%
So we do use props, because
we believe that they are not

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.660 align:middle line:84%
only tools to trigger
our subconscious,

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.810 align:middle line:84%
but because they embody
these sacred elements,

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:16.430 align:middle line:84%
they are like magnets that
can kind of work for us

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:18.500 align:middle line:84%
and draw our attention
to us, or to take us

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.520 align:middle line:90%
to where our goal is.

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.370 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:22.310 align:middle line:90%
Props, lots of things.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.810 align:middle line:90%
That's fun.

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:23.499 align:middle line:90%
It's creative.

00:18:23.499 --> 00:18:25.290 align:middle line:84%
That's what I really
love about witchcraft,

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:26.789 align:middle line:84%
that it's creative
and it's tactile.

00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:27.550 align:middle line:90%
It can be sensual.

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:29.700 align:middle line:84%
If you're using beautiful
scented incenses

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.330 align:middle line:84%
and gorgeous candles, it
can be a very evocative,

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:35.360 align:middle line:84%
beautiful thing that
you're a part of.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.660 align:middle line:90%
Running around naked?

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.842 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:38.842 --> 00:18:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Actually in my
first book, I talked

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.470 align:middle line:84%
about an all women's
gathering called We Moonies.

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:43.835 align:middle line:90%
He's giving me the thumbs up.

00:18:43.835 --> 00:18:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.030 align:middle line:90%
Where do you run around?

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Well, we consider
sky clad, the term sky clad,

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:53.065 align:middle line:90%
to be sacred, clad in skin.

00:18:53.065 --> 00:18:53.940 align:middle line:90%
It's clad in the sky.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.480 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you
know, if God meant

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.170 align:middle line:84%
us to be naked we would
have been born that way.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:58.970 align:middle line:90%
We were.

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:01.990 align:middle line:84%
So obviously it's
not a bad thing.

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:05.840 align:middle line:84%
We don't consider that the body
has things that are shameful

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:06.799 align:middle line:90%
and need to be hidden.

00:19:06.799 --> 00:19:09.090 align:middle line:84%
But that being said, it's
everyone's individual choice.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:10.190 align:middle line:90%
There's no mandatory thing.

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:11.530 align:middle line:84%
If someone came
up to me and said,

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:13.186 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm a really
powerful witch and you

00:19:13.186 --> 00:19:15.310 align:middle line:84%
got to get naked with me
in this circle of candles,

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:17.170 align:middle line:90%
I would run the other direction.

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:21.340 align:middle line:84%
That's like a wanker not a
witch, as far as I'm concerned.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:24.505 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so yeah, always it's
your own personal comforts.

00:19:24.505 --> 00:19:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And especially younger people
who are drawn to the craft.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.560 align:middle line:84%
I did write a book for
teenagers, a few years back.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:34.381 align:middle line:84%
And it's about exercising
ethical, moral responsibility,

00:19:34.381 --> 00:19:36.130 align:middle line:84%
but also really
understanding that there's

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:37.430 align:middle line:90%
no shame in our bodies.

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:38.230 align:middle line:90%
It's sacred.

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:40.560 align:middle line:84%
They're blessed, they
procreate, they're

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.020 align:middle line:84%
a big part of why
we're here, you know?

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:46.660 align:middle line:84%
So to celebrate them
is a healthier thing.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And so certainly
gathering sky clad,

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:51.340 align:middle line:84%
it can be done by witches,
consenting witches.

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's a beautiful,
wonderful, and rewarding thing.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:55.950 align:middle line:90%
And what was a last one again?

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:57.975 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, have you ever
been chased by the church,

00:19:57.975 --> 00:19:58.940 align:middle line:90%
or anybody like that?

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:00.523 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Well, like,
I remember once,

00:20:00.523 --> 00:20:01.690 align:middle line:90%
I was doing a book launch.

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually
in Australia.

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:04.520 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to remember if
it was Australia or here.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:05.650 align:middle line:90%
Because I live in America.

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:07.440 align:middle line:84%
I've lived here for
like 12, 13 years now.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.536 align:middle line:84%
But I go back to
Australia periodically.

00:20:10.536 --> 00:20:14.110 align:middle line:84%
I remember doing a book launch,
turning up at this event.

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And there was this truck, and
this big cross, a wooden cross.

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.474 align:middle line:90%
And it was burning.

00:20:20.474 --> 00:20:21.640 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh, goodness.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:22.250 align:middle line:90%
All of this.

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:24.300 align:middle line:84%
They went to all this
trouble just for me.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.840 align:middle line:84%
I felt rather special
that they all turned

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:27.919 align:middle line:90%
up and were chanting.

00:20:27.919 --> 00:20:28.835 align:middle line:90%
And they had placards.

00:20:28.835 --> 00:20:30.072 align:middle line:90%
And burn the witch.

00:20:30.072 --> 00:20:31.405 align:middle line:90%
And it was really extraordinary.

00:20:31.405 --> 00:20:32.070 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Burn the witch?

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Yeah, I thought, god,
I wish I had a reality TV show

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:34.970 align:middle line:90%
happening now.

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:37.480 align:middle line:90%
This is like, wow.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough, after
I had a chat with them,

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.515 align:middle line:84%
they all turned out to
be perfectly pleasant.

00:20:41.515 --> 00:20:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And it was just what
they felt they had to do.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:46.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, I mean,
again, it's education

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:48.585 align:middle line:90%
and it's awareness.

00:20:48.585 --> 00:20:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, you have
a different way about you.

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:52.227 align:middle line:84%
You make people
feel comfortable.

00:20:52.227 --> 00:20:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Well, thank you.

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:54.840 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to hope I do.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You don't come
across as being evil, at all.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:58.660 align:middle line:90%
Because you're not.

00:20:58.660 --> 00:20:59.970 align:middle line:90%
I've known you for years.

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:01.050 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: You have, yeah.

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:02.716 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are there
some people, though,

00:21:02.716 --> 00:21:07.074 align:middle line:84%
who are witches who you
kind of wish they weren't?

00:21:07.074 --> 00:21:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Well, it's not
my business to judge.

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:10.680 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, there's
definitely people out there

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.055 align:middle line:84%
that you just think, God,
they're whack jobs not witches,

00:21:13.055 --> 00:21:14.190 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:16.760 align:middle line:84%
But you know, like
anything, it can only

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:20.138 align:middle line:84%
take one bad egg to kind of
stink out the room, you know?

00:21:20.138 --> 00:21:21.770 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah, that's true.

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: So I just think,
all I can do is balance

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:30.400 align:middle line:84%
the negativity by trying to
continue to live a good life.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.130 align:middle line:84%
When I say good, I
mean good in the sense

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:35.860 align:middle line:84%
of responsible, ethical,
tread lightly on the earth,

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.096 align:middle line:90%
honor others.

00:21:37.096 --> 00:21:38.470 align:middle line:84%
We don't all have
to be the same.

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:41.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in fact, our survival
depends on our diversity.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.790 align:middle line:84%
I had a remarkable
meditation once, with that.

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:46.190 align:middle line:90%
I was talking to God, literally.

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:47.820 align:middle line:90%
This god energy, again.

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.667 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me--
it was a he, he

00:21:50.667 --> 00:21:52.500 align:middle line:84%
was a masculine presence
in the meditation--

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.050 align:middle line:84%
and he said, Fiona,
look at all the trees

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:56.169 align:middle line:90%
in the garden around you.

00:21:56.169 --> 00:21:57.460 align:middle line:90%
I was meditating in the garden.

00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed there were all
different types of trees.

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:01.890 align:middle line:84%
There was a willow tree,
an oak tree, a gum tree.

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:03.966 align:middle line:90%
And I said I understand that.

00:22:03.966 --> 00:22:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And he said, do you see
how they're the same,

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.590 align:middle line:84%
they're a tree, but
they're all different.

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yes,
I understand that.

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And he said, so, he
said, their survival

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.331 align:middle line:90%
depends on their diversity.

00:22:13.331 --> 00:22:14.580 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I understand that.

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And he said, so it
is with my love.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.680 align:middle line:84%
My survival depends
on the diversity

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.180 align:middle line:90%
of the love you give me.

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:24.930 align:middle line:84%
So every instrument, or every
spiritual path, every religion,

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:27.040 align:middle line:84%
is like an instrument
in an orchestra.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And when they're played
together it's a symphony.

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:33.140 align:middle line:84%
A symphony of the soul and that
is my voice, the voice of God.

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And so in that moment,
I realized, I thought,

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.110 align:middle line:84%
we all have a place to,
whatever religion or spiritual

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:39.870 align:middle line:84%
path we are, to be
that instrument.

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:42.470 align:middle line:84%
We play our instrument, and
then we give God a voice.

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:44.864 align:middle line:84%
So I don't judge,
even within the craft.

00:22:44.864 --> 00:22:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's some
wacky ones out there.

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:47.660 align:middle line:90%
And there are aspects to the--

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:48.930 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: There are
wacky ones in everything.

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:49.660 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: In everything.

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And there are aspects to the
craft that can appear darker.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.156 align:middle line:84%
Like Samhain, we were
talking about Halloween.

00:22:54.156 --> 00:22:55.334 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we do have a skull.

00:22:55.334 --> 00:22:56.500 align:middle line:90%
Usually it's not a real one.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:57.680 align:middle line:90%
But sometimes it can be.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.804 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Hey, some of our
politicians have skulls.

00:22:59.804 --> 00:23:01.927 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Well, there you go.

00:23:01.927 --> 00:23:04.010 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, I mean,
there's always that imagery.

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:05.100 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You fly.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:05.900 align:middle line:90%
You fly planes.

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:06.290 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Yes.

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:07.110 align:middle line:90%
And I jump out of them.

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why don't
you just use the broom?

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:10.140 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Because, well, a
plane is more comfortable.

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.610 align:middle line:84%
Brooms get a bit uncomfortable
after half an hour.

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:13.395 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I guess they would be.

00:23:13.395 --> 00:23:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: But you
can sit side saddle,

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:15.650 align:middle line:90%
it's a bit more comfortable.

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:16.150 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:18.122 align:middle line:84%
Seriously, I took up
flying planes about five

00:23:18.122 --> 00:23:18.830 align:middle line:90%
or six years ago.

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Around the same time
I started skydiving.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.900 align:middle line:90%
I've always loved aviation.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And my brain is not wired for
math and that kind of thing,

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:27.200 align:middle line:90%
and machines.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.160 align:middle line:90%
It's more creative.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.390 align:middle line:84%
So it's been a real challenge
to become a heavy machinery

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:34.650 align:middle line:84%
operator, basically, and
be able to fly a plane.

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:36.080 align:middle line:90%
A lot of stuff to remember.

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:36.815 align:middle line:90%
But I love it.

00:23:36.815 --> 00:23:37.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful world.

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.790 align:middle line:84%
I love the, how
would I say this?

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:44.410 align:middle line:84%
The history of, and the
"herstory" even, of aviation.

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And just it's such a
grand human endeavor.

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.440 align:middle line:90%
And I know we're using avgas.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.856 align:middle line:90%
And I'm all about solar power.

00:23:50.856 --> 00:23:52.730 align:middle line:84%
There's this solar plane
they're flying from,

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:53.790 align:middle line:90%
it's called Solarimpulse.

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:54.120 align:middle line:90%
Do check it out.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.119 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: A solar plane?

00:23:55.119 --> 00:23:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Yeah, a solar plane
they're flying across America.

00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:59.286 align:middle line:90%
It's a Swedish couple.

00:23:59.286 --> 00:24:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Like, they've got two
guys that have done it.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.290 align:middle line:84%
You should have
them on the show.

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:03.520 align:middle line:84%
It would be amazing
to talk about.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:04.990 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it's
called Solarimpulse.

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:06.400 align:middle line:90%
And they've got a plane.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.930 align:middle line:84%
It's got solar
panels on the wings.

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like a
massive glider, right now.

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:12.270 align:middle line:84%
But it's the beginning of
the next wave of aviation.

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:15.075 align:middle line:84%
We will have planes that
can be powered by the sun.

00:24:15.075 --> 00:24:17.200 align:middle line:84%
At the moment, we're trying
rechargeable batteries.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.555 align:middle line:84%
But they're too heavy and
they don't make sense.

00:24:18.555 --> 00:24:19.890 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's not fly at
night with that plane, huh?

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:20.990 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Well,
you can, actually.

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.606 align:middle line:90%
It stores power.

00:24:21.606 --> 00:24:22.280 align:middle line:90%
That's a really good point.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.780 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
my dad said to me.

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.120 align:middle line:84%
He said, oh, but, you
can't fly it at night.

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, it stores
power during the day.

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And you gauge how far you can
go by the stored solar energy.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: As you would
fuel in your wings.

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Yeah.

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:37.650 align:middle line:84%
But even as a pilot of a good
old Tailgaters and Cessna 180s,

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:40.840 align:middle line:84%
and all that kind
of stuff, I try

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.510 align:middle line:84%
to still tread
lightly on the earth.

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:45.360 align:middle line:84%
So yes, I'm using avgas,
and all that kind of stuff.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:48.650 align:middle line:84%
So I do support
environmental initiatives.

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:49.790 align:middle line:90%
I recycle.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:51.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't buy plastic
bottles of water.

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:53.680 align:middle line:90%
I refill things.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And where I can, I
make a difference.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.330 align:middle line:90%
But yes, I do buy avgas.

00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:59.800 align:middle line:84%
So I am contributing
to carbon emissions.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You are a sky jumper.

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Skydiver, yes.

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:05.434 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And I remember one
day you broke your ankle?

00:25:05.434 --> 00:25:06.100 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: I did.

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:07.050 align:middle line:90%
Last time I was on your show.

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What happened?

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Well, it wasn't
very exciting or interesting.

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:12.350 align:middle line:84%
I was jumping in Arizona, and
it was a regular old landing,

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:13.880 align:middle line:90%
I just, you know.

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:14.530 align:middle line:90%
flared.

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And my foot went, it could have
happened wearing these shoes

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:19.170 align:middle line:84%
if I tripped off the
corner of the stage, here.

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:20.395 align:middle line:90%
But there was a gopher hole.

00:25:20.395 --> 00:25:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And my foot went in it and it
just went, and snapped off.

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh gosh,
that was embarrassing.

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.080 align:middle line:84%
It was my first jump at
this particular new drop

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:27.996 align:middle line:90%
zone I was jumping at.

00:25:27.996 --> 00:25:30.870 align:middle line:84%
So I picked up my canopy, and I
was like walking off thinking,

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:32.130 align:middle line:84%
oh, I don't want people
to think I'm a goose.

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:33.440 align:middle line:90%
I didn't actually fall over.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.231 align:middle line:84%
I just, it was like
genuflecting, actually.

00:25:35.231 --> 00:25:37.550 align:middle line:84%
I dropped to one knee, stood
up and went, oh, please

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:38.370 align:middle line:90%
feel normal in a minute.

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:39.390 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's not feeling normal.

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:40.170 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's burning.

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:40.740 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no.

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:41.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:43.110 align:middle line:84%
Don't look like an
idiot, walk back.

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And I got to the hanger, and I
lay out my canopy to pack it.

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:46.994 align:middle line:90%
And, just, I got to sit down.

00:25:46.994 --> 00:25:47.910 align:middle line:90%
And I got my shoe off.

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:50.010 align:middle line:84%
My sole of my foot had
already gone black.

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:51.370 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, that gnarly.

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:53.887 align:middle line:84%
But it's back on
now, held with pins.

00:25:53.887 --> 00:25:54.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm like the bionic woman.

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Oh, there's
pins in there?

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:55.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:56.390 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Oh, yeah.

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:57.200 align:middle line:90%
I snapped my foot off.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do they go off when
you go through an airport.

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Uh, they wanted to
pat me down the other day,

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.270 align:middle line:84%
and then the lady said, oh,
it was randomly selected.

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:04.478 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh, whatever.

00:26:04.478 --> 00:26:06.010 align:middle line:90%
I don't think my ankle goes off.

00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:08.354 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, I've got
a lot of metal in it.

00:26:08.354 --> 00:26:09.270 align:middle line:90%
But I'm jumping again.

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:12.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was jumping
again within six months.

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:13.080 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'm proud to say, I
actuallly got a world record.

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:15.730 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Do you really?

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:16.620 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Yes, I did.

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:19.950 align:middle line:84%
I got a world record,
which was nothing I ever

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:22.560 align:middle line:84%
thought I could ever achieve in
skydiving or anything, really.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.815 align:middle line:84%
But it was all of
us were over 40.

00:26:25.815 --> 00:26:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And it was a head
down formation,

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:32.290 align:middle line:84%
of 13-way head down formation
in-- we were up in Oregon.

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:34.607 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:26:34.607 --> 00:26:36.190 align:middle line:84%
Head down is really
a hard way to fly.

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:38.540 align:middle line:84%
You often see people jumping
on their bellies, you know?

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:39.020 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: With their hands out.

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:40.110 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: The classic
belly thing, yeah.

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:42.350 align:middle line:84%
But when you start to free
fly, you're stick flying,

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:43.410 align:middle line:90%
you're doing other positions.

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:45.243 align:middle line:84%
And then your head down,
that's the fastest.

00:26:45.243 --> 00:26:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And its most awkward, because
you're literally upside down

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:47.960 align:middle line:90%
on your head.

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:48.930 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Can you feel
speed when you doing that?

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:49.721 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Oh, yeah.

00:26:49.721 --> 00:26:52.400 align:middle line:84%
You're going like 180 miles
an hour when you're head down.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.190 align:middle line:84%
So we flew into a
formation of 13,

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:55.850 align:middle line:84%
that's was predetermined
on the ground.

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:58.700 align:middle line:84%
We had to fill in slots,
slot specific, as you say.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.650 align:middle line:90%
A photograph had to be taken.

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:02.090 align:middle line:90%
Grips had to be shown.

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And we actually
flew the formation

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:05.993 align:middle line:84%
for about 12 seconds, which
is a long time in skydiving,

00:27:05.993 --> 00:27:06.980 align:middle line:90%
because you free fall.

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Once you're out of the
plane, at that speed,

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:11.902 align:middle line:84%
it's usually only
about 52 to 54 seconds.

00:27:11.902 --> 00:27:13.485 align:middle line:84%
And we were breaking
off a little high

00:27:13.485 --> 00:27:16.165 align:middle line:84%
to give us room to open and
separate without banging

00:27:16.165 --> 00:27:18.580 align:middle line:90%
into each other under canopy.

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:20.230 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, we achieved the record.

00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:21.570 align:middle line:90%
And all of us were over 40.

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:23.207 align:middle line:90%
That was what the caveat was.

00:27:23.207 --> 00:27:24.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. so we were really excited.

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:26.415 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is it noisy
when you're doing that?

00:27:26.415 --> 00:27:27.470 align:middle line:90%
Can you hear the wind?

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:28.100 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Oh, yeah.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.390 align:middle line:84%
I wear a full faced helmet now,
but yeah, the noise is there.

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:31.620 align:middle line:84%
That's why movies
like "Point Break"

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:33.869 align:middle line:84%
is so funny, when they have
the conversation going on.

00:27:33.869 --> 00:27:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And the free fall is
like 2 and 1/2 minutes.

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:37.810 align:middle line:84%
You're like, yeah, this
isn't how it really is.

00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:39.757 align:middle line:84%
But you can sometimes
yell at each other,

00:27:39.757 --> 00:27:42.340 align:middle line:84%
just as you're coming out of the
plane and you're on the heal,

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:43.569 align:middle line:90%
you can kind of hear things.

00:27:43.569 --> 00:27:45.360 align:middle line:84%
But generally, we just
nod and smile a lot.

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.430 align:middle line:90%
And gesture with hands.

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you
communicate in the sky.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.360 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You're a pretty
accomplished musician.

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:52.440 align:middle line:90%
You've been a singer.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.902 align:middle line:90%
Do you still do some of that?

00:27:53.902 --> 00:27:55.360 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: I do
enjoy singing still.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:58.550 align:middle line:84%
My band, actually, last year,
we had a big career in Australia

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:01.177 align:middle line:84%
in the '90s, which
was a lot of fun.

00:28:01.177 --> 00:28:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of launched my work
in the entertainment industry.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.271 align:middle line:84%
We did a 15 year reunion
tour last year in Australia.

00:28:06.271 --> 00:28:07.270 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Is that Def X?

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Def FX.

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:08.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:09.360 align:middle line:90%
It sold out.

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Great venues, great,
just the people, the fans

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:13.284 align:middle line:90%
came out to see us again.

00:28:13.284 --> 00:28:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And were like,
back in the day, we

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.640 align:middle line:84%
were electronica
before electronica.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.210 align:middle line:84%
So we had like really heavy
guitars and dance beats.

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:20.620 align:middle line:90%
And this was in the early '90s.

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:24.210 align:middle line:84%
So we had mosh pits and stage
diving and all that craziness.

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And I was cracking jokes
last year in interviews.

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:28.550 align:middle line:84%
I was like, yeah, we
got these mosh pits,

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:30.910 align:middle line:84%
but now it's all 40
somethings going,

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:32.154 align:middle line:90%
ow, don't tread on my foot.

00:28:32.154 --> 00:28:33.070 align:middle line:90%
Ow, you're hurting me.

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:34.020 align:middle line:90%
Stop banging into me.

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:35.120 align:middle line:90%
Ow.

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.370 align:middle line:84%
So back in the day, everyone
was just slamming it up.

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:38.440 align:middle line:90%
And I did too.

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.170 align:middle line:84%
My two front teeth
are pretty much fake,

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:42.336 align:middle line:84%
because I left in someone's
head when I stage-dived.

00:28:42.336 --> 00:28:44.360 align:middle line:84%
But I stage-dived
again last year.

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:45.482 align:middle line:90%
I was like, why not?

00:28:45.482 --> 00:28:46.190 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you know.

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Jump right in.

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:47.345 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: It was fun.

00:28:47.345 --> 00:28:49.680 align:middle line:84%
We're touring again this year,
because the fans want it.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.046 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So you're pretty
multifaceted, Fiona.

00:28:52.046 --> 00:28:53.420 align:middle line:84%
You do a lot of
different things.

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:54.090 align:middle line:90%
You're an author.

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:54.380 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Yeah.

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:54.990 align:middle line:90%
So I'm very proud of my books.

00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How many
books out there now?

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:57.416 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Gosh, let
me hold up my books.

00:28:57.416 --> 00:28:59.830 align:middle line:84%
This is the latest one,
the young adult book.

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:01.090 align:middle line:90%
My first work of fiction.

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:03.345 align:middle line:84%
I felt very, very blessed
to get a book deal

00:29:03.345 --> 00:29:05.220 align:middle line:84%
at this time in the
publishing industry, when

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:06.575 align:middle line:90%
things are changing so much.

00:29:06.575 --> 00:29:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Very tough.

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: And to get-- to
be able to write fiction

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.810 align:middle line:84%
for a young adult
market was just--

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:15.496 align:middle line:84%
it's actually a kind of
murder, mystery, love story.

00:29:15.496 --> 00:29:17.650 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like a maybe,
Nancy Drew meets Sabrina,

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:18.440 align:middle line:90%
but she's cooler.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:18.760 align:middle line:90%
I don't now.

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Is there a movie here?

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Oh, who knows.

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:22.030 align:middle line:90%
It's the first of three.

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:23.370 align:middle line:90%
Anything could happen.

00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:24.870 align:middle line:90%
So that was a big thrill.

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And then my last
nonfiction book before that

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.840 align:middle line:84%
was "Bewitch a Man,"
which was a fun

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.472 align:middle line:84%
book I did with
Simon and Schuster.

00:29:31.472 --> 00:29:33.430 align:middle line:84%
They had put out "He's
Just Not That Into You."

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:35.405 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, he's
just not that into you,

00:29:35.405 --> 00:29:36.738 align:middle line:90%
you want him anyway, do a spell.

00:29:36.738 --> 00:29:37.940 align:middle line:90%
So they liked that idea.

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now tell me how
spells work, actually.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Are there spells for everything
you need to accomplish?

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:47.060 align:middle line:84%
If you want a better job,
if you want a relationship,

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:48.361 align:middle line:90%
if you want better health?

00:29:48.361 --> 00:29:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: There are definitely
spells and rituals you can do

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:55.325 align:middle line:84%
that can assist in those things
manifesting in your life.

00:29:55.325 --> 00:29:57.450 align:middle line:84%
I always say, you've got
to act practically as well

00:29:57.450 --> 00:29:57.940 align:middle line:90%
as magically.

00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:59.898 align:middle line:84%
So you can't just sit in
your room doing spells

00:29:59.898 --> 00:30:02.660 align:middle line:84%
forever and ever and expect
everything to change.

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:04.930 align:middle line:84%
Occasionally, your
perception of reality,

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:07.870 align:middle line:84%
if it's triggered, if
it's shifted significantly

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:10.010 align:middle line:84%
enough in a quiet,
private ritual

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:11.670 align:middle line:84%
can actually affect
change outside you.

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:13.160 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
do the work, too.

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.540 align:middle line:84%
If you do a spell for
a new job, well, you've

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:16.160 align:middle line:84%
got to go out there
for interviews.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:19.020 align:middle line:84%
But you ask for
guidance and for help

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.130 align:middle line:84%
to get the best job, the
right job, the one that

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:22.970 align:middle line:84%
has all the qualities and
characters that you want.

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:24.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, especially
with love, too.

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:25.906 align:middle line:84%
I mean that's what
"Bewitch a Man"

00:30:25.906 --> 00:30:29.645 align:middle line:84%
that book was so about, you
know, finding the perfect love

00:30:29.645 --> 00:30:31.020 align:middle line:84%
or experiencing
the perfect love.

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And I always say, well, the
first spell you've got to cast

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:35.474 align:middle line:84%
is on yourself, so
you have self love.

00:30:35.474 --> 00:30:37.348 align:middle line:84%
And then when you've
got that kind of plugged

00:30:37.348 --> 00:30:38.880 align:middle line:84%
in and worked out,
then you can work

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.297 align:middle line:84%
on manifesting
your ideal partner.

00:30:40.297 --> 00:30:40.796 align:middle line:90%
And

00:30:40.796 --> 00:30:42.430 align:middle line:84%
when we would cast
a spell, we wouldn't

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:43.800 align:middle line:90%
pick a specific person.

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:49.300 align:middle line:84%
We would say, they might
be-- they love travel,

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:50.820 align:middle line:84%
they've got a great
sense of humor,

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.480 align:middle line:84%
or maybe they are really
successful in finances,

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.760 align:middle line:84%
or anything, or
they're a great chef

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.740 align:middle line:84%
so they can cook me
dinner, or anything.

00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.780 align:middle line:84%
You pick what the
qualities, and then you

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:04.024 align:middle line:84%
ask, God, the universe, whatever
to bring you that person that

00:31:04.024 --> 00:31:06.440 align:middle line:84%
embodies those qualities and
something else that maybe you

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:09.220 align:middle line:84%
don't really know at the time
you need or would learn from.

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the spells
can be really effective.

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:16.097 align:middle line:84%
And in an every day sense
now, as being that I'm a,

00:31:16.097 --> 00:31:17.930 align:middle line:84%
I guess, yeah, I'm still
a practicing witch,

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:23.400 align:middle line:84%
it's been a really long
time, a lot of my spell work

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.050 align:middle line:90%
is more intuitive.

00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:28.540 align:middle line:84%
But every time I light a candle,
I say a prayer, or say a charm,

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:29.740 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And I never blow candles
out, I snuff them,

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:34.730 align:middle line:84%
because blowing them away
blows away the magic.

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:38.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's funny how I stir my
coffee in a sun-wise direction,

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:40.800 align:middle line:84%
so in the northern
hemisphere it's to the right,

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.230 align:middle line:84%
and in the southern
hemisphere it's to left.

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.780 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You go the other way.

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: It's just, I just
naturally do these things.

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:47.160 align:middle line:90%
Do they make my life better?

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.670 align:middle line:90%
I feel that they do, you know.

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:51.600 align:middle line:90%
So I'm plugged in to my life.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.300 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It sounds like it's an
exercise in positive thinking.

00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:57.880 align:middle line:90%
Is it?

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.004 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: I think so, yeah.

00:31:59.004 --> 00:32:03.060 align:middle line:90%
I think, life's not always easy.

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:05.380 align:middle line:84%
There was a, again I
reference my books a lot,

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:09.651 align:middle line:84%
but I feel it's a privilege to
put what I've learned in books.

00:32:09.651 --> 00:32:11.150 align:middle line:84%
There was one chapter
I wrote called

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:13.195 align:middle line:84%
It Has to Be Dark
to See the Stars.

00:32:13.195 --> 00:32:15.149 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, in the
darkest, darkest night,

00:32:15.149 --> 00:32:16.440 align:middle line:90%
the brightest light will shine.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And even just recently, I had
like a very, very difficult

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:23.300 align:middle line:84%
time in my personal life, very,
very sad and challenging time.

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:25.330 align:middle line:90%
And you've got that choice.

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, do I just go into the
dark and just fade away?

00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:33.240 align:middle line:84%
Or do I find a way to shine
in this dark, dark night?

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.670 align:middle line:90%
And so it's a choice.

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:36.560 align:middle line:84%
I choose to see this
dark night as a time

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.910 align:middle line:84%
to shine, not a time
to be diminished.

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:40.310 align:middle line:90%
And it's not always easy.

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:42.265 align:middle line:84%
It's a day by day process,
one day at a time.

00:32:42.265 --> 00:32:42.890 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:44.070 align:middle line:90%
No, it isn't easy.

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And there are some people,
you see these cases

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.150 align:middle line:84%
where kids will go into
schools and shoot up.

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:54.221 align:middle line:84%
And they must be so tormented
to do things like that.

00:32:54.221 --> 00:32:55.470 align:middle line:90%
And then they kill themselves.

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:56.469 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: It's very sad.

00:32:56.469 --> 00:32:59.500 align:middle line:84%
It's just, you know, and
it's probably not the place

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:02.030 align:middle line:84%
to talk about it in depth,
but at the same time,

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:05.520 align:middle line:84%
I think wherever we
can as individuals,

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:08.490 align:middle line:84%
not bow down to that
incredible negativity that

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:10.690 align:middle line:90%
permeates our society now.

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:12.100 align:middle line:84%
I like to just
try and find a way

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.540 align:middle line:90%
to appreciate simple things.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And just take a
moment in meditation

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:19.480 align:middle line:84%
to honor life and the privilege
that it is, to ask for peace

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:21.830 align:middle line:84%
and ask for blessings for
those who are suffering.

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And all that stuff really,
it does make a difference,

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:25.500 align:middle line:90%
it really does.

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:29.170 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When you go out,
and people somehow hear that

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:31.870 align:middle line:84%
you're a witch-- and I bet that
comes up in the conversation.

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:32.270 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Sometimes it does.

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:34.010 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people are
like, oh, this is Fiona.

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:34.593 align:middle line:90%
She's a witch.

00:33:34.593 --> 00:33:36.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, amongst
other things but yeah.

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:38.408 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Does that
bother you sometimes?

00:33:38.408 --> 00:33:40.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, did you get
pestered when you go out?

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:43.390 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Well, it depends
on the context, too.

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:45.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a big weird in
aviation, because it's

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:46.909 align:middle line:90%
a pretty conservative bunch.

00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:48.450 align:middle line:84%
So if someone, for
some weird reason,

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Googled me for some reason and
sees all this stuff about me--

00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:53.330 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And they probably did.

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:54.090 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Mm, sometimes.

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:54.560 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They do.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.643 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: If it gets around,
oh, she's been on TV,

00:33:56.643 --> 00:33:59.960 align:middle line:84%
or she's done something,
then, you know?

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.632 align:middle line:90%
But again, it's just education.

00:34:01.632 --> 00:34:03.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
get all worked up.

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And everyone has a right to
think what they want to think.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And if it's different
to what I think,

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:07.790 align:middle line:90%
well, that's their prerogative.

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What has been, in
your witchcraft career and life,

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:15.257 align:middle line:84%
the strangest event that's
ever happened to you?

00:34:15.257 --> 00:34:15.840 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: God.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.429 align:middle line:90%


00:34:18.429 --> 00:34:20.489 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was going to
say, that burning cross

00:34:20.489 --> 00:34:21.484 align:middle line:90%
is pretty strange.

00:34:21.484 --> 00:34:23.292 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's weird.

00:34:23.292 --> 00:34:24.370 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: The strangest?

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:27.060 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I mean, where
somebody came up to you,

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:29.399 align:middle line:84%
and it was just weird,
the whole thing was weird.

00:34:29.399 --> 00:34:31.440 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: God, I was
thinking of a stalker I had.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.280 align:middle line:90%
That was pretty weird.

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:32.960 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You had a stalker?

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:33.751 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Oh, yeah.

00:34:33.751 --> 00:34:34.312 align:middle line:90%
Big time.

00:34:34.312 --> 00:34:35.145 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: He's back.

00:34:35.145 --> 00:34:36.350 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: It's been a while.

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He's in the
audience, did you know?

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:41.710 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Which one is he?

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:42.409 align:middle line:90%
I'm psychic.

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:44.620 align:middle line:90%
I should know who he is.

00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:46.700 align:middle line:90%
No, yeah that was a bit weird.

00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:48.949 align:middle line:84%
But that's just working in
the entertainment industry,

00:34:48.949 --> 00:34:49.250 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:49.730 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That happens.

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: And you're sort of
out there in the public eye.

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:51.679 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I've had my share.

00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:53.199 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: In any area where
you're sort of getting

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:54.800 align:middle line:84%
attention, you
can, unfortunately,

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.790 align:middle line:90%
get that experience.

00:34:56.790 --> 00:35:00.515 align:middle line:84%
I was lucky in that it didn't
get really, really, really bad.

00:35:00.515 --> 00:35:02.640 align:middle line:84%
It was definitely really
difficult for about a year

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:03.140 align:middle line:90%
and a half.

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:03.932 align:middle line:90%
But I'm still here.

00:35:03.932 --> 00:35:05.181 align:middle line:90%
He didn't kill me or anything.

00:35:05.181 --> 00:35:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I have got
a house in St. Louis.

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And I go back and forth
between Los Angeles

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.660 align:middle line:84%
and now a little bit of
Denver, here, and Boulder,

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:13.110 align:middle line:90%
in this area.

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And I opened up my mail at
the network in LA one day,

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:20.410 align:middle line:84%
and it was a package
of photographs

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:24.170 align:middle line:84%
of a woman who took
pictures of herself

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:26.446 align:middle line:90%
in front of my St. Louis house.

00:35:26.446 --> 00:35:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Ouch, yeah.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: She's from
a different state.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And wrote down on
every photograph,

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:34.580 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't I look good
living with you.

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:36.392 align:middle line:90%
And I went, this is creepy.

00:35:36.392 --> 00:35:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: It is creepy.

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And we finally
had to put an end to that.

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.193 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: The one I had
did a similar thing,

00:35:41.193 --> 00:35:44.524 align:middle line:84%
where they were sending
drawings they had done--

00:35:44.524 --> 00:35:46.190 align:middle line:84%
they were quite an
accomplished artist--

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:47.880 align:middle line:84%
drawings they had
done to my publisher,

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.570 align:middle line:84%
who was just thinking it was
fan mail and kept forwarding it

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:51.814 align:middle line:90%
to my private address.

00:35:51.814 --> 00:35:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And I would open
it, and I started

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:54.450 align:middle line:90%
to recognize the handwriting.

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:56.890 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that
really was eerie to me

00:35:56.890 --> 00:35:58.560 align:middle line:90%
was, there was a cartoon.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And at the time I was
living in Australia still.

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:04.747 align:middle line:84%
And my boyfriend at the
time played football.

00:36:04.747 --> 00:36:06.080 align:middle line:90%
He was a professional football--

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And football
to you is soccer, right?

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:09.210 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Aussie rules, mate.

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:09.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:10.550 align:middle line:90%
Best game in the world.

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:12.530 align:middle line:90%
Best game in the world.

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:15.950 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, so he
had-- his number,

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:17.180 align:middle line:90%
his jumper number was 7.

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And so he had done this drawing
of my boyfriend with the 7

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.090 align:middle line:90%
and me with a shopping trolley.

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And we were at Woolley's,
which is a supermarket.

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:31.247 align:middle line:84%
And some of the stuff in
the trolley was what I buy.

00:36:31.247 --> 00:36:32.580 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: He obviously saw this.

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: He was there
in the supermarket.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.600 align:middle line:84%
That's what really
freaked me out.

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:36.200 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Ooh.

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:37.360 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: You
know, that he was--

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.050 align:middle line:90%
and I had a red sweater on.

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:39.520 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Cast a spell on him.

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:43.070 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Well, I did do some
spells for healing for him,

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:44.860 align:middle line:90%
that he's find peace.

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And feel that he could have
some kind of sense of not

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.180 align:middle line:90%
needing to--

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:51.170 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Did it work?

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:52.535 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Well, it did
go away in the end.

00:36:52.535 --> 00:36:54.500 align:middle line:84%
But when I moved to
America, he was sending mail

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:55.480 align:middle line:84%
to my publisher
here for a while.

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.520 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Still, he didn't stop.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.603 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: And then it and
it eventually faded out.

00:36:58.603 --> 00:37:00.970 align:middle line:84%
But I would always
ask for healing.

00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:03.760 align:middle line:84%
I tried not to come
from a place of fear,

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.660 align:middle line:90%
because fear brings more fear.

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:07.620 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: That's why I jump
out of planes and stuff.

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.602 align:middle line:84%
I was totally scared
to jump out of a plane.

00:37:09.602 --> 00:37:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What was the
first jump like for you?

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:12.490 align:middle line:90%
Were you petrified?

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Well, the
first was a tandem jump.

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:16.890 align:middle line:84%
When I turned 40
my girlfriend said

00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:19.805 align:middle line:84%
that she wanted to take me
skydiving, jump out a plane.

00:37:19.805 --> 00:37:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And at the time
I had been single

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:22.070 align:middle line:90%
for like three or four years.

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:22.850 align:middle line:90%
I was miserable.

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:24.891 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, yeah,
I don't care if I die.

00:37:24.891 --> 00:37:25.390 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:25.930 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Let's go.

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:26.990 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Let's
jump out of a plane.

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I did
it and I loved it.

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:30.854 align:middle line:84%
And then I said, I'm going
to learn how to do this.

00:37:30.854 --> 00:37:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And that became a
real passion for me.

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:33.920 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be
very focused on it.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:34.240 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Especially
the first year.

00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think I did like 200
jumps in the first year,

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:40.630 align:middle line:84%
as you just get familiar with
it and develop your skills.

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:43.000 align:middle line:90%
And you know, I love it.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.540 align:middle line:84%
It's such a great environment,
a great community.

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:47.370 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a
death wish, at all.

00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Some might be described
as adrenalin junkies.

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Some of us-- I love
the peace of it.

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.430 align:middle line:84%
I just love being--
I'll jump alone.

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:54.930 align:middle line:84%
I love jumping with
groups, but I'll

00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:57.370 align:middle line:84%
jump alone and just
experience the sensation

00:37:57.370 --> 00:37:59.240 align:middle line:84%
of how extraordinary
life can be.

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:00.865 align:middle line:84%
You can always get
out of your own box.

00:38:00.865 --> 00:38:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Right, Did you have
to get pushed the first time?

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:03.760 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: No, no.

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.635 align:middle line:84%
I was strapped to someone
in the tandem jump.

00:38:05.635 --> 00:38:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And then you go through the AFF
course, the Accelerated Free

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Fall course, which
is seven levels.

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:11.263 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Who packed your chute?

00:38:11.263 --> 00:38:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: I paid
someone $6 to do it.

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:13.759 align:middle line:90%
But you have to--

00:38:13.759 --> 00:38:16.050 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I would have paid
them a little more than $6.

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: You have to
demonstrate that you can pack

00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:18.509 align:middle line:90%
a chute.

00:38:18.509 --> 00:38:21.260 align:middle line:84%
But when you actually
get the packing done,

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:23.130 align:middle line:84%
you can pay someone
else to do it.

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:24.190 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:25.680 align:middle line:84%
It's not rocket science, you've
just got to do it properly.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.031 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Who would like to
pay, the lowest paid guy,

00:38:28.031 --> 00:38:29.030 align:middle line:90%
or the highest paid one?

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Well, I'll you
what, it doesn't matter.

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:32.482 align:middle line:84%
I was paying someone
that charges a bit more,

00:38:32.482 --> 00:38:33.440 align:middle line:90%
and I tip him, as well.

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:37.170 align:middle line:84%
And I had my first cut away in
October, just a few months ago.

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:39.747 align:middle line:84%
Jumped, it's like
[IMITATING  STRONG WIND] uh-oh,

00:38:39.747 --> 00:38:40.580 align:middle line:90%
nothing's happening.

00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Oh, gosh, is this,
this is going,

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:42.701 align:middle line:90%
this, I think this could be it.

00:38:42.701 --> 00:38:45.254 align:middle line:84%
This is like my 648th
jump or something.

00:38:45.254 --> 00:38:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, oh,
wow, it's not opening.

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Because
that does happen.

00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:48.314 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Yeah.

00:38:48.314 --> 00:38:51.115 align:middle line:84%
And I looked up and my canopy
was just this tangled mess.

00:38:51.115 --> 00:38:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
alright, I got to chop.

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:54.600 align:middle line:90%
And so I chopped, cut away.

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:55.890 align:middle line:90%
I opened the reserve.

00:38:55.890 --> 00:38:59.190 align:middle line:84%
The reserve popped out, and it
was beautiful, there, working.

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:00.395 align:middle line:90%
And I was like wow.

00:39:00.395 --> 00:39:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of got
used to how different

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:04.390 align:middle line:84%
it felt, because the rig is
sitting differently on you,

00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:05.780 align:middle line:90%
being that it's a reserve.

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:06.860 align:middle line:90%
I un-stored the toggles.

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:09.060 align:middle line:84%
They were kind of really
stiff, because they

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:11.834 align:middle line:84%
hadn't-- it's the
first ride, you know.

00:39:11.834 --> 00:39:13.000 align:middle line:90%
It hadn't been flown before.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.087 align:middle line:84%
And I flew over to where
my canopy was still

00:39:15.087 --> 00:39:15.920 align:middle line:90%
floating in the air.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.461 align:middle line:84%
And it was all mashed
up and tangled.

00:39:17.461 --> 00:39:19.140 align:middle line:90%
Massive line over malfunction.

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:20.380 align:middle line:90%
And then I landed.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:22.339 align:middle line:90%
And it was a great story.

00:39:22.339 --> 00:39:23.630 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It was a great story.

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: You know, I was
the talk of the drop zone.

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:26.370 align:middle line:90%
And that was that.

00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:26.510 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Perfect.

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:27.940 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: And onwards you go.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:30.136 align:middle line:84%
Because we have three kind
of lifesaving devices.

00:39:30.136 --> 00:39:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, the
first main canopy.

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:33.700 align:middle line:84%
We have a reserve canopy,
which is the one I opened.

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:34.770 align:middle line:90%
And then there's an AAD.

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Most rigs now have an
Automatic Activation Device,

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:39.355 align:middle line:84%
and it sits in the nape
of your neck, here.

00:39:39.355 --> 00:39:41.439 align:middle line:84%
And then that way, if like,
say, you hit the plane

00:39:41.439 --> 00:39:43.604 align:middle line:84%
as you were leaving the
plane, or someone kicked you

00:39:43.604 --> 00:39:45.950 align:middle line:84%
in free fall and you
were knocked unconscious,

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:48.294 align:middle line:84%
that would still fire your
reserve at around 700 feet.

00:39:48.294 --> 00:39:49.460 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Fail safe systems.

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: So you've got three
chances to save your life when

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:53.050 align:middle line:90%
you jump out of a plane.

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:54.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's take some
more questions for you, Fiona.

00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:56.280 align:middle line:84%
OK, how about
somebody over here?

00:39:56.280 --> 00:40:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Who's got a question for
the witch, Fiona Horne?

00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I was wondering,
where do wizards fit

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:04.470 align:middle line:90%
in to your modalities?

00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:05.220 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Wizards.

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Wizards, yeah,
that's such a great question.

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, wizards, in the spiritual
path of modern witchcraft,

00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:13.340 align:middle line:90%
there are no wizards.

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:15.460 align:middle line:84%
It's witches, men and
women are witches.

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:17.020 align:middle line:90%
So there's no warlocks, either.

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:18.960 align:middle line:90%
That's all words.

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:22.520 align:middle line:84%
The wizard, to me, how I
experience a wizard, and even

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:24.774 align:middle line:84%
in my tarot deck I have
a card, the magician,

00:40:24.774 --> 00:40:26.440 align:middle line:84%
which I kind of relate
to as the wizard.

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:30.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like the alchemist, someone
that can transform things.

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.660 align:middle line:84%
But generally,
wizard is a term used

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:35.580 align:middle line:84%
in the entertainment culture
of witchcraft and magic,

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:36.834 align:middle line:90%
not in real life.

00:40:36.834 --> 00:40:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: The wizards.

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:38.820 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: But you can
be a wizard if you want.

00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:40.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm presuming it has
to be a bloke, though.

00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:42.210 align:middle line:84%
Has anyone ever heard
of a female wizard?

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:42.709 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:40:42.709 --> 00:40:44.390 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: No, I don't think so.

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:45.900 align:middle line:90%
What are the guys called?

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:46.510 align:middle line:90%
Warlocks?

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Witches.

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:49.357 align:middle line:90%
There's no term warlock in our--

00:40:49.357 --> 00:40:51.440 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: "Bewitched" did
that to us, didn't they?

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.065 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Yeah.

00:40:52.065 --> 00:40:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do you
wiggle your nose?

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:54.306 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: No.

00:40:54.306 --> 00:40:54.732 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You don't do that?

00:40:54.732 --> 00:40:56.482 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Except when
I'm about to sneeze.

00:40:56.482 --> 00:40:59.070 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, you know, a show
like that was probably great

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:01.990 align:middle line:84%
for getting the word out
about witches, wasn't it?

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Well, it inspired
me when I was a kid.

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:06.198 align:middle line:84%
I used to come home from
school to watch "Bewitched."

00:41:06.198 --> 00:41:08.920 align:middle line:84%
I just loved the idea that
there were these cool women that

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:10.510 align:middle line:90%
could do crazy cool things.

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:12.040 align:middle line:90%
And I liked Sabrina.

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:14.180 align:middle line:84%
I like the naughty
witch, Samantha's cousin.

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:16.405 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't into-- I thought,
if I was Samantha,

00:41:16.405 --> 00:41:19.072 align:middle line:84%
and I was a powerful witch, I
wouldn't like Darren boss me

00:41:19.072 --> 00:41:19.780 align:middle line:90%
around like that.

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:20.738 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:41:20.738 --> 00:41:22.629 align:middle line:84%
Only in those days,
women got bossed around.

00:41:22.629 --> 00:41:24.420 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Yeah, it was
part of the culture.

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:24.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.140 align:middle line:84%
But I loved the
imagery, that Endora

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:30.280 align:middle line:84%
with all her, oh, darling,
fantastic, flamboyant

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.350 align:middle line:90%
mannerisms and carry on.

00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:31.780 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Agnes
Moorehead, I think.

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.689 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Yeah, Agnes
Moorehead is amazing.

00:41:33.689 --> 00:41:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Classics.

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: But it's a great
point that you bring up.

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Like the witches portrayed
in the world of entertainment

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:43.160 align:middle line:84%
can be really inspiring
and exciting and fun.

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:44.200 align:middle line:90%
Or it can be scary.

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.470 align:middle line:90%
It just depends.

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:46.610 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Absolutely.

00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of young people love
some of those kinds of movies.

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:54.297 align:middle line:84%
They love the vampire
movies, the witches movies,

00:41:54.297 --> 00:41:55.130 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:57.070 align:middle line:84%
How about another
question for Fiona?

00:41:57.070 --> 00:41:58.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:41:58.590 --> 00:42:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Years ago, I had
read some books by Sybil Leek

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:03.750 align:middle line:90%
and really enjoyed those.

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:05.870 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering, who
were your role models?

00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And other than the TV
shows, who did you read

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:13.150 align:middle line:84%
and who helped you
with your craft?

00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:14.590 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Definitely Sybil Leek.

00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Definitely a huge
fan of her writings.

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:21.310 align:middle line:84%
The very first book I ever
bought, or was discovered,

00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:23.030 align:middle line:84%
I guess, because I
felt I was led to it

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:25.550 align:middle line:84%
was called "Way of the
Goddess" by Lady Angeles.

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And she's a which in
Australia, that I,

00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:31.390 align:middle line:84%
a few years after reading her
book, I was privileged to meet.

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:33.290 align:middle line:90%
And an extraordinary woman.

00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:35.310 align:middle line:90%
A wise woman.

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And still, I consider
a mentor in her work.

00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:40.045 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're not
as close in touch,

00:42:40.045 --> 00:42:41.670 align:middle line:84%
because I'm obviously
not in Australia.

00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:45.500 align:middle line:84%
But I keep an eye on what
she's doing on the internet.

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And also Starhawk,
"Spiral Dance," classic.

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:53.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, that
book is just so amazing.

00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:57.020 align:middle line:84%
I love Scott Cunningham's books
about "Magical Herbalism,"

00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:00.010 align:middle line:84%
or magical herbs, as
we say in America.

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And Raymond Buckland,
another author.

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Gerald Gardner, of course,
because of the early writings

00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:06.880 align:middle line:90%
on witchcraft.

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:10.856 align:middle line:84%
And I enjoyed, it
was Alex Sanders.

00:43:10.856 --> 00:43:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Didn't they, he
and Maxine wrote,

00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:16.040 align:middle line:84%
no, it was Gavin and Janet
Farrar, that's right,

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:18.270 align:middle line:84%
it was Stewart and Janet
who wrote "What Withes Do."

00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:22.570 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of those older
texts I was very inspired by.

00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And I love some of
the newer stuff.

00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:28.120 align:middle line:84%
When I first got into it, it
was very-- like in Australia,

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.210 align:middle line:90%
no one talked about it.

00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:30.835 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for me to
find a book about it,

00:43:30.835 --> 00:43:33.635 align:middle line:84%
I had to kind of burrow
through a market stall

00:43:33.635 --> 00:43:35.540 align:middle line:84%
and find this-- the
very first book I got

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:37.855 align:middle line:84%
was actually "The Sixth Sense
and Us" by Justine Glass.

00:43:37.855 --> 00:43:39.921 align:middle line:90%
And it was in a market.

00:43:39.921 --> 00:43:40.670 align:middle line:90%
And I had no idea.

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:42.679 align:middle line:90%
And it was publish in like 1963.

00:43:42.679 --> 00:43:44.720 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of that stuff,
early stuff I was reading

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:46.090 align:middle line:90%
was old stuff like that.

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And there was also a
self-published book,

00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:51.630 align:middle line:84%
or they was a zine,
actually, called "Shadowplay"

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:53.360 align:middle line:84%
that was edited by
Bill Beatty and Rhea.

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And again, it was
all very underground.

00:43:56.070 --> 00:44:00.647 align:middle line:84%
And then as I kind of got--
it's been-- I mean, I'm 46 now.

00:44:00.647 --> 00:44:02.480 align:middle line:84%
I was getting into this
stuff when I was 18.

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:05.810 align:middle line:84%
It's been a long
time, in linear time.

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:09.410 align:middle line:84%
So I'm always excited to
read new material by people.

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And as I kind of, you know, I'm
working on another book now.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And I can see how much my
personal practice of the craft

00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:17.170 align:middle line:84%
and perception of
the craft has changed

00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:19.090 align:middle line:84%
over more than a
quarter century.

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:21.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's always growing,
evolving, and changing.

00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:23.675 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I love those
old books, Fiona,

00:44:23.675 --> 00:44:25.720 align:middle line:90%
those old books on witchcraft.

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:30.192 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you open it up and they
just feel spooky on the inside.

00:44:30.192 --> 00:44:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Well,
it's spooky inside.

00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:33.717 align:middle line:84%
I love the wisdom and
the history of it.

00:44:33.717 --> 00:44:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And also, it's very
interesting to see how the way

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:37.870 align:middle line:90%
we use words differently.

00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:39.240 align:middle line:90%
I also collect dictionaries.

00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:40.074 align:middle line:90%
I love dictionaries.

00:44:40.074 --> 00:44:41.656 align:middle line:84%
People say, what's
your favorite book?

00:44:41.656 --> 00:44:42.560 align:middle line:90%
I say the dictionary.

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:44.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's just
it's so fascinating.

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.071 align:middle line:90%
And I collect them.

00:44:45.071 --> 00:44:47.020 align:middle line:84%
I've got some, a
couple of new ones

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:48.930 align:middle line:90%
I got from 1946 that I like.

00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:52.160 align:middle line:84%
Just so interesting to see how
words change and their usages

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:53.887 align:middle line:90%
change in modern society.

00:44:53.887 --> 00:44:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You said you
read the tarot cards.

00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:57.090 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Yes.

00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:58.710 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What's
that death card like?

00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:59.550 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Ah, death card?

00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:01.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, it just means
transformation, rebirth.

00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:03.320 align:middle line:90%
It rarely literally means death.

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:06.161 align:middle line:84%
It always depends on where, you
know, the combination of cards

00:45:06.161 --> 00:45:07.660 align:middle line:84%
and where they're
placed in a spread

00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:10.050 align:middle line:90%
and how I'm interpreting them.

00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:12.440 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, death, generally,
I see as rebirth, change.

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.950 align:middle line:84%
It could mean-- the tower
card is the one that's gnarly.

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:17.180 align:middle line:84%
That's destruction and
chaos and calamity.

00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:19.580 align:middle line:84%
I've had that a few times
in the last few months--

00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:20.620 align:middle line:90%
last 12 months.

00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:23.910 align:middle line:84%
But you know, at every
ending is another beginning.

00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When you do the
tarot cards with an individual,

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:29.360 align:middle line:84%
do they pick the card,
or do you pick the card?

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:30.943 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: I generally
have them do it.

00:45:30.943 --> 00:45:33.556 align:middle line:84%
I'll have them shuffle
the card into three piles,

00:45:33.556 --> 00:45:35.680 align:middle line:84%
the cards into three piles,
put them back together,

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:36.570 align:middle line:90%
and then I throw.

00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:40.490 align:middle line:84%
But I do a lot of, I actually
read tarot and do consulting.

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:41.930 align:middle line:90%
It's part of my work, I guess.

00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:44.290 align:middle line:90%
I help others with that insight.

00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:48.247 align:middle line:84%
And I have a lot of clients
on the phone or over Skype.

00:45:48.247 --> 00:45:49.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the blessings
of the internet.

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:51.954 align:middle line:84%
When I started in the craft,
there was no internet.

00:45:51.954 --> 00:45:54.544 align:middle line:84%
Or its was going at
like one megabyte.

00:45:54.544 --> 00:45:55.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one, what
is it, kilobyte.

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:57.590 align:middle line:90%
Those little tiny kilobytes.

00:45:57.590 --> 00:46:01.060 align:middle line:84%
One kilobyte per hour, type
speed, it was really slow.

00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:02.690 align:middle line:84%
But now, with the
internet, you can

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:06.332 align:middle line:84%
have clients like
Skyping and on the phone.

00:46:06.332 --> 00:46:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I have clients
all over the world.

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And in that case, I
would shuffle for them.

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't really
make too much difference.

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:12.990 align:middle line:90%
Its energy.

00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:14.531 align:middle line:84%
It's just getting
out of your own way

00:46:14.531 --> 00:46:17.420 align:middle line:84%
and letting, I guess, the
veils between the world's part,

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:19.940 align:middle line:84%
and finding out what
you need to find out.

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:21.330 align:middle line:90%
I always see it as guidance.

00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:22.890 align:middle line:84%
I usually, what
I'll say, quickly,

00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:24.490 align:middle line:84%
is when I read for
someone, I say,

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:26.547 align:middle line:84%
consider me a bit
like a meteorologist.

00:46:26.547 --> 00:46:28.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to look
at the high pressure

00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:30.740 align:middle line:84%
system, the low pressure system,
the cold front, the warm front,

00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:32.550 align:middle line:84%
and tell you whether it's likely
going to rain in your life

00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:34.300 align:middle line:84%
tomorrow, whether
you need an umbrella.

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that can
change, everything does.

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:39.020 align:middle line:84%
I never claimed to
be 100% accurate.

00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:41.228 align:middle line:84%
But I say, I'm usually more
accurate than the weather

00:46:41.228 --> 00:46:41.830 align:middle line:90%
report.

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah, it's
picking up on energies.

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I've
had this same deck

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:49.520 align:middle line:90%
of cards for over 25 years.

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:50.800 align:middle line:90%
I read that same deck.

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.681 align:middle line:84%
And it's so old
and rubbed off, you

00:46:52.681 --> 00:46:54.180 align:middle line:84%
can barely see the
pictures anymore.

00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:57.510 align:middle line:84%
But I still get the reading
I need to help the client.

00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:59.450 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You are a good witch.

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:01.160 align:middle line:84%
There's no evil
about you, at all.

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:01.750 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: No.

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:02.541 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: No, none.

00:47:02.541 --> 00:47:03.890 align:middle line:90%
So what did you bring us here?

00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:07.007 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Well, this is
a basic witch's altar.

00:47:07.007 --> 00:47:08.840 align:middle line:84%
We were talking a little
earlier in the show

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:10.412 align:middle line:90%
about what you put on an altar.

00:47:10.412 --> 00:47:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking
about the four elements

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:13.542 align:middle line:90%
of air, earth, fire, and water.

00:47:13.542 --> 00:47:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Now depending on how
structured you want to be,

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:18.780 align:middle line:84%
there can be very specific
ways of placing them

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:23.090 align:middle line:84%
in certain compass points,
north, south, east, and west.

00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:24.920 align:middle line:84%
But I've always said
to people, sometimes

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:27.800 align:middle line:84%
people use all the
particular stuff

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:29.720 align:middle line:84%
as being a way to
procrastinate and not

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:31.120 align:middle line:90%
actually get anything done.

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.292 align:middle line:84%
And usually with
modern witchcraft,

00:47:33.292 --> 00:47:34.500 align:middle line:90%
you just want to get started.

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:35.670 align:middle line:90%
You want to get into it.

00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:37.870 align:middle line:84%
So I always say, when
you cast a circle,

00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:39.490 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of set
outside of time.

00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:41.390 align:middle line:84%
You cast circle as
sacred space that

00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:43.250 align:middle line:90%
exists outside of linear time.

00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:46.140 align:middle line:84%
There's no past, present,
or future in it, it just is.

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:47.620 align:middle line:90%
It just is everything.

00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And in that case,
it doesn't really

00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:51.480 align:middle line:84%
need to be structured
with the north, south,

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:53.340 align:middle line:90%
east, and west orientation.

00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:54.230 align:middle line:90%
Just get it going.

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:56.605 align:middle line:84%
And understand that there are
these four sacred elements.

00:47:56.605 --> 00:47:58.420 align:middle line:84%
The fifth, you could
consider as spirit,

00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:00.150 align:middle line:90%
your presence in the circle.

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:02.950 align:middle line:84%
So these four things
are represented here.

00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:04.846 align:middle line:84%
Water, obviously,
in this bowl here,

00:48:04.846 --> 00:48:06.720 align:middle line:84%
with the shell in it,
representing the ocean.

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:08.160 align:middle line:90%
There's a little salt in there.

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:09.209 align:middle line:90%
It's honoring the ocean.

00:48:09.209 --> 00:48:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Can I touch it?

00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:11.180 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Yeah, you can.

00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Will
anything happen to me?

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:12.471 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: No.

00:48:12.471 --> 00:48:13.430 align:middle line:90%
Well, good stuff.

00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:15.810 align:middle line:84%
I've had this
actual bowl was made

00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:17.420 align:middle line:84%
by my dear girlfriend,
Wendy Hanham.

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:18.920 align:middle line:84%
She's a glass blower,
and she set it

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:21.620 align:middle line:84%
in this beautiful
stand of rose thorns.

00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And that is, she gave that to
me when I was in my early 20's.

00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:27.939 align:middle line:84%
So it's over 20 years
old, it's travel

00:48:27.939 --> 00:48:28.980 align:middle line:90%
around the world with me.

00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's here, today, in the
Gaiam TV studios with you.

00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:33.550 align:middle line:90%
So that represents water.

00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:36.440 align:middle line:84%
A lot of my staff
has kind of-- what's

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:39.964 align:middle line:84%
the word when something is old
and it has that lovely energy?

00:48:39.964 --> 00:48:42.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm blanking on the word--
but you know what I mean.

00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:44.490 align:middle line:84%
It's just got that
lovely sense of memory.

00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:47.290 align:middle line:84%
This altar cloth here, you
can see it's a bit tattered.

00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:48.385 align:middle line:90%
It's got holes in it.

00:48:48.385 --> 00:48:50.360 align:middle line:84%
But it's my original
altar cloth from...

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:51.330 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:52.920 align:middle line:84%
I've had that since
I was a teenager.

00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And I keep it, and I usually
wrap my tarot cards in it.

00:48:56.110 --> 00:48:58.520 align:middle line:84%
But I just I keep it
clean, I gently wash it.

00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:02.920 align:middle line:84%
But it has that sort of that
energy of memory and presence.

00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:05.710 align:middle line:84%
Fire is represented by
the candle, obviously.

00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:07.320 align:middle line:84%
So that's another
sacred element.

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:09.110 align:middle line:84%
We have earth
represented by crystals.

00:49:09.110 --> 00:49:10.610 align:middle line:90%
I have this amethyst crystal.

00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And this actually is a
piece of petrified fruit

00:49:13.290 --> 00:49:15.820 align:middle line:84%
from Mount Warning, which is
the sacred aboriginal site

00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:17.410 align:middle line:90%
in Australia.

00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:19.960 align:middle line:84%
It's the highest mountain
on the East Coast.

00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:21.915 align:middle line:84%
So it's the first place
to see the sun rise.

00:49:21.915 --> 00:49:22.540 align:middle line:90%
And it's just--

00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: This is
hard as a rock.

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:24.020 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Yeah.

00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:25.490 align:middle line:84%
So I consider it the
element of earth.

00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:26.865 align:middle line:84%
It was brought up
from the earth.

00:49:26.865 --> 00:49:28.150 align:middle line:90%
But it's petrified fruit.

00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:30.972 align:middle line:84%
And the Australian aborigines
used to see Mount Warning,

00:49:30.972 --> 00:49:33.430 align:middle line:84%
and see all the thunderstorms
up there, and the lightening,

00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:34.780 align:middle line:90%
because it was so high.

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And they would think that the
warrior gods were fighting up

00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:38.090 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:49:38.090 --> 00:49:39.720 align:middle line:90%
So it's a very sacred space.

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:42.729 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to procure this
petrified fruit from up there.

00:49:42.729 --> 00:49:43.770 align:middle line:90%
So that represents earth.

00:49:43.770 --> 00:49:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's travel
around the world with me

00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:46.720 align:middle line:90%
for many, many years.

00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:48.482 align:middle line:84%
I've had that for
20 years, as well.

00:49:48.482 --> 00:49:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And we also have the
element of air represented

00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:54.620 align:middle line:84%
by incense, which
it's going out a bit.

00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:56.460 align:middle line:84%
So incense can represent
the element or air,

00:49:56.460 --> 00:50:00.134 align:middle line:84%
or even like a feather,
something like that.

00:50:00.134 --> 00:50:01.800 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So that's
what I smell, right?

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:03.299 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Yeah,
it's nice, isn't it?

00:50:03.299 --> 00:50:05.220 align:middle line:90%
It's pinon.

00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:06.939 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Getting a
little high, here.

00:50:06.939 --> 00:50:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Well, I'm
actually a sober witch.

00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:09.830 align:middle line:90%
You bring up a good point.

00:50:09.830 --> 00:50:12.446 align:middle line:84%
I don't drink and I don't
do drugs, I'm sober.

00:50:12.446 --> 00:50:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Good.

00:50:13.070 --> 00:50:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: And I consider
that a spiritual calling.

00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:18.690 align:middle line:84%
So I have really refined
my spiritual practice

00:50:18.690 --> 00:50:21.150 align:middle line:84%
to embrace my sobriety in
a way that is, I think,

00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:24.335 align:middle line:84%
really rewarding and it allows
me to be a better person.

00:50:24.335 --> 00:50:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And also-- I promise you,
there's no drugs in it.

00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:30.626 align:middle line:84%
And also just more--
sometimes people

00:50:30.626 --> 00:50:32.000 align:middle line:84%
think you've got
to get out of it

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.480 align:middle line:84%
to have a transcendental
experience.

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:36.576 align:middle line:84%
The more sober I am, the
more out of it I feel.

00:50:36.576 --> 00:50:37.450 align:middle line:90%
Life's extraordinary.

00:50:37.450 --> 00:50:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You lose control.

00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:39.075 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Yeah.

00:50:39.075 --> 00:50:42.110 align:middle line:84%
I just, I love being out to
have a tangible experience

00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:44.224 align:middle line:84%
of the beautiful
sacredness of life.

00:50:44.224 --> 00:50:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's so much
more intense when

00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:49.160 align:middle line:84%
it's not diluted by
drugs or alcohol.

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:51.420 align:middle line:84%
The other thing I have
here is the pentagram.

00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:53.239 align:middle line:84%
It's a five pointed
start on a disk.

00:50:53.239 --> 00:50:54.530 align:middle line:90%
This was given to me, actually.

00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:56.364 align:middle line:84%
He used to be-- I
think he called himself

00:50:56.364 --> 00:50:58.780 align:middle line:84%
a wizard, funnily enough, to
the lady in the audience that

00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:00.045 align:middle line:90%
asked that question.

00:51:00.045 --> 00:51:01.410 align:middle line:90%
But he gave me this necklace.

00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:03.335 align:middle line:84%
And I just love it because
it's the pentagram.

00:51:03.335 --> 00:51:04.410 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It looks heavy.

00:51:04.410 --> 00:51:05.618 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: It's not too heavy.

00:51:05.618 --> 00:51:09.970 align:middle line:84%
But I keep that on the altar as
a symbol of the four elements

00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:12.920 align:middle line:84%
involving spirit, as well,
the five-pointed star.

00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:14.190 align:middle line:90%
So that's there.

00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:15.360 align:middle line:90%
And then this I love too.

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:16.290 align:middle line:90%
I feel very blessed.

00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:17.620 align:middle line:90%
This was a gift.

00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:19.750 align:middle line:84%
A couple of gorgeous
witches made this for me.

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's a wand with
this beautiful smoky

00:51:22.310 --> 00:51:23.990 align:middle line:84%
quartz crystal on
the end, a dragon

00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:27.370 align:middle line:84%
because I have a dragon
tattooed on my arm, up here.

00:51:27.370 --> 00:51:28.990 align:middle line:90%
I had that a long time ago.

00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And that represents the
four elements, as well.

00:51:32.650 --> 00:51:35.080 align:middle line:84%
But I love the
symbolism of the dragon.

00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:37.372 align:middle line:84%
And so they put this
dragon around the wand.

00:51:37.372 --> 00:51:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And then they put me on, with
my wings and my-- because I'm

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:41.762 align:middle line:84%
a scuba diver, I
love spending time

00:51:41.762 --> 00:51:43.720 align:middle line:84%
in the ocean-- they put
things fins on my feet,

00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:46.510 align:middle line:84%
wings on my back, and a
snake-- my snake, Lulu,

00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:48.260 align:middle line:84%
she's in Australia
now-- on my arm.

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:49.570 align:middle line:90%
So that's my wand.

00:51:49.570 --> 00:51:50.420 align:middle line:90%
See, they're fun.

00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:51.930 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be--
I've got an athame as well,

00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:52.830 align:middle line:90%
a double-bladed knife.

00:51:52.830 --> 00:51:54.038 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Cast a spell on us.

00:51:54.038 --> 00:51:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: But I wanted
to bring my wand.

00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:59.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's for casting circle
and channeling energy and using

00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:02.589 align:middle line:90%
it to transform and create.

00:52:02.589 --> 00:52:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And then the other thing,
I'll show you really quickly,

00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:06.830 align:middle line:84%
because we were talking about
it before, my good old trusty

00:52:06.830 --> 00:52:07.450 align:middle line:90%
tarot cards.

00:52:07.450 --> 00:52:09.283 align:middle line:84%
Like, I don't know if
you can see on camera,

00:52:09.283 --> 00:52:11.060 align:middle line:84%
but these are really,
they are really old.

00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:12.070 align:middle line:90%
Can you see?

00:52:12.070 --> 00:52:13.330 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They look ancient.

00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:14.800 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Yeah, over 25 years.

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:15.883 align:middle line:90%
Give them a quick shuffle.

00:52:15.883 --> 00:52:18.260 align:middle line:90%
Let's get a quick read on you.

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:19.310 align:middle line:90%
Three card draw.

00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:21.018 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Will they
help me in Blackjack?

00:52:21.018 --> 00:52:21.960 align:middle line:90%
That's the question.

00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:23.430 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Let's see how good you
can shuffle them to tell-- oh,

00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:23.930 align:middle line:90%
hang on.

00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:25.295 align:middle line:90%
You're flipping them already.

00:52:25.295 --> 00:52:26.709 align:middle line:90%
Because you can't see the image.

00:52:26.709 --> 00:52:27.250 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:52:27.250 --> 00:52:27.800 align:middle line:90%
Flip them that way.

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:29.696 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: If you
can shuffle good,

00:52:29.696 --> 00:52:31.686 align:middle line:84%
we'll know you're
a good gambler.

00:52:31.686 --> 00:52:33.200 align:middle line:90%
He's not too bad.

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Not bad.

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:34.491 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: OK.

00:52:34.491 --> 00:52:35.434 align:middle line:90%
Cut them into three.

00:52:35.434 --> 00:52:36.267 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:52:36.267 --> 00:52:38.127 align:middle line:90%


00:52:38.127 --> 00:52:39.210 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Nice, all right.

00:52:39.210 --> 00:52:40.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do a
three card split.

00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:41.396 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: There we go.

00:52:41.396 --> 00:52:42.740 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Oh, wheel of fortune.

00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:43.110 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Uh, huh.

00:52:43.110 --> 00:52:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: That means a
big win ahead for you.

00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:45.270 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't suck.

00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:47.534 align:middle line:90%


00:52:47.534 --> 00:52:48.200 align:middle line:90%
All right, nice.

00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:49.372 align:middle line:90%
Oh, and how interesting.

00:52:49.372 --> 00:52:50.830 align:middle line:84%
So you've got the
wheel of fortune.

00:52:50.830 --> 00:52:51.371 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:52:51.371 --> 00:52:53.881 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: You've got the seven
of coins, which is about--

00:52:53.881 --> 00:52:56.380 align:middle line:84%
it can generally mean a little
bit of an imbalance in money.

00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:57.838 align:middle line:84%
So if we're talking
about gambling,

00:52:57.838 --> 00:53:00.250 align:middle line:84%
it's meaning exercising caution
in your gambling efforts.

00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:02.530 align:middle line:84%
But you are blessed by
the wheel of fortune.

00:53:02.530 --> 00:53:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll final
card is temperance,

00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:06.544 align:middle line:84%
which means avoid excesses
of food and alcohol.

00:53:06.544 --> 00:53:07.835 align:middle line:90%
We were talking about sobriety.

00:53:07.835 --> 00:53:09.220 align:middle line:84%
So don't be drunk
when you gamble

00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:10.100 align:middle line:90%
and you can expect a good win.

00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:11.200 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I don't drink
a lot or eat a lot.

00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.006 align:middle line:90%
So good.

00:53:12.006 --> 00:53:13.217 align:middle line:90%
But it's a warning, right?

00:53:13.217 --> 00:53:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: It's a warning, don't
be drunk when you're gambling.

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Perfect.

00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: And then
you'll do all right.

00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:18.110 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:20.190 align:middle line:84%
So can you do a little
spell on the audience?

00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Yes, well,
with the audience.

00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:22.615 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What would you
like to do with the audience,

00:53:22.615 --> 00:53:22.890 align:middle line:90%
all right.

00:53:22.890 --> 00:53:24.431 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Yes, if
they would like to.

00:53:24.431 --> 00:53:27.020 align:middle line:84%
Because it's something
that, again, it

00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:29.040 align:middle line:84%
has to be consented
to and free will.

00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:30.540 align:middle line:84%
So it can either--
I guess, are we

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:32.030 align:middle line:90%
keeping everyone in their seats?

00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:53:32.530 --> 00:53:32.780 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Let's do that.

00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:33.370 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: OK.

00:53:33.370 --> 00:53:35.570 align:middle line:90%
So are you all into it?

00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:36.604 align:middle line:90%
It's very benign.

00:53:36.604 --> 00:53:37.520 align:middle line:90%
We got some thumbs up.

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:37.940 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:39.190 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: All right,
they're ready for us.

00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: Yeah, so what we're
going to do with the spell,

00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:42.720 align:middle line:90%
and again, it's with not on.

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:45.310 align:middle line:84%
So I think for the
purposes of this,

00:53:45.310 --> 00:53:47.860 align:middle line:84%
we can do it like we're going
to create a sacred space.

00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:50.443 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to say a few things
and wave my arms around a bit

00:53:50.443 --> 00:53:51.780 align:middle line:90%
and do some stuff like that.

00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:53.238 align:middle line:84%
And then we're
going to-- I'm going

00:53:53.238 --> 00:53:55.740 align:middle line:84%
to ask you to visualize white
light forming around us.

00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:57.090 align:middle line:90%
I'll say it in the ritual.

00:53:57.090 --> 00:53:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to think
about something we really want

00:53:59.590 --> 00:54:00.660 align:middle line:90%
and come up with one word.

00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:02.040 align:middle line:84%
So start thinking
about that now:

00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:04.079 align:middle line:84%
one word that describes
something that you feel

00:54:04.079 --> 00:54:05.370 align:middle line:90%
would really enhance your life.

00:54:05.370 --> 00:54:08.370 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe if you know someone
who is in pain or suffering,

00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:11.130 align:middle line:84%
one word that describes
what they're going through

00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:13.520 align:middle line:84%
and how you would like
them to be healed.

00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:15.690 align:middle line:90%
It can be someone's name even.

00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:16.462 align:middle line:90%
But just one word.

00:54:16.462 --> 00:54:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And what we're
going to do is we're

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:19.610 align:middle line:84%
going to raise power
in the sacred circle.

00:54:19.610 --> 00:54:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And at a point, I'm going to
get you to call out that word.

00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to send all that
good positive transformative

00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:27.200 align:middle line:84%
energy into that situation
represented by the word.

00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:28.290 align:middle line:90%
Does that sound OK?

00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:29.040 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Perfect.

00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:30.144 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Yes?

00:54:30.144 --> 00:54:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Let's do it.

00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:32.010 align:middle line:84%
>> HORNE: All right,
shall we do it?

00:54:32.010 --> 00:54:32.804 align:middle line:90%
Can I stand up?

00:54:32.804 --> 00:54:33.970 align:middle line:90%
Am I allowed to move around?

00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Absolutely.

00:54:34.690 --> 00:54:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Okee doke.

00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:38.040 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to just get
the incense going again.

00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:41.496 align:middle line:90%


00:54:41.496 --> 00:54:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to have
to get a bit loud with me.

00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to transform this
studio from a quiet, reflective

00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:50.640 align:middle line:84%
space into something
a bit ruckus.

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:53.030 align:middle line:84%
Because, when in witchcraft
we raise power in circle,

00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:56.406 align:middle line:84%
it means we kind of want to
build some energy up, you know?

00:54:56.406 --> 00:54:57.220 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:59.210 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to use
my fabulous wand.

00:54:59.210 --> 00:55:01.970 align:middle line:84%
So everyone close
your eyes for a minute

00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:03.200 align:middle line:90%
and take a few deep breaths.

00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:06.870 align:middle line:90%


00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And just have both your feet
planted firmly on the floor.

00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:11.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:14.362 align:middle line:84%
We're in a studio with
concrete and cement and all

00:55:14.362 --> 00:55:16.070 align:middle line:84%
that good stuff, but
I want you visualize

00:55:16.070 --> 00:55:19.130 align:middle line:84%
plugging in to a sense of
earth underneath our feet.

00:55:19.130 --> 00:55:23.250 align:middle line:84%
A beautiful sense of
solid, reliable earth,

00:55:23.250 --> 00:55:25.413 align:middle line:84%
strong earth that
grounds us and anchors us

00:55:25.413 --> 00:55:27.570 align:middle line:90%
in the physical realm.

00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:32.164 align:middle line:84%
So take a nice deep breath in
and draw in that earth energy.

00:55:32.164 --> 00:55:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And now, at the same time, I
want you to consider or think

00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:36.060 align:middle line:84%
about the top of
your head and feel

00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:39.080 align:middle line:84%
that it's like opening
up to receive abundance.

00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's plugging into that
energy of the sky and all

00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:43.730 align:middle line:84%
the space that our
Earth is suspended in.

00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:46.829 align:middle line:90%


00:55:46.829 --> 00:55:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And now when you
have that connection

00:55:48.370 --> 00:55:51.025 align:middle line:84%
with your head opened up,
receiving abundance, love,

00:55:51.025 --> 00:55:53.260 align:middle line:84%
and enlightenment, and your
feet anchored and solid

00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:55.530 align:middle line:84%
and grounded in
the earth, I want

00:55:55.530 --> 00:55:58.630 align:middle line:84%
you to visualize a sphere of
white light forming around us,

00:55:58.630 --> 00:56:00.760 align:middle line:84%
above and below
us, to our sides.

00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:02.990 align:middle line:84%
It's like a big
egg-shaped sphere even.

00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And we're circled in
this beautiful space.

00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:08.618 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to cast circle.

00:56:08.618 --> 00:56:11.790 align:middle line:84%
I conjure thee,
circle, so that you

00:56:11.790 --> 00:56:13.810 align:middle line:84%
may be a boundary
between the realms

00:56:13.810 --> 00:56:16.240 align:middle line:84%
of the everyday and
the eternal planes.

00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:18.850 align:middle line:90%


00:56:18.850 --> 00:56:22.910 align:middle line:84%
A space of joy, peace,
enlightenment, transformation.

00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:25.630 align:middle line:90%
The circle is bound and blessed.

00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:28.540 align:middle line:90%
So mote it be.

00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:31.310 align:middle line:84%
So visualize that
lovely energy around us.

00:56:31.310 --> 00:56:34.230 align:middle line:90%


00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And then in this space
I'm going to just honor

00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:37.680 align:middle line:90%
the four elements.

00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:40.276 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to honor the
element of air in the east.

00:56:40.276 --> 00:56:44.250 align:middle line:90%


00:56:44.250 --> 00:56:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just tracing a
pentagram with the air.

00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:50.590 align:middle line:84%
Again, this sacred
symbol of enlightenment,

00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:51.865 align:middle line:90%
the five-pointed star.

00:56:51.865 --> 00:56:54.750 align:middle line:90%


00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:56.405 align:middle line:90%
And I honor earth in the north.

00:56:56.405 --> 00:57:03.810 align:middle line:90%


00:57:03.810 --> 00:57:05.080 align:middle line:90%
I honor water in the west.

00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:10.792 align:middle line:90%


00:57:10.792 --> 00:57:15.434 align:middle line:84%
This big heavy candle--
and fire in the south.

00:57:15.434 --> 00:57:18.840 align:middle line:84%
The circle is bound and
blessed by the four elements.

00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And we have their transformative
powers with us in this space.

00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:25.630 align:middle line:84%
So now I'd like you to think
of one word that describes--

00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:28.350 align:middle line:84%
if you've already thought of it,
that's awesome, hang onto it.

00:57:28.350 --> 00:57:30.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to think of one.

00:57:30.370 --> 00:57:33.039 align:middle line:84%
And again, we're thinking
about transforming,

00:57:33.039 --> 00:57:35.455 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to raise
energy in circle in a minute.

00:57:35.455 --> 00:57:36.871 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get
loud, and we're

00:57:36.871 --> 00:57:38.288 align:middle line:84%
going to move
around a little bit.

00:57:38.288 --> 00:57:40.537 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to think
about this energy bubbling up

00:57:40.537 --> 00:57:41.540 align:middle line:90%
inside our sacred space.

00:57:41.540 --> 00:57:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And at a point, we're
going to release it out

00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:44.387 align:middle line:90%
into the rest of the world.

00:57:44.387 --> 00:57:45.970 align:middle line:84%
Because we've actually
created a space

00:57:45.970 --> 00:57:49.320 align:middle line:84%
set outside of time now, in
this sacred space that we're in.

00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:50.900 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
think about letting

00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:53.420 align:middle line:84%
the transformative energy
be released and transform

00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:55.860 align:middle line:84%
a situation that's represented
by our sacred word.

00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:58.270 align:middle line:84%
So we, again, we all
have a sacred word?

00:57:58.270 --> 00:57:58.900 align:middle line:90%
We're all good?

00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:00.850 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:58:00.850 --> 00:58:01.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:58:01.350 --> 00:58:03.350 align:middle line:84%
So how do we want
to raise energy?

00:58:03.350 --> 00:58:06.070 align:middle line:84%
I think we might stamp our
feet and clap our hands.

00:58:06.070 --> 00:58:08.290 align:middle line:84%
Again, remembering that
we're building energy up.

00:58:08.290 --> 00:58:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And our bodies are
tactile, tangible things

00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:15.830 align:middle line:84%
that can create and
transform, as well.

00:58:15.830 --> 00:58:17.580 align:middle line:84%
So why don't we start
by stamping our feet

00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:19.040 align:middle line:90%
and clapping our hands?

00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:22.380 align:middle line:90%


00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And really picture this
energy building up.

00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:28.800 align:middle line:90%


00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:31.570 align:middle line:90%
More and more.

00:58:31.570 --> 00:58:33.390 align:middle line:90%
Think about your sacred word.

00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:37.244 align:middle line:90%


00:58:37.244 --> 00:58:40.702 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready, I want
you to throw your hands up

00:58:40.702 --> 00:58:43.666 align:middle line:84%
in the air and scream
that word to the skies.

00:58:43.666 --> 00:58:46.630 align:middle line:90%
One, two, three, healing.

00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:50.590 align:middle line:90%


00:58:50.590 --> 00:58:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And the circle is
open, but unbroken.

00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:56.102 align:middle line:90%
Carried within our hearts.

00:58:56.102 --> 00:58:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And if you'd like to place
your hands over your heart

00:58:58.310 --> 00:59:00.360 align:middle line:84%
right now and just take
a nice deep breath in.

00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:03.090 align:middle line:90%


00:59:03.090 --> 00:59:07.550 align:middle line:84%
For the good of all, with harm
to none, the magic has begun.

00:59:07.550 --> 00:59:09.820 align:middle line:90%
So mote it be.

00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:12.605 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, everyone.

00:59:12.605 --> 00:59:14.649 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Thank you, Fiona.

00:59:14.649 --> 00:59:15.940 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: That was really good.

00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:17.310 align:middle line:90%
I thought you guys were awesome.

00:59:17.310 --> 00:59:18.410 align:middle line:90%
I could feel the energy then.

00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:19.190 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I could feel it.

00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:20.090 align:middle line:90%
I could feel it.

00:59:20.090 --> 00:59:23.342 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to ask you,
can you make me disappear?

00:59:23.342 --> 00:59:24.550 align:middle line:90%
>> HORNE: Goodness, gracious.

00:59:24.550 --> 00:59:25.924 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
hardest spells.

00:59:25.924 --> 00:59:27.630 align:middle line:84%
But being that I am
a practiced witch,

00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:29.010 align:middle line:90%
I think I could manage it.

00:59:29.010 --> 00:59:30.120 align:middle line:90%
All right, give it a try.

00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:30.620 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:32.911 align:middle line:84%
Well, I need everyone in the
audience to help me again.

00:59:32.911 --> 00:59:35.539 align:middle line:84%
So let's just take
a deep breath.

00:59:35.539 --> 00:59:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
need you to call out

00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:39.205 align:middle line:84%
George disappear with
me, I need your help.

00:59:39.205 --> 00:59:40.830 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it's just
not going to work.

00:59:40.830 --> 00:59:42.460 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:44.432 align:middle line:90%
So a nice deep breath.

00:59:44.432 --> 00:59:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And when I snap my fingers, call
out with me, George disappear.

00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:49.320 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:53.586 align:middle line:84%
One, two, three,
George disappear.

00:59:53.586 --> 00:59:55.000 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Hey, where am I?

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:56.400 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:59.670 align:middle line:84%
Oh well, thanks for
watching "Beyond Belief"

00:59:59.670 --> 01:00:00.820 align:middle line:90%
with Fiona Horne.

01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:02.500 align:middle line:90%
She really is a witch.

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:04.000 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.900 align:middle line:90%


01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:26.838 align:middle line:90%
