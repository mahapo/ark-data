>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.930 align:middle line:10%
George Noory with you with a
very special guest, Dr. Bruce

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:29.730 align:middle line:10%
Goldberg.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.880 align:middle line:10%
He has advanced
degrees in dentistry

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.640 align:middle line:10%
and a master's in
counseling psychology.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And he conducts an international
hypnotherapy practice based out

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.200 align:middle line:90%
of Los Angeles.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.690 align:middle line:84%
He is the author
of 21 books that

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.310 align:middle line:84%
have been translated into 21
languages all over this planet

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.510 align:middle line:84%
and has conducted more than
35,000 past life regressions

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.970 align:middle line:90%
and future life progressions.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.470 align:middle line:84%
Bruce, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUCE GOLDBERG:
Thank you, George.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.820 align:middle line:84%
It's always a pleasure
to reincarnate.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.195 align:middle line:84%
In effect, it's like beyond
belief to be back here again.

00:01:00.195 --> 00:01:02.153 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHS] You
are one of our favorites.

00:01:02.153 --> 00:01:04.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, I went in
the pre-dentistry

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.530 align:middle line:84%
at the University of Detroit
for a couple of years.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.230 align:middle line:84%
You devoted your entire
career to dentistry

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.228 align:middle line:84%
and then into this,
hypnotherapy and reincarnation.

00:01:13.228 --> 00:01:15.270 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about that transition
-- that's dramatic.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.020 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, the universe
works in mysterious ways.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.140 align:middle line:10%
I only practiced dentistry
for a few years full time.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.260 align:middle line:10%
I developed my past life
regression and future life

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.090 align:middle line:10%
progression
hypnotherapy practice

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.670 align:middle line:10%
while I was in dental
school, interestingly enough.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.950 align:middle line:84%
So the first couple of
years after a residency,

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.710 align:middle line:84%
I did dentistry full time, but
I had a part time practice.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.085 align:middle line:84%
And then after a
couple of years,

00:01:36.085 --> 00:01:38.490 align:middle line:90%
I said, no, I want to switch it.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.430 align:middle line:84%
So the universe was kind
enough thanks to certain media

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.360 align:middle line:90%
contexts I had.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.390 align:middle line:84%
I was doing interviews with
local radio and television

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.560 align:middle line:90%
and building up my practice.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.850 align:middle line:84%
I wrote my first book "Past
Lives, Future Lives" then.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.903 align:middle line:84%
So I've been doing
this for 45 years.

00:01:53.903 --> 00:01:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
made that switch

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.400 align:middle line:84%
after going through dentistry
school, which is very rigorous,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.830 align:middle line:84%
were your parents a
little upset with you?

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:02.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, no.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Really, my whole life
has been based on what

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.740 align:middle line:90%
I call psychic empowerment.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.560 align:middle line:84%
So I've always succeeded
in things that I've done.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not like I left
because I couldn't do it.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.030 align:middle line:84%
It's because I
developed something

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.850 align:middle line:84%
that was more
empowering to me as well

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.310 align:middle line:84%
as I like to think
empowerment to the universe.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.260 align:middle line:84%
The world does not
need another dentist.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260 align:middle line:84%
But the world does need
metaphysical experts

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.733 align:middle line:84%
and practitioners to help people
attain their own karmic growth.

00:02:28.733 --> 00:02:30.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I'll tell
you a brief story about me,

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.690 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll get into your
work as a hypnotherapist.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.240 align:middle line:84%
But while I was going to
the University of Detroit

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.180 align:middle line:84%
studying pre-dentistry,
my dad would always

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.130 align:middle line:90%
get my annual report cards.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.170 align:middle line:84%
They'd always show up
to him because he paid

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.690 align:middle line:90%
most of the student loan bills.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And one day, he called
me into the living room.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.030 align:middle line:84%
He said, George, got
a little problem here.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.710 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what's matter, dad?

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
whoever this person

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.470 align:middle line:84%
is, they're doing
great in broadcasting.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.680 align:middle line:84%
They're getting A's in
speech and radio technology

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.620 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.030 align:middle line:90%
But I got the wrong report card.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.010 align:middle line:90%
There's no dentistry courses.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.030 align:middle line:90%
There's no biology.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.620 align:middle line:90%
I got to call the school.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.600 align:middle line:84%
I said, dad, I switched my
major into broadcasting, which

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.825 align:middle line:90%
is what I always wanted to do.

00:03:16.825 --> 00:03:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And said, what do you mean
you switched your major?

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.810 align:middle line:84%
I said, I don't want
to be a dentist.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.150 align:middle line:90%
I want to be a broadcaster.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.223 align:middle line:84%
Bruce, he wouldn't talk
to me for two months.

00:03:25.223 --> 00:03:27.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes, but
look what you illustrate.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.500 align:middle line:84%
The universe-- you did very well
in the broadcasting courses.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.340 align:middle line:84%
It was your natural,
shall we say, direction.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And you not only were
rewarded because look

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.990 align:middle line:90%
what you are doing today.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Again, if you went
into dentistry,

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.450 align:middle line:84%
you would have
probably hated it.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.058 align:middle line:84%
And you may have been a
good dentist, but look at--

00:03:46.058 --> 00:03:47.600 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't have
empowered yourself.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.765 align:middle line:84%
Today, the universe gave you a
connection just like with me.

00:03:50.765 --> 00:03:51.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was my destiny.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: When I
was in dental school,

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.415 align:middle line:84%
they never said, oh, by the
way, Dr. Bruce Goldberg,

00:03:55.415 --> 00:03:57.290 align:middle line:84%
why don't you do
hypnotherapy and take people

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.970 align:middle line:90%
into the future?

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:58.210 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.450 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't one of
my classes in school.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: [LAUGHS]

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.650 align:middle line:84%
I learned one thing out
of this whole thing.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:04.550 align:middle line:90%
I have good teeth.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.000 align:middle line:90%
I still have them all.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.950 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I did.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.700 align:middle line:84%
But anyways, let's
talk about you

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.690 align:middle line:84%
because when you've
been on "Coast to Coast"

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.810 align:middle line:84%
with me or this program
"Beyond Belief,"

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.930 align:middle line:84%
you get an astounding,
astounding response

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.820 align:middle line:90%
to what you do.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.980 align:middle line:90%
You talk a lot about ascension.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.750 align:middle line:90%
What is ascension?

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: OK, so
why are we here?

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.980 align:middle line:84%
The main purpose,
people think that they

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.560 align:middle line:84%
want to raise a family,
pay their mortgage,

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.240 align:middle line:84%
support their
grandparents and stuff.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.408 align:middle line:90%
That's all fine.

00:04:33.408 --> 00:04:34.700 align:middle line:90%
But that's not the main reason.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.020 align:middle line:84%
The main reason why we here in
our physical body with a soul,

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.500 align:middle line:84%
which goes beyond the physical
body after clinical death,

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.430 align:middle line:84%
is to perfect a soul and
rejoin the god energy

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.550 align:middle line:90%
complex from whence we came.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.153 align:middle line:84%
In other words, to
eliminate the karmic cycle.

00:04:51.153 --> 00:04:52.070 align:middle line:90%
That's why we're here.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.480 align:middle line:90%
This is like a schoolhouse.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.650 align:middle line:90%
You have lessons to learn.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.750 align:middle line:84%
That's where
reincarnation comes in.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.480 align:middle line:84%
You did things in past
lives that were terrible,

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.336 align:middle line:90%
and you failed lessons.

00:05:02.336 --> 00:05:03.493 align:middle line:90%
People have done things.

00:05:03.493 --> 00:05:05.660 align:middle line:84%
But the point is they didn't
learn all their lessons

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.920 align:middle line:90%
or else they wouldn't be here.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.570 align:middle line:84%
This is a physical plane, the
lowest of all the dimensions.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.570 align:middle line:84%
We'll discuss the
dimensions in a moment.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.160 align:middle line:90%
But this is the lowest one.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.800 align:middle line:84%
This is the physical
lowest physical plane.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.790 align:middle line:90%
You can't teleport.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.360 align:middle line:84%
You can't fly unless you
do exotic techniques.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.790 align:middle line:90%
So we have to perfect a soul.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.030 align:middle line:84%
A soul has a debt just like
having a mortgage or the bills

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.900 align:middle line:90%
to pay.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.860 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of ascension is to
access your higher self, which

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.980 align:middle line:84%
also is known as the
superconscious mind, which

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.440 align:middle line:84%
will raise the quality
of the soul's energy

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.140 align:middle line:84%
just like an immune system
with an energy base.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
perfect the soul,

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.300 align:middle line:84%
learn all the karmic
lessons, wipe the debt clean,

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.690 align:middle line:84%
then you can go to what we
call the soul plane where

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.600 align:middle line:84%
you eventually will be
able to ascend and rejoin

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.620 align:middle line:84%
the god energy complex
from whence we came.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.120 align:middle line:84%
So that's really
the key issue here.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a matter of
perfection of the soul.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, people say to
me, look, doctor,

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.810 align:middle line:84%
how many past lives
has the average person?

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And I said this before
on your show and radio.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Average person's probably
had 1,000 past lives.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: All right.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.927 align:middle line:84%
Now, the problem with that
is that all those debts.

00:06:09.927 --> 00:06:11.260 align:middle line:90%
How do you wipe out those debts?

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.270 align:middle line:90%
It's impossible, right?

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.070 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.740 align:middle line:84%
There is a principle,
a universal law,

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.690 align:middle line:84%
called the principle
of forgiveness.

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.340 align:middle line:84%
This is not what
you think it is.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.890 align:middle line:84%
The principle of
forgiveness says that once

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.480 align:middle line:84%
you mess up on earth X number
of karmic debts that you failed,

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.820 align:middle line:84%
tests that you failed, but
then you finally correct it

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.610 align:middle line:84%
and you pass that test,
all the previous tests

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.855 align:middle line:84%
in that particular
category are wiped out.

00:06:33.855 --> 00:06:34.730 align:middle line:90%
It's like bankruptcy.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:35.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gone.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Gone.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.250 align:middle line:90%
That's why you can ascend.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.750 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to access
to higher self in order

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:40.550 align:middle line:90%
to receive it.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.840 align:middle line:84%
When I created my
famous technique

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.790 align:middle line:84%
the superconscious
mind tap, that

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.300 align:middle line:84%
is the way in which you
can access the higher self,

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.450 align:middle line:84%
the superconscious mind,
which will raise the frequency

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.640 align:middle line:84%
vibration or rate of
your soul's energy

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.430 align:middle line:84%
allow you to grow
spiritually and eventually

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:59.870 align:middle line:90%
to perfect a soul.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And then you can become
at-one-ment, atonement,

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.180 align:middle line:84%
at one with your higher
self, merge with it.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.315 align:middle line:84%
And then you go to the
soul plane and ascend.

00:07:07.315 --> 00:07:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If we
know Christianity,

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.270 align:middle line:84%
we all know that Jesus
ascended into heaven.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.062 align:middle line:84%
Is that the same thing
we're talking about?

00:07:14.062 --> 00:07:14.862 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes.

00:07:14.862 --> 00:07:17.510 align:middle line:84%
It's just that you don't have
to be the Son of God to ascend.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.400 align:middle line:84%
What happens is
that you go through

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.450 align:middle line:90%
the different dimensions.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.820 align:middle line:84%
So right now we're on
the physical plane.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:23.930 align:middle line:90%
This is characterized.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Each plane or dimension has
a sound characteristic of it.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.380 align:middle line:84%
So thunder is the sound
of the earth plane.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.570 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to practice
out of body experiences--

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:34.943 align:middle line:84%
and I train many of
my people to do that--

00:07:34.943 --> 00:07:36.860 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to do it
during a thunderstorm.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:37.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Because it's like
a salmon swimming upstream.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:42.110 align:middle line:84%
The sound will keep
you on the earth plane.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:42.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: It's very difficult.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sound has
a lot to do with it.

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:46.232 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes, a
lot to do with it.

00:07:46.232 --> 00:07:49.385 align:middle line:84%
Now, beyond the physical
plane is the astral plane,

00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:50.510 align:middle line:90%
which people have heard of.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.802 align:middle line:84%
That's the most common
dimension that they've heard of.

00:07:52.802 --> 00:07:55.550 align:middle line:84%
The roar of the sea, just
like putting a seashell

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:56.360 align:middle line:90%
next to your ear.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.590 align:middle line:90%
That's the kind of sound.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.550 align:middle line:84%
It has the lower
astral plane, which is

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:00.950 align:middle line:90%
the source of psychic attack.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
upper astral plane

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.600 align:middle line:84%
where you can work
with your higher self.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.790 align:middle line:90%
So that's the astral plane.

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Beyond that is the
causal plane, which

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.560 align:middle line:84%
is the tiniest of the
dimensions, characterized

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.840 align:middle line:84%
by the tinkling of
bells as the sound.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
Akashic records are stored.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.220 align:middle line:84%
That's like a fifth
dimensional computer

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:23.210 align:middle line:84%
chip which stores your
past, present, future,

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.340 align:middle line:90%
and parallel life information.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Beyond that is the mental
plane, characterized

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.550 align:middle line:84%
by sound of running water,
which is characterized by where

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:32.789 align:middle line:90%
the masters would hang out.

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:34.680 align:middle line:90%
Moses, Buddha, Jesus, et cetera.

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.105 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: There's
abstract buildings.

00:08:37.105 --> 00:08:38.103 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Higher planes?

00:08:38.103 --> 00:08:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, it's still
the part of the karmic cycle.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.500 align:middle line:84%
But you have these
angelic entities

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.799 align:middle line:90%
wearing these white smocks.

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:46.400 align:middle line:84%
The robes are actually
dark blue in color

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.740 align:middle line:84%
so you know how you're
on that dimension.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.200 align:middle line:84%
Beyond the mental plane
is the etheric plane.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a
very important one.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.950 align:middle line:84%
It's the largest of
all the dimensions.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.100 align:middle line:84%
It's characterized by the
sound of buzzing bees.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And there are these
weird entities known

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.210 align:middle line:90%
as the etheric plane surgeons.

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:04.280 align:middle line:90%
They look like giant tadpoles.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And what they do is if you
have an incurable disease

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:11.970 align:middle line:84%
or any major disease, they can
operate on your etheric body.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.610 align:middle line:84%
Remember, every
dimension you go to,

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:15.030 align:middle line:90%
you go into a spiritual body.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:17.705 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So if you
go to the astral plane,

00:09:17.705 --> 00:09:18.860 align:middle line:90%
you're in your astral body.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.540 align:middle line:84%
If you go to the
etheric plane, you

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.400 align:middle line:90%
travel in your etheric body.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.860 align:middle line:84%
The etheric body is
the only spiritual body

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.913 align:middle line:84%
that's absolutely identical
to the physical body.

00:09:27.913 --> 00:09:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's necessary
for life, by the way.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:30.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:32.568 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So let's say the
etheric plane surgeons operate

00:09:32.568 --> 00:09:35.360 align:middle line:84%
on somebody who has
cancer, aids, or lupus,

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.740 align:middle line:90%
or some disease.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.020 align:middle line:90%
They cure the etheric body.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Then with techniques-- I call
this etheric plane surgery--

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.680 align:middle line:84%
I can transfer the
techniques, the healing

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.010 align:middle line:84%
from the etheric body when they
return to the physical body.

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:51.710 align:middle line:84%
In certain cases, it's
very difficult to do.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And then they can
cure the physical body

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:57.650 align:middle line:84%
because the etheric body was
cured on the etheric plane.

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:01.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, the etheric plane, the
mental, the causal, the astral,

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.770 align:middle line:84%
and the physical represent--
those five dimensions

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:04.860 align:middle line:90%
are the karmic cycle.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:05.660 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:06.980 align:middle line:84%
That's where you
have to reincarnate

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:07.813 align:middle line:90%
over and over again.

00:10:07.813 --> 00:10:11.930 align:middle line:84%
Beyond that, your higher self
will accompany with you as when

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:14.278 align:middle line:84%
you cross into spirit
or clinically die

00:10:14.278 --> 00:10:16.070 align:middle line:84%
takes you through the
different dimensions.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And then you go to the soul
plane, the sixth dimension.

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And the soul plane
is like a DMZ.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.180 align:middle line:84%
It's neither the higher
planes nor the lower plane.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we automatically
get through that level?

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's where you
choose your next life.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.360 align:middle line:84%
So everybody goes
to the soul plane.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Now,
on the soul plane,

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:32.330 align:middle line:90%
there are these floating heads.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:33.698 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] It's unusual.

00:10:33.698 --> 00:10:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And your master's guides are
there, your spirit guides.

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:37.090 align:middle line:84%
An angelic entity
could be there.

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I bet you're
wild at parties, Bruce.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:39.340 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.507 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And they help
you choose your next life.

00:10:41.507 --> 00:10:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're ready
to ascend, they

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:48.110 align:middle line:84%
do a form of energy
cleansing to actually finally

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:49.910 align:middle line:90%
perfect soul's energy.

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Now you shed-- remember,
you're in this soul plane,

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:55.640 align:middle line:84%
you're in your soul plane
body, spiritual body.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you're ready to
ascend, you shed that body.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.230 align:middle line:90%
So now you're pure energy--

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:02.420 align:middle line:90%
no more body of any kind--

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.370 align:middle line:84%
and you go into
the higher planes.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually,
you wind up with what

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.520 align:middle line:90%
we call the god energy complex.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.280 align:middle line:90%
Some people call it All That Is.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.240 align:middle line:90%
They call it God.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.320 align:middle line:90%
They call it whatever.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Heaven or Nirvana, where there's
no perpetrators, no victim.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.120 align:middle line:90%
It's the eternal now.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.250 align:middle line:84%
That's the ultimate
goal is to ascend.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Once you enter the higher
planes, you'll never come back.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.182 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
conscious dying?

00:11:24.182 --> 00:11:25.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Now,
conscious dying is

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.850 align:middle line:84%
a technique I train people to
do at the-- what you want to do

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:32.058 align:middle line:84%
is you want to-- at the moment
of death, this is what happens.

00:11:32.058 --> 00:11:33.725 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use my
fists as an example.

00:11:33.725 --> 00:11:34.525 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK

00:11:34.525 --> 00:11:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So let's say my left
fist is the subconscious mind,

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:40.035 align:middle line:90%
and this is your higher self.

00:11:40.035 --> 00:11:40.910 align:middle line:90%
This is what happens.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:42.952 align:middle line:84%
Most people when they
die-- just about everyone--

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:44.210 align:middle line:90%
they die in fear, OK?

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a disease, a
traumatic inc-- whatever it is.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:49.910 align:middle line:84%
So at the moment of death,
this is what they do.

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:52.760 align:middle line:84%
Now they go to the lower astral
plane, a very complicated

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.560 align:middle line:84%
cycle, they wind up
in the soul plane,

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.340 align:middle line:84%
and they reincarnate in usually
a very dysfunctional life.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, what you want to do--
conscious dying or COBE--

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.000 align:middle line:84%
is you merge with the higher
self at the moment of death.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.670 align:middle line:84%
If you do that, now
your soul's energy

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:10.820 align:middle line:84%
is merging with the
perfect part of your soul.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.320 align:middle line:84%
You can actually ascend
right then and there.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.170 align:middle line:84%
If not, you go to
the soul plane.

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And even if you're
not perfect but you're

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:19.520 align:middle line:84%
a whole lot better
than you were before,

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:23.270 align:middle line:84%
you can reincarnate in a
really spiritual life maybe

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:26.240 align:middle line:84%
on the etheric plane
or the mental plane

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.740 align:middle line:84%
rather than the earth plane
and maybe the next life

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:29.540 align:middle line:90%
that you ascend.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:30.590 align:middle line:90%
So this is called--

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:32.780 align:middle line:84%
conscious dying is
that you train yourself

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.660 align:middle line:84%
when you go to sleep at
night in various techniques

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:38.990 align:middle line:84%
to always merge with your higher
self at the moment of death.

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And when you do
that, you're going

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:43.610 align:middle line:84%
to relate to what we
call conscious dying

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:45.280 align:middle line:84%
or the conscious
out-of-body experience.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've had a client
who was guided through a loved

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.090 align:middle line:90%
one in a conscious death.

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:52.970 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I was aware of this pounding,
just a thumping and a pounding

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:58.640 align:middle line:90%
in our bed.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.500 align:middle line:90%
I was laying in bed next to him.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it seemed that it was
like angel wings or something

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:05.540 align:middle line:90%
were right there.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:08.250 align:middle line:90%
And the presence was so heavy.

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:10.110 align:middle line:90%
And that was when he began--

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:13.640 align:middle line:84%
that was his last half hour
when he began to actually die.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.680 align:middle line:90%
And I went over, I got up.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.070 align:middle line:84%
I got up with a start
from that pounding,

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:19.370 align:middle line:90%
and I went over to see him.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And he was actually--
his breathing

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:22.550 align:middle line:90%
was starting to slow down.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:23.580 align:middle line:90%
He was looking at me.

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.850 align:middle line:90%
He was awake at that point.

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:28.760 align:middle line:90%
And he looked into my eyes.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And I just told
him at that moment,

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:31.770 align:middle line:90%
I said, just go into the light.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:32.570 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:33.370 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:34.610 align:middle line:90%
You can go home.

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:36.290 align:middle line:90%
Just go into the light.

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And I kept saying
that over and over.

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And gradually, his
breathing slowed down,

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:44.810 align:middle line:84%
a tear rolled down his eye,
and he died, he left his body.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
beautiful because it

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:50.480 align:middle line:84%
wasn't this heavy
sadness that I expected.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.720 align:middle line:84%
I just felt his
presence so much with me

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.420 align:middle line:84%
that I never really
grieved in the sense

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.490 align:middle line:84%
that I've seen
other people grieve,

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:01.370 align:middle line:84%
even though the sadness
hit me a lot, of course.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Now, the interesting
thing about this case with

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.353 align:middle line:90%
Candela is that--

00:14:05.353 --> 00:14:07.520 align:middle line:84%
this is when I work with
people with conscious dying

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.100 align:middle line:84%
techniques-- she
had no bereavement.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.510 align:middle line:90%
This is a big issue I deal with.

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:13.170 align:middle line:84%
People have lost loved
ones, they've lost pets.

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:14.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:16.138 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So the reason
why-- let me tell you

00:14:16.138 --> 00:14:17.360 align:middle line:90%
what the mechanism is.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.760 align:middle line:84%
When you lose a loved one--
and this can be a pet, too,

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.618 align:middle line:90%
by the way--

00:14:20.618 --> 00:14:22.910 align:middle line:84%
what happens is that they're
on the lower astral plane.

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:24.620 align:middle line:84%
People die in fear,
right away, they're

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:25.790 align:middle line:90%
going to the lower astral--

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:27.110 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to go
there-- because they're not

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:28.120 align:middle line:90%
doing conscious dying.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.870 align:middle line:84%
So now what happens
is they're struggling,

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.620 align:middle line:84%
they're panicking
because the lower astral

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:35.330 align:middle line:84%
plane is filled with really
nasty entities 24/7, no rest.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:36.660 align:middle line:90%
People picking on each other.

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:37.830 align:middle line:90%
It's very noisy.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:38.810 align:middle line:90%
It's disgusting.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:41.150 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is they
see their loved one.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:43.190 align:middle line:90%
And they say, help me, help me.

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And they're sending
out a panic energy.

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:48.453 align:middle line:84%
They're not trying to hurt
the person on the earth plane.

00:14:48.453 --> 00:14:50.870 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is they're
actually psychically attacking

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.350 align:middle line:90%
them without realizing it.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:55.310 align:middle line:84%
So now the person, the loved
one who's on the earth plane

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:57.710 align:middle line:84%
is now getting attacked
by this negative energy.

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's what bereavement
is-- depression, if you will.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:01.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.833 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: So what happens is--

00:15:02.833 --> 00:15:04.910 align:middle line:84%
but by having this,
now she's sending

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:10.220 align:middle line:84%
the soul of her departed husband
to the upper astral plane.

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:11.340 align:middle line:90%
No more panic attack.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:12.140 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.510 align:middle line:84%
No more negative energy
being sent to her.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's why there's
no bereavement with her.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.680 align:middle line:84%
She had zero bereavement
after the death.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dramatic.

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:21.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But I work
with a lot of people

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.300 align:middle line:84%
with bereavement, even
people who lost pets.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.400 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you name it.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Bereavement is
natural, isn't it?

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.157 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: No,
it isn't actually.

00:15:28.157 --> 00:15:29.450 align:middle line:90%
Bereavement is a sign of fear.

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:30.890 align:middle line:84%
It's a sign of
being psychically--

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:32.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't think psychic
attack is natural.

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:35.120 align:middle line:84%
I find that to be a very
unnatural, negative aspect

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.230 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:37.070 align:middle line:90%
It isn't natural.

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:39.740 align:middle line:90%


00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, if it was,
then why wasn't she

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.770 align:middle line:90%
being experienced bereavement?

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:43.910 align:middle line:90%
She didn't.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: True.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.210 align:middle line:84%
You've talked about
reincarnation sometimes up

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:50.640 align:middle line:84%
to 1,000, maybe even
more, reincarnated lives.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.015 align:middle line:84%
How does that tie
into ascension?

00:15:52.015 --> 00:15:52.815 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:15:52.815 --> 00:15:54.740 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm going to
make this very personal.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:55.540 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.760 align:middle line:84%
So reincarnation means that--
we talked about the principle

00:15:58.760 --> 00:15:59.780 align:middle line:90%
of forgiveness.

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:03.470 align:middle line:84%
So if you've messed up on
past life debts, karmic debts,

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:04.920 align:middle line:90%
you're not going to ascend, OK?

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.310 align:middle line:84%
But let's say you start
to improve it, OK?

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:08.880 align:middle line:84%
You start to knock
out these debts.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Now you're building
up your soul's energy.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.870 align:middle line:84%
You're raising it
to a higher level.

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:16.757 align:middle line:84%
We call this just-- cleansing
is the term that I use.

00:16:16.757 --> 00:16:18.090 align:middle line:90%
And you get ready for ascension.

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:19.090 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about you.

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, you know I've done two
of your future lives, OK?

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:22.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, you have.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: In
another hundred years,

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.730 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be Dexter
Monterrey, the coolest name

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:28.197 align:middle line:84%
I've ever heard of for
a spirit entity, OK.

00:16:28.197 --> 00:16:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I still get
emails about him.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.155 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: [LAUGHS]
You're going

00:16:31.155 --> 00:16:36.230 align:middle line:84%
to be a radio host equivalent
in the Global Communication

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:37.993 align:middle line:90%
Network, GCN, OK?

00:16:37.993 --> 00:16:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to have
over 300 million listeners.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.150 align:middle line:90%
You're in a mall.

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
hologram of you, OK?

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:44.930 align:middle line:90%
It's really cool.

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And you're in a gold one
piece jumpsuit, all right?

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:48.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, nice.

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:50.442 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And what
you're doing is you're

00:16:50.442 --> 00:16:53.088 align:middle line:84%
dealing with healing energy,
psychic techniques, et cetera.

00:16:53.088 --> 00:16:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And what you're well
known for-- now,

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:56.370 align:middle line:84%
this is part of your
climate growth now.

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Remember, obviously, this
life, in this century, OK--

00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Carries through.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But now
you're known for exposing

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:02.570 align:middle line:90%
what's called the mind pirates.

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:04.670 align:middle line:84%
These are people
who are criminals

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:09.158 align:middle line:84%
who are stealing the ideas of
scientists by various devices

00:17:09.158 --> 00:17:10.700 align:middle line:84%
and then selling on
the black market.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:11.119 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:11.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Got that?

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.740 align:middle line:90%
So you expose them.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.060 align:middle line:84%
The government comes in,
they destroy the machines.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:18.319 align:middle line:84%
The people who created those
devices were dead or whatever.

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:19.849 align:middle line:90%
They were just incapacitated.

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:21.630 align:middle line:90%
So you help society--

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:22.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I save society.

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:25.579 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Now, we
fast forward 1,300 years

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:27.180 align:middle line:90%
to the 35th century.

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:30.230 align:middle line:84%
You're now going to be a psychic
researcher and scientist named

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:33.170 align:middle line:90%
Xeor, X-E-O-R. OK?

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:35.900 align:middle line:84%
You're living in what
we call Toronto today.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And what you do is you
develop this brass ring

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:40.520 align:middle line:84%
kind of cleansing
technique which

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.130 align:middle line:84%
will remove psychic attack
energy-- in other words,

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.170 align:middle line:84%
will protect the
soul and cleanse it.

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:46.910 align:middle line:84%
The reason why
that's important is

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:49.793 align:middle line:84%
because in the 35th
century, time travelers

00:17:49.793 --> 00:17:51.210 align:middle line:84%
from our future--
the chrononauts,

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:53.930 align:middle line:84%
as I've discussed-- were
now going to go back

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:55.790 align:middle line:90%
in time by teleportation.

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:57.920 align:middle line:84%
But they were concerned
that they would

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.420 align:middle line:90%
be destroyed by doing that.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Teleportation is a very
complicated technique.

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:04.170 align:middle line:84%
So they used to go
back in time by using

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:06.480 align:middle line:84%
enlarging wormholes
and a device called

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.090 align:middle line:90%
a wormhole linear accelerator.

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:10.480 align:middle line:90%
They use that for 300 years.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.740 align:middle line:84%
But by 35th century, now
teleportation has evolved.

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Your device, your brass
ring cleansing technique

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.860 align:middle line:84%
is what's used to
help them protect them

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.650 align:middle line:84%
so that they can go back
in time and be unharmed.

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:26.190 align:middle line:84%
You are given the equivalent
of a Nobel Prize in those days

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:28.860 align:middle line:84%
in the future because
of that invention.

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.150 align:middle line:90%
So this is your own growth.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not trying
to brag about this,

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:36.240 align:middle line:84%
but look what you're doing from
"Coast to Coast" and "Beyond

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Reality" to exposing it on a
much larger level as Dexter

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Monterrey, and then to
actually being a scientist

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:47.430 align:middle line:84%
to help the growth of not
only the time travelers

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:49.650 align:middle line:84%
but society in general
because everybody

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:52.950 align:middle line:84%
is able to use this device to
help their own purification.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bruce, must we
reincarnate to ascend?

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:56.110 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes.

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that the only way?

00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:58.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, unless
you're perfect right now.

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.180 align:middle line:90%
If you are, let me know.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nobody is.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: No, nobody is.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.858 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So with this ascension,
how do you grow into these--

00:19:06.858 --> 00:19:08.900 align:middle line:84%
so you don't have to
reincarnate a million times?

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, that hopes--
by accessing your higher self.

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.728 align:middle line:84%
The main technique is to connect
with the superconscious mind.

00:19:13.728 --> 00:19:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
train people to do.

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:18.570 align:middle line:84%
I have a technique I
developed 45 years ago called

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:20.490 align:middle line:90%
the superconscious mind tap.

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:22.660 align:middle line:90%
And I teach people how to do it.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:23.580 align:middle line:90%
I've got CDs for that.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.220 align:middle line:90%
I work with them in my practice.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And they train to connect
with their higher self.

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:30.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a step by step process.

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.600 align:middle line:90%
Ascension is not easy.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.140 align:middle line:84%
It's like going
to dental school.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.600 align:middle line:84%
You have to take
a lot of courses.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Many courses.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.920 align:middle line:84%
Do you get better with
each life technically?

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.528 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: You can, but you
don't have to, all right?

00:19:43.528 --> 00:19:44.820 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you a good example.

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you a good
example of a reincarnation

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.810 align:middle line:90%
for ascension growth.

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:50.820 align:middle line:84%
My famous case is "The
Search for Grace,"

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.760 align:middle line:84%
a woman who was obsessively
attracted to a man,

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.500 align:middle line:90%
a married man she was dating.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:59.282 align:middle line:84%
He had tried to kill her on
three different episodes.

00:19:59.282 --> 00:20:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And she couldn't
break up with him.

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh.

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Right?

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.000 align:middle line:90%
So I work with her.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.417 align:middle line:90%
We did 45 past life regressions.

00:20:04.417 --> 00:20:05.217 align:middle line:90%
46 actually.

00:20:05.217 --> 00:20:06.017 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 46?

00:20:06.017 --> 00:20:07.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: 46.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And in 20 of those,
he had successfully

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.340 align:middle line:90%
murdered her in past lives.

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:14.190 align:middle line:84%
This would have been
number 21, but she

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:16.860 align:middle line:84%
was able to be empowered
enough to break up with him,

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:20.490 align:middle line:84%
to go on with her life, and
overcome the victimization.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:22.200 align:middle line:84%
That was the big issue
with this one man.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.460 align:middle line:84%
We call him Johnny,
not his real name.

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:29.280 align:middle line:84%
So that case was done,
what, 25 years ago, OK?

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.750 align:middle line:90%
Oh, 30 years ago actually.

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.530 align:middle line:84%
She contacts me every
couple of years.

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:33.330 align:middle line:90%
She's fine.

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She's fine.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:34.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: She's fine.

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:34.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's worked for her.

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So in other
words, she's growing her life.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.920 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't get
involved with guys

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.310 align:middle line:84%
that are trying to abuse
her physically or whatever.

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:42.880 align:middle line:90%
So this is, again--

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.760 align:middle line:84%
she's now moving
closer to ascension.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.560 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Just like Candela in the
case of the non-bereavement

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.660 align:middle line:90%
over the death of her husband.

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:52.800 align:middle line:90%
She overcame fear.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:53.640 align:middle line:90%
What is bereavement?

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.900 align:middle line:90%
It's fear.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.370 align:middle line:90%
I've lost a loved one.

00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:58.200 align:middle line:90%
What's going to happen?

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.700 align:middle line:84%
People worry about their
own mortality, too.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:01.500 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:05.400 align:middle line:84%
So cleansing or growing
psychic empowerment,

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.250 align:middle line:84%
overcoming fear, which are the
only lesson we have to learn.

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:10.715 align:middle line:84%
If you overcome fear,
you're ready to ascend.

00:21:10.715 --> 00:21:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had
a client, Bruce,

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:15.690 align:middle line:84%
who saved her mother's life
after seeing a future life.

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:19.223 align:middle line:84%
And that story appeared on
the Sally Jessy Raphael show.

00:21:19.223 --> 00:21:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLY JESSY RAPHAEL: Can
you travel into the past?

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:23.700 align:middle line:10%
Can you travel into the future?

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:28.950 align:middle line:84%
One woman says she did just that
with the help of a hypnotist.

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:32.190 align:middle line:10%
Valerie Ross says she
traveled into her own future

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:34.380 align:middle line:10%
and the unbelievable happened.

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:36.990 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:39.660 align:middle line:10%
>>VALERIE ROSS:
In June of 1993, I

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:41.540 align:middle line:10%
was awakened out
of a sound sleep

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:44.700 align:middle line:10%
with a pretty frightening
vision that my mother was

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:45.960 align:middle line:10%
going to die.

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:51.330 align:middle line:84%
I heard someone or something
say, "maternal, maternal."

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:54.060 align:middle line:10%
I saw perfectly the
clouds, and her birth date

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.200 align:middle line:10%
was written on it.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.680 align:middle line:10%
But the year was flashing on
and off like a question mark.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.500 align:middle line:10%
I saw a quick
scene of my mother.

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.710 align:middle line:10%
And then it went black.

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And I was so upset because
I didn't know when, how.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.410 align:middle line:84%
(CRYING) And I
couldn't understand

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:13.860 align:middle line:84%
why I was being given this
when I couldn't do anything

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:14.970 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:21.600 align:middle line:10%
I found out about a doctor
who dealt with the paranormal.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.640 align:middle line:84%
When I talked to him,
he actually said to me,

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.910 align:middle line:90%
your mother is not going to die.

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:30.220 align:middle line:10%
And he said, tell your
mother so you can help her.

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.240 align:middle line:10%
And I did.

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.448 align:middle line:10%
And she had been at the
doctor about three and a half

00:22:33.448 --> 00:22:36.100 align:middle line:10%
weeks earlier with a
clean bill of health.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.950 align:middle line:10%
Well, she went
back to the doctor.

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:39.720 align:middle line:10%
There was a three
centimeter kidney stone

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.682 align:middle line:10%
lodged in one of her kidneys.

00:22:41.682 --> 00:22:43.140 align:middle line:10%
And the doctor said
to her, I don't

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.587 align:middle line:10%
understand how you couldn't
have been in any pain

00:22:45.587 --> 00:22:47.670 align:middle line:10%
because this could have
turned into renal failure.

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:49.090 align:middle line:90%
You could have died.

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a dramatic case.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Now, this case
has a lot of aspects to it.

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:55.718 align:middle line:84%
Valerie was extremely
close to her mother.

00:22:55.718 --> 00:22:56.760 align:middle line:90%
That was her best friend.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.850 align:middle line:84%
She didn't have much
of a social network.

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:00.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she was married,
she had a daughter.

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:05.270 align:middle line:84%
But she was extremely
enmeshed with her mother.

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, the mother-- she
goes into the future.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.463 align:middle line:90%
I take her into the future.

00:23:09.463 --> 00:23:11.130 align:middle line:84%
She sees that her
mother's going to have

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:12.338 align:middle line:90%
these major medical problems.

00:23:12.338 --> 00:23:13.138 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:23:13.138 --> 00:23:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Mother just
went to a physician

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.370 align:middle line:90%
for an annual recall.

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:17.910 align:middle line:90%
They said everything was fine.

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:18.720 align:middle line:90%
They missed it.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.490 align:middle line:90%
Two major issues, OK?

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:23.308 align:middle line:84%
So she nags her
mother to go back.

00:23:23.308 --> 00:23:24.850 align:middle line:84%
She's from New Jersey
originally, OK?

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:25.892 align:middle line:90%
So you can understand it.

00:23:25.892 --> 00:23:28.440 align:middle line:84%
She nags her mother to
go back to the doctor.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.627 align:middle line:84%
And mother doesn't
want to do it, OK?

00:23:30.627 --> 00:23:31.960 align:middle line:90%
And I work with the mother, too.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.220 align:middle line:90%
Really nice woman.

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And she says, OK,
Valerie, I'll go.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And they find out
these two issues.

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.420 align:middle line:84%
The physician said if they
hadn't done the surgery,

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:41.360 align:middle line:90%
she would've died.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:44.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, Valerie overcame the
enmeshment aspect, OK?

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:46.200 align:middle line:84%
She loves her mother,
but she's no longer--

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.240 align:middle line:90%
she was no longer depressed.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.940 align:middle line:84%
She grew, saved her mother's
life-- so obviously,

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:52.350 align:middle line:90%
that's a factor, too--

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:55.560 align:middle line:84%
but became more confident
and empowered as a woman.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And she raised the
frequency vibration or rate

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:01.270 align:middle line:84%
of her soul's energy as
well as helped her mother.

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:03.090 align:middle line:90%
So that's a double win here.

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:04.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is amazing, too.

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:07.052 align:middle line:84%
It shows you how ascension
can save somebody's life.

00:24:07.052 --> 00:24:08.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: This is
age progression, now.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.552 align:middle line:84%
This is when I take
people into the future.

00:24:10.552 --> 00:24:14.160 align:middle line:84%
Remember the famous case that
I talk about that woman back

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.087 align:middle line:90%
in 1997?

00:24:15.087 --> 00:24:16.170 align:middle line:90%
She was a college student.

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:18.690 align:middle line:84%
She came to me
from New York City.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:19.870 align:middle line:90%
She came to Los Angeles.

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And then I trained her
to go out of the body.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.460 align:middle line:84%
She goes back because she was
going to go to Europe the last

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:26.670 align:middle line:84%
half the summer and go to
Paris and meet her friends

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:28.230 align:middle line:90%
and then go to graduate school.

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:30.330 align:middle line:84%
I call her Tammy,
not her real name.

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And July 17, 1997, she was
going to go on TWA Flight 800.

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh.

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:36.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: But she had an--

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:37.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The one that
crashed off of Long Island.

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: --don't go there.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:40.110 align:middle line:90%
Plane's going to crash.

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Plane's going to go up
immediately from JFK and crash.

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.310 align:middle line:90%
She changed her flight plans.

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And we know what happened
with TW Flight 800.

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:46.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure do.

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: She went
into the future.

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:49.290 align:middle line:90%
I don't take credit for this.

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:50.090 align:middle line:90%
It was her.

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:54.900 align:middle line:84%
But she saved her own life by
following an age progression.

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.750 align:middle line:84%
That's what age progression
can-- two examples of lives

00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:59.692 align:middle line:90%
being saved not by me.

00:24:59.692 --> 00:25:00.900 align:middle line:90%
I don't take credit for this.

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm 1% of therapy.

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:04.070 align:middle line:90%
The patient is always 99%.

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:05.700 align:middle line:84%
It's the higher
self that does that.

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why don't people
recollect their past lives

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:10.620 align:middle line:90%
naturally?

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:11.640 align:middle line:90%
Why does it take hypnotherapy?

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.098 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: I feel it's because
you're cheating the system.

00:25:14.098 --> 00:25:17.390 align:middle line:84%
The universe doesn't want you
to know the answer to the test.

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:19.860 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they want
you to work things out

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:22.390 align:middle line:84%
and to come-- you're going
to have karmic test presented

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:23.190 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:25.410 align:middle line:84%
You won't know why you're
getting those tests.

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:27.938 align:middle line:84%
It could be people, it
could be circumstances.

00:25:27.938 --> 00:25:29.730 align:middle line:84%
So if you knew all the
answers to the test,

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:31.350 align:middle line:90%
what would you learn, you see?

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:33.780 align:middle line:84%
So to me-- now, we can
get information out

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.090 align:middle line:84%
by things like
hypnosis, meditation.

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:37.920 align:middle line:84%
Meditation and hypnosis,
for your audience,

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:38.740 align:middle line:90%
are the same thing.

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.590 align:middle line:84%
They're both alpha
brainwaves, OK?

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:42.210 align:middle line:84%
You can just--
different techniques.

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:43.890 align:middle line:90%
So you can do that.

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:47.712 align:middle line:84%
But if there was some sort
of a secret information

00:25:47.712 --> 00:25:49.170 align:middle line:84%
that you weren't
supposed to know--

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:50.640 align:middle line:84%
we call that
forbidden knowledge--

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.370 align:middle line:84%
you won't get that until
you're ready to get that.

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:55.590 align:middle line:84%
When the student is ready,
the teacher will be there.

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:57.298 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I find it
amazing though, Bruce,

00:25:57.298 --> 00:26:02.130 align:middle line:84%
that these progressions of
lives can save the current life

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:03.183 align:middle line:90%
or somebody else's.

00:26:03.183 --> 00:26:04.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, yes.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:04.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's dramatic.

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:06.257 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: As an
example, with Valerie.

00:26:06.257 --> 00:26:08.350 align:middle line:84%
But remember, not
everybody can be saved, OK?

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:09.660 align:middle line:90%
People die every day.

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:12.140 align:middle line:84%
There are millions of deaths
in not only this country,

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:14.610 align:middle line:84%
but probably tens of
millions around the world.

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:16.710 align:middle line:84%
But when people-- just
remember one thing though.

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:19.080 align:middle line:84%
When people die, clinically
cross into spirit,

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.950 align:middle line:84%
you always choose
the moment of death.

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:21.500 align:middle line:90%
So let me tell you something.

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:21.600 align:middle line:90%
Wait.

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:21.870 align:middle line:90%
Wait.

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:23.495 align:middle line:84%
Before you're born--
this is important.

00:26:23.495 --> 00:26:24.840 align:middle line:90%
It relates to ascension.

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.640 align:middle line:84%
You're on the soul plane, but
now you've got a karmic cycle.

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.410 align:middle line:84%
So now you got to
choose your next life.

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:31.285 align:middle line:84%
And you've got your
masters and guides there,

00:26:31.285 --> 00:26:32.820 align:middle line:84%
and your higher
self is with you.

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Now you're going to
select a body to come to.

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you're going
to go on the earth plane.

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:39.650 align:middle line:84%
You choose the
framework of your life.

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:41.120 align:middle line:90%
It's not predestination.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.380 align:middle line:90%
You choose an incident.

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.850 align:middle line:84%
How you respond to it
is always free will.

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:45.650 align:middle line:90%
You get?

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:48.153 align:middle line:84%
So what you do choose, though,
is the moment of death.

00:26:48.153 --> 00:26:49.820 align:middle line:84%
So when people die,
they say, oh, person

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:52.770 align:middle line:84%
died in a plane crash or a
car crash or a drug overdose,

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:53.570 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:54.930 align:middle line:90%
They chose that.

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:55.880 align:middle line:90%
It's their free will.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can prevent it if
you really want to do that,

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:01.280 align:middle line:84%
or you do techniques
like age progression.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.320 align:middle line:84%
But when people say,
oh, the world hates me,

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.420 align:middle line:84%
and they start whining
and complaining, no.

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:06.740 align:middle line:90%
You earned that.

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:08.570 align:middle line:84%
That's part of
your karmic debts.

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you're not giving
to the answer to the tests

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:14.360 align:middle line:84%
because you have to
learn to grow with it

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.190 align:middle line:84%
to avoid the problems
in the future

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:19.610 align:middle line:84%
and to wipe out that debt
from the karmic cycle.

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bruce, when
I was 11-years-old,

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.730 align:middle line:90%
I had an out-of-body experience.

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:28.610 align:middle line:84%
I woke up, was bouncing on
the ceiling looking down

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:30.470 align:middle line:90%
at my 11-year-old body in bed.

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:32.220 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was
a dream initially.

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.340 align:middle line:90%
And then all of a sudden, wham!

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:36.950 align:middle line:84%
I was brought right back
into my body, and I jolted.

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:38.540 align:middle line:90%
And I went, that wasn't a dream.

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:39.720 align:middle line:90%
What was it?

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And I went to the library, and
I started looking for books.

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And I stumbled across
books on astral projection

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:48.680 align:middle line:84%
by Sylvan Muldoon, Hereward
Carrington, and people

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:49.640 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.080 align:middle line:90%
And I got obsessed with this.

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:54.020 align:middle line:84%
I've never been able to
duplicate an OBE again.

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.880 align:middle line:90%
But what happened to me?

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:59.410 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, this was
a karmic benefit to you.

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:01.110 align:middle line:10%
This got you into the field.

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:01.910 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It did.

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:03.770 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: Now, if
you had difficulties

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:06.470 align:middle line:10%
in doing out-of-body
experience--

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:08.090 align:middle line:10%
it can be complicated.

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:11.073 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'd be happy to
send you some of my material

00:28:11.073 --> 00:28:11.990 align:middle line:90%
to help you with this.

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:14.030 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to see you do that.

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:17.030 align:middle line:84%
But the key issue here is
that in your life, maybe

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:18.530 align:middle line:84%
you would have gone
to dental school

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:20.340 align:middle line:84%
and become a dentist
if it wasn't for that.

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:22.010 align:middle line:84%
That got you into
the paranormal,

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:24.110 align:middle line:90%
the metaphysical mentality.

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:27.950 align:middle line:84%
That was the key issue here
of that most importantly.

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Your literature research that
your read about, that was back

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:33.860 align:middle line:84%
in the 1920s and '30s, the
old days of-- they used

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:36.560 align:middle line:84%
to call them astral
projection, then OOBE,

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.100 align:middle line:90%
and then OBE, all the changes.

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:38.900 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:41.840 align:middle line:84%
But that was the
key issue to get you

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.020 align:middle line:84%
into the field, which would lead
to you doing what you do now,

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:46.670 align:middle line:90%
Dexter Monterrey, Xeor.

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:47.480 align:middle line:90%
You understand?

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:48.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a progression.

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:51.360 align:middle line:84%
So that incident in
your life was critical.

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:52.713 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it meant to be?

00:28:52.713 --> 00:28:53.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Of course.

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:55.078 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what's the odds?

00:28:55.078 --> 00:28:57.245 align:middle line:84%
Not every 11-year-old has
an out-of-body experience.

00:28:57.245 --> 00:28:58.045 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:28:58.045 --> 00:28:58.940 align:middle line:90%
And remembers it.

00:28:58.940 --> 00:28:59.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Right.

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:00.610 align:middle line:90%
I mean, everybody.

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:02.510 align:middle line:84%
By the way, let me for
the audience-- when

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:03.980 align:middle line:84%
you go to sleep at
night, everybody

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:05.070 align:middle line:90%
goes into the REM cycle.

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:05.870 align:middle line:90%
They've heard.

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:07.162 align:middle line:90%
That's the rapid eye movements.

00:29:07.162 --> 00:29:10.050 align:middle line:84%
It's a very deep alpha brainwave
going into feta brain wave

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:10.850 align:middle line:90%
levels.

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:14.120 align:middle line:84%
All your dream cycles, those
are all out-of-body experiences.

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.880 align:middle line:84%
So every dream you've had--
that's three hours a night--

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.040 align:middle line:84%
those are out-of-body
experiences.

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Whether you remember
or not is up to you.

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:23.510 align:middle line:84%
But we go out the
body every night.

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:25.550 align:middle line:84%
That's why out-of-body
experiences are not

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:27.290 align:middle line:90%
difficult on that level.

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:30.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, remembering it consciously
or doing it during the waking

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:33.580 align:middle line:84%
day, it becomes more difficult.
But everybody goes out

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:34.380 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:36.410 align:middle line:84%
So with people worried
about it being dangerous,

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:38.762 align:middle line:84%
I've been out of the
body over 3,000 times.

00:29:38.762 --> 00:29:40.220 align:middle line:84%
We're on the earth
plane right now.

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:41.520 align:middle line:90%
This isn't the astral plane.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:41.680 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: It's perfectly safe.

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "Open Minds"
is a Gaia show.

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And Luis Minero
talked about OBEs.

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:50.920 align:middle line:90%
He's an expert.

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.420 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
This is one thing

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:53.920 align:middle line:10%
that I heard in one
of your lectures

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.730 align:middle line:10%
that I was very curious
about that sometimes when

00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:03.110 align:middle line:10%
you have left the body, there
is someone in that field

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:07.880 align:middle line:10%
or dimension you're in or even
a human being in this dimension

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.990 align:middle line:10%
that will detect
you, can see you.

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.790 align:middle line:10%
>>LUIS MINERO: OK.

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:12.530 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: Let's talk
about that phenomena.

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:13.790 align:middle line:10%
>>MINERO: In outside the body.

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:13.850 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:14.990 align:middle line:10%
When you're out of the body.

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:15.200 align:middle line:10%
>>MINERO: Yes.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.783 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: And then I'll bring
an example, another example up

00:30:17.783 --> 00:30:18.990 align:middle line:10%
that I found fascinating.

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:21.080 align:middle line:10%
Let's talk about that
where you're out of body,

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.110 align:middle line:10%
and they can see you.

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:22.910 align:middle line:10%
>>MINERO: Yeah.

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:26.780 align:middle line:10%
Because basically, in essence,
the person that can see you

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:29.990 align:middle line:10%
or about that non-physical
entity or being

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:33.050 align:middle line:10%
that can see you, they can see
you because at this moment,

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:34.760 align:middle line:10%
you are basically in
the same dimension

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.008 align:middle line:10%
as they are, in the
same plane as they are.

00:30:37.008 --> 00:30:38.300 align:middle line:10%
And you can interact with them.

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:42.770 align:middle line:10%
You can talk to them, depending
on their level of consciousness

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:46.810 align:middle line:10%
and your level of
consciousness as always.

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:48.770 align:middle line:10%
And this is even
why sometimes when

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:50.870 align:middle line:10%
people have out-of-body
experiences, for example,

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:53.360 align:middle line:10%
they meet the relatives that
have already passed away.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.160 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: Right.

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:56.980 align:middle line:10%
>>MINERO: So the relative that
already passed away is there,

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:57.980 align:middle line:10%
is in that dimension.

00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:59.220 align:middle line:10%
And you can find them.

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:03.750 align:middle line:10%
And this actually helps people
a lot because it helps them to--

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:05.810 align:middle line:10%
especially with the
grieving process

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:07.670 align:middle line:10%
or if they were
missing them a lot,

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:11.870 align:middle line:10%
they realize or they can verify
by themselves and the practice

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:12.745 align:middle line:10%
my relative is there.

00:31:12.745 --> 00:31:15.037 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bruce, you've talked
about the fifth dimension

00:31:15.037 --> 00:31:15.920 align:middle line:90%
before as well.

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:16.840 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Right.

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.970 align:middle line:84%
The fifth dimension is
anything beyond the three

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:21.560 align:middle line:90%
dimensional world we live.

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.560 align:middle line:84%
So we have length,
breadth, and depth.

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.360 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.030 align:middle line:90%
Three dimensions.

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:25.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:27.375 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Now,
time is considered

00:31:27.375 --> 00:31:28.500 align:middle line:90%
to be the fourth dimension.

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:28.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:31.095 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: It's used in
the mathematical equations

00:31:31.095 --> 00:31:32.720 align:middle line:90%
by physicists, OK?

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Anything beyond time is
called the fifth dimension.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And when you travel in the
fifth dimension, you are--

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:40.510 align:middle line:90%
the term is an ultraterrestrial.

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:42.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Remember that term.

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:43.597 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not an
extraterrestrial.

00:31:43.597 --> 00:31:44.990 align:middle line:90%
An ultraterrestrial.

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Now,
the fifth dimension

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:48.860 align:middle line:84%
includes things like
the various dimensions--

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:51.950 align:middle line:84%
the astral, causal, mental,
etheric, and soul plane

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:53.130 align:middle line:90%
as an example.

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:54.890 align:middle line:84%
It also includes
parallel universes.

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:57.530 align:middle line:84%
So when I take people
into parallel universes,

00:31:57.530 --> 00:31:59.953 align:middle line:84%
that's actually the fifth
dimension mentality.

00:31:59.953 --> 00:32:02.120 align:middle line:84%
But let me comment on the
clip that you just showed.

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:06.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: In order
to see an astral entity

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.540 align:middle line:84%
or fifth dimensional
entity, usually you

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.340 align:middle line:90%
have to be in the altered state.

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:12.260 align:middle line:84%
You have to be either
out of the body

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:15.920 align:middle line:84%
yourself or functioning from the
level of the fifth dimension,

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:18.050 align:middle line:84%
not the three dimensional
world, like an hypnotic

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:19.490 align:middle line:90%
level of meditation.

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:21.290 align:middle line:90%
But there's an exception.

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:23.470 align:middle line:84%
You can have-- you've heard
the term doppelganger?

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.150 align:middle line:90%
So what is a doppelganger?

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:26.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The double of--

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Bilocation
kind of thing.

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:30.520 align:middle line:84%
You can take an astral
body, let's say.

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:33.630 align:middle line:84%
I'll just use the astral plane
since it's the closest to us.

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And you can concentrate
the astral matter

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:39.140 align:middle line:84%
that the body is composed
of to such a level

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:41.060 align:middle line:90%
that people can see it.

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:42.950 align:middle line:90%
Now, there was a case years ago.

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:46.460 align:middle line:84%
This is a little weird one,
but it's been reported.

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:50.990 align:middle line:84%
A New York City physician was
giving a talk in New York City

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:53.610 align:middle line:84%
after a dinner like I give
talks to medical groups.

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:54.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:57.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, the exact
same moment he was doing that,

00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:00.087 align:middle line:90%
his body was seen in Toronto--

00:33:00.087 --> 00:33:00.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: --giving the
same talk to a medical group.

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:07.490 align:middle line:84%
What happened was the physical
body was in New York City.

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:11.490 align:middle line:84%
The bilocated doppelganger
was in Toronto.

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Doing the same thing.

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.115 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Doing
the same thing.

00:33:14.115 --> 00:33:15.545 align:middle line:90%
This was back in the '60s.

00:33:15.545 --> 00:33:16.670 align:middle line:90%
But here's another example.

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:18.020 align:middle line:90%
A better example is this.

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:20.330 align:middle line:84%
In England, they
have the parliament,

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:22.940 align:middle line:84%
which is like our lower House,
House of Representatives.

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And there was a guy who was very
sick, almost on his deathbed.

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to vote for
some piece of legislation.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:30.800 align:middle line:90%
He was in bed.

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.750 align:middle line:84%
He's got his lawyers
there, his doctors there,

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:33.980 align:middle line:90%
nurses are there.

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:35.180 align:middle line:90%
And he wanted to vote.

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:36.530 align:middle line:90%
He was desperate to vote.

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was he dying?

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, he
was just-- a bad flu.

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:39.590 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:40.670 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:42.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So what
happens is in parliament,

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.260 align:middle line:84%
his body was seen
casting the vote.

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And he looked very
pale like a ghost, OK?

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.682 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he's back in bed.

00:33:48.682 --> 00:33:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Now, one of the
people who witnessed him-- this

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:52.910 align:middle line:90%
was in 1905, OK?

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:54.950 align:middle line:84%
One of the people who
witnessed him eventually

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:56.940 align:middle line:84%
became the prime minister
of Great Britain.

00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:58.920 align:middle line:84%
So the credibility
is pretty cool, OK?

00:33:58.920 --> 00:33:59.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:02.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: That's an
example of a doppelganger.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.283 align:middle line:84%
He actually physically was
there casting the vote.

00:34:04.283 --> 00:34:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And you know like in
Congress, all those votes

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.655 align:middle line:84%
that we have forever
are all public record.

00:34:08.655 --> 00:34:09.530 align:middle line:90%
So nobody faked that.

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:13.156 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who was responsible
for the doppelganger to appear?

00:34:13.156 --> 00:34:14.989 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, he
didn't do it purposely.

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:16.739 align:middle line:84%
What he was saying--
this is what happens.

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:20.400 align:middle line:84%
You can create a doppelganger
by saying, I want to go here.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:21.780 align:middle line:90%
I got to go here, but I can't.

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:22.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wish I could.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:23.858 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: I just
wish I could go.

00:34:23.858 --> 00:34:28.550 align:middle line:84%
A classic example is what
happened in Minnesota.

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:33.739 align:middle line:84%
In Cloquet, Minnesota, this
gentleman, he ran a business.

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to go
to the Grand Canyon.

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:37.380 align:middle line:90%
This was 1948.

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.990 align:middle line:84%
So he wanted to go there
desperately, but he couldn't.

00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:40.790 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't leave.

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:41.810 align:middle line:90%
Was too busy.

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:47.420 align:middle line:84%
So now we fast forward
to 1954 or '55.

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:49.100 align:middle line:90%
'55 I believe it was.

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And now he has the chance
to go to the Grand Canyon.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:55.429 align:middle line:84%
He takes a camera with him,
a Bosley 35 millimeter camera

00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:57.890 align:middle line:90%
that was created in 1955.

00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:00.260 align:middle line:84%
He goes to the Grand
Canyon, takes some pictures.

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:04.100 align:middle line:84%
When he comes home, he
goes to see a travelogue.

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.435 align:middle line:84%
He goes to the
photography store.

00:35:06.435 --> 00:35:08.060 align:middle line:84%
They have these little
travelogue films

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:08.910 align:middle line:90%
like castle films.

00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:09.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:10.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: He rents one.

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:12.050 align:middle line:84%
He wants to see
the Grand Canyon.

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:12.972 align:middle line:90%
He sees himself--

00:35:12.972 --> 00:35:14.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In the Grand Canyon.

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:16.388 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: --in the 1948
film, which was copyrighted

00:35:16.388 --> 00:35:19.530 align:middle line:90%
in 1948, with his 1955 camera.

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh.

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:21.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: How do
you explain that?

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:22.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's bizarre.

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:23.895 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Now, that
to me is teleportation.

00:35:23.895 --> 00:35:29.135 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've seen videos of the
1800s, pictures of the 1800s.

00:35:29.135 --> 00:35:29.935 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Right.

00:35:29.935 --> 00:35:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there's a guy
there with a cell phone, Bruce.

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:36.800 align:middle line:84%
It's clearly some kind
of device in his hand.

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:41.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he's holding it up like
this in this 1800s photograph,

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.250 align:middle line:90%
black and white photograph.

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:44.167 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:35:44.167 --> 00:35:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was he a time traveler?

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:46.700 align:middle line:84%
What the hell was
he doing there.

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:47.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: There's also--

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:48.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You remember
that picture.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.367 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: I remember that.

00:35:49.367 --> 00:35:52.200 align:middle line:84%
That was actually-- you're
talking about the 1920s film--

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.920 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was
called "The Circus"--

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.180 align:middle line:84%
where this guy had this
thing next to his ear.

00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:58.610 align:middle line:90%
It was a 1920s film.

00:35:58.610 --> 00:35:59.410 align:middle line:90%
It was--

00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not from the 1800s?

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:01.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: No, no.

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:03.020 align:middle line:90%
This was actually a movie, OK?

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:06.808 align:middle line:84%
And he was holding up this
thing right to his ear.

00:36:06.808 --> 00:36:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And people thought at
first it was a hearing aid.

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:09.880 align:middle line:90%
No, it wasn't.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.210 align:middle line:90%
And it looks like a cell phone.

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Then there's a depiction
from ancient Greece

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:18.900 align:middle line:84%
of a person that looks like
they're holding up a laptop.

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:19.170 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHS]

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:21.808 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: You've got
those on the air, right?

00:36:21.808 --> 00:36:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a lot of examples
of what they call things out

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:26.120 align:middle line:90%
of time, out of time sequence.

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:28.340 align:middle line:84%
This is part of
forbidden archeology.

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:33.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's just there
are many examples

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:36.710 align:middle line:84%
to show that things
aren't as they appear, OK?

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:40.100 align:middle line:84%
You go back into ancient Greece,
the temple of Dendera in Egypt

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:42.950 align:middle line:84%
where you have the equivalent
of a television set

00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:45.500 align:middle line:84%
and electrical devices
set up, a big tube.

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And the temple-- just
for your audience,

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Google the temple of Dendera
and see what you get.

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:53.728 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
get this big tube.

00:36:53.728 --> 00:36:56.270 align:middle line:84%
It looks like a crook's tube,
which is a primitive television

00:36:56.270 --> 00:37:01.850 align:middle line:84%
set dated 2,000 years ago in the
Ptolemy era of ancient Egypt.

00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:04.560 align:middle line:84%
That was 2,300 years
ago to 2,000 years ago.

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And that's
called the temple of Dendera.

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And then there's Abydos
where you have a UFO--

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:11.127 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And helicopters.

00:37:11.127 --> 00:37:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: --and
the helicopters, OK?

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:13.760 align:middle line:90%
And the stealth jet.

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:14.030 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:15.280 align:middle line:90%
So where do you get that from?

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.788 align:middle line:84%
And that was also
the Ptolemy era.

00:37:16.788 --> 00:37:18.330 align:middle line:84%
So these are things
that are out of--

00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:20.840 align:middle line:84%
of course, we've had
advanced civilizations

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:22.670 align:middle line:90%
that we don't have records of.

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:24.420 align:middle line:90%
And those are examples of--

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:27.040 align:middle line:84%
you've seen the forbidden
archeology where

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:29.310 align:middle line:90%
they have a sole of a shoe--

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:30.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Michael Cremo--

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:32.268 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: --a couple
of hundred million years

00:37:32.268 --> 00:37:33.635 align:middle line:90%
ago in Kentucky.

00:37:33.635 --> 00:37:34.800 align:middle line:90%
Where do you get that from?

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Or the gold-- remember
that gold thread

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:37.675 align:middle line:90%
that was found in Illinois?

00:37:37.675 --> 00:37:39.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Threads or
steel balls down below.

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:43.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: That was
2.8 billion years ago.

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:45.410 align:middle line:90%
That was in South Africa, OK?

00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:47.343 align:middle line:90%
So 2.8 billion?

00:37:47.343 --> 00:37:49.260 align:middle line:84%
There was only single
celled organisms around.

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:50.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, exactly.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:53.342 align:middle line:84%
What is conscious
out-of-body experiences?

00:37:53.342 --> 00:37:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well,
this is the COBE.

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:58.730 align:middle line:84%
This is when you're actually
merging with your higher self.

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:00.245 align:middle line:84%
A conscious
out-of-body experience

00:38:00.245 --> 00:38:04.400 align:middle line:84%
is whenever you go into the
alpha level, the hypnotic

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.640 align:middle line:84%
level, so now you can
access your higher self.

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.380 align:middle line:84%
But what you're
being trained to do

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:13.040 align:middle line:84%
is to merge with your higher
self at the moment of death.

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:17.090 align:middle line:84%
If you do that, you avoid going
through the lower astral plane,

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:18.770 align:middle line:84%
going through the
karmic cycle again,

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:22.260 align:middle line:84%
winding up in the soul
plane with a necessity

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:23.310 align:middle line:90%
to reincarnate.

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:24.900 align:middle line:84%
If you merge with
your higher self,

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:27.790 align:middle line:84%
you can zip right up
to the soul plane.

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And if everything is
go, you can now ascend.

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:32.340 align:middle line:84%
Or you can stay as a
spirit guide like a Buddha,

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:32.910 align:middle line:90%
if you want.

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:33.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK?

00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:36.270 align:middle line:84%
But the point is you
want to avoid going

00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:38.280 align:middle line:90%
to the lower astral plane.

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:39.630 align:middle line:90%
That's called unconscious dying.

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't
want to go there.

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Don't
want to go there.

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.890 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: As a matter of fact,
when I was reading that book

00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:44.900 align:middle line:10%
as a kid--

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:47.460 align:middle line:10%
Sylvan Muldoon and Hereward
Carrington's book--

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:49.650 align:middle line:10%
they talked too about
these different levels

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:51.330 align:middle line:10%
of these astral planes.

00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:54.730 align:middle line:10%
And they said the bottom level,
you don't want to hang around.

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:56.897 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: You know, that's
the lower astral plane.

00:38:56.897 --> 00:38:59.110 align:middle line:84%
By the way, those guys were
also very ill physically.

00:38:59.110 --> 00:38:59.910 align:middle line:90%
They were on--

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:00.525 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Those authors.

00:39:00.525 --> 00:39:00.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Yeah, those authors
were almost on their deathbed

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:03.600 align:middle line:90%
when they were doing this.

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So when
people get ill,

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:06.670 align:middle line:84%
they actually go out
of the body a lot.

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, you don't have to
be physically depreciated,

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:11.760 align:middle line:84%
decimated as they
were to do that.

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.920 align:middle line:84%
But they were both very
weak people physically.

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the benefit
of going out of the body?

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Oh.

00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can access your
higher self, and you can--

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:20.910 align:middle line:90%
creativity.

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:23.410 align:middle line:84%
If you're involved in the
creative arts-- writing,

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:26.838 align:middle line:84%
painting, whatever-- you can do
what I call astral negotiation.

00:39:26.838 --> 00:39:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you have a problem
with somebody on the earth

00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:29.510 align:middle line:90%
plane.

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:30.530 align:middle line:90%
It could be a wife, a child.

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:31.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In your life?

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:32.898 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: You
can work things out

00:39:32.898 --> 00:39:35.580 align:middle line:84%
on the astral plane,
upper astral plane.

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:37.590 align:middle line:84%
I call this a
sanctuary technique

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:39.690 align:middle line:84%
where you and your
higher self summon

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:42.300 align:middle line:84%
the soul of the person
you're having problems with.

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:45.810 align:middle line:84%
They come to a conference room
on the upper astral plane.

00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:47.320 align:middle line:84%
They have to show
up, by the way.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:48.510 align:middle line:90%
And this is not black magic.

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:49.650 align:middle line:90%
This is perfectly natural.

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:52.290 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to stay,
but they do have to show up.

00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:55.830 align:middle line:84%
If they stay, you can
now negotiate, OK?

00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And then if they work it
out, when they wake up

00:39:58.410 --> 00:39:59.730 align:middle line:90%
the following morning--

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:00.932 align:middle line:90%
which you will too--

00:40:00.932 --> 00:40:02.640 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden, they
say, hey, you know?

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:03.827 align:middle line:90%
Everything is fine here.

00:40:03.827 --> 00:40:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you remember
from the previous night?

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:06.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: You will.

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:07.450 align:middle line:90%
They won't.

00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:09.660 align:middle line:84%
I've had people do this
to actually get a job,

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:11.135 align:middle line:90%
do a job interview.

00:40:11.135 --> 00:40:12.510 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with
actors who get--

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:13.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've used it.

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:14.932 align:middle line:84%
I've used it for personal
things like that.

00:40:14.932 --> 00:40:16.557 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well,
I've worked with you.

00:40:16.557 --> 00:40:17.880 align:middle line:90%
In LA, I deal with actors, OK?

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And some of them use it to get
roles in TV shows and feature

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:21.240 align:middle line:90%
films, OK?

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:24.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't tell the
casting director that.

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.778 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can do
astral negotiations.

00:40:25.778 --> 00:40:28.320 align:middle line:84%
You can meet time travelers from
our future, the chrononauts.

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:31.020 align:middle line:84%
You can meet the good
ETs like Pleiadians.

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:33.660 align:middle line:84%
You can meet people
who are also going out

00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:36.540 align:middle line:90%
of the body, ultraterrestrials.

00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:39.540 align:middle line:84%
You can meet people who are
having near-death experiences.

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:42.540 align:middle line:84%
You can contact lost
relatives, departed relatives,

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:46.830 align:middle line:84%
overcome bereavement as the
case with Candela, for example.

00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:49.200 align:middle line:90%
You can do a myriad of things.

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.702 align:middle line:90%
Go into parallel universes.

00:40:50.702 --> 00:40:51.660 align:middle line:90%
You can do any of this.

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:52.730 align:middle line:90%
Past and future lives.

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:55.840 align:middle line:84%
You can do time travel while
you're in the fifth dimension

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:57.340 align:middle line:84%
because when you're
out of the body,

00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:58.830 align:middle line:90%
you're in the fifth dimension.

00:40:58.830 --> 00:41:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Remember, all time is
simultaneous there.

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I use my dreams
a lot, too, Bruce.

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:04.890 align:middle line:90%
Is that part of this?

00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:05.753 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes.

00:41:05.753 --> 00:41:06.920 align:middle line:90%
That's where I train people.

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:08.490 align:middle line:84%
See, my therapy--
let me explain.

00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:10.230 align:middle line:84%
My therapy of connecting
people to higher

00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:13.540 align:middle line:84%
self, 99% of the therapy occurs
in the REM cycle at night.

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:14.340 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:15.820 align:middle line:90%
Because they're out of the body.

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:17.820 align:middle line:84%
There's no limitations
of the earth plane.

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:19.350 align:middle line:84%
If they're having
physical problems,

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:21.780 align:middle line:84%
it's irrelevant when they're
in the fifth dimension.

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:24.630 align:middle line:84%
They can access their higher
self, which is perfect energy.

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:27.330 align:middle line:84%
Your higher self comes from
the god energy complex.

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:28.180 align:middle line:90%
It's like an angel.

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:29.610 align:middle line:90%
It's perfect energy.

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:30.570 align:middle line:90%
You can't lose.

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And there's no defense
mechanisms or ego

00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:35.880 align:middle line:84%
to bother you, whereas
there is on the earth plane.

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:38.280 align:middle line:84%
There's always the ego,
the defense mechanisms,

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:42.010 align:middle line:84%
the beta brain life, we call
that, the beta brain level.

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:46.050 align:middle line:84%
So here, out of the body, you
eliminate all the defenses.

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And now you can connect
with your higher self,

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:50.250 align:middle line:90%
and the world is your oyster.

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bruce, the Gaia
program "Mystery Teachings"

00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:56.560 align:middle line:90%
dives into ascension.

00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:59.770 align:middle line:10%
>> If we can learn to achieve
a coherent state of being

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:03.220 align:middle line:10%
and have a daily practice
with meditation every day,

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:08.020 align:middle line:10%
we can activate more and more
of that secret fire within.

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:11.680 align:middle line:10%
This then draws to it what we
can call the celestial fire

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:15.520 align:middle line:10%
or light that is the smallest
particle of consciousness

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:17.590 align:middle line:10%
from source.

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:20.750 align:middle line:10%
This is the smallest
building block of matter.

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:24.030 align:middle line:10%
It is at the central
core of every atom.

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:28.130 align:middle line:10%
This particle of consciousness
is within the nuclei.

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:30.970 align:middle line:10%
It acts as a portal through
which divine consciousness

00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:33.580 align:middle line:10%
enters into manifestation.

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:37.210 align:middle line:10%
It is the essence of
source in this world.

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:40.490 align:middle line:10%
It has the seed of
divinity within it.

00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:43.990 align:middle line:10%
This seed is something that we
as conscious and aware beings

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:48.310 align:middle line:10%
can tap into using our own
secret fire of consciousness

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:50.208 align:middle line:10%
to reach it.

00:42:50.208 --> 00:42:51.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what'd
you think of that?

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, I
like it, first of all,

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:54.420 align:middle line:90%
and I agree with it.

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:56.450 align:middle line:84%
What happens is that what
they're talking about

00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:58.950 align:middle line:84%
is a very technical
procedure we call

00:42:58.950 --> 00:43:01.650 align:middle line:84%
that's going through
geophysical time warps

00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:03.900 align:middle line:84%
and perfecting
the soul by a form

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:07.620 align:middle line:84%
of a fifth dimensional
surgery kind of thing

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:10.610 align:middle line:84%
in order to perfect and
raise the frequency vibration

00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:13.440 align:middle line:84%
or rate of the soul to
perfect it, which means

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:15.340 align:middle line:90%
merging with the higher self.

00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And then you can go through the
various dimensions winding up

00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:21.060 align:middle line:84%
on the soul plane
and, again, eventually

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:24.930 align:middle line:84%
shedding the spiritual body--
that would be the soul plane

00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:27.990 align:middle line:84%
body-- to eventually become
pure energy and ascend.

00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:30.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, they're talking
about trying to show

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:31.500 align:middle line:90%
the technical aspect of it.

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Remember, this is
fifth dimensional.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's very difficult for us
to comprehend that on the earth

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:38.520 align:middle line:90%
plane in our physical bodies.

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:40.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where does energy
healing fit into all of this?

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:41.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:44.250 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you have a
lot of medical problems.

00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:46.920 align:middle line:84%
That causes other issues
in your life-- obviously,

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:50.790 align:middle line:84%
the physical ones, emotional,
sometimes spiritual.

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:53.020 align:middle line:84%
So it makes people
feel depressed,

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:55.500 align:middle line:84%
and it makes people
feel cynical about life.

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:56.340 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't help you.

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:59.370 align:middle line:84%
You're not growing
spiritually if you're in pain

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:00.720 align:middle line:90%
and having all kinds of issues.

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.150 align:middle line:84%
The more you can heal
yourself, the more

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:05.530 align:middle line:84%
you can connect with
your higher self,

00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:06.820 align:middle line:90%
which does the healing anyway.

00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that could be
physically and emotionally.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:09.750 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: And spiritually.

00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:11.083 align:middle line:90%
That's a good point.

00:44:11.083 --> 00:44:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So then as
you become more healed,

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:16.210 align:middle line:84%
and not only do you
have a better life--

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:17.970 align:middle line:90%
it's more quality oriented--

00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:20.850 align:middle line:84%
but now you have more
confidence of your ability

00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:23.670 align:middle line:84%
to merge with your higher
self rather than whining

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:27.910 align:middle line:84%
and complaining and just
saying, oh, my god, life sucks,

00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:28.710 align:middle line:90%
and then you die.

00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:29.510 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:31.410 align:middle line:90%
That's what people will say.

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:33.930 align:middle line:84%
So healing is part of
the cleansing process.

00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:36.090 align:middle line:84%
Even though it deals
with the physical body,

00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:38.880 align:middle line:84%
it deals with the emotional
and the spiritual,

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.110 align:middle line:90%
which is the energy part.

00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we getting help
from these astral planes

00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:45.983 align:middle line:84%
from master healers
or anybody like that?

00:44:45.983 --> 00:44:48.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, your
higher self is the main part.

00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:49.950 align:middle line:84%
Your higher self
actually introduces you

00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:51.130 align:middle line:90%
to various spirit guides.

00:44:51.130 --> 00:44:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about spirit
guides for a moment.

00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:54.870 align:middle line:90%
Spirit guides are specialists.

00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:56.730 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you have
a medical problem.

00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:58.480 align:middle line:84%
You're going to connect
with-- your higher

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:01.320 align:middle line:84%
self will connect you with
what's called a chemist guide.

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:04.680 align:middle line:84%
So some biochemical problems,
some hormonal issue,

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.630 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is, the
spirit guide will help

00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:08.010 align:middle line:90%
with that particular healing.

00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:09.960 align:middle line:84%
If you have a
relationship problem,

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.590 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have another guy
that deals with relationships.

00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:12.900 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's specialists
for all these different things,

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:15.550 align:middle line:90%
huh?

00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Or
creativity, whatever.

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.620 align:middle line:84%
So my point is that
your higher self

00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:22.620 align:middle line:84%
is your general practitioner
kind of connecting you

00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:23.910 align:middle line:90%
with the various guides.

00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:25.870 align:middle line:84%
But your higher self
also physically--

00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:28.260 align:middle line:84%
or let's just say
metaphysically--

00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:31.520 align:middle line:84%
does the actual healing on
your physical body, too,

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:33.420 align:middle line:84%
and raises the
frequency vibrational

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:34.713 align:middle line:90%
rate of your soul's energy.

00:45:34.713 --> 00:45:36.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bruce, since
you've been doing this--

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:38.270 align:middle line:84%
and you've been doing
this how many years now?

00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:39.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: 45.

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:40.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 45 years.

00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Are you seeing a change
in progression of people?

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:48.252 align:middle line:84%
Or are they like they
were 45 years ago?

00:45:48.252 --> 00:45:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well,
this is now going

00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:51.730 align:middle line:90%
into the third generation.

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:54.390 align:middle line:84%
What I see is that people
have the same basic problems.

00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:56.010 align:middle line:90%
That really hasn't changed, OK?

00:45:56.010 --> 00:46:00.060 align:middle line:84%
What I see though is more of a
consciousness shift, more open

00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:01.950 align:middle line:90%
mindedness to this.

00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:04.290 align:middle line:90%
So people are more into new age.

00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:07.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't think Gaia TV would
have been around 45 years ago.

00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:08.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But it's big now.

00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Very big now.

00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:15.090 align:middle line:84%
So I see a greater increase in
the new age aspect in general.

00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:18.630 align:middle line:84%
People are becoming more health
conscious, more in general

00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:21.630 align:middle line:84%
about worrying about
the universe, about just

00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:23.940 align:middle line:84%
the quality of life to
a much greater degree.

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:25.320 align:middle line:90%
And they're more open minded.

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:27.330 align:middle line:84%
So to me, hypnosis
is much more accepted

00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:28.480 align:middle line:90%
than it was when I began.

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.300 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've been
involved 45 years.

00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:33.300 align:middle line:84%
You think I've dealt with
maybe skeptics over the years?

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:34.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah.

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:35.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:35.700 align:middle line:90%
A few.

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:37.367 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: [LAUGHS]
Actually, the media

00:46:37.367 --> 00:46:38.760 align:middle line:84%
has been much more
kind to me now

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:39.968 align:middle line:90%
than it was in the beginning.

00:46:39.968 --> 00:46:42.030 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, it
was like pulling teeth,

00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:42.870 align:middle line:90%
to use a metaphor.

00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I think
the exposure you're

00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:46.860 align:middle line:84%
starting to get and have
been getting from let's say

00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:49.200 align:middle line:84%
"Coast to Coast" and
now "Beyond Belief"

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:53.537 align:middle line:84%
and other programs has
helped people understand you.

00:46:53.537 --> 00:46:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, also
my medical training--

00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:57.870 align:middle line:84%
my education helped, too,
because the media looked

00:46:57.870 --> 00:47:00.780 align:middle line:84%
upon me as somebody who was
qualified rather than some X

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:02.870 align:middle line:84%
stage hypnotist or
some entertainer,

00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:04.480 align:middle line:84%
which you see a
lot in this field.

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:05.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:07.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: But a good example.

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.810 align:middle line:84%
When "The Search for Grace,"
the TV movie came out--

00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:11.250 align:middle line:90%
that was back in 1994--

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:14.402 align:middle line:84%
I was doing a
workshop in San Diego.

00:47:14.402 --> 00:47:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And they showed a clip
of it because that

00:47:16.110 --> 00:47:17.040 align:middle line:90%
was the year it aired.

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And the newscaster, one of
them was really skeptical.

00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:22.020 align:middle line:90%
And he says, my name is Thomas.

00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:24.630 align:middle line:84%
Consider me to be
a doubting Thomas.

00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And his other two cohorts said,
Tom, the network documented

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:31.780 align:middle line:84%
this case independently
for three weeks in Buffalo,

00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:32.800 align:middle line:90%
New York.

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:35.342 align:middle line:90%
And he said, oh.

00:47:35.342 --> 00:47:37.550 align:middle line:84%
So two thirds of the people
were actually on my side.

00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:39.480 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly,
the facts where it

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:40.800 align:middle line:90%
was documented by the network.

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.780 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't prove it gives
suggestive evidence.

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:45.480 align:middle line:84%
The point is that
things like that--

00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:50.030 align:middle line:84%
Valerie's case, the
Tammy case from 1997,

00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:51.360 align:middle line:90%
Candela's case here--

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:54.315 align:middle line:84%
these kinds of things
show that it works

00:47:54.315 --> 00:47:55.440 align:middle line:90%
whether you believe or not.

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:57.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what people's
belief systems are.

00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:59.470 align:middle line:90%
They can be skeptical.

00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:00.750 align:middle line:90%
They can be atheists.

00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:02.470 align:middle line:84%
You have a First
Amendment right.

00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:05.520 align:middle line:84%
What I care about is
people healing themselves.

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:07.680 align:middle line:90%
Notice I say healing themselves.

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:08.790 align:middle line:90%
I don't heal them.

00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:10.230 align:middle line:90%
Their higher self does.

00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And going on with their
lives, empowering themselves,

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:13.980 align:middle line:90%
and getting closer to ascension.

00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:15.332 align:middle line:90%
That's all I care about.

00:48:15.332 --> 00:48:17.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting
take on all of this.

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, the etheric
plane has surgeons.

00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:20.490 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about them.

00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:21.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes.

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:23.190 align:middle line:90%
These are the giant tadpoles.

00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:24.880 align:middle line:90%
So let me tell you what happens.

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:26.520 align:middle line:90%
You go to the etheric plane.

00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:28.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're traveling
in your etheric body.

00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:32.160 align:middle line:90%
So let's reincarnate this here.

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Your astral body is taller and
thinner and younger looking

00:48:35.070 --> 00:48:36.940 align:middle line:90%
than your physical body.

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:38.910 align:middle line:84%
The other body is also
a little bit different.

00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:43.080 align:middle line:84%
But the etheric body is
identical, absolutely

00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:44.140 align:middle line:90%
identical.

00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:47.010 align:middle line:84%
So if you heal the etheric
body, you can transfer--

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:49.110 align:middle line:84%
it's very difficult
to do, not a given--

00:48:49.110 --> 00:48:50.020 align:middle line:90%
to the physical body.

00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:51.312 align:middle line:90%
So you're on the etheric plane.

00:48:51.312 --> 00:48:54.240 align:middle line:84%
You're in an OR, a
fifth dimensional OR.

00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:57.085 align:middle line:84%
You're on this table,
and these giant tadpoles

00:48:57.085 --> 00:48:57.960 align:middle line:90%
are working with you.

00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:02.310 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of lights and
sounds, really weird sounds.

00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:05.130 align:middle line:84%
It's very distracting, and
it's very uncomfortable.

00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:08.220 align:middle line:84%
But what they do is
using these laser beams

00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:09.960 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of
techniques-- remember,

00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:11.710 align:middle line:90%
no physical scalpel play.

00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:14.280 align:middle line:90%
These are all energy and sounds.

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:18.490 align:middle line:84%
They then heal the authentic
body, whatever the issue is.

00:49:18.490 --> 00:49:20.100 align:middle line:90%
And then you're done.

00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:21.540 align:middle line:90%
People just kind of go to sleep.

00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:22.620 align:middle line:84%
They don't even
wonder what's going on

00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:24.120 align:middle line:90%
because it's very annoying.

00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And then they wake up
in their physical body,

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:29.640 align:middle line:90%
and everything is fine.

00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, I was going to
play tennis with a physician

00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:33.870 align:middle line:90%
friend of mine.

00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:35.760 align:middle line:90%
And I had hurt my left knee.

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:36.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:37.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK?

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:38.990 align:middle line:84%
So I said to him, I
said, look, I said,

00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:39.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm really in bad shape.

00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't run.

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:41.732 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: I can't play.

00:49:41.732 --> 00:49:44.260 align:middle line:84%
I says, but let me
try one technique.

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And he said, what
are you going to do?

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.860 align:middle line:84%
I said, look, I
don't take pills.

00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:49.660 align:middle line:90%
Give me a break.

00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:53.100 align:middle line:84%
So I used the etheric plane
surgical technique, went

00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:56.610 align:middle line:84%
to the etheric plane, had
the etheric plane surgeons

00:49:56.610 --> 00:49:58.530 align:middle line:90%
play with my left kneecap.

00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:01.927 align:middle line:84%
I woke up maybe
20 minutes later.

00:50:01.927 --> 00:50:02.760 align:middle line:90%
And I called him up.

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:05.790 align:middle line:90%
And I said, see you at 10:00.

00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:07.130 align:middle line:90%
And I beat him.

00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:08.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You beat him?

00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:09.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: My point is that--

00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:10.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:11.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, I was
a better player than him.

00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:12.887 align:middle line:90%
But my point is that--

00:50:12.887 --> 00:50:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Even on one knee.

00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: --the healing
my left kneecap, which was--

00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:19.010 align:middle line:84%
I must have-- I don't know--
twisted or whatever I did.

00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:20.870 align:middle line:90%
It just was gone.

00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:25.270 align:middle line:84%
No medication, no chiropractor,
no physical anything.

00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:26.473 align:middle line:90%
Etheric plane surgery.

00:50:26.473 --> 00:50:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We get a
call from a lady

00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:31.340 align:middle line:84%
who claims that she's the
reincarnated Cleopatra.

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:33.730 align:middle line:90%
She calls the program often.

00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:35.790 align:middle line:90%
And I've got to tell you, Bruce.

00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:39.440 align:middle line:84%
She knows things
that history books

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:41.840 align:middle line:90%
don't know about Cleopatra.

00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And she's not making
this stuff up.

00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:48.270 align:middle line:84%
She said things about her
relationship with Marc Anthony

00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:50.000 align:middle line:90%
and talked about certain things.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And then you go back and look
at these high level books,

00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:55.310 align:middle line:90%
and there they are.

00:50:55.310 --> 00:50:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure she couldn't
have found it that way.

00:50:57.620 --> 00:50:59.060 align:middle line:90%
Who is she?

00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:00.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, OK.

00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:04.220 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with over 35,000
patients over the years

00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:07.460 align:middle line:84%
or done 35,000 regressions
and progressions.

00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:10.940 align:middle line:84%
I have never had a
historical figure myself.

00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:13.280 align:middle line:84%
I've had people who may
have been a lady in waiting

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.420 align:middle line:90%
with Louis XIV.

00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:14.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:15.855 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: But not Louis.

00:51:15.855 --> 00:51:15.970 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:51:15.970 --> 00:51:17.315 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But not Louis.

00:51:17.315 --> 00:51:18.920 align:middle line:90%
Or Marie Antoinette.

00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:22.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: [LAUGHS] The odds
are really high against that.

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:26.880 align:middle line:84%
The only way to do that is to
really do a very deep level

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:31.730 align:middle line:84%
regression and try to find
out information that is not

00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:34.243 align:middle line:84%
in the history books,
even scholarly books,

00:51:34.243 --> 00:51:35.660 align:middle line:84%
because she could
have found that.

00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:36.540 align:middle line:90%
Who knows, you know?

00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:37.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Possible.

00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:40.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: If you can find out
things that then are eventually

00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:45.830 align:middle line:84%
documented, that are not in your
classic scholarly books, that's

00:51:45.830 --> 00:51:46.830 align:middle line:90%
a different ballgame.

00:51:46.830 --> 00:51:47.630 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:49.070 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:50.870 align:middle line:84%
I'd have to work
with her or see her.

00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:55.290 align:middle line:84%
But I hope she doesn't have
any pet asps in her apartment.

00:51:55.290 --> 00:51:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:51:56.090 --> 00:51:56.890 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:51:56.890 --> 00:52:00.390 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember that case about
the cab driver in New York--

00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:01.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes.

00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:04.524 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --who hit a person
who was in the 1800 garbs?

00:52:04.524 --> 00:52:06.357 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Rudolph
Fentz is the man's name.

00:52:06.357 --> 00:52:06.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:07.670 align:middle line:90%
Tell us that story.

00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:08.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:11.900 align:middle line:84%
1876, Rudolph Fentz
is having dinner

00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:14.750 align:middle line:90%
in a restaurant in Kansas City.

00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:17.195 align:middle line:84%
And he goes out for
a constitutional,

00:52:17.195 --> 00:52:19.910 align:middle line:90%
a walk after dinner.

00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:20.710 align:middle line:90%
Disappears.

00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:21.610 align:middle line:90%
Nobody sees him again.

00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nobody
know where he is.

00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:22.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Gone.

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:28.830 align:middle line:84%
He teleports to 1950 New
York City, Times Square.

00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:29.630 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, he's dressed, and he's got
these mutton chops, you know?

00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:33.450 align:middle line:90%
The look of an 1870s--

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:34.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:34.900 align:middle line:90%
He's got the hat.

00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:36.525 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: He's
wearing this zoot suit

00:52:36.525 --> 00:52:38.240 align:middle line:84%
with the stripes and
everything, right?

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:39.800 align:middle line:90%
Completely out of place.

00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:40.930 align:middle line:90%
He's in New York City.

00:52:40.930 --> 00:52:42.180 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't know what a car is.

00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Doesn't
know what a car is.

00:52:43.170 --> 00:52:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And it's rush
hour traffic, and people

00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:46.700 align:middle line:90%
going back and forth.

00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And cab driver, he
doesn't know what's going.

00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:51.110 align:middle line:84%
The cab driver hits
him and kills him.

00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Teleportation didn't kill
him, the cab driver did.

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, the cab driver
wasn't trying to hurt him.

00:52:55.770 --> 00:52:56.960 align:middle line:84%
He just didn't know
what he was doing.

00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:58.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The guy just popped
up in front of the cab.

00:52:58.330 --> 00:53:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: He had some
material in his pocket.

00:53:00.350 --> 00:53:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And he had a receipt of a
stable where his horse, I guess,

00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:07.950 align:middle line:90%
was being kept for the day.

00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:11.010 align:middle line:84%
He had the dinner
receipt from 1876

00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:12.740 align:middle line:90%
and his name, Rudolph Fentz.

00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:14.120 align:middle line:90%
That's how we know who he is.

00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:17.780 align:middle line:90%
So they tried to trace him back.

00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And they found out that there
was a Rudolph Fentz in 1876

00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:22.860 align:middle line:90%
in Kansas City who disappeared.

00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:24.590 align:middle line:90%
Nobody ever found him again.

00:53:24.590 --> 00:53:27.060 align:middle line:90%
That was him in 1950.

00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:29.960 align:middle line:90%
So he teleported by 74 years.

00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:32.540 align:middle line:84%
Again, teleportation--
what he did

00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:34.905 align:middle line:84%
was he entered into a tear
in the fabric of space time.

00:53:34.905 --> 00:53:36.030 align:middle line:90%
That's how people teleport.

00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:37.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did he fall into it?

00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:39.050 align:middle line:90%
Or was he time traveling?

00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:40.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: They're invisible.

00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:43.290 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of cases
in London, England,

00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:47.210 align:middle line:84%
and in Argentina are the two
most populated countries where

00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:49.890 align:middle line:84%
there are spontaneous
cases of teleportation.

00:53:49.890 --> 00:53:50.690 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:53:50.690 --> 00:53:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Where people just walk down the
street, and all of a sudden,

00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:55.670 align:middle line:84%
they're gone, and
they enter into a tear

00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:57.860 align:middle line:90%
in the fabric of space time.

00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And then they move
thousands of miles away.

00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:02.450 align:middle line:90%
There are many documented cases.

00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:04.325 align:middle line:84%
In my book, "Time
Travelers from Our Future,"

00:54:04.325 --> 00:54:08.640 align:middle line:84%
I give many examples of
the teleportation cases.

00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:12.380 align:middle line:84%
So when the time travelers come
back in time for the first 300

00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:15.590 align:middle line:84%
years, the 31st to
the 34th century,

00:54:15.590 --> 00:54:18.770 align:middle line:84%
they travel in a
device like a craft.

00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And they use a wormhole
linear accelerator.

00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it a time machine?

00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:23.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Yeah,
it's kind of like.

00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:25.520 align:middle line:84%
It's called a wormhole
linear accelerator,

00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:28.430 align:middle line:84%
which enlarges a
wormhole to classic size

00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:30.140 align:middle line:84%
and allows the
craft to go through.

00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Every time they do
that, they create

00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:36.230 align:middle line:84%
a tear in the fabric of space
time, almost like a star gate,

00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:39.680 align:middle line:84%
if you want to use that analogy
if you remember the films.

00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:41.683 align:middle line:90%
So they're invisible.

00:54:41.683 --> 00:54:43.850 align:middle line:84%
So you're walking along
when all of a sudden, bingo.

00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:45.050 align:middle line:90%
You're 5,000 miles away.

00:54:45.050 --> 00:54:46.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just like that.

00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Or whatever.

00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:47.570 align:middle line:90%
And there's a case.

00:54:47.570 --> 00:54:49.528 align:middle line:84%
There's a famous case,
the most documented case

00:54:49.528 --> 00:54:53.540 align:middle line:84%
of teleportation in Mexico City
where a gentleman teleported

00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:58.530 align:middle line:84%
to Mexico City dressed in a
Manila, Philippines outfit,

00:54:58.530 --> 00:55:00.440 align:middle line:90%
which is 9,000 miles away.

00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:02.535 align:middle line:84%
And when they brought him
to the governor's office

00:55:02.535 --> 00:55:04.160 align:middle line:84%
and the police, they
said, who are you?

00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:05.780 align:middle line:90%
He says, my name is--

00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:07.760 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to
help the governor,

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:08.930 align:middle line:90%
and he was assassinated.

00:55:08.930 --> 00:55:10.530 align:middle line:90%
And they said, assassinated?

00:55:10.530 --> 00:55:11.850 align:middle line:90%
You're in Mexico City.

00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:13.350 align:middle line:84%
Because they had
different uniforms,

00:55:13.350 --> 00:55:15.970 align:middle line:84%
Mexico versus the Philippines,
Spain, all those countries.

00:55:15.970 --> 00:55:16.970 align:middle line:90%
So they put him in jail.

00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:17.977 align:middle line:90%
That was October.

00:55:17.977 --> 00:55:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And two months later--
it's around Christmas time.

00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:23.150 align:middle line:84%
The ships-- they send the ships
around the world, you know?

00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:27.800 align:middle line:84%
So the ship comes
in to Mexico City.

00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And they say, hey, we
got this guy in jail.

00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:32.090 align:middle line:84%
He was interrogated
by the police.

00:55:32.090 --> 00:55:34.190 align:middle line:84%
He was exorcised by
the Catholic church.

00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:37.730 align:middle line:90%
Remember, this is the 1580s.

00:55:37.730 --> 00:55:40.050 align:middle line:84%
So they said, can
you talk to this guy?

00:55:40.050 --> 00:55:42.680 align:middle line:90%
And they said, it's Gil Perez.

00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:44.730 align:middle line:84%
He's one of the guards
from the governor.

00:55:44.730 --> 00:55:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:55:45.530 --> 00:55:47.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Documented.

00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:50.120 align:middle line:84%
How do you get from
Manila, Philippines,

00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:54.955 align:middle line:84%
to Mexico City 9,000
miles away in the 1500s?

00:55:54.955 --> 00:55:55.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Time travel.

00:55:55.830 --> 00:55:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: You don't
unless you teleport.

00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:58.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or time travel.

00:55:58.890 --> 00:55:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Well.

00:55:59.690 --> 00:56:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, he teleported
back in time by 12 hours, too.

00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:03.110 align:middle line:90%
So that's another issue.

00:56:03.110 --> 00:56:03.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Bruce, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief" again.

00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:07.850 align:middle line:84%
Every time you're
on, it's fascinating.

00:56:07.850 --> 00:56:09.350 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: Well,
every time I'm on,

00:56:09.350 --> 00:56:11.600 align:middle line:10%
it's a pleasure to work
with you and your audience.

00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:14.265 align:middle line:10%
And like I say, when
they communicate with me,

00:56:14.265 --> 00:56:15.890 align:middle line:10%
when I do my sessions
with them-- which

00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:17.920 align:middle line:10%
I can do by Skype
or FaceTime-- they

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:19.430 align:middle line:10%
don't have to be in Los Angeles.

00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:21.080 align:middle line:10%
I love working with them.

00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:22.250 align:middle line:10%
They can go to my website.

00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:23.660 align:middle line:10%
All the materials are on there.

00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:25.030 align:middle line:90%
And there's many articles.

00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:25.863 align:middle line:90%
There's free videos.

00:56:25.863 --> 00:56:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dr. Bruce Goldberg.

00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:27.880 align:middle line:90%
D-R, right?

00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: DrBruceGoldberg.com.

00:56:29.810 --> 00:56:30.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:56:30.690 --> 00:56:31.490 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, Bruce.

00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:32.130 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you again.

00:56:32.130 --> 00:56:32.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: My pleasure.

00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:33.380 align:middle line:90%
Same here.

00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
lives have we had?

00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:37.790 align:middle line:10%
You can find out
through hypnotherapy.

00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:39.500 align:middle line:10%
And maybe-- just maybe--

00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:41.850 align:middle line:10%
it will help you in
your current life.

00:56:41.850 --> 00:56:42.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
