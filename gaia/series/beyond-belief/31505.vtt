[ Silence ]

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:14.114 align:middle line:84%
>> I think many people
today don't know what

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:15.248 align:middle line:90%
to believe anymore.

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:17.484 align:middle line:84%
>> People are basically
going to keep on look

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:19.686 align:middle line:84%
to [inaudible] tell them
what really happened.

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:22.022 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>> We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.694 align:middle line:84%
You weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:34.434 align:middle line:84%
>> And now, the host of the
nationally syndicated coast

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:38.305 align:middle line:84%
to coast AM and GaiamTV
bring you Beyond Belief

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:41.041 align:middle line:90%
with George Noory.

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:42.843 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:42.843 --> 00:00:45.979 align:middle line:84%
You know I have always believed
that if you can't take care

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:49.116 align:middle line:84%
of your health, you can't take
other people you care about,

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:50.383 align:middle line:90%
your loved ones.

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:53.487 align:middle line:84%
And so your health is by
far the most critical thing

00:00:53.487 --> 00:00:55.522 align:middle line:90%
that you can take care of.

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:58.992 align:middle line:84%
Our guest tonight on Beyond
Belief is the noted researcher

00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:02.929 align:middle line:84%
and author, who is going to be
probably save many lives just

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:04.164 align:middle line:90%
on this program alone.

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:06.333 align:middle line:90%
Please welcome Christian Wilde.

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:11.204 align:middle line:84%
[Applause] How are
are you my friend?

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:12.105 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you.

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:13.406 align:middle line:90%
Have a seat.

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:14.441 align:middle line:90%
Always a pleasure.

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:15.809 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
Always a pleasure.

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:18.078 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Do you know
how many people you have saved

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:19.980 align:middle line:90%
over the years?

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.714 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
We have saved.

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:24.951 align:middle line:84%
If you didn't give me that
forum George, they would never

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:27.921 align:middle line:84%
of heard about the things
that we were talking about.

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.723 align:middle line:90%
And therefore, benefit from it.

00:01:29.723 --> 00:01:34.294 align:middle line:84%
I have no way of knowing except
probably for sure eight people

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:37.264 align:middle line:84%
that we know, because
they've come back on the show

00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:40.734 align:middle line:84%
after having been in
late stage heart failure.

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to
get them into trials.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.474 align:middle line:84%
As their advocates, they've
gotten their stem cells.

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:50.410 align:middle line:84%
Takes about 45 minutes
as you know.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.547 align:middle line:84%
And the patient goes
home the next day.

00:01:53.547 --> 00:01:57.851 align:middle line:84%
Six weeks later a person who
couldn't negotiate a trip

00:01:57.851 --> 00:02:00.020 align:middle line:84%
to the broom without
being exhausted.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.854 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yes.

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:02.055 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't even walk three steps.

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:03.256 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: They
told you that in the show.

00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:05.559 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden they're
walking 2, 3 miles a day.

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:08.261 align:middle line:90%
It is absolutely phenomenal.

00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:09.529 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
I'm just wondering

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:11.665 align:middle line:84%
if we should all get injections
with stem cells one day.

00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:13.266 align:middle line:84%
But we'll talk about
some of that.

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:14.634 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
Actually, we may.

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:16.302 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You know, I
was just telling the audience

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:20.874 align:middle line:84%
as I introduced you, how
important it is for everybody,

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:23.643 align:middle line:84%
each individual to take
care of themselves.

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:24.677 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Absolutely.

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:27.113 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I
mean, you lose that.

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:28.515 align:middle line:90%
What good is money?

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:29.883 align:middle line:90%
What good is anything?

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:33.453 align:middle line:84%
What good is the ability to
help your family if you're gone?

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:34.521 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: That's true.

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:36.623 align:middle line:84%
If you're not around
and the old saying,

00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:38.358 align:middle line:84%
"If you got your health,
you got everything."

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:39.559 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Absolutely.

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:41.394 align:middle line:84%
How did you get interested
in all this Christian?

00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:44.464 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: Well, I
was in a different business.

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:46.733 align:middle line:84%
You know I was in the music
industry for 20 so years.

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:49.069 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I may have
you sing a song acapella.

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:50.737 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: I
don't know about that.

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:51.538 align:middle line:90%
But

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:52.939 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: We'll vote.

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.975 align:middle line:84%
We'll vote a little bit later on
to see if they want to see you

00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:56.876 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: But
that's been a long time

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:58.511 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I love
putting people on the spot.

00:02:58.511 --> 00:02:59.879 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.549 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: But at
one point I became concerned

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.086 align:middle line:84%
about friends of mine that
were dying of heart disease.

00:03:06.086 --> 00:03:09.956 align:middle line:84%
I would talk to their families
and the wife might say,

00:03:09.956 --> 00:03:12.726 align:middle line:84%
"Christian, my husband had
a complete physical the

00:03:12.726 --> 00:03:14.527 align:middle line:90%
week before.

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:16.396 align:middle line:90%
A nuclear treadmill.

00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:18.531 align:middle line:90%
Cholesterol was perfect.

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:21.601 align:middle line:84%
Doctor said that I don't need
to see you for another year.

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:24.537 align:middle line:84%
And three days he
died in his sleep.

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:27.707 align:middle line:84%
And I would hear it
time and time again.

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And I became concerned
with what is there

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.712 align:middle line:90%
out there that's hidden?

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:37.250 align:middle line:84%
What hidden heart attack
risk are going undetected

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.486 align:middle line:90%
by physicians?

00:03:39.486 --> 00:03:43.623 align:middle line:84%
So, it took five and a half
years to write the book.

00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:45.191 align:middle line:90%
The first book.

00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:48.361 align:middle line:84%
During that time I had
mortgage on my house.

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:50.697 align:middle line:90%
And just dedicate myself

00:03:50.697 --> 00:03:56.870 align:middle line:84%
to finding not only the hidden
risk factors but what you can do

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.740 align:middle line:84%
to be involved in your own
health care so you could see

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.442 align:middle line:84%
to it that when you
talk to your physician,

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:05.245 align:middle line:84%
you could present your
case intelligently.

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.047 align:middle line:90%
And so that's where we started.

00:04:07.047 --> 00:04:09.182 align:middle line:90%
And it's been very good.

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:11.651 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Noory here has
been kind to me.

00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:14.921 align:middle line:84%
He's had me on that show
so many, many times.

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:16.089 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Can I
tell them how many times?

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Sure.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.093 align:middle line:84%
We figured out it
was over 300 times.

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:22.128 align:middle line:90%
Two times a month average.

00:04:22.128 --> 00:04:23.296 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Little news clip.

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:24.798 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
Little news shows.

00:04:24.798 --> 00:04:26.199 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.468 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: But I'm telling
you, and we'll get into this.

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Some of the people that
have called the program,

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.073 align:middle line:84%
these were regular coast
to coast listeners.

00:04:33.073 --> 00:04:38.244 align:middle line:84%
People who were at deaths door
and I mean, one individual said,

00:04:38.244 --> 00:04:41.448 align:middle line:84%
as I mentioned, he could
barely walk three steps.

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:45.385 align:middle line:84%
Christian got him into an
experimental stem cell program.

00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:46.619 align:middle line:90%
The guy's jogging.

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:47.187 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Yes.

00:04:47.187 --> 00:04:48.154 align:middle line:90%
He's jogging.

00:04:48.154 --> 00:04:50.924 align:middle line:84%
That was after seven
heart attacks.

00:04:50.924 --> 00:04:55.428 align:middle line:84%
By the time he called George,
he had five heart attacks.

00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:58.298 align:middle line:84%
And it took me two years
to get him into a trial.

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:01.601 align:middle line:84%
But I promised him on the
air, I would stay with you

00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:03.970 align:middle line:84%
as your advocate
to get this done.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.807 align:middle line:84%
Well, by the time we got him
in, he had his 7th heart attack.

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:09.075 align:middle line:90%
But isn't that amazing?

00:05:09.075 --> 00:05:11.111 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well,
that's the other thing.

00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:14.714 align:middle line:84%
You know, when someone calls
and says, "I need help."

00:05:14.714 --> 00:05:17.050 align:middle line:84%
We really don't know how
much time they have left.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.385 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: No we don't.

00:05:18.385 --> 00:05:20.286 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And so, you
move at a rapid clip to try

00:05:20.286 --> 00:05:21.654 align:middle line:90%
to get them into the program.

00:05:21.654 --> 00:05:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: There was
one fellow recently, George.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.159 align:middle line:84%
A friend of his called
me and said,

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.694 align:middle line:90%
"Would you try to help him?"

00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:30.964 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the most
gracious man you'll ever meet.

00:05:30.964 --> 00:05:33.400 align:middle line:90%
And so I said, "Okay, I'll him.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.268 align:middle line:84%
Tell him I'm going to
call him so he'll know."

00:05:35.268 --> 00:05:37.070 align:middle line:90%
And so I called him and he said,

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.972 align:middle line:84%
"Oh don't worry about
me, Chris."

00:05:38.972 --> 00:05:41.674 align:middle line:84%
He said, "I'm ready to meet my
[inaudible] my doctor's been

00:05:41.674 --> 00:05:44.544 align:middle line:84%
telling me for two years
to prepare to die."

00:05:44.544 --> 00:05:46.246 align:middle line:90%
He says, "Don't worry about me."

00:05:46.246 --> 00:05:47.647 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Well, I am
worried about you.

00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:49.549 align:middle line:90%
Let me ask you some questions."

00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:53.052 align:middle line:84%
Because I need to pre qualify
these people medically.

00:05:53.052 --> 00:05:55.355 align:middle line:90%
And he gave me the answers.

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:58.925 align:middle line:84%
And I e mailed the director of
one of the major Universities.

00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:01.594 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Can we help
this fellow?"

00:06:01.594 --> 00:06:05.598 align:middle line:84%
He writes me back, "Call
Pamela in the morning.

00:06:05.598 --> 00:06:07.434 align:middle line:90%
Schedule him to come in.

00:06:07.434 --> 00:06:09.202 align:middle line:90%
We're going to save this man."

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:13.239 align:middle line:84%
And he went in since then and
had his own stem cells taken

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:16.309 align:middle line:84%
from his leg and
injected into his heart.

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:17.277 align:middle line:90%
We'll talk about that

00:06:17.277 --> 00:06:17.844 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yes.

00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:18.945 align:middle line:90%
Just amazing.

00:06:18.945 --> 00:06:21.614 align:middle line:90%
You deserve a round of applause.

00:06:21.614 --> 00:06:24.184 align:middle line:90%
[Applause].

00:06:24.184 --> 00:06:26.152 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: George
cares about his listeners.

00:06:26.152 --> 00:06:27.987 align:middle line:90%
There's no question about that.

00:06:27.987 --> 00:06:29.956 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: When people
come down with diseases,

00:06:29.956 --> 00:06:33.893 align:middle line:84%
sometimes you know, it takes
a long time to affect them.

00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:35.962 align:middle line:84%
Heart attacks are
sometimes [inaudible].

00:06:35.962 --> 00:06:37.664 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I've got to you.

00:06:37.664 --> 00:06:39.833 align:middle line:84%
You know, when I'm
preparing for coast to coast

00:06:39.833 --> 00:06:43.436 align:middle line:84%
and you read a story that this
person is a prominent actor

00:06:43.436 --> 00:06:45.872 align:middle line:84%
or somebody just keeled
over, died of a heart attack.

00:06:45.872 --> 00:06:48.541 align:middle line:90%
Showing no symptoms at all.

00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:49.742 align:middle line:90%
That's darn scary.

00:06:49.742 --> 00:06:51.878 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: That's
scary because we wonder.

00:06:51.878 --> 00:06:53.246 align:middle line:84%
And we've talked about
[inaudible] where I sit

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:56.115 align:middle line:84%
in some shows and people like
that you've called me about.

00:06:56.115 --> 00:06:59.486 align:middle line:84%
We wonder if these people
whether the finest medical

00:06:59.486 --> 00:07:02.222 align:middle line:84%
attention they have how
does this happen to them?

00:07:02.222 --> 00:07:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And if it happens to them, what
assurance is there for you and I

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.128 align:middle line:84%
that it's not going
to happen to us?

00:07:09.128 --> 00:07:11.898 align:middle line:84%
You must become involved
in your own health care.

00:07:11.898 --> 00:07:14.734 align:middle line:84%
Because nobody will
have invested interest

00:07:14.734 --> 00:07:16.769 align:middle line:90%
in it more than you.

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:19.639 align:middle line:84%
But to answer George's
question, that's true.

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:21.708 align:middle line:84%
People who have cancer
or Parkinson's,

00:07:21.708 --> 00:07:25.011 align:middle line:84%
they get a diagnosis
of prostate cancer.

00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:27.280 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be around for
a long time before it takes

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.515 align:middle line:90%
its toll.

00:07:28.515 --> 00:07:31.818 align:middle line:84%
That individual has time
to spend with his family,

00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:34.787 align:middle line:84%
to mend some fences
with some people.

00:07:34.787 --> 00:07:36.656 align:middle line:90%
To take some trips.

00:07:36.656 --> 00:07:38.791 align:middle line:90%
To look at his bucket list.

00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:41.528 align:middle line:84%
But as George said, with a
heart attack, it's sudden.

00:07:41.528 --> 00:07:44.998 align:middle line:84%
A man can be 47 years
old, raises his children.

00:07:44.998 --> 00:07:47.233 align:middle line:90%
Got three kids or a woman.

00:07:47.233 --> 00:07:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, it's the
number one killer in the world.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.639 align:middle line:90%
And it strikes too often.

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.674 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: In many cases,

00:07:54.674 --> 00:07:58.111 align:middle line:84%
had he done some
preventative medicine

00:07:58.111 --> 00:08:01.681 align:middle line:84%
or gotten certain tests,
would he have known

00:08:01.681 --> 00:08:03.583 align:middle line:90%
that he had a potential problem?

00:08:03.583 --> 00:08:05.351 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
He would George.

00:08:05.351 --> 00:08:10.356 align:middle line:84%
I recommend that everybody try
to get a nuclear treadmill.

00:08:10.356 --> 00:08:13.226 align:middle line:84%
Because I continually
hear people say,

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:16.729 align:middle line:84%
"Before my heart
attack, I had been told

00:08:16.729 --> 00:08:20.233 align:middle line:84%
that I had no risk factors,
everything was perfect.

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:22.936 align:middle line:90%
Nothing to be concerned about.

00:08:22.936 --> 00:08:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I had a heart attack
and they found out then

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.943 align:middle line:84%
that I have three
major blocked arteries.

00:08:29.943 --> 00:08:32.445 align:middle line:90%
97 percent, 80 percent.

00:08:32.445 --> 00:08:33.979 align:middle line:90%
I had no symptoms."

00:08:33.979 --> 00:08:38.751 align:middle line:84%
The nuclear treadmill tells you
right now, you've got a problem.

00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:40.353 align:middle line:90%
We've got to correct it.

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:41.753 align:middle line:90%
And we can go in to do a stem.

00:08:41.753 --> 00:08:43.423 align:middle line:84%
And this information
is as much good

00:08:43.423 --> 00:08:45.858 align:middle line:84%
for the women as
it is for the men.

00:08:45.858 --> 00:08:47.894 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: It's smart,
preventative business.

00:08:47.894 --> 00:08:50.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, I look at
the body like a car.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.798 align:middle line:90%
I'm the kind of guy.

00:08:51.798 --> 00:08:54.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to drive
a car and have it break

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.369 align:middle line:84%
down on the freeway at 3
o'clock in the morning,

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:58.071 align:middle line:90%
leaving coast to coast.

00:08:58.071 --> 00:08:59.339 align:middle line:90%
I want to make sure

00:08:59.339 --> 00:09:03.443 align:middle line:84%
that whatever maintenance
I do, it's done prior to.

00:09:03.443 --> 00:09:06.279 align:middle line:84%
It's tuned up, the
oil is changed

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:08.147 align:middle line:90%
and everything is humming along.

00:09:08.147 --> 00:09:09.983 align:middle line:84%
I don't want that
car to break down.

00:09:09.983 --> 00:09:10.917 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: No.

00:09:10.917 --> 00:09:11.851 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
And I know I have

00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:13.586 align:middle line:90%
to replace the parts eventually.

00:09:13.586 --> 00:09:17.390 align:middle line:84%
I know I have to fix it, but
I don't want it to break down.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.058 align:middle line:90%
Isn't the body the same way?

00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:20.259 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: You
know, that's a good point.

00:09:20.259 --> 00:09:22.729 align:middle line:84%
I think we know more about
our cars and care more

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:26.399 align:middle line:84%
about taking care of our cars
than we do our own hearts.

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:29.302 align:middle line:84%
You know that's a
magnificent instrument here.

00:09:29.302 --> 00:09:32.205 align:middle line:84%
This little guy, how many
of you know that we depend

00:09:32.205 --> 00:09:36.142 align:middle line:84%
on that heart to beat
100,000 times a day?

00:09:36.142 --> 00:09:37.577 align:middle line:90%
Is that alarming?

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:42.614 align:middle line:84%
Did you know 42 million
times a year?

00:09:42.614 --> 00:09:46.319 align:middle line:84%
George called me one day and
said, "I just read an article

00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:50.823 align:middle line:84%
that says you're heart pumps
enough blood to fill three

00:09:50.823 --> 00:09:56.496 align:middle line:84%
and a half Exxon [inaudible]
oil tankers in our lifetime.

00:09:56.496 --> 00:09:58.531 align:middle line:90%
So we depend on this little guy.

00:09:58.531 --> 00:09:59.832 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
This little thing.

00:09:59.832 --> 00:10:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: The
size of your fist George.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.135 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yes.

00:10:02.135 --> 00:10:03.236 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
We depend on that

00:10:03.236 --> 00:10:06.205 align:middle line:84%
to keep us one beat
this side of eternity.

00:10:06.205 --> 00:10:08.608 align:middle line:90%
So it's that important.

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:10.176 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And what
an incredible instrument

00:10:10.176 --> 00:10:11.477 align:middle line:90%
that the man upstairs gave us.

00:10:11.477 --> 00:10:13.446 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
Oh he did didn't he.

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:14.814 align:middle line:90%
He worked over time on that.

00:10:14.814 --> 00:10:17.183 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And now with
new science, we're beginning

00:10:17.183 --> 00:10:18.751 align:middle line:84%
to be able to repair
some of that.

00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:19.852 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: We are.

00:10:19.852 --> 00:10:22.922 align:middle line:84%
We have some amazing
things that can be done.

00:10:22.922 --> 00:10:24.891 align:middle line:90%
And are being done.

00:10:24.891 --> 00:10:28.327 align:middle line:84%
You know the constructive
at heart, George,

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:34.367 align:middle line:90%
is there are four chambers.

00:10:34.367 --> 00:10:37.737 align:middle line:84%
There are two ventricles on
the bottom left and the right.

00:10:37.737 --> 00:10:40.907 align:middle line:90%
On top of those are the atrium

00:10:40.907 --> 00:10:44.377 align:middle line:84%
that controls the electrical
system of the heart.

00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:48.347 align:middle line:84%
It sends out signals when the
right ventricle should open

00:10:48.347 --> 00:10:49.749 align:middle line:90%
and fill with blood.

00:10:49.749 --> 00:10:52.585 align:middle line:84%
Then it sends another
signal empty.

00:10:52.585 --> 00:10:57.123 align:middle line:84%
Goes to the left chamber or
to the lungs to get oxygen.

00:10:57.123 --> 00:11:00.493 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very well-
orchestrated technique.

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:07.400 align:middle line:84%
We depend on the atrium to
keep all working in sync.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.735 align:middle line:90%
The four chambers of the heart.

00:11:08.735 --> 00:11:10.770 align:middle line:90%
There is the tricuspid.

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:13.039 align:middle line:84%
These are the valves
now, the tricuspid.

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:14.607 align:middle line:90%
The aortic.

00:11:14.607 --> 00:11:17.944 align:middle line:84%
The mitral and the
pulmonic valve.

00:11:17.944 --> 00:11:21.514 align:middle line:84%
Anyone of those can
be deficient.

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:22.815 align:middle line:90%
Can cause a heart attack.

00:11:22.815 --> 00:11:24.917 align:middle line:90%
Can cause heart failure.

00:11:24.917 --> 00:11:26.018 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Quick show of hands.

00:11:26.018 --> 00:11:28.521 align:middle line:84%
How many of you have
ever had a heart problem

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:31.457 align:middle line:90%
or you know somebody who did?

00:11:31.457 --> 00:11:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: How many
of you had a broken heart?

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.628 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well,
that's another problem

00:11:35.628 --> 00:11:36.662 align:middle line:90%
which we'll talk about.

00:11:36.662 --> 00:11:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
Yes, that's true.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I mean, how
many elderly couple, one dies

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.070 align:middle line:84%
and the other goes
soon thereafter?

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:46.606 align:middle line:84%
Or a dog dies and
their master goes.

00:11:46.606 --> 00:11:47.807 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Yes.

00:11:47.807 --> 00:11:50.910 align:middle line:84%
I still mourn over my
dog, he died 20 years ago.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:51.944 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
It's amazing things.

00:11:51.944 --> 00:11:53.346 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Yes.

00:11:53.346 --> 00:11:56.682 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: But there are
ways to prevent heart disease.

00:11:56.682 --> 00:12:00.653 align:middle line:84%
There are ways to prevent an
early exit from this plant.

00:12:00.653 --> 00:12:01.921 align:middle line:90%
And it's very simple.

00:12:01.921 --> 00:12:03.356 align:middle line:84%
Like you said, explain
the treadmill.

00:12:03.356 --> 00:12:04.290 align:middle line:90%
The nuclear treadmill.

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:05.625 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Well

00:12:05.625 --> 00:12:09.462 align:middle line:84%
that nuclear treadmill will
show you show the physician

00:12:09.462 --> 00:12:14.700 align:middle line:84%
by using an agent, which is
out of your body in 24 hours.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:18.671 align:middle line:84%
They can use that trace
agent to show up in colors.

00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:21.874 align:middle line:84%
As they look it he heart,
they say, this section

00:12:21.874 --> 00:12:25.144 align:middle line:84%
of the heart is not
getting enough blood.

00:12:25.144 --> 00:12:26.746 align:middle line:90%
Or this section or this section

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:29.615 align:middle line:84%
and this section
are all compromised.

00:12:29.615 --> 00:12:32.985 align:middle line:84%
Which artery feeds
each of these sections?

00:12:32.985 --> 00:12:34.220 align:middle line:90%
It's blocked.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.957 align:middle line:84%
We need to go in in an
angio gram and take a look.

00:12:37.957 --> 00:12:42.094 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll just take a
[inaudible] on a catheter.

00:12:42.094 --> 00:12:45.264 align:middle line:84%
Go right up at that
spot and burst it open.

00:12:45.264 --> 00:12:47.066 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly that
[inaudible] will keep

00:12:47.066 --> 00:12:49.468 align:middle line:90%
that chamber wide open.

00:12:49.468 --> 00:12:54.040 align:middle line:84%
If you didn't do it, your
quality of life would fail

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.942 align:middle line:90%
and you could die at any minute.

00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:57.043 align:middle line:90%
That's how serious.

00:12:57.043 --> 00:12:58.578 align:middle line:90%
Serious as a heart attack.

00:12:58.578 --> 00:13:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: How soon
will you begin to feel better

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.515 align:middle line:84%
after they pop in a
[inaudible] for example.

00:13:02.515 --> 00:13:04.383 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Next day.

00:13:04.383 --> 00:13:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And if you had to pay for
it, you don't feel that good.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.288 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: All right,
let's take some questions

00:13:09.288 --> 00:13:12.825 align:middle line:84%
for Christian Wilde as we talk
about stem cells and heart.

00:13:12.825 --> 00:13:14.961 align:middle line:84%
Just exciting information
you've bring us.

00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:16.829 align:middle line:90%
Whose got something for us?

00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:18.030 align:middle line:90%
There, yes, sir.

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:19.198 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:13:19.198 --> 00:13:20.666 align:middle line:90%
How are we doing?

00:13:20.666 --> 00:13:24.270 align:middle line:84%
What are some every
day exercises we can do

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:25.471 align:middle line:90%
to maintain our heart health?

00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:26.739 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde:

00:13:26.739 --> 00:13:32.278 align:middle line:84%
Simply walking 30 minutes
a day gives great benefit.

00:13:32.278 --> 00:13:35.815 align:middle line:84%
Cardio. You know,
working out it at the gym.

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:38.451 align:middle line:84%
Certain amount of
weight training.

00:13:38.451 --> 00:13:40.653 align:middle line:84%
But primarily, I think
walking is still one

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:42.788 align:middle line:84%
of the most important
things you can do.

00:13:42.788 --> 00:13:44.257 align:middle line:90%
Gets the circulation going.

00:13:44.257 --> 00:13:47.026 align:middle line:90%
Gets rid of a lot of stress.

00:13:47.026 --> 00:13:50.396 align:middle line:84%
Because remember stress
is still the major killer.

00:13:50.396 --> 00:13:51.664 align:middle line:90%
Don't smoke.

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:53.399 align:middle line:90%
Please don't smoke.

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:56.903 align:middle line:84%
Number one killer of
all still is smoking.

00:13:56.903 --> 00:13:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Isn't that amazing?

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:58.371 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:13:58.371 --> 00:13:59.572 align:middle line:90%
Constrict the arteries?

00:13:59.572 --> 00:14:00.473 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
Constricts the arteries.

00:14:00.473 --> 00:14:01.507 align:middle line:90%
Builds the plaque.

00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:04.477 align:middle line:84%
It helps contribute
to the plaque.

00:14:04.477 --> 00:14:06.679 align:middle line:90%
And narrows the arteries.

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:08.648 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: But exercise
alone isn't going to save you

00:14:08.648 --> 00:14:10.850 align:middle line:84%
if you have a blocked
artery, right?

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:11.851 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: That's true.

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:12.551 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:13.786 align:middle line:90%
He knows. George knows.

00:14:13.786 --> 00:14:18.557 align:middle line:84%
He's following he cares
about his heart I know that.

00:14:18.557 --> 00:14:21.727 align:middle line:84%
If you have certain blood tests,
which you normally aren't going

00:14:21.727 --> 00:14:24.764 align:middle line:90%
to get that are in hidden causes

00:14:24.764 --> 00:14:28.701 align:middle line:84%
of heart attacks
and stroke, George.

00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:30.903 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I
call this by the way,

00:14:30.903 --> 00:14:35.908 align:middle line:84%
the bible of heart disease
and learning about your heart.

00:14:35.908 --> 00:14:37.043 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: And prevent

00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:38.010 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Great
job when you did this.

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:39.245 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
Thanks George.

00:14:39.245 --> 00:14:41.180 align:middle line:84%
But you can find out
certain blood tests

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.049 align:middle line:90%
and ask your doctor for them.

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:45.484 align:middle line:84%
Number one if you
have an elevation

00:14:45.484 --> 00:14:48.254 align:middle line:84%
in something called fibrinogen,
your doctor isn't going

00:14:48.254 --> 00:14:49.689 align:middle line:90%
to check you for that.

00:14:49.689 --> 00:14:54.660 align:middle line:84%
However, for fibrinogens, is
one of the inflammatory factors.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.496 align:middle line:84%
It causes your blood
to become viscous.

00:14:57.496 --> 00:15:01.367 align:middle line:84%
What causes a heart
attack or a stroke?

00:15:01.367 --> 00:15:02.702 align:middle line:90%
Is it not a clot?

00:15:02.702 --> 00:15:03.970 align:middle line:90%
A blood clot.

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:06.839 align:middle line:84%
There's not enough attention
paid to that blood clot

00:15:06.839 --> 00:15:08.774 align:middle line:84%
until after you've
had the stroke.

00:15:08.774 --> 00:15:12.478 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, the doctor wants to
put you on a blood thinner.

00:15:12.478 --> 00:15:14.347 align:middle line:84%
If you're fibrinogen
is elevated,

00:15:14.347 --> 00:15:18.284 align:middle line:84%
you have a great great chance
of having heart disease.

00:15:18.284 --> 00:15:20.453 align:middle line:90%
It's a test I suggest.

00:15:20.453 --> 00:15:23.022 align:middle line:90%
See reactive proteins developed

00:15:23.022 --> 00:15:26.892 align:middle line:84%
by doctor Paul Ridker
at Harvard medical.

00:15:26.892 --> 00:15:30.096 align:middle line:84%
Probably the most important
measurement inflammation.

00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:31.063 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: CRP.

00:15:31.063 --> 00:15:31.897 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: CRP.

00:15:31.897 --> 00:15:33.366 align:middle line:90%
See reactive.

00:15:33.366 --> 00:15:35.267 align:middle line:84%
George and I have been
talking about this for years

00:15:35.267 --> 00:15:38.037 align:middle line:84%
on the importance of
getting your measurement

00:15:38.037 --> 00:15:41.140 align:middle line:84%
down because CRP will literally
tell you whether you're going

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.143 align:middle line:84%
to have a heart attack
in the next six years.

00:15:44.143 --> 00:15:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Now we know it was the
subtitle of the book.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.249 align:middle line:84%
Inflammation cardiologies
new frontier.

00:15:50.249 --> 00:15:52.952 align:middle line:90%
Since then, it's become the fact

00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:56.889 align:middle line:84%
that all diseases are
affected by inflammation.

00:15:56.889 --> 00:16:01.394 align:middle line:84%
So maintaining your inflammatory
factor, you may be surprised

00:16:01.394 --> 00:16:03.929 align:middle line:84%
when you get the test
results that you are

00:16:03.929 --> 00:16:07.066 align:middle line:90%
in a highly danger area.

00:16:07.066 --> 00:16:09.101 align:middle line:84%
If you smoke, if
you're overweight.

00:16:09.101 --> 00:16:11.137 align:middle line:90%
If you have SLE.

00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:12.905 align:middle line:90%
SLE Lupus.

00:16:12.905 --> 00:16:15.775 align:middle line:90%
If you are smoking is a big one.

00:16:15.775 --> 00:16:17.610 align:middle line:84%
It's not a [inaudible]
lifestyle.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:18.444 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Diabetes.

00:16:18.444 --> 00:16:19.378 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Diabetes.

00:16:19.378 --> 00:16:20.012 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:16:20.012 --> 00:16:21.614 align:middle line:90%
Diabetes for sure.

00:16:21.614 --> 00:16:25.584 align:middle line:84%
You must attack that
C reactive protein.

00:16:25.584 --> 00:16:27.286 align:middle line:84%
It can affect your
blood vessels.

00:16:27.286 --> 00:16:32.224 align:middle line:84%
It can make plaque that's just
lying there suddenly erupt.

00:16:32.224 --> 00:16:34.860 align:middle line:84%
One person can have a
whole lot of calcification

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.328 align:middle line:90%
and plaque in the artery.

00:16:36.328 --> 00:16:38.564 align:middle line:90%
He can weigh 260 pounds.

00:16:38.564 --> 00:16:40.766 align:middle line:90%
But not release that plaque.

00:16:40.766 --> 00:16:42.935 align:middle line:90%
Somebody else with normal weight

00:16:42.935 --> 00:16:47.206 align:middle line:84%
because he has the inflammatory
marker in elevation can heat

00:16:47.206 --> 00:16:50.676 align:middle line:84%
up that plaque in any
time and kick it loose.

00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:54.547 align:middle line:84%
They've described
[inaudible] described it

00:16:54.547 --> 00:16:56.649 align:middle line:90%
as bursting like popcorn.

00:16:56.649 --> 00:16:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
that's what could do it.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.485 align:middle line:84%
Let's take your Beyond
Belief cam

00:16:59.485 --> 00:17:02.254 align:middle line:84%
for a question for
Christian Wilde.

00:17:02.254 --> 00:17:03.456 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi Christian.

00:17:03.456 --> 00:17:04.457 align:middle line:90%
My name is Al.

00:17:04.457 --> 00:17:06.325 align:middle line:90%
I'm from Cleveland, Ohio.

00:17:06.325 --> 00:17:09.428 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering what is
sudden death syndrome

00:17:09.428 --> 00:17:11.230 align:middle line:90%
and what causes it?

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.399 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
Interesting question.

00:17:13.399 --> 00:17:15.935 align:middle line:90%
It's not at pleasant subject.

00:17:15.935 --> 00:17:22.775 align:middle line:84%
But 329,000 Americans drop
dead of sudden cardiac death.

00:17:22.775 --> 00:17:24.343 align:middle line:90%
No warning.

00:17:24.343 --> 00:17:26.245 align:middle line:90%
It just happens.

00:17:26.245 --> 00:17:29.815 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
you can't revive.

00:17:29.815 --> 00:17:32.785 align:middle line:84%
There is a difference
between cardiac arrest,

00:17:32.785 --> 00:17:34.487 align:middle line:90%
where people have heart attacks

00:17:34.487 --> 00:17:38.290 align:middle line:84%
because a [inaudible] heart
disease has closed an artery.

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:40.059 align:middle line:90%
That person can survive,

00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:42.294 align:middle line:84%
hopefully if there's
people there.

00:17:42.294 --> 00:17:46.632 align:middle line:84%
And that is an actual
myocardial [inaudible].

00:17:46.632 --> 00:17:49.135 align:middle line:84%
With sudden death,
what happens is

00:17:49.135 --> 00:17:52.505 align:middle line:84%
that the heart the two chambers
I described it he bottom left

00:17:52.505 --> 00:17:55.341 align:middle line:84%
and the right, they go
into defibrillation.

00:17:55.341 --> 00:17:56.876 align:middle line:90%
And are just doing like this.

00:17:56.876 --> 00:18:00.146 align:middle line:84%
And in that instant,
the heart stops

00:18:00.146 --> 00:18:03.082 align:middle line:84%
because the electrical,
it shorts out.

00:18:03.082 --> 00:18:05.284 align:middle line:90%
That is sudden cardio death.

00:18:05.284 --> 00:18:08.287 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's important
to go to a cardiologist

00:18:08.287 --> 00:18:10.089 align:middle line:90%
and let them run their tests

00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:13.759 align:middle line:84%
because they can find these
things before they happen.

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:17.163 align:middle line:84%
Now, of all the things
that I follow,

00:18:17.163 --> 00:18:19.465 align:middle line:90%
and I do this for the show too.

00:18:19.465 --> 00:18:22.535 align:middle line:84%
I go to the American Heart
Association sessions each year

00:18:22.535 --> 00:18:24.804 align:middle line:90%
to see what's coming along.

00:18:24.804 --> 00:18:26.372 align:middle line:90%
It really looks promising.

00:18:26.372 --> 00:18:30.009 align:middle line:84%
And there's something I
want to share with you

00:18:30.009 --> 00:18:33.412 align:middle line:90%
and our gracious host here toad.

00:18:33.412 --> 00:18:39.084 align:middle line:84%
And that is, when somebody
has an open heart surgery

00:18:39.084 --> 00:18:41.253 align:middle line:90%
and times goes by.

00:18:41.253 --> 00:18:46.025 align:middle line:84%
If the physician hasn't found
out your hidden factors,

00:18:46.025 --> 00:18:47.660 align:middle line:90%
you'll be under the scalpel,

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:50.930 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately 10
or 15 years later.

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:55.568 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these people can't
sustain that operation.

00:18:55.568 --> 00:18:58.637 align:middle line:84%
They captain go through
open heart surgery.

00:18:58.637 --> 00:19:03.075 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is the physician
says, "I can't allow you to die

00:19:03.075 --> 00:19:05.411 align:middle line:90%
on the table or a week later.

00:19:05.411 --> 00:19:08.080 align:middle line:84%
Your condition is
just too far gone.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.950 align:middle line:90%
You need a heart valve.

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:13.686 align:middle line:84%
But weigh can't put
in a heart valve."

00:19:13.686 --> 00:19:16.255 align:middle line:84%
Now, normally a heart
valve would be a mitral

00:19:16.255 --> 00:19:20.125 align:middle line:84%
or an aortic valve that they
would get from a tissue valve.

00:19:20.125 --> 00:19:22.161 align:middle line:84%
They'd get it from
a cow a bovine.

00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:23.996 align:middle line:90%
Or they get it from a pig.

00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:25.965 align:middle line:90%
That's a poor sign.

00:19:25.965 --> 00:19:33.205 align:middle line:84%
But our friends at a company
called, Edward's Life Sciences,

00:19:33.205 --> 00:19:35.708 align:middle line:84%
decided to take on
that challenge.

00:19:35.708 --> 00:19:39.411 align:middle line:84%
What about these people who are
going to die that you could save

00:19:39.411 --> 00:19:42.882 align:middle line:84%
if there was a way you
could put a heart valve

00:19:42.882 --> 00:19:46.652 align:middle line:84%
in a mechanical one
without opening the chest

00:19:46.652 --> 00:19:51.190 align:middle line:84%
and presenting them
for open heart surgery.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:55.561 align:middle line:84%
The way they do it
is they put the valve

00:19:55.561 --> 00:19:56.729 align:middle line:90%
which I'm going to show you.

00:19:56.729 --> 00:20:01.433 align:middle line:84%
It's called a sapien
transcatheter heart valve.

00:20:01.433 --> 00:20:03.769 align:middle line:90%
They put it on a catheter head.

00:20:03.769 --> 00:20:06.205 align:middle line:90%
They go in their femoral artery.

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:11.076 align:middle line:84%
Up into your aortic valve
and pop it in place.

00:20:11.076 --> 00:20:12.177 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Pop it in place?

00:20:12.177 --> 00:20:13.445 align:middle line:90%
Just like there's no surgery?

00:20:13.445 --> 00:20:14.747 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: No surgery.

00:20:14.747 --> 00:20:15.881 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Let's see
what this thing looks like.

00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:16.749 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: I'm
going to show it to you.

00:20:16.749 --> 00:20:18.117 align:middle line:90%
But I want to tell it to you.

00:20:18.117 --> 00:20:19.385 align:middle line:90%
We got to be careful.

00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:21.053 align:middle line:90%
This is a real one.

00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:26.825 align:middle line:90%
This one cost $30,000.

00:20:26.825 --> 00:20:28.394 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: $30,000.

00:20:28.394 --> 00:20:31.597 align:middle line:84%
You obviously have to give
it back to the company.

00:20:31.597 --> 00:20:32.598 align:middle line:90%
What's it made out of?

00:20:32.598 --> 00:20:33.599 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian it's
made out of a kind

00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:35.768 align:middle line:90%
of a teflon type of material.

00:20:35.768 --> 00:20:37.269 align:middle line:90%
You can handle it.

00:20:37.269 --> 00:20:42.675 align:middle line:90%
That's the sapien heart valve.

00:20:42.675 --> 00:20:44.243 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Little tiny thing.

00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:45.678 align:middle line:90%
You got a picture of that.

00:20:45.678 --> 00:20:47.046 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
It keeps you alive.

00:20:47.046 --> 00:20:50.716 align:middle line:90%
It's a gravity valve which means

00:20:50.716 --> 00:20:52.051 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Pretty rigid.

00:20:52.051 --> 00:20:53.686 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: Pretty
rigid I haven't even felt it.

00:20:53.686 --> 00:20:56.722 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: It's rigid
and so they just pop it?

00:20:56.722 --> 00:20:58.123 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Yes.

00:20:58.123 --> 00:21:02.494 align:middle line:84%
It goes right over your old
diseased valve that's calcified.

00:21:02.494 --> 00:21:05.631 align:middle line:84%
Then it goes in there, they
pop it with a balloon and poof.

00:21:05.631 --> 00:21:06.966 align:middle line:90%
It takes its place.

00:21:06.966 --> 00:21:08.701 align:middle line:90%
Yes. And then

00:21:08.701 --> 00:21:13.372 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Why
does that cost so much?

00:21:13.372 --> 00:21:15.941 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: Because
I guess that 7 or 10 years

00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:18.744 align:middle line:84%
of going through the
trials and millions

00:21:18.744 --> 00:21:20.412 align:middle line:90%
and millions of dollars.

00:21:20.412 --> 00:21:22.114 align:middle line:84%
It's unfortunate, but
that is what happens.

00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:23.248 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: I mean,

00:21:23.248 --> 00:21:25.517 align:middle line:84%
it's like a toilet part
you get for only $15.

00:21:25.517 --> 00:21:26.819 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Yes.

00:21:26.819 --> 00:21:28.754 align:middle line:84%
It's like the mechanic says
to you, "I put a new valve

00:21:28.754 --> 00:21:31.490 align:middle line:90%
in your car or a new seal.

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:34.159 align:middle line:90%
Seal costs $2.50.

00:21:34.159 --> 00:21:36.061 align:middle line:84%
Where it costs $800
to put it in."

00:21:36.061 --> 00:21:37.262 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: The labor.

00:21:37.262 --> 00:21:37.963 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: That's
a good example, right?

00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:38.497 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yes.

00:21:38.497 --> 00:21:39.898 align:middle line:90%
It sure is.

00:21:39.898 --> 00:21:40.733 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: So that's
one of the new breakthroughs.

00:21:40.733 --> 00:21:41.533 align:middle line:90%
Something to look forward to.

00:21:41.533 --> 00:21:42.868 align:middle line:90%
You might have relatives

00:21:42.868 --> 00:21:46.972 align:middle line:84%
that have insufficient
heart valve problems.

00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:48.173 align:middle line:90%
Mitral valve.

00:21:48.173 --> 00:21:50.275 align:middle line:84%
Mitral valve hasn't
been approved yet.

00:21:50.275 --> 00:21:53.545 align:middle line:84%
There are 50,000 of
these already in people.

00:21:53.545 --> 00:21:55.414 align:middle line:84%
The mitral is about
two years away.

00:21:55.414 --> 00:21:57.182 align:middle line:90%
It's a little bit more complex.

00:21:57.182 --> 00:21:58.584 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: The ancients.

00:21:58.584 --> 00:22:01.019 align:middle line:84%
They lived to about
30, 40 years old.

00:22:01.019 --> 00:22:04.056 align:middle line:84%
Or that was old age
in those days.

00:22:04.056 --> 00:22:06.325 align:middle line:84%
You know, now we're
into the late 70's.

00:22:06.325 --> 00:22:08.827 align:middle line:84%
And some people even
longer than that.

00:22:08.827 --> 00:22:10.929 align:middle line:90%
Is it because of technology?

00:22:10.929 --> 00:22:14.733 align:middle line:84%
What has changed the
lifestyle of people

00:22:14.733 --> 00:22:19.104 align:middle line:84%
where the ancients died in
their 40's and now we're dying

00:22:19.104 --> 00:22:20.906 align:middle line:90%
in our late 70's and 80's.

00:22:20.906 --> 00:22:21.707 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: 90's.

00:22:21.707 --> 00:22:23.575 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people.

00:22:23.575 --> 00:22:24.943 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Is it technology?

00:22:24.943 --> 00:22:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: A lot of
it is technology and knowledge

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:31.316 align:middle line:84%
that you pick up and say,
"I'm going to get involved

00:22:31.316 --> 00:22:32.618 align:middle line:90%
in my own health care.

00:22:32.618 --> 00:22:34.953 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to see my
doctor more often."

00:22:34.953 --> 00:22:38.056 align:middle line:84%
Plus they have the doctor's
have tremendous amount more

00:22:38.056 --> 00:22:43.095 align:middle line:84%
at their disposal to identify
your disease before it happens.

00:22:43.095 --> 00:22:46.198 align:middle line:84%
You know, I don't
know how many George

00:22:46.198 --> 00:22:48.934 align:middle line:84%
and I were doing
this show together

00:22:48.934 --> 00:22:52.271 align:middle line:90%
in Long Beach, a while back.

00:22:52.271 --> 00:22:55.741 align:middle line:84%
And there was a fellow in
the audience Doctor Wallock.

00:22:55.741 --> 00:22:59.178 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned that
the average life span

00:22:59.178 --> 00:23:01.914 align:middle line:90%
of after physician was 58 years.

00:23:01.914 --> 00:23:02.781 align:middle line:90%
You remember that?

00:23:02.781 --> 00:23:03.882 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
I remember that.

00:23:03.882 --> 00:23:05.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
And he confirmed that.

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:06.919 align:middle line:84%
And now there's an
article last week

00:23:06.919 --> 00:23:09.087 align:middle line:84%
about how many surgeons
die very early

00:23:09.087 --> 00:23:11.924 align:middle line:84%
through the stress
they're under.

00:23:11.924 --> 00:23:14.927 align:middle line:84%
So I know we get very
critical of doctors but we got

00:23:14.927 --> 00:23:16.528 align:middle line:90%
to cut a little slack.

00:23:16.528 --> 00:23:18.831 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to be
dedicated your life

00:23:18.831 --> 00:23:21.200 align:middle line:84%
and your average
life span is 58.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.267 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Surely remarkable.

00:23:22.267 --> 00:23:23.635 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: It is.

00:23:23.635 --> 00:23:25.771 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: When you talked
about atrial defibrillation,

00:23:25.771 --> 00:23:30.609 align:middle line:84%
will the heart fibrillate
without an artery blockage?

00:23:30.609 --> 00:23:31.577 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Yes.

00:23:31.577 --> 00:23:33.779 align:middle line:84%
If you have and that's
unfortunate.

00:23:33.779 --> 00:23:35.247 align:middle line:90%
They are not very effective

00:23:35.247 --> 00:23:39.017 align:middle line:84%
in treating atrial
fibrillation, AFib.

00:23:39.017 --> 00:23:42.488 align:middle line:84%
Many of you probably have
family members that have it.

00:23:42.488 --> 00:23:44.923 align:middle line:90%
And it's here's what happens.

00:23:44.923 --> 00:23:48.994 align:middle line:84%
If the heart fibrillates
just a little bit,

00:23:48.994 --> 00:23:53.332 align:middle line:84%
the blood thats being
sent by the atrium

00:23:53.332 --> 00:23:59.071 align:middle line:84%
to the ventricle clots in
that couple of seconds.

00:23:59.071 --> 00:24:04.910 align:middle line:84%
So, the importance is that you
must never miss your medication.

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:09.381 align:middle line:84%
I know somebody who did and
she's in a retirement home now.

00:24:09.381 --> 00:24:10.616 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Blood thinners?

00:24:10.616 --> 00:24:11.617 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
Blood thinners, yes.

00:24:11.617 --> 00:24:12.818 align:middle line:90%
You have to take it.

00:24:12.818 --> 00:24:15.454 align:middle line:84%
You have to be religious
about it.

00:24:15.454 --> 00:24:18.624 align:middle line:84%
They came up with a drug called
Pradaxa, everybody was excited.

00:24:18.624 --> 00:24:21.894 align:middle line:90%
Then 2500 people died from it.

00:24:21.894 --> 00:24:26.231 align:middle line:84%
Coumadin apparently is still
the drug of choice for it.

00:24:26.231 --> 00:24:28.133 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Let's talk
about some natural remedies.

00:24:28.133 --> 00:24:31.036 align:middle line:84%
Things that people can
do at home right now

00:24:31.036 --> 00:24:33.939 align:middle line:84%
to make their heart
tick a little longer.

00:24:33.939 --> 00:24:35.941 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
A little longer.

00:24:35.941 --> 00:24:40.279 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
helps control fibrillation

00:24:40.279 --> 00:24:44.116 align:middle line:84%
and the electrical part of your
heart is your magnesium level.

00:24:44.116 --> 00:24:46.618 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder how many
of us I check myself.

00:24:46.618 --> 00:24:47.953 align:middle line:90%
I went down there.

00:24:47.953 --> 00:24:52.558 align:middle line:84%
I said to the doctor, "I want
you to do a vitamin D test

00:24:52.558 --> 00:24:54.593 align:middle line:90%
and a magnesium test."

00:24:54.593 --> 00:24:57.596 align:middle line:84%
I was below the scale
on magnesium.

00:24:57.596 --> 00:25:01.867 align:middle line:84%
Magnesium can help
women lower their risk

00:25:01.867 --> 00:25:04.736 align:middle line:90%
of sudden death by 77 percent.

00:25:04.736 --> 00:25:07.472 align:middle line:84%
And these are things
like George just said.

00:25:07.472 --> 00:25:10.842 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the natural
things why are we living longer?

00:25:10.842 --> 00:25:11.910 align:middle line:90%
Because of knowledge.

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:14.046 align:middle line:84%
We know because we
just talked about it.

00:25:14.046 --> 00:25:15.847 align:middle line:90%
You got to check your magnesium.

00:25:15.847 --> 00:25:19.218 align:middle line:84%
You have to check your vitamin
D. They didn't know that until

00:25:19.218 --> 00:25:20.652 align:middle line:90%
about three years ago.

00:25:20.652 --> 00:25:24.456 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: It is senseless
not to take care of yourself.

00:25:24.456 --> 00:25:25.757 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
It really is.

00:25:25.757 --> 00:25:27.559 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
When it is so easy.

00:25:27.559 --> 00:25:30.696 align:middle line:84%
You go in you get some simple
blood tests [inaudible].

00:25:30.696 --> 00:25:32.464 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I even know
with my doctors,

00:25:32.464 --> 00:25:35.100 align:middle line:84%
I've told them specifically,
I want to look at that.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:37.469 align:middle line:84%
I said you know, I want
to look at my CRP reading.

00:25:37.469 --> 00:25:39.871 align:middle line:84%
And they look the
you like, what?

00:25:39.871 --> 00:25:42.140 align:middle line:90%
Why would you ask me for that?

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:45.077 align:middle line:84%
But it's critical to have
that kind of knowledge.

00:25:45.077 --> 00:25:47.212 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: And
now CRP is heavily involved

00:25:47.212 --> 00:25:49.781 align:middle line:90%
in Alzheimer's disease.

00:25:49.781 --> 00:25:54.419 align:middle line:84%
It's heavily in involved
homocysteine levels.

00:25:54.419 --> 00:25:57.823 align:middle line:84%
Homocysteine is involved
now as a risk factor.

00:25:57.823 --> 00:25:59.091 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
explain what that is.

00:25:59.091 --> 00:26:03.061 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: Homocysteine
is a sulfur containing

00:26:03.061 --> 00:26:04.796 align:middle line:90%
amino acid.

00:26:04.796 --> 00:26:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And they've kind of played it
down for the past few years.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.802 align:middle line:84%
Though there was a lot
of attention to it.

00:26:10.802 --> 00:26:14.373 align:middle line:84%
If your homocysteine
levels is elevated,

00:26:14.373 --> 00:26:17.709 align:middle line:84%
and you're taking niacine,
it will raise 50 percent.

00:26:17.709 --> 00:26:20.812 align:middle line:84%
And you wouldn't know that
unless you were checked.

00:26:20.812 --> 00:26:23.882 align:middle line:84%
If you're taking a
drug called Tricor,

00:26:23.882 --> 00:26:26.251 align:middle line:90%
a fibrate drug or Gemfibrozil.

00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:29.621 align:middle line:84%
It will raise your homocysteine
levels to danger levels.

00:26:29.621 --> 00:26:31.623 align:middle line:90%
50 percent higher.

00:26:31.623 --> 00:26:34.026 align:middle line:84%
So, knowing your
homocysteine is another one

00:26:34.026 --> 00:26:36.461 align:middle line:84%
of those tests I talk
about in the books.

00:26:36.461 --> 00:26:38.030 align:middle line:90%
I lay them out for you.

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:40.766 align:middle line:84%
Ask for these tests,
I insist on them.

00:26:40.766 --> 00:26:43.969 align:middle line:84%
Now doctors are doing
it more often.

00:26:43.969 --> 00:26:46.738 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And of course
there's my favorite spice.

00:26:46.738 --> 00:26:47.572 align:middle line:90%
Turmeric.

00:26:47.572 --> 00:26:48.407 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Turmeric.

00:26:48.407 --> 00:26:50.342 align:middle line:90%
I thought he'd never mention it.

00:26:50.342 --> 00:26:52.177 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Which I
think I turned you onto it

00:26:52.177 --> 00:26:53.045 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Yes, he did.

00:26:53.045 --> 00:26:54.246 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
A long time ago.

00:26:54.246 --> 00:26:58.684 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: I had
written in hidden causes

00:26:58.684 --> 00:27:02.587 align:middle line:84%
about turmeric's effect on
the heart, and it actually

00:27:02.587 --> 00:27:05.057 align:middle line:84%
in animal studies,
has been shown

00:27:05.057 --> 00:27:07.526 align:middle line:90%
to shrink the enlarged heart.

00:27:07.526 --> 00:27:15.100 align:middle line:84%
What is cardiomyopathy,
the enlarged heart.

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:19.137 align:middle line:84%
But since then, the studies
have been incredible.

00:27:19.137 --> 00:27:20.305 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: I'm going to

00:27:20.305 --> 00:27:21.139 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: If
you were to [inaudible]

00:27:21.139 --> 00:27:22.407 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Keep talking.

00:27:22.407 --> 00:27:24.142 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give this to
everybody in the audience.

00:27:24.142 --> 00:27:25.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: All right.

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:29.347 align:middle line:84%
If you were to do a search
on the internet on Google

00:27:29.347 --> 00:27:35.087 align:middle line:84%
between curcumin and turmeric,
you'd get 20 million responses.

00:27:35.087 --> 00:27:38.824 align:middle line:84%
You're hearing about it
more and more in the news.

00:27:38.824 --> 00:27:41.593 align:middle line:90%
Turmeric is anti- inflammatory.

00:27:41.593 --> 00:27:43.095 align:middle line:90%
Anti infection.

00:27:43.095 --> 00:27:44.596 align:middle line:90%
Anti depression.

00:27:44.596 --> 00:27:49.301 align:middle line:90%
Anti coagulate.

00:27:49.301 --> 00:27:52.270 align:middle line:84%
I could go on if I could
think about them all.

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:53.405 align:middle line:90%
[Chuckles].

00:27:53.405 --> 00:27:57.676 align:middle line:84%
But basically what it
does is beyond belief.

00:27:57.676 --> 00:28:01.913 align:middle line:84%
Talking about beyond belief, If
you do some study on turmeric,

00:28:01.913 --> 00:28:07.519 align:middle line:84%
you will not believe all the
things it affects this is the

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:11.389 align:middle line:84%
the FDA has not approved
turmeric for any disease.

00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:15.961 align:middle line:84%
However, all the scientists
from Duke University, from UCLA,

00:28:15.961 --> 00:28:21.166 align:middle line:84%
from John Hopkins all of them
have gone to India and found

00:28:21.166 --> 00:28:24.035 align:middle line:84%
that they believe that
turmeric is the reason

00:28:24.035 --> 00:28:28.006 align:middle line:84%
for the lowest cancers
on the plant.

00:28:28.006 --> 00:28:32.110 align:middle line:84%
They believe it is the reason
for the lowest Alzheimer.

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:35.413 align:middle line:84%
When UCLA get the school of
medicine went, there they said

00:28:35.413 --> 00:28:40.619 align:middle line:84%
that only one percent of
the villagers over 65,

00:28:40.619 --> 00:28:44.456 align:middle line:84%
in the areas they examined,
developed any form of dementia.

00:28:44.456 --> 00:28:45.724 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: It's
a miracle ingredient.

00:28:45.724 --> 00:28:46.858 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
It kind of is.

00:28:46.858 --> 00:28:49.861 align:middle line:84%
But George is the one
to look into this more.

00:28:49.861 --> 00:28:50.996 align:middle line:90%
You know there's more to it.

00:28:50.996 --> 00:28:52.230 align:middle line:90%
More to it.

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:53.765 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well, and
you've not only did you

00:28:53.765 --> 00:28:57.702 align:middle line:84%
but you also found in a
formula you developed.

00:28:57.702 --> 00:28:59.004 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Right.

00:28:59.004 --> 00:29:00.672 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: That you
can find at MyHeartBook.com.

00:29:00.672 --> 00:29:02.607 align:middle line:90%
That black pepper is a catalyst.

00:29:02.607 --> 00:29:03.542 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Catalyst

00:29:03.542 --> 00:29:04.676 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Catalyst as well.

00:29:04.676 --> 00:29:05.977 align:middle line:84%
And you've found this
out in your research.

00:29:05.977 --> 00:29:07.345 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
In the research.

00:29:07.345 --> 00:29:11.183 align:middle line:84%
I've learned it from the world
leader in turmeric research.

00:29:11.183 --> 00:29:15.053 align:middle line:90%
[Inaudible] published 600 times.

00:29:15.053 --> 00:29:18.089 align:middle line:84%
Director at [inaudible]
cancer clinic.

00:29:18.089 --> 00:29:21.593 align:middle line:84%
And he's also a director
at university of Texas.

00:29:21.593 --> 00:29:26.631 align:middle line:84%
Your body will not absorb
turmeric if you don't have

00:29:26.631 --> 00:29:28.500 align:middle line:90%
in my case in my formula,

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:31.803 align:middle line:84%
I use a patented form
called [inaudible].

00:29:31.803 --> 00:29:35.240 align:middle line:84%
66 percent of it will go
right through your body.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:39.110 align:middle line:84%
But with that, you have the
catalyst that makes it work.

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:41.112 align:middle line:84%
But in the formula
that I put together,

00:29:41.112 --> 00:29:45.650 align:middle line:84%
it has five other
inflammatories.

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:49.154 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose of my product
is simply to not to turn this

00:29:49.154 --> 00:29:51.189 align:middle line:90%
into a commercial, but it is

00:29:51.189 --> 00:29:54.426 align:middle line:84%
to help the bodies do
what it does naturally.

00:29:54.426 --> 00:29:58.697 align:middle line:84%
I remember asking
Doctor Doris Taylor

00:29:58.697 --> 00:30:03.401 align:middle line:84%
at the first international
stem cell conference I said,

00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:06.705 align:middle line:84%
"What is the role of
the research scientist

00:30:06.705 --> 00:30:08.640 align:middle line:90%
for stem cell is going to be?"

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.176 align:middle line:90%
She said, "The best thing

00:30:11.176 --> 00:30:16.014 align:middle line:84%
that scientists can do is
give the body what it needs

00:30:16.014 --> 00:30:19.584 align:middle line:90%
to heal itself and step back

00:30:19.584 --> 00:30:22.354 align:middle line:84%
and let the body do
what it does best."

00:30:22.354 --> 00:30:24.589 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: What
is it about this planet

00:30:24.589 --> 00:30:28.560 align:middle line:84%
that has the remedies for
just about every ailment

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:29.928 align:middle line:90%
that we are discovering?

00:30:29.928 --> 00:30:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: They are
finding that out more and more.

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:34.032 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you an example.

00:30:34.032 --> 00:30:39.571 align:middle line:84%
Three weeks ago, Salk,
the famous Salk Institute,

00:30:39.571 --> 00:30:44.409 align:middle line:84%
Jonus Salk announced that
they are starting a trial

00:30:44.409 --> 00:30:46.077 align:middle line:90%
for Alzheimer's.

00:30:46.077 --> 00:30:49.814 align:middle line:84%
And what is the key
ingredient that they are using?

00:30:49.814 --> 00:30:56.154 align:middle line:84%
Turmeric. Cedars Sinai Hospital
is doing a trial right now

00:30:56.154 --> 00:30:59.190 align:middle line:84%
for people who have
damaged from stroke.

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:00.659 align:middle line:90%
What are they using?

00:31:00.659 --> 00:31:05.630 align:middle line:84%
Turmeric. And we know we can
look at boswellia and all kind

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:10.235 align:middle line:84%
of natural things that
we see, basic medications

00:31:10.235 --> 00:31:12.904 align:middle line:90%
that you pay $300 for.

00:31:12.904 --> 00:31:14.039 align:middle line:90%
And you read them.

00:31:14.039 --> 00:31:17.208 align:middle line:84%
Oh, this is a natural
ingredient, you know.

00:31:17.208 --> 00:31:19.844 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Do you think
it was just an accident that

00:31:19.844 --> 00:31:20.645 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: No.

00:31:20.645 --> 00:31:21.579 align:middle line:90%
I think it's part of a plan.

00:31:21.579 --> 00:31:22.547 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: It's the plan.

00:31:22.547 --> 00:31:23.548 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
It's the plan.

00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:24.416 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
It's right out there.

00:31:24.416 --> 00:31:25.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: You know,

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:26.418 align:middle line:84%
you look at it and
you say, "Wait.

00:31:26.418 --> 00:31:30.689 align:middle line:84%
How could people in
this country people

00:31:30.689 --> 00:31:33.758 align:middle line:84%
who eat yogurt have
less gastric problems.

00:31:33.758 --> 00:31:36.161 align:middle line:90%
People who " it's just amazing.

00:31:36.161 --> 00:31:37.629 align:middle line:90%
It goes on and on and on.

00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:38.830 align:middle line:90%
There are books on it too.

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:40.231 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: It's
actually exciting

00:31:40.231 --> 00:31:43.268 align:middle line:90%
to know how this was designed.

00:31:43.268 --> 00:31:44.636 align:middle line:90%
And that it's out there.

00:31:44.636 --> 00:31:45.837 align:middle line:90%
Where you just have to find it.

00:31:45.837 --> 00:31:47.105 align:middle line:90%
And that's one of the criticisms

00:31:47.105 --> 00:31:51.476 align:middle line:84%
of destroying the amazon
forests and things like that.

00:31:51.476 --> 00:31:52.477 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Oh yes.

00:31:52.477 --> 00:31:54.746 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Because, I think a lot

00:31:54.746 --> 00:31:58.083 align:middle line:84%
of natural remedies
are tucked away there.

00:31:58.083 --> 00:32:00.318 align:middle line:84%
They still haven't
been discovered.

00:32:00.318 --> 00:32:03.054 align:middle line:90%
But if you lose that.

00:32:03.054 --> 00:32:05.724 align:middle line:84%
Aspirin for example is based
on the willow bark, right?

00:32:05.724 --> 00:32:06.491 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Yes.

00:32:06.491 --> 00:32:08.560 align:middle line:90%
You corrected me one time.

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:13.531 align:middle line:84%
I said," Hippocrates was using
it 400 years before Christ.

00:32:13.531 --> 00:32:18.036 align:middle line:84%
Aspirin. He made it from I
think I said a lime tree."

00:32:18.036 --> 00:32:19.070 align:middle line:90%
And George says, "No.

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:21.373 align:middle line:90%
He made it from a willow."

00:32:21.373 --> 00:32:22.741 align:middle line:90%
Stand corrected.

00:32:22.741 --> 00:32:23.641 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You
went and looked and

00:32:23.641 --> 00:32:24.209 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Yes.

00:32:24.209 --> 00:32:25.010 align:middle line:90%
It was right.

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:26.011 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: So be it.

00:32:26.011 --> 00:32:27.645 align:middle line:90%
What about a baby aspirin?

00:32:27.645 --> 00:32:29.114 align:middle line:90%
Every day for everybody.

00:32:29.114 --> 00:32:29.781 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:32:29.781 --> 00:32:31.516 align:middle line:90%
82 milligrams.

00:32:31.516 --> 00:32:33.351 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
I think, you know,

00:32:33.351 --> 00:32:35.587 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a doctor, you know that.

00:32:35.587 --> 00:32:38.556 align:middle line:84%
So it's difficult to
recommend certain things.

00:32:38.556 --> 00:32:42.227 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering how many
lives have been saved

00:32:42.227 --> 00:32:44.029 align:middle line:90%
by that baby aspirin.

00:32:44.029 --> 00:32:47.165 align:middle line:90%
It's kept people from clotting.

00:32:47.165 --> 00:32:49.834 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: They say, if
you're having a heart attack,

00:32:49.834 --> 00:32:51.436 align:middle line:90%
take an aspirin immediately.

00:32:51.436 --> 00:32:52.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: 325.

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:53.571 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: 325.

00:32:53.571 --> 00:32:54.606 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: And
if it's a coated aspirin,

00:32:54.606 --> 00:32:56.541 align:middle line:84%
chew it so you get
it into your system.

00:32:56.541 --> 00:32:57.609 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Just remember that.

00:32:57.609 --> 00:33:00.345 align:middle line:84%
God forbid if you
ever have to to that.

00:33:00.345 --> 00:33:01.513 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
So these people

00:33:01.513 --> 00:33:05.283 align:middle line:84%
that George was talking
about, a PHD doctor

00:33:05.283 --> 00:33:08.753 align:middle line:84%
at Duke University has
decided that she's going

00:33:08.753 --> 00:33:13.658 align:middle line:90%
to challenge the age old notion

00:33:13.658 --> 00:33:17.228 align:middle line:84%
that once a heart
attack is engaged,

00:33:17.228 --> 00:33:20.231 align:middle line:84%
that heart could never
again be repaired.

00:33:20.231 --> 00:33:23.268 align:middle line:84%
That person would eventually
go into heart failure.

00:33:23.268 --> 00:33:24.836 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that what we
always were told?

00:33:24.836 --> 00:33:25.937 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Absolutely.

00:33:25.937 --> 00:33:26.771 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
So Doctor Taylor says,

00:33:26.771 --> 00:33:28.773 align:middle line:90%
"I'm going to challenge that.

00:33:28.773 --> 00:33:35.213 align:middle line:84%
I believe I can take an
induced heart attack in a dog.

00:33:35.213 --> 00:33:38.083 align:middle line:84%
And then I can take stem
cells from the leg muscle,

00:33:38.083 --> 00:33:39.517 align:middle line:90%
because the heart's a muscle.

00:33:39.517 --> 00:33:42.554 align:middle line:84%
And I can add some
growth hormone to it.

00:33:42.554 --> 00:33:46.791 align:middle line:84%
And I can multiply it into
the tens and millions.

00:33:46.791 --> 00:33:55.867 align:middle line:84%
And then I can put a
formulation on a catheter.

00:33:56.634 --> 00:33:58.036 align:middle line:90%
I can go up the dog's leg.

00:33:58.036 --> 00:33:59.871 align:middle line:84%
And I can shoot this
in his heart.

00:33:59.871 --> 00:34:02.507 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that dog is
going to get repaired."

00:34:02.507 --> 00:34:05.343 align:middle line:90%
And lo and behold, it did.

00:34:05.343 --> 00:34:07.278 align:middle line:90%
First time in history.

00:34:07.278 --> 00:34:10.982 align:middle line:84%
So Doctor Warren Sherman
from Columbia university goes

00:34:10.982 --> 00:34:14.385 align:middle line:84%
to the Netherlands to do
the first human patient.

00:34:14.385 --> 00:34:18.723 align:middle line:84%
And then the next year he does
one patient in the United States

00:34:18.723 --> 00:34:21.291 align:middle line:84%
that George interviewed
on his show.

00:34:21.291 --> 00:34:23.094 align:middle line:90%
The boy was 34 years old.

00:34:23.094 --> 00:34:24.996 align:middle line:84%
Had already had four
heart attacks.

00:34:24.996 --> 00:34:25.797 align:middle line:90%
Had 11 [inaudible].

00:34:25.797 --> 00:34:28.166 align:middle line:90%
He was a no option patient.

00:34:28.166 --> 00:34:29.800 align:middle line:90%
He said, "Do me."

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.302 align:middle line:84%
Now I talked to him and
George talks to him.

00:34:32.302 --> 00:34:34.072 align:middle line:90%
Ten years later he's doing fine.

00:34:34.072 --> 00:34:37.208 align:middle line:90%
He's never had a single problem.

00:34:37.208 --> 00:34:39.511 align:middle line:90%
Is that amazing?

00:34:39.511 --> 00:34:41.679 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
the sculpts, the graphs,

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:46.550 align:middle line:84%
the color charts that would
also damage its heart.

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:47.819 align:middle line:90%
It's all repaired now.

00:34:47.819 --> 00:34:49.052 align:middle line:90%
All repaired.

00:34:49.052 --> 00:34:49.621 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Yes.

00:34:49.621 --> 00:34:51.021 align:middle line:90%
They look at it.

00:34:51.021 --> 00:34:56.461 align:middle line:84%
You can look at on a [inaudible]
mapping, you can look at a heart

00:34:56.461 --> 00:34:59.564 align:middle line:84%
and on the mapping they
show in bright red.

00:34:59.564 --> 00:35:02.834 align:middle line:84%
All of the red is
damaged heart tissue.

00:35:02.834 --> 00:35:06.271 align:middle line:84%
And then three months later,
they can look at it again

00:35:06.271 --> 00:35:11.109 align:middle line:84%
and all of the red has now
turned to green and yellow.

00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:14.179 align:middle line:90%
As that scar tissue is replaced.

00:35:14.179 --> 00:35:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter if you had
your heart attacks 15 years ago.

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:20.351 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:35:20.351 --> 00:35:23.054 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
how many you had.

00:35:23.054 --> 00:35:23.955 align:middle line:90%
Because it's amazing.

00:35:23.955 --> 00:35:25.423 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't been approved yet.

00:35:25.423 --> 00:35:26.524 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: [Inaudible]

00:35:26.524 --> 00:35:29.427 align:middle line:84%
when somebody would
get a preventative stem

00:35:29.427 --> 00:35:30.762 align:middle line:90%
cell injection.

00:35:30.762 --> 00:35:34.399 align:middle line:84%
They just harvest it and
they shoot it right into you.

00:35:34.399 --> 00:35:35.033 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Yes.

00:35:35.033 --> 00:35:37.202 align:middle line:90%
Now Doctor Taylor.

00:35:37.202 --> 00:35:39.571 align:middle line:84%
Did I tell you her
name was Doctor Taylor?

00:35:39.571 --> 00:35:41.072 align:middle line:90%
All right I hope I did.

00:35:41.072 --> 00:35:42.907 align:middle line:90%
Because she's an phenomena.

00:35:42.907 --> 00:35:47.679 align:middle line:84%
She's not really content
with that one breakthrough.

00:35:47.679 --> 00:35:52.283 align:middle line:84%
She decides, "I believe
I can take a rat heart

00:35:52.283 --> 00:35:54.485 align:middle line:90%
and bring it back to life."

00:35:54.485 --> 00:35:56.621 align:middle line:90%
She gets a cadabra rat heart.

00:35:56.621 --> 00:35:57.889 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
The heart's dead.

00:35:57.889 --> 00:35:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
The heart's dead.

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:00.892 align:middle line:90%
It's removed.

00:36:00.892 --> 00:36:04.796 align:middle line:84%
She takes stem cells
from a young mouse.

00:36:04.796 --> 00:36:07.966 align:middle line:84%
But first of all, she
decellularizes this heart.

00:36:07.966 --> 00:36:11.369 align:middle line:84%
She washes it with
a kitchen detergent.

00:36:11.369 --> 00:36:12.637 align:middle line:90%
Cleans out all the cells.

00:36:12.637 --> 00:36:17.141 align:middle line:84%
What's left is a
transparent shell or a matrix.

00:36:17.141 --> 00:36:21.012 align:middle line:84%
Now she and her associate,
Doctor Greg Oc,

00:36:21.012 --> 00:36:25.617 align:middle line:84%
from Massachusetts general,
are working together.

00:36:25.617 --> 00:36:28.052 align:middle line:84%
They've injected the stem
cells of the young mouse

00:36:28.052 --> 00:36:31.089 align:middle line:90%
into this cadabra heart.

00:36:31.089 --> 00:36:34.025 align:middle line:84%
On the fourth day they
walk in the laboratory.

00:36:34.025 --> 00:36:35.226 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
It's beating away?

00:36:35.226 --> 00:36:37.595 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
Heart's beating on its own.

00:36:37.595 --> 00:36:38.429 align:middle line:90%
Okay?

00:36:38.429 --> 00:36:39.197 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Truly amazing.

00:36:39.197 --> 00:36:40.131 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Okay?

00:36:40.131 --> 00:36:41.633 align:middle line:84%
Now that opened a
whole new world.

00:36:41.633 --> 00:36:44.736 align:middle line:84%
Because Doctor Paolo
Maracharini [phonetic]

00:36:44.736 --> 00:36:47.472 align:middle line:84%
in Spain says, "Now,
wait a minute.

00:36:47.472 --> 00:36:50.909 align:middle line:84%
If I can do if she can
do that with a heart.

00:36:50.909 --> 00:36:54.612 align:middle line:84%
Why can't I do it for this
young girl, Claudia who's 31

00:36:54.612 --> 00:36:57.315 align:middle line:90%
and dying of trachea cancer?

00:36:57.315 --> 00:37:00.084 align:middle line:90%
Why can't I do the same thing?"

00:37:00.084 --> 00:37:01.152 align:middle line:90%
Because the big problem is

00:37:01.152 --> 00:37:02.287 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: But
it's in her trachea.

00:37:02.287 --> 00:37:03.321 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
In the trachea, yes.

00:37:03.321 --> 00:37:06.624 align:middle line:84%
The big problem is
the body rejects it.

00:37:06.624 --> 00:37:09.193 align:middle line:84%
But when you take out
and decellularize it.

00:37:09.193 --> 00:37:10.295 align:middle line:90%
And take the cells out.

00:37:10.295 --> 00:37:13.731 align:middle line:84%
And then feed the
patient's own cells.

00:37:13.731 --> 00:37:15.199 align:middle line:90%
It tricks the body.

00:37:15.199 --> 00:37:18.069 align:middle line:90%
The body thinks, this is my own.

00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:23.808 align:middle line:84%
So he takes a trachea from a
man, a 51 year old man in Italy.

00:37:23.808 --> 00:37:26.678 align:middle line:90%
And has it shipped to Barcelona.

00:37:26.678 --> 00:37:28.880 align:middle line:90%
Puts it in the patient.

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.082 align:middle line:90%
Puts her stem cells in it.

00:37:31.082 --> 00:37:32.183 align:middle line:90%
She's good to go.

00:37:32.183 --> 00:37:34.085 align:middle line:84%
And now he's doing it
all over the world.

00:37:34.085 --> 00:37:37.255 align:middle line:84%
So as they can do
that with the trachea,

00:37:37.255 --> 00:37:39.324 align:middle line:90%
they can do it with a liver.

00:37:39.324 --> 00:37:40.625 align:middle line:90%
With a kidney.

00:37:40.625 --> 00:37:44.696 align:middle line:84%
Doctor Taylor said, "I don't
see this as decades away.

00:37:44.696 --> 00:37:48.499 align:middle line:84%
Right now medical science
is waiting for an human art

00:37:48.499 --> 00:37:52.136 align:middle line:84%
to be put in a human
being from a cadabra."

00:37:52.136 --> 00:37:54.405 align:middle line:84%
I remember her telling
me that she's concerned

00:37:54.405 --> 00:38:00.078 align:middle line:84%
that 3,000 people a year die
waiting for a heart transplant.

00:38:00.078 --> 00:38:01.746 align:middle line:90%
And this could be the answer."

00:38:01.746 --> 00:38:06.584 align:middle line:84%
So, at Lake Forest university
and at university of Pittsburgh

00:38:06.584 --> 00:38:09.687 align:middle line:84%
and several other
University in the field

00:38:09.687 --> 00:38:11.889 align:middle line:90%
to regenerate the [inaudible].

00:38:11.889 --> 00:38:18.162 align:middle line:84%
They are building
livers, kidneys, bladders

00:38:18.162 --> 00:38:22.867 align:middle line:84%
and other organ parts that can
be implanted into a human being.

00:38:22.867 --> 00:38:28.439 align:middle line:84%
Now a lot of the veterans are
getting replacement ears, limbs

00:38:28.439 --> 00:38:29.374 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Noses.

00:38:29.374 --> 00:38:30.775 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Noses.

00:38:30.775 --> 00:38:34.412 align:middle line:84%
Yes. They can build a they can
make a matrix out of the ear.

00:38:34.412 --> 00:38:36.547 align:middle line:90%
It'll be exactly like your ear.

00:38:36.547 --> 00:38:41.486 align:middle line:84%
They can use an extra
cellular material.

00:38:41.486 --> 00:38:45.223 align:middle line:84%
And in eight weeks, that's a
new ear they could implant.

00:38:45.223 --> 00:38:46.224 align:middle line:90%
Ready to go.

00:38:46.224 --> 00:38:47.492 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
That's truly amazing.

00:38:47.492 --> 00:38:49.227 align:middle line:84%
Let's take some questions
for Christian Wilde here.

00:38:49.227 --> 00:38:50.728 align:middle line:90%
Just raise your hands.

00:38:50.728 --> 00:38:53.297 align:middle line:90%
Anybody? Yes, sir.

00:38:53.297 --> 00:38:56.401 align:middle line:84%
>> What sort of ethical
and legal issues do you run

00:38:56.401 --> 00:39:03.474 align:middle line:84%
into with these kinds of
trials and surgical procedures?

00:39:03.474 --> 00:39:04.342 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
That's a good question.

00:39:04.342 --> 00:39:05.676 align:middle line:90%
These are monitored by the FDA.

00:39:05.676 --> 00:39:09.914 align:middle line:84%
They cannot do this
without FDA approval.

00:39:09.914 --> 00:39:13.918 align:middle line:84%
And they are watched
very scrupulously.

00:39:13.918 --> 00:39:18.523 align:middle line:84%
They have to absolutely report
on everything it goes on.

00:39:18.523 --> 00:39:20.758 align:middle line:84%
I have not heard
of anybody dying

00:39:20.758 --> 00:39:23.294 align:middle line:84%
from this heart procedure
that I mentioned.

00:39:23.294 --> 00:39:26.898 align:middle line:84%
And now they're using
donor stem cells

00:39:26.898 --> 00:39:31.669 align:middle line:84%
from other people instead
of the thigh muscle.

00:39:31.669 --> 00:39:33.037 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Why is that?

00:39:33.037 --> 00:39:35.339 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: It's just
see they are more prevalent.

00:39:35.339 --> 00:39:37.942 align:middle line:90%
They can get those from anybody.

00:39:37.942 --> 00:39:40.411 align:middle line:84%
And eventually what'll
happen George is it's going

00:39:40.411 --> 00:39:42.213 align:middle line:90%
to be off the shelf.

00:39:42.213 --> 00:39:47.685 align:middle line:84%
The doctor will be able to
order stem cells off the shelf

00:39:47.685 --> 00:39:50.188 align:middle line:90%
and use them for your body.

00:39:50.188 --> 00:39:53.524 align:middle line:90%
And another answer for that.

00:39:53.524 --> 00:39:56.861 align:middle line:84%
If the pharmaceutical
companies were going to spend 50

00:39:56.861 --> 00:40:00.565 align:middle line:84%
to a hundred million dollars
on a trial, they are not going

00:40:00.565 --> 00:40:04.001 align:middle line:84%
to make any money
doing this procedure.

00:40:04.001 --> 00:40:08.072 align:middle line:84%
It takes I've been in this
procedure, it takes 45 minutes.

00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:10.508 align:middle line:90%
And I'm talking to the patient.

00:40:10.508 --> 00:40:12.510 align:middle line:90%
And he's listening to music.

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:14.612 align:middle line:90%
My CD. [Chuckles]

00:40:14.612 --> 00:40:17.215 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Which we're
going to have you sing.

00:40:17.215 --> 00:40:21.919 align:middle line:84%
Let's take another question
from our Beyond Belief cam.

00:40:21.919 --> 00:40:23.421 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi Chris.

00:40:23.421 --> 00:40:25.523 align:middle line:90%
I'm Melissa from California.

00:40:25.523 --> 00:40:27.558 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering what
your thoughts were

00:40:27.558 --> 00:40:31.596 align:middle line:84%
on freezing the umbilical
cord for stem cells.

00:40:31.596 --> 00:40:32.897 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
Oh, good question.

00:40:32.897 --> 00:40:33.865 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: That seems

00:40:33.865 --> 00:40:35.833 align:middle line:84%
to be going away
somewhat, isn't it?

00:40:35.833 --> 00:40:37.969 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: I
want to try to change it.

00:40:37.969 --> 00:40:39.604 align:middle line:84%
How many of you have
heard about that?

00:40:39.604 --> 00:40:41.706 align:middle line:90%
Storing the umbilical cord.

00:40:41.706 --> 00:40:43.107 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you the
rational for it.

00:40:43.107 --> 00:40:44.175 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
It's controversial.

00:40:44.175 --> 00:40:45.877 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
Controversial.

00:40:45.877 --> 00:40:48.112 align:middle line:90%
But here's the good point.

00:40:48.112 --> 00:40:52.717 align:middle line:84%
You don't know whether your
child is going to be able

00:40:52.717 --> 00:40:55.152 align:middle line:90%
to walk for a couple of years.

00:40:55.152 --> 00:40:58.489 align:middle line:84%
You don't know if your child
is going to be able to talk.

00:40:58.489 --> 00:41:00.825 align:middle line:90%
You're watching all the time.

00:41:00.825 --> 00:41:08.099 align:middle line:84%
It's possible your child has a
defect from birth in general.

00:41:08.099 --> 00:41:10.601 align:middle line:90%
Childhood diseases show up.

00:41:10.601 --> 00:41:15.306 align:middle line:84%
Up to 18, there's many diseases
that can strike a child.

00:41:15.306 --> 00:41:19.877 align:middle line:84%
But if science, by then,
has a cure for this disease

00:41:19.877 --> 00:41:25.616 align:middle line:84%
with stem cells and you have
stored the blood, the cord blood

00:41:25.616 --> 00:41:28.085 align:middle line:84%
from the birth, they
can take that

00:41:28.085 --> 00:41:30.621 align:middle line:84%
and purify it and
heal that child.

00:41:30.621 --> 00:41:32.456 align:middle line:90%
I want to give you an example.

00:41:32.456 --> 00:41:37.929 align:middle line:84%
At Duke University, director of
pediatrics, Joanne Kurtzberg,

00:41:37.929 --> 00:41:41.732 align:middle line:84%
has brought a child
who has cerebral palsy.

00:41:41.732 --> 00:41:44.235 align:middle line:84%
The reason they are
bring the child to her is

00:41:44.235 --> 00:41:49.707 align:middle line:84%
because she's an advocate of
umbilical storage of stem cells.

00:41:49.707 --> 00:41:53.711 align:middle line:84%
She says, "Because you have
done that, I can take blood

00:41:53.711 --> 00:41:56.047 align:middle line:90%
from there and I can purify it.

00:41:56.047 --> 00:41:59.116 align:middle line:84%
Take out the abhorrent
gene that's in it.

00:41:59.116 --> 00:42:01.886 align:middle line:84%
And inject it into the
child through his hand.

00:42:01.886 --> 00:42:05.556 align:middle line:84%
And six months later, that
child is completely free

00:42:05.556 --> 00:42:07.058 align:middle line:90%
of cerebral palsy.

00:42:07.058 --> 00:42:10.595 align:middle line:84%
And on my website, under
stem cell miracles,

00:42:10.595 --> 00:42:11.996 align:middle line:90%
you can see a story.

00:42:11.996 --> 00:42:14.966 align:middle line:84%
It'll bring tears to your eyes,
of a little two year old girl

00:42:14.966 --> 00:42:19.503 align:middle line:84%
who had been photographed in
her problems as she developed

00:42:19.503 --> 00:42:25.176 align:middle line:84%
and found out she had mobility
problems and speech problems.

00:42:25.176 --> 00:42:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And because of stem cells,
she's a hundred percent.

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:30.715 align:middle line:90%
And you'll see it.

00:42:30.715 --> 00:42:34.185 align:middle line:84%
It was a TV thing
that I put on there.

00:42:34.185 --> 00:42:35.786 align:middle line:84%
And now they find
that they may be able

00:42:35.786 --> 00:42:38.689 align:middle line:90%
to help other family members.

00:42:38.689 --> 00:42:40.491 align:middle line:90%
So, it's an investment.

00:42:40.491 --> 00:42:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Like George said,
it is an investment.

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Grandparents will sometimes
do it for their newborn.

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:47.164 align:middle line:90%
Say, "Let me just do it.

00:42:47.164 --> 00:42:48.833 align:middle line:84%
If I can only afford to
do it for three years,

00:42:48.833 --> 00:42:49.867 align:middle line:90%
I'll do it for three years.

00:42:49.867 --> 00:42:52.737 align:middle line:84%
It might cost $75
a month, I figure."

00:42:52.737 --> 00:42:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And at that point you find
out if the child can talk.

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.975 align:middle line:90%
If the child can walk.

00:42:57.975 --> 00:43:00.077 align:middle line:84%
You know? And think
what a blessing it is

00:43:00.077 --> 00:43:03.714 align:middle line:84%
that you can save
that child's misery.

00:43:03.714 --> 00:43:05.616 align:middle line:90%
Cerebral palsy among them.

00:43:05.616 --> 00:43:07.718 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Let's take
another question in the audience

00:43:07.718 --> 00:43:09.720 align:middle line:90%
for Christian Wilde yes, sir?

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:10.888 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi Christian.

00:43:10.888 --> 00:43:13.758 align:middle line:84%
Is plaque buildup
in the arteries one

00:43:13.758 --> 00:43:16.093 align:middle line:84%
of the main causes
of heart attacks?

00:43:16.093 --> 00:43:19.463 align:middle line:84%
And is there any way
to reduce or eliminate

00:43:19.463 --> 00:43:22.566 align:middle line:90%
that by diet and exercise alone?

00:43:22.566 --> 00:43:25.903 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: Unless
you have a predisposition

00:43:25.903 --> 00:43:29.740 align:middle line:84%
in your family line, in the
hidden causes, what we talk

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:35.413 align:middle line:84%
about a lot is what could
have taken your grandfather

00:43:35.413 --> 00:43:41.952 align:middle line:84%
out at 54 years of age and then
his son at 50 years of age.

00:43:41.952 --> 00:43:45.356 align:middle line:84%
And now you're 50 years
of age, and you wonder,

00:43:45.356 --> 00:43:47.725 align:middle line:84%
what's going on in
my family line?

00:43:47.725 --> 00:43:51.228 align:middle line:84%
If they can detector what's
going on now, which we talk

00:43:51.228 --> 00:43:53.898 align:middle line:84%
about in the book,
most physicians don't.

00:43:53.898 --> 00:43:56.300 align:middle line:84%
They just treat you
as an individual.

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:59.236 align:middle line:84%
But those hidden factors have
been passed on from generations

00:43:59.236 --> 00:44:01.772 align:middle line:90%
to generations to generations.

00:44:01.772 --> 00:44:05.109 align:middle line:84%
And you will pass them onto
your children, unfortunately.

00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:09.180 align:middle line:84%
Unless you learn to go
in and detect what it is

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:10.614 align:middle line:90%
that you've inherited.

00:44:10.614 --> 00:44:15.386 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you just have
a normal lifestyle.

00:44:15.386 --> 00:44:16.454 align:middle line:90%
And you have built

00:44:16.454 --> 00:44:21.258 align:middle line:84%
up calcification
plaque, in your arteries.

00:44:21.258 --> 00:44:25.329 align:middle line:84%
Doctor Doris Taylor also
addresses that issue.

00:44:25.329 --> 00:44:28.666 align:middle line:84%
She took a young mouse
and she took an old mouse.

00:44:28.666 --> 00:44:33.504 align:middle line:84%
She induced a great
amount of plaque

00:44:33.504 --> 00:44:36.640 align:middle line:84%
in the artery of
the older mouse.

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:41.145 align:middle line:84%
And then she took stem
cells from a young mouse

00:44:41.145 --> 00:44:45.816 align:middle line:84%
and injected them into that
mouse, the older mouse.

00:44:45.816 --> 00:44:49.186 align:middle line:84%
And she could see
before and after.

00:44:49.186 --> 00:44:53.858 align:middle line:84%
The stem cells eroded
and took out 95 percent

00:44:53.858 --> 00:44:56.260 align:middle line:90%
of the plaque buildup.

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:58.229 align:middle line:90%
But the stress is a factor.

00:44:58.229 --> 00:44:59.263 align:middle line:90%
[Inaudible] is a factor.

00:44:59.263 --> 00:45:01.398 align:middle line:90%
Homocysteine's a factor.

00:45:01.398 --> 00:45:04.268 align:middle line:90%
Definitely CRP is a factor.

00:45:04.268 --> 00:45:06.203 align:middle line:90%
All of these things contribute.

00:45:06.203 --> 00:45:08.439 align:middle line:90%
Smoking is still number one.

00:45:08.439 --> 00:45:12.610 align:middle line:84%
We've got Beyond Belief cam
question for you Christian.

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:14.211 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:45:14.211 --> 00:45:17.114 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi Christian, my name
is mark from a Washington,

00:45:17.114 --> 00:45:20.417 align:middle line:84%
D.C. the scientist tell us
that one day they'll be able

00:45:20.417 --> 00:45:22.653 align:middle line:90%
to replace our body parts.

00:45:22.653 --> 00:45:25.589 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: So, let's
replace these body parts.

00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:26.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Yes.

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:31.896 align:middle line:84%
You know, a person
dies prematurely.

00:45:31.896 --> 00:45:35.399 align:middle line:84%
To answer George's question
about the fact that people die

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:39.003 align:middle line:84%
and live 40 years, 35,
40 years then they die.

00:45:39.003 --> 00:45:44.241 align:middle line:84%
A person dies because of
liver failure, kidney failure,

00:45:44.241 --> 00:45:46.944 align:middle line:90%
heart failure, lung failure.

00:45:46.944 --> 00:45:48.479 align:middle line:90%
And have they not had any

00:45:48.479 --> 00:45:51.382 align:middle line:84%
of those diseases they
probably would have lived a 30

00:45:51.382 --> 00:45:53.717 align:middle line:90%
or 40 years longer.

00:45:53.717 --> 00:45:58.956 align:middle line:84%
Now, because of doctor Doris
Taylor's work, they can replace

00:45:58.956 --> 00:46:01.892 align:middle line:90%
and will replace that kidney.

00:46:01.892 --> 00:46:03.093 align:middle line:90%
And you're good to go.

00:46:03.093 --> 00:46:05.596 align:middle line:84%
It's like the car we
were talking about.

00:46:05.596 --> 00:46:07.565 align:middle line:84%
You need to put the
transmission in it.

00:46:07.565 --> 00:46:08.899 align:middle line:90%
So this car is good.

00:46:08.899 --> 00:46:11.135 align:middle line:84%
Now if I put a new
transmission in it,

00:46:11.135 --> 00:46:14.471 align:middle line:84%
this person's body
is back to normal

00:46:14.471 --> 00:46:16.941 align:middle line:90%
if I can replace that liver.

00:46:16.941 --> 00:46:20.244 align:middle line:84%
If I can replace that
lung or those lungs.

00:46:20.244 --> 00:46:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's all being
done right now.

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:25.683 align:middle line:84%
And then once it
gets FDA approved,

00:46:25.683 --> 00:46:27.017 align:middle line:90%
you will know about it.

00:46:27.017 --> 00:46:30.688 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you right
now, it is being done.

00:46:30.688 --> 00:46:33.057 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: So, if you
were to go up to someone

00:46:33.057 --> 00:46:36.660 align:middle line:84%
who would come up to you
and say, "What do I do?"

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:38.829 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you spell out,
first of all, and we'll get

00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:41.932 align:middle line:84%
into the stem cell treatments
and some things people can do,

00:46:41.932 --> 00:46:45.269 align:middle line:84%
but in terms of just
taking care of your heart,

00:46:45.269 --> 00:46:48.539 align:middle line:84%
what do you recommend
people do right now?

00:46:48.539 --> 00:46:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
Coenzyme Q10.

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:51.742 align:middle line:84%
If you're taking this
[inaudible] drug,

00:46:51.742 --> 00:46:54.311 align:middle line:84%
how many of you are
taking [inaudible] drugs?

00:46:54.311 --> 00:46:55.412 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Cholesterol lowers.

00:46:55.412 --> 00:46:56.413 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
Only one person?

00:46:56.413 --> 00:46:57.548 align:middle line:90%
This is a healthy group.

00:46:57.548 --> 00:47:01.151 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: This
is a healthy group.

00:47:01.151 --> 00:47:02.586 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Yes.

00:47:02.586 --> 00:47:07.091 align:middle line:84%
If you take any [inaudible]
drug you're depleting your heart

00:47:07.091 --> 00:47:09.994 align:middle line:90%
of Coenzyme Q10.

00:47:09.994 --> 00:47:14.798 align:middle line:84%
Coenzyme Q10 is required of
every muscle of your body.

00:47:14.798 --> 00:47:19.770 align:middle line:84%
If you got a prescription
in Canada for any

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:20.971 align:middle line:90%
of the [inaudible] drugs,

00:47:20.971 --> 00:47:25.209 align:middle line:84%
you would also be told you
must take Coenzyme Q10.

00:47:25.209 --> 00:47:26.777 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Why
don't they tell you here?

00:47:26.777 --> 00:47:29.513 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: That's
an interesting question.

00:47:29.513 --> 00:47:31.649 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you it takes a
little time to answer that,

00:47:31.649 --> 00:47:36.253 align:middle line:84%
but when they developed the
very first [inaudible] drug,

00:47:36.253 --> 00:47:37.988 align:middle line:90%
it was Merc [phonetic].

00:47:37.988 --> 00:47:41.292 align:middle line:84%
And it of us called
[inaudible] statin.

00:47:41.292 --> 00:47:45.796 align:middle line:84%
They have a director of
exploratory research by the name

00:47:45.796 --> 00:47:49.066 align:middle line:90%
of Doctor Karl Folkers.

00:47:49.066 --> 00:47:51.235 align:middle line:90%
And he told the company

00:47:51.235 --> 00:47:54.138 align:middle line:84%
that this drug we're
developing lowers cholesterol,

00:47:54.138 --> 00:47:55.272 align:middle line:90%
but it does something else.

00:47:55.272 --> 00:47:58.475 align:middle line:90%
It depletes Coenzyme Q10.

00:47:58.475 --> 00:48:00.878 align:middle line:90%
They filed two patents.

00:48:00.878 --> 00:48:03.514 align:middle line:90%
So nobody else could do it.

00:48:03.514 --> 00:48:06.750 align:middle line:84%
Other companies would have
added it to their drugs,

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:10.054 align:middle line:90%
but Merc kept it quiet.

00:48:10.054 --> 00:48:13.857 align:middle line:84%
There's a patent request
by Doctor Julian Whitaker,

00:48:13.857 --> 00:48:17.294 align:middle line:84%
for several years now,
the petition to the FDA,

00:48:17.294 --> 00:48:20.230 align:middle line:90%
that they must warn all people

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:21.932 align:middle line:84%
that if you're taking
any statin drugs,

00:48:21.932 --> 00:48:24.835 align:middle line:90%
you must take Coenzyme Q10.

00:48:24.835 --> 00:48:27.237 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually
put a person

00:48:27.237 --> 00:48:29.540 align:middle line:90%
into heart failure eventually.

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:33.310 align:middle line:84%
As you weaken the heart
without getting Coenzyme Q10.

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:35.145 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: So that's
just a simple supplement

00:48:35.145 --> 00:48:36.080 align:middle line:90%
that you get?

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.081 align:middle line:84%
And it's pretty expensive
though.

00:48:37.081 --> 00:48:37.948 align:middle line:90%
It's not cheap.

00:48:37.948 --> 00:48:39.016 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: You mean,

00:48:39.016 --> 00:48:41.185 align:middle line:84%
like the [inaudible]
and stuff like that.

00:48:41.185 --> 00:48:41.819 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yes.

00:48:41.819 --> 00:48:42.987 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:48:42.987 --> 00:48:45.389 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
People have done very well

00:48:45.389 --> 00:48:46.490 align:middle line:90%
with a [inaudible] product.

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:50.995 align:middle line:84%
There are some natural
products out there.

00:48:50.995 --> 00:48:52.863 align:middle line:90%
No side effects.

00:48:52.863 --> 00:48:55.566 align:middle line:84%
And might be a good
thing to try.

00:48:55.566 --> 00:49:03.507 align:middle line:84%
At any rate, lowering
cholesterol is important.

00:49:03.507 --> 00:49:06.276 align:middle line:90%
But there is a risk factor too.

00:49:06.276 --> 00:49:09.179 align:middle line:84%
You can lower your
cholesterol too much.

00:49:09.179 --> 00:49:10.981 align:middle line:90%
I've looked at 16 studies.

00:49:10.981 --> 00:49:17.554 align:middle line:84%
They said for longevity, a
level of 180 to 200 is advisable

00:49:17.554 --> 00:49:20.391 align:middle line:90%
for a longer life span.

00:49:20.391 --> 00:49:24.228 align:middle line:84%
If your doctor's telling you
and is very proud of the fact

00:49:24.228 --> 00:49:28.799 align:middle line:84%
that he has driven your total
cholesterol down to 140 or 130.

00:49:28.799 --> 00:49:31.435 align:middle line:84%
And he's so proud of
himself, he's so proud of you.

00:49:31.435 --> 00:49:33.337 align:middle line:90%
Look what we've done.

00:49:33.337 --> 00:49:37.341 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't realize that when
doctor [inaudible] university

00:49:37.341 --> 00:49:39.443 align:middle line:90%
of California, San Diego

00:49:39.443 --> 00:49:43.747 align:middle line:84%
who is running the
international stem cell,

00:49:43.747 --> 00:49:47.885 align:middle line:84%
I mean statin side effect
trial from the government.

00:49:47.885 --> 00:49:51.221 align:middle line:84%
That when she separated
primates.

00:49:51.221 --> 00:49:55.292 align:middle line:84%
The primates with the very low
cholesterol suddenly became

00:49:55.292 --> 00:49:59.430 align:middle line:84%
aggressive, negative and
began attacking all the

00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:01.165 align:middle line:90%
other primates.

00:50:01.165 --> 00:50:02.699 align:middle line:90%
They became depressed.

00:50:02.699 --> 00:50:08.939 align:middle line:84%
Your body requires cholesterol
to produce [inaudible]

00:50:08.939 --> 00:50:12.709 align:middle line:90%
if you lower it too much,

00:50:12.709 --> 00:50:17.648 align:middle line:84%
the brain which is effected
very definitely by cholesterol.

00:50:17.648 --> 00:50:20.784 align:middle line:84%
When you lower it too much,
the protective membrane

00:50:20.784 --> 00:50:22.653 align:middle line:90%
that keeps you from bleeding,

00:50:22.653 --> 00:50:26.657 align:middle line:84%
having brain bleeds,
is suddenly weakened.

00:50:26.657 --> 00:50:29.593 align:middle line:84%
And you can have a
hemorrhagic stroke.

00:50:29.593 --> 00:50:33.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying everybody
who's cholesterol is 115,

00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:34.164 align:middle line:90%
that's going to happen.

00:50:34.164 --> 00:50:37.367 align:middle line:84%
But the possibility is
that it could happen.

00:50:37.367 --> 00:50:38.936 align:middle line:90%
Here is the point.

00:50:38.936 --> 00:50:42.473 align:middle line:84%
Cholesterol is not
your big enemy.

00:50:42.473 --> 00:50:45.542 align:middle line:90%
It is LDM cholesterol.

00:50:45.542 --> 00:50:47.678 align:middle line:90%
That's what needs to be lowered.

00:50:47.678 --> 00:50:49.646 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that
in order to lower it,

00:50:49.646 --> 00:50:53.484 align:middle line:84%
some physicians are
pushing the entire profile

00:50:53.484 --> 00:50:55.786 align:middle line:90%
to a dangerous level.

00:50:55.786 --> 00:50:59.022 align:middle line:84%
It can be dangerous to
lower cholesterol too much.

00:50:59.022 --> 00:51:01.825 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Yes I know some
people who have very low levels

00:51:01.825 --> 00:51:03.694 align:middle line:90%
and now the doctor's concerned.

00:51:03.694 --> 00:51:05.095 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Really.

00:51:05.095 --> 00:51:06.230 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You're going
to have a raise that up again.

00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:07.397 align:middle line:90%
How do you raise it back up?

00:51:07.397 --> 00:51:10.601 align:middle line:84%
Do you have to eat
strange foods, fatty foods?

00:51:10.601 --> 00:51:12.002 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: No.

00:51:12.002 --> 00:51:14.771 align:middle line:84%
Probably cut back on that statin
if that's what he's got you on.

00:51:14.771 --> 00:51:17.508 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: What if this
person's not on a statin at all.

00:51:17.508 --> 00:51:18.709 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Really?

00:51:18.709 --> 00:51:20.277 align:middle line:84%
And she said what
kind of problem?

00:51:20.277 --> 00:51:21.812 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: It's 120.

00:51:21.812 --> 00:51:22.613 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Oh.

00:51:22.613 --> 00:51:26.550 align:middle line:90%
160 is the ideal.

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:27.851 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yes.

00:51:27.851 --> 00:51:29.219 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: She just
may super a liver problem.

00:51:29.219 --> 00:51:31.755 align:middle line:84%
Because cholesterol is
produced in the liver.

00:51:31.755 --> 00:51:32.589 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: So
they checked that out.

00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:33.423 align:middle line:90%
So all right.

00:51:33.423 --> 00:51:37.427 align:middle line:90%
So, increase your Co Q10 level.

00:51:37.427 --> 00:51:39.296 align:middle line:90%
What else for the heart?

00:51:39.296 --> 00:51:40.464 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Fish oil.

00:51:40.464 --> 00:51:42.299 align:middle line:84%
We talked about it
on the show recently.

00:51:42.299 --> 00:51:43.467 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: A lot
of people are saying,

00:51:43.467 --> 00:51:45.402 align:middle line:84%
"Well maybe fish
oil doesn't work."

00:51:45.402 --> 00:51:46.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
Yes, we heard that.

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:49.139 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: How
about vegetable oil

00:51:49.139 --> 00:51:50.741 align:middle line:90%
that has the same ingredients?

00:51:50.741 --> 00:51:51.975 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: Well,
that's a good thing.

00:51:51.975 --> 00:51:53.043 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Like, flax seed and

00:51:53.043 --> 00:51:54.211 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
Flax seed oil?

00:51:54.211 --> 00:51:55.112 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:51:55.112 --> 00:51:56.079 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
[Inaudible] oil.

00:51:56.079 --> 00:51:57.214 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Yes.

00:51:57.214 --> 00:51:59.383 align:middle line:84%
Particularly flax seed
oil will benefit you.

00:51:59.383 --> 00:52:02.519 align:middle line:84%
But, I'm staying
with the fish oil.

00:52:02.519 --> 00:52:06.523 align:middle line:84%
I've seen too many
studies for depression.

00:52:06.523 --> 00:52:07.257 align:middle line:90%
For heart disease.

00:52:07.257 --> 00:52:08.792 align:middle line:90%
For stroke.

00:52:08.792 --> 00:52:10.093 align:middle line:90%
For anything you can mention.

00:52:10.093 --> 00:52:12.529 align:middle line:84%
There are tens and
hundreds of studies

00:52:12.529 --> 00:52:14.164 align:middle line:90%
that have been done on it.

00:52:14.164 --> 00:52:15.832 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll here
about a new study

00:52:15.832 --> 00:52:18.068 align:middle line:90%
that says to take vitamin E.

00:52:18.068 --> 00:52:19.036 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: L Carnitine.

00:52:19.036 --> 00:52:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: L Carnitine.

00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:21.638 align:middle line:84%
Which I'm glad you
brought that up.

00:52:21.638 --> 00:52:23.340 align:middle line:90%
That's important for the heart.

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:24.474 align:middle line:90%
Good George.

00:52:24.474 --> 00:52:28.879 align:middle line:84%
L Taurine for the heart
and for heart failure.

00:52:28.879 --> 00:52:31.715 align:middle line:90%
L Arginine.

00:52:31.715 --> 00:52:33.016 align:middle line:90%
Nitric oxide.

00:52:33.016 --> 00:52:38.922 align:middle line:84%
The fellow at UCLA won the
noble peace prize for that.

00:52:38.922 --> 00:52:42.793 align:middle line:84%
Almonds is a precursor
of nitric oxide.

00:52:42.793 --> 00:52:47.798 align:middle line:84%
So L Carnitine, L
Taurine, L Arginine,

00:52:47.798 --> 00:52:52.102 align:middle line:84%
Co enzyme Q10, vitamin
E, fish oil.

00:52:52.102 --> 00:52:53.337 align:middle line:90%
Those are

00:52:53.337 --> 00:52:54.471 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Turmeric.

00:52:54.471 --> 00:52:57.474 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
Turmeric for everything.

00:52:57.474 --> 00:52:59.843 align:middle line:84%
That's going to come out
more and more as you see.

00:52:59.843 --> 00:53:00.811 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: So how
many of you are going

00:53:00.811 --> 00:53:03.680 align:middle line:90%
to actually start doing in?

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.449 align:middle line:90%
Taking care of yourself.

00:53:05.449 --> 00:53:06.216 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:53:06.216 --> 00:53:07.618 align:middle line:90%
That's the way to do it.

00:53:07.618 --> 00:53:10.387 align:middle line:84%
Name of the game is to
just prolong your life

00:53:10.387 --> 00:53:12.155 align:middle line:90%
and have some fun.

00:53:12.155 --> 00:53:12.856 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Wow.

00:53:12.856 --> 00:53:14.758 align:middle line:90%
That's all true.

00:53:14.758 --> 00:53:18.328 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: It just changes
your outlook if you're healthy.

00:53:18.328 --> 00:53:19.429 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: No doubt.

00:53:19.429 --> 00:53:20.397 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
there are certain things

00:53:20.397 --> 00:53:22.266 align:middle line:90%
that with he can do about it.

00:53:22.266 --> 00:53:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
A lot of us are lazy.

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:28.672 align:middle line:84%
I'm lazy. But I'm a walking
[inaudible] to the kitchen.

00:53:28.672 --> 00:53:29.973 align:middle line:90%
[Chuckles]

00:53:29.973 --> 00:53:31.275 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Want to do
a little acapella for me?

00:53:31.275 --> 00:53:32.409 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Oh.

00:53:32.409 --> 00:53:33.644 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: See,
Christian is also a very

00:53:33.644 --> 00:53:35.045 align:middle line:90%
accomplished singer.

00:53:35.045 --> 00:53:39.249 align:middle line:84%
A frustrated singer because as
you said you originally started

00:53:39.249 --> 00:53:40.884 align:middle line:90%
in the music business.

00:53:40.884 --> 00:53:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: Then I
became a producer in the 20's.

00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: You do CD's.

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:44.888 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Yes.

00:53:44.888 --> 00:53:45.822 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I
know every Christmas.

00:53:45.822 --> 00:53:47.391 align:middle line:84%
I run one of your
Christmas songs.

00:53:47.391 --> 00:53:48.425 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
That's right.

00:53:48.425 --> 00:53:49.426 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Christian called me.

00:53:49.426 --> 00:53:51.028 align:middle line:90%
We do bumpers on Post its,

00:53:51.028 --> 00:53:53.363 align:middle line:84%
which sometimes it lasts
for a minute or so.

00:53:53.363 --> 00:53:55.899 align:middle line:84%
And he called me up one
day and I told him, I said,

00:53:55.899 --> 00:53:57.935 align:middle line:84%
"I'm going to use one of
your son's as a bumper."

00:53:57.935 --> 00:53:59.536 align:middle line:84%
He called me up and
he said, "Well,

00:53:59.536 --> 00:54:00.937 align:middle line:90%
I'm home listening, buddy.

00:54:00.937 --> 00:54:02.239 align:middle line:90%
You only ran a minute's worth."

00:54:02.239 --> 00:54:03.407 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
Yes [chuckles].

00:54:03.407 --> 00:54:06.243 align:middle line:84%
I recorded a three and
a half minute song.

00:54:06.243 --> 00:54:07.878 align:middle line:90%
It was Oh Holy Night, I think.

00:54:07.878 --> 00:54:09.813 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Why don't you
give me a little Old Danny Boy?

00:54:09.813 --> 00:54:11.048 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Oh.

00:54:11.048 --> 00:54:12.249 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Let's do that.

00:54:12.249 --> 00:54:14.718 align:middle line:84%
And I'll stop you
when I stop you.

00:54:14.718 --> 00:54:17.754 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
Oh Danny boy.

00:54:17.754 --> 00:54:21.992 align:middle line:84%
The pipes, the pipes
are calling.

00:54:21.992 --> 00:54:28.932 align:middle line:84%
From gland to gland and
down the mountain side.

00:54:28.932 --> 00:54:35.172 align:middle line:84%
The summer's gone and all
the flowers are dying.

00:54:35.172 --> 00:54:42.112 align:middle line:84%
It's you it's you must
go and I must fly.

00:54:42.112 --> 00:54:49.720 align:middle line:84%
But coming back when
summer's in the medicine dose.

00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:57.627 align:middle line:84%
Or when the valley's
hushed and white with snow.

00:54:57.627 --> 00:55:06.703 align:middle line:84%
It's I'll be here in
sunshine or in shadow.

00:55:08.004 --> 00:55:16.146 align:middle line:84%
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny
boy, I love you so.

00:55:16.146 --> 00:55:17.347 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: All right.

00:55:17.347 --> 00:55:20.150 align:middle line:90%
[Applause]

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:22.886 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: The one time
I sing in the course of a year

00:55:22.886 --> 00:55:24.654 align:middle line:84%
or two years, everybody
[inaudible]

00:55:24.654 --> 00:55:25.355 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Very good.

00:55:25.355 --> 00:55:26.690 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:28.959 align:middle line:84%
So you get more than just
information on Beyond Belief.

00:55:28.959 --> 00:55:29.793 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Yes.

00:55:29.793 --> 00:55:30.360 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: You really do.

00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:31.361 align:middle line:90%
No, that's good.

00:55:31.361 --> 00:55:32.996 align:middle line:84%
I mean, did you train
with anybody?

00:55:32.996 --> 00:55:33.697 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Oh, yes.

00:55:33.697 --> 00:55:36.066 align:middle line:90%
I was doing musicals.

00:55:36.066 --> 00:55:44.241 align:middle line:84%
I was starring in shows
like Carousel and Oklahoma.

00:55:44.241 --> 00:55:47.844 align:middle line:84%
And then I started my
ego wasn't that great.

00:55:47.844 --> 00:55:51.281 align:middle line:84%
So then I needed that and I
started coaching other singers.

00:55:51.281 --> 00:55:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And I studied with
many of the best.

00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:56.353 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
producing artists.

00:55:56.353 --> 00:55:59.623 align:middle line:90%
And writing for Tom Jones.

00:55:59.623 --> 00:56:01.391 align:middle line:84%
And see, I can't
even adventures.

00:56:01.391 --> 00:56:06.430 align:middle line:84%
A lot of things with
adventures as a musical group.

00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:07.664 align:middle line:90%
[Inaudible]

00:56:07.664 --> 00:56:08.765 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: That
whole business is changing.

00:56:08.765 --> 00:56:09.633 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde: Bill
Cosby with orchestra

00:56:09.633 --> 00:56:11.635 align:middle line:90%
and Andy Griffin with orchestra.

00:56:11.635 --> 00:56:14.371 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well,
you got a great voice.

00:56:14.371 --> 00:56:14.871 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Thank you.

00:56:14.871 --> 00:56:15.672 align:middle line:90%
So do you.

00:56:15.672 --> 00:56:16.873 align:middle line:90%
I've heard him sing.

00:56:16.873 --> 00:56:18.175 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well,
I'm not going to sing now.

00:56:18.175 --> 00:56:19.709 align:middle line:84%
But I would do it
with my full band.

00:56:19.709 --> 00:56:20.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Christian Wilde: Next time.

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:21.078 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Next time.

00:56:21.078 --> 00:56:22.379 align:middle line:90%
You never know.

00:56:22.379 --> 00:56:25.482 align:middle line:84%
But, let's talk a little bit
more about the main book.

00:56:25.482 --> 00:56:27.651 align:middle line:84%
The book that you and I got
introduced to each other.

00:56:27.651 --> 00:56:30.086 align:middle line:84%
Hidden causes of heart
attack and stroke.

00:56:30.086 --> 00:56:32.823 align:middle line:90%
It is so me a bible.

00:56:32.823 --> 00:56:34.324 align:middle line:90%
A reference point.

00:56:34.324 --> 00:56:35.625 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian Wilde:
Thank you George.

00:56:35.625 --> 00:56:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I got to
tell you I still pick it up.

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:39.196 align:middle line:84%
And I look at it and I
go, "Am I doing this?
