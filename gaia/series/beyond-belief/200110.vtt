00:00:24.308 --> 00:00:26.350 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief,"

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.850 align:middle line:10%
and if you're into
astrology, you're

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.170 align:middle line:10%
going to love this program.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.990 align:middle line:10%
Heather Arielle with
us, founder and CEO

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.160 align:middle line:10%
of Arielle's Astrology, where
she offers astrology readings,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.360 align:middle line:10%
counseling, and classes.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And her readings focus on
personal and practical and

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.140 align:middle line:84%
powerful ways that astrology
can improve your life.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.190 align:middle line:90%
Great to see you again.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.790 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HEATHER ARIELLE: Thanks
for having me back.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.810 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful to be here.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Have you been busy?

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: I have.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.140 align:middle line:84%
I created this whole new
Oracle deck and book.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.270 align:middle line:10%
I've been touring
all over the country,

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.033 align:middle line:10%
doing events with
my book and deck.

00:00:57.033 --> 00:00:57.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:58.750 align:middle line:90%
Good for you.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.900 align:middle line:90%
People love astrology.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I remember,
Heather, when I was a kid,

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.170 align:middle line:84%
and I'd read the newspaper,
because in my day,

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.170 align:middle line:90%
we didn't have computers.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Everybody would turn to
the horoscopes first--

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.250 align:middle line:90%
everybody.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that was the
thing in a newspaper,

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.020 align:middle line:84%
and they'd publish it every
day, these different things.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.930 align:middle line:84%
Astrology is based on
astrological signs.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.730 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Right, right.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The planets,
star systems.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.310 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: The Houses, yes.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does that
determine, though, who we are

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.690 align:middle line:90%
or what we are?

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.220 align:middle line:10%
>>ARIELLE: Well, I mean,
it is a belief system,

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.520 align:middle line:10%
but it all starts with
your exact birth time.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.260 align:middle line:10%
And so the belief
in astrology is

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.930 align:middle line:10%
that, if we have your
exact birth time,

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.720 align:middle line:10%
we can create what's
called a natal chart,

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.190 align:middle line:10%
and that is a snapshot
of the cosmos the moment

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.990 align:middle line:10%
you were born.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.920 align:middle line:84%
So where all the planets
are the moment you're born,

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.670 align:middle line:84%
the Houses they're in,
what all that looks

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.800 align:middle line:84%
like, and it really
is the belief

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.230 align:middle line:84%
that then that's going to
reveal qualities about you,

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.370 align:middle line:84%
talents that you're
going to want to develop,

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.050 align:middle line:90%
challenges that you may face.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.230 align:middle line:84%
So it is going to give you
a lot of information on how

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.750 align:middle line:90%
to reach your full potential.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When little
Heather Arielle was a kid,

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.610 align:middle line:84%
did she go, mommy, I'm
going to be an astrologer?

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.480 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: No, no, I--

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.920 align:middle line:90%
it did happen a little early.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.470 align:middle line:84%
I was 14, but a good friend
of mine just gave me a read

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.970 align:middle line:84%
and said, oh, you
should go do this.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:25.590 align:middle line:90%
It's really fun.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.390 align:middle line:90%
I do it.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.340 align:middle line:10%
I had no idea how
transformative it would be,

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.290 align:middle line:10%
but I went to Mary Keswani,
so in Louisville, Kentucky,

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.150 align:middle line:10%
where I'm from.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.580 align:middle line:10%
If you go to a great
astrologer, it's

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.140 align:middle line:10%
not just, oh, tell me
what's going to happen next.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.550 align:middle line:10%
It is transformative.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.620 align:middle line:10%
It is healing.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.240 align:middle line:10%
It really does elevate
your consciousness.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.660 align:middle line:10%
So after I had such a
great reading with her,

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.370 align:middle line:10%
I started studying with her.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.730 align:middle line:10%
She became my mentor, and she
really taught me most of what

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.110 align:middle line:10%
I know with astrology.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you
have Oracle cards.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.990 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes, I do.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let me
see this pack here.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, yes, sure.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's,
what, 52 cards in here?

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: That's
right, 52 cards.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.568 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And these
are Oracle cards here,

00:03:00.568 --> 00:03:03.570 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to be showing
you on screen these cards

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.907 align:middle line:84%
and what they mean,
because each card has

00:03:05.907 --> 00:03:06.990 align:middle line:90%
a different meaning to it.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: That is right,
and that's something

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.720 align:middle line:90%
unique to Oracle cards.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.020 align:middle line:84%
So Oracle cards, they all
use different languages.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.470 align:middle line:84%
So you can get Oracle
cards on animals, chakras.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.920 align:middle line:84%
Mine uses the language
of Western astrology,

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.230 align:middle line:84%
and each card is different
with different messages.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And each image is
also different.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does it differ, the
Oracle cards, from tarot cards,

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.870 align:middle line:84%
where you have
70-some in the deck?

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: That's right,
78 cards in tarot.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, in tarot, there's
always the same 78 cards.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.225 align:middle line:84%
You have the Minor
Arcana, the Major Arcana.

00:03:40.225 --> 00:03:41.850 align:middle line:84%
You're always going
to have an Empress,

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.320 align:middle line:84%
you're always going to
have a Wheel of Fortune,

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.630 align:middle line:84%
but the art is going to
be-- the illustrations

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.590 align:middle line:90%
will be different.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.650 align:middle line:84%
So with the Oracle, not only
are the illustrations different,

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.100 align:middle line:90%
but the language is different.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.830 align:middle line:84%
So the cards you're
going to find,

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.580 align:middle line:84%
since I'm using
astrology, you're going

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.650 align:middle line:90%
to find Sagittarius in my deck.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.360 align:middle line:84%
You're going to find astrology
themed ideas in my deck,

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.200 align:middle line:84%
whereas in an animal one,
you'd find a lion card.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.595 align:middle line:84%
So each Oracle deck
is unique in that way.

00:04:05.595 --> 00:04:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when the
person picks the card,

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.760 align:middle line:84%
or you pick the card for
them, does that determine

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.200 align:middle line:90%
their outcome of their life?

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.118 align:middle line:84%
Or how many do you have to
pick for an individual one.

00:04:16.118 --> 00:04:17.118 align:middle line:90%
Oh, here are your cards.

00:04:17.118 --> 00:04:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: You can get
so much-- oh, sure.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.450 align:middle line:84%
You can get so much out of a
reading from just one card,

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.050 align:middle line:84%
so if you're a beginner,
I say start simply.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.350 align:middle line:84%
Pick one card, and you
can say a simple request,

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.310 align:middle line:84%
like inspire and prepare me
for today, or for the week,

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.270 align:middle line:90%
or for the month.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.530 align:middle line:90%
You take that card.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.470 align:middle line:84%
You take it, and you
read the message.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.480 align:middle line:84%
You take in the image, and then
you look it up in my guidebook,

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.960 align:middle line:84%
where I have two to four
pages written on each card,

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.720 align:middle line:84%
and there are
additional messages.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.180 align:middle line:90%
They're also detailed messages.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I see.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: And then I
work with my clients

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.510 align:middle line:84%
to develop their
intuition, so then they

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.280 align:middle line:90%
know which message is for them.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it's
all of the above.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.663 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, that card--

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:58.115 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I believe that.

00:04:58.115 --> 00:05:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Yeah, really
take in that card's energy.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.855 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the tarot cards, you
have some scary cards in there.

00:05:03.855 --> 00:05:04.880 align:middle line:90%
You've got the Devil.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.040 align:middle line:90%
You've got Death.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yeah.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have the
same kind of things in yours?

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:09.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Well--

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yours seem
more enlightening.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, yes,
well, I think--

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm very playful.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm a very playful,
creative person,

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.670 align:middle line:84%
so I always have a lot of joy
and bliss in anything I do.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.380 align:middle line:84%
There are some cards, like
Uranus, Pluto, Charon.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And, well, Uranus is
the Great Awakener,

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.150 align:middle line:84%
and so that scares
people because it's

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.920 align:middle line:90%
expect the unexpected.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.520 align:middle line:84%
Any loss or elimination
will lead to liberation,

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.080 align:middle line:90%
and people are like, what.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.570 align:middle line:90%
And so recently, I had a woman--

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.090 align:middle line:84%
the last card in her
reading was Uranus,

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.400 align:middle line:90%
and it was very unsettling.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And so I said,
two things you can

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.020 align:middle line:84%
do when you get a card that
you consider to be scary.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.730 align:middle line:84%
One, clarify it, because it
may not be, and in her case,

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter was the clarification,
which is abundance.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And it ended up, there
was an offer to relocate,

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.550 align:middle line:84%
so it was positive
in her situation.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.460 align:middle line:84%
But even when you do
get a card that is maybe

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.510 align:middle line:90%
not the cards you wanted--

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.930 align:middle line:84%
well, I believe we
choose our chart.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And so if we choose
our chart, and if we're

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.780 align:middle line:84%
connecting to our guides
to receive messages,

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.090 align:middle line:84%
we're getting the messages
that are going to help

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.780 align:middle line:90%
us reach our full potential.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.430 align:middle line:84%
So any message that we
get is a good message

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.030 align:middle line:84%
because it's going to help us
transform, and that's the goal.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And are they things
that will be or could be?

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:30.170 align:middle line:90%
When you pull a card--

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Yes, yes, it all
depends on how you ask it.

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:34.700 align:middle line:90%
I like to really--

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.380 align:middle line:84%
I encourage my clients not to
always ask yes or no questions.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Instead say, well, what are
some energies, if I incorporate,

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.660 align:middle line:90%
will bring me more joy?

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.060 align:middle line:84%
Then if you pick
that card, you're

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.730 align:middle line:84%
going to then want to
incorporate those energies,

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.760 align:middle line:84%
and then you're going to
be a more fulfilled person.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So we've got
some on the screen

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.900 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to look
at called Sun signs.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.610 align:middle line:90%
What are Sun signs?

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: So the Sun sign--

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.500 align:middle line:84%
if your sun is in
Gemini, my sun is

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.840 align:middle line:84%
in Gemini, that means
when we were born,

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.210 align:middle line:84%
the sun was in the
zodiac sign of Gemini.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.220 align:middle line:90%
There are 12 zodiac signs.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.430 align:middle line:84%
Every zodiac sign
has about 30 degrees,

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:19.040 align:middle line:84%
so for 30 days about, the
sun is in a certain sign,

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.590 align:middle line:84%
and it does give a
lot of information.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.030 align:middle line:90%
It illuminates.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.050 align:middle line:90%
It illuminates us.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.230 align:middle line:90%
The sun is vital.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:26.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a vital part of us.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.850 align:middle line:84%
Even though there's
been too much

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.890 align:middle line:84%
emphasis on sun science
with the horoscopes

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:32.900 align:middle line:84%
that you mentioned
earlier, but it still

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.492 align:middle line:84%
is very important for
us to really feel alive.

00:07:35.492 --> 00:07:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With what we've
got on the screen right now,

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.590 align:middle line:90%
what are these, Heather?

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: So the these are--

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:44.953 align:middle line:84%
the whole Western zodiac
starts with Aries.

00:07:44.953 --> 00:07:46.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And these
are four cards?

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Yes, these
are the first four signs,

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.280 align:middle line:84%
and I like to talk in terms
of, are we in or out of balance

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.810 align:middle line:90%
with our energy?

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Because there is nuance
and duality in astrology.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.100 align:middle line:84%
So for Aries, if
you have Aries Sun,

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.110 align:middle line:90%
then that's pioneering air--

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:04.820 align:middle line:90%
that's pioneering energy.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.660 align:middle line:84%
If you want to be in balance
with that energy, be a warrior.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:09.710 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead and be first.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:12.560 align:middle line:90%
Pursue your pioneering ideas.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.970 align:middle line:90%
Aries is also very fast.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:15.530 align:middle line:90%
Things happen quickly.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, when an Aries
gets out of balance,

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.820 align:middle line:84%
that's when they can
become impatient.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.640 align:middle line:84%
They want things to
happen right now,

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.890 align:middle line:84%
and so I always say
patience is a virtue.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.495 align:middle line:84%
Follow through with
your pioneering plan.

00:08:27.495 --> 00:08:28.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Now, Taurus
is the second sign.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.489 align:middle line:90%
Taurus is very earthy.

00:08:32.489 --> 00:08:33.289 align:middle line:90%
It's grounded.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:34.120 align:middle line:90%
It has tenacity--

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.145 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kind of
bull-headed, right?

00:08:35.145 --> 00:08:36.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes, yes.

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:40.130 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: My daughter's a Taurus,
and she is a little toughie.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.350 align:middle line:10%
>>ARIELLE: Well, if you're
in bounds with Taurus,

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:43.970 align:middle line:10%
you have wonderful perseverance.

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:46.820 align:middle line:10%
You can get to the
finish line, and they're

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:51.770 align:middle line:10%
very great manipulators
of the material world.

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:53.730 align:middle line:10%
So that's very, very powerful.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:57.920 align:middle line:10%
Now, if a Taurus gets out of
balance, then that tenacity--

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:02.180 align:middle line:10%
they're going to a finish line
that may not be worth crossing.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And they don't quite--
they get stubborn,

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:06.350 align:middle line:84%
and they don't do a
course correction.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:09.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's the same quality
that can be wonderful,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.443 align:middle line:84%
but that can also be
a little challenging.

00:09:11.443 --> 00:09:13.485 align:middle line:84%
So that's why you want to
be aware of everything.

00:09:13.485 --> 00:09:13.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:14.300 align:middle line:90%
Next one?

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Now, Gemini--

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:16.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here he is.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.240 align:middle line:90%
Hey, the twins.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: We're both Geminis.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Gemini, the twins, it's
a playful, curious sign.

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:23.780 align:middle line:84%
It's all about
communication, so ideas

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.940 align:middle line:90%
are very important to Geminis.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the
most adaptable sign.

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:30.710 align:middle line:90%
They can bend like willows.

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:34.010 align:middle line:84%
They can be chameleons, and
they can just adapt instantly.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.950 align:middle line:84%
So when a Gemini gets out
of balance, all of a sudden,

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:38.610 align:middle line:90%
they overthink things.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:42.500 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, the Gemini has to
be reminded to make a decision

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.820 align:middle line:90%
or stick the landing.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.190 align:middle line:84%
So in gymnastics, it's
stick the landing.

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:49.185 align:middle line:84%
Just make a decision, and
don't overthink everything.

00:09:49.185 --> 00:09:50.810 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Interesting,
and our last car?

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:51.770 align:middle line:10%
>>ARIELLE: Cancer.

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.570 align:middle line:10%
It's such nurturing energy.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:55.310 align:middle line:10%
It's very sensitive
and nurturing.

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:56.660 align:middle line:10%
It's very loving.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.870 align:middle line:10%
So I like the
watercolor, and I should

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.147 align:middle line:10%
say Tom Cummins
is the artist who

00:10:02.147 --> 00:10:03.355 align:middle line:10%
did all of these watercolors.

00:10:03.355 --> 00:10:04.250 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: He's done a
great job with these.

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.570 align:middle line:10%
>>ARIELLE: Yes, and I think
it's a beautiful watercolor

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:07.370 align:middle line:10%
for Cancer.

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.050 align:middle line:10%
It says everything
in the image--

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:10.790 align:middle line:10%
a mother holding a child.

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:11.720 align:middle line:10%
It's nurturing.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.490 align:middle line:10%
When Cancers are
in balance, they

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.410 align:middle line:10%
nurture themselves
as well as others.

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:17.420 align:middle line:10%
When Cancers get
out of balance, they

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.640 align:middle line:10%
get moody because
all of their energy

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.387 align:middle line:10%
is on taking care
of other people.

00:10:21.387 --> 00:10:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:23.900 align:middle line:84%
So since you've been
doing this-- which

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.105 align:middle line:90%
has been how many years now?

00:10:25.105 --> 00:10:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Well, it's
been a long time.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:27.650 align:middle line:90%
It's been decades.

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you gotten
better and better at it?

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, my gosh,
every single reading I do,

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:37.070 align:middle line:84%
I get better because there's
such nuance and duality

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.005 align:middle line:90%
in astrology that--

00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:41.910 align:middle line:90%
and it's so complicated.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And a part of it is
intuitive, especially

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.250 align:middle line:84%
when I'm incorporating
my Oracle cards.

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:48.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's just, you
need to practice.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is a natal chart?

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:52.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: So a natal chart--

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.630 align:middle line:90%
that is the snapshot.

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:58.550 align:middle line:84%
So if I have your birthday,
month, year, location--

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:01.010 align:middle line:84%
even with that, I can
create a solar chart.

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:03.200 align:middle line:84%
But if I have your
exact time, then I

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.530 align:middle line:84%
can create a
complete natal chart,

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:07.660 align:middle line:84%
and that's going to--
that is the foundation.

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.120 align:middle line:84%
That energy is with
you every single day

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.680 align:middle line:90%
for your entire life.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.570 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Now this natal chart
we're looking at right now--

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:15.820 align:middle line:10%
>>ARIELLE: OK, this is-- yeah.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:16.240 align:middle line:10%
This is--

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.720 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: This is
somebody we know.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.320 align:middle line:10%
>>ARIELLE: This is
somebody we know.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.215 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How'd you
get my information?

00:11:21.215 --> 00:11:23.740 align:middle line:10%
How do these people
know this stuff?

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.800 align:middle line:10%
>>ARIELLE: So this
is your natal chart,

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.130 align:middle line:10%
and a couple of ways that--

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:29.470 align:middle line:10%
I like to look at a big picture.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:32.650 align:middle line:10%
So when I look at this
chart, sometimes I

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.740 align:middle line:10%
would just start by
saying, your zodiac signs

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.090 align:middle line:10%
that we're going to talk about--

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:39.880 align:middle line:10%
Taurus, Gemini, Aquarius, Leo.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.860 align:middle line:10%
Those are your main
signs, and then I

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.775 align:middle line:10%
would look at elements
and modalities.

00:11:44.775 --> 00:11:46.150 align:middle line:10%
So when I look at
your chart, you

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:50.650 align:middle line:10%
have a lot of earth, Taurus,
with you have Mercury, Venus,

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:52.150 align:middle line:10%
Mid Heaven, and Taurus.

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:53.675 align:middle line:10%
So what we talked
about with Taurus,

00:11:53.675 --> 00:11:56.050 align:middle line:10%
you've got all the tenacity,
and your daughter, you said,

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:56.650 align:middle line:10%
is a Taurus.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:57.080 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: She's one, yeah.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.110 align:middle line:10%
>>ARIELLE: You see that
often, where children,

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.240 align:middle line:10%
their charts are
going to echo strongly

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.890 align:middle line:10%
the charts of their parents.

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:04.600 align:middle line:10%
So you've got all
that perseverance.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.800 align:middle line:10%
Taurus rules the voice.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.320 align:middle line:10%
You have an amazing voice,
singing and not singing.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.890 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Thank you very much.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:12.970 align:middle line:10%
>>ARIELLE: And then
the earth, grounded,

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.910 align:middle line:10%
being able to
manifest in real ways.

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:19.450 align:middle line:10%
Now, when we add in your
Gemini sun and Aquarian moon,

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.490 align:middle line:10%
those are air signs,
and that's going

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:23.420 align:middle line:10%
to add something a
little bit different.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.420 align:middle line:90%
So you have great ideas.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.760 align:middle line:84%
You have great communication
with the Gemini.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.950 align:middle line:90%
Aquarius is unique energy.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:33.490 align:middle line:84%
It's the energy to reform, so
that means your ideas are also

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.110 align:middle line:90%
alternative and unique.

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:39.070 align:middle line:84%
When you combine the air with
the earth, all of a sudden,

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:42.730 align:middle line:84%
you're able to manifest, in
tangible, practical ways,

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:45.790 align:middle line:90%
your alternative unique ideas.

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you didn't know
me, and you looked merely

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:51.670 align:middle line:84%
at the chart before you
met me, would you still

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.380 align:middle line:84%
have a pretty good
idea of who I was?

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: I would have a very
good idea of your potential.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.950 align:middle line:84%
I would have a very good idea
of the opportunities that would

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.720 align:middle line:90%
be open to you, the talents.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, you never know,
until you meet somebody,

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:06.490 align:middle line:84%
if they're-- because sometimes
people overcompensate,

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:09.302 align:middle line:84%
and they overidentify
with certain energy.

00:13:09.302 --> 00:13:11.260 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's great to
get your reading done,

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.940 align:middle line:90%
because then you can say, oh.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.680 align:middle line:84%
I have clients say,
oh, I didn't even

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.910 align:middle line:84%
know I had that because
they were so focused.

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:20.140 align:middle line:84%
So becoming aware
of your energy is

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.880 align:middle line:84%
really significant to
reaching your full potential.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.060 align:middle line:84%
That's why everything
I do, every tool

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:28.360 align:middle line:84%
I use with my clients, is
to help them be present

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.240 align:middle line:90%
with their energy.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now, what is a collage?

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Well,
it's something I use.

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:34.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm an astrological
counselor, so I

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:37.540 align:middle line:90%
see clients on a regular basis.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.430 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
tools I use to help

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:42.550 align:middle line:84%
them reach their-- to help them
really reach transformation.

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:46.210 align:middle line:84%
I use my Oracle deck,
and I assemble them

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:49.420 align:middle line:84%
into a beautiful art collage
with meaningful messages.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Often, it's from an intuitive
reading I've had with them.

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.460 align:middle line:84%
It's at the end of, first,
I do their astrology,

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.520 align:middle line:84%
then I do that, and I send
them away with a collage.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And I found it very helpful,
because even though astrology--

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you put
the collage together?

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Yes, I put
the collage together

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.730 align:middle line:84%
based on the intuitive
messages that their guides

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:08.680 align:middle line:90%
are giving them through me.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.500 align:middle line:84%
So then they can go home,
and in between sessions,

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.350 align:middle line:84%
they can look at that
collage, and it will trigger

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:16.980 align:middle line:90%
everything we spoke about.

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.730 align:middle line:84%
It will have the
essence, because I really

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.183 align:middle line:84%
capture the essence of
each card's meaning.

00:14:21.183 --> 00:14:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting
take on that.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.360 align:middle line:84%
How many cards, of
the 52 in the deck,

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.180 align:middle line:84%
do you use for any
particular person?

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: I use all 52.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:30.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do?

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:31.773 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Yes, and
there are actually

00:14:31.773 --> 00:14:35.930 align:middle line:84%
104 messages because I
use messages on each side.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:38.860 align:middle line:84%
I use the reverse card design,
which is a little unusual.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.202 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what
are the 12 Houses?

00:14:41.202 --> 00:14:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: The Houses
are very important.

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:46.030 align:middle line:84%
When you look at a chart,
you see these little boxes.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:49.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, each box is an
area of experience.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.780 align:middle line:90%
So we have a box--

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:53.680 align:middle line:84%
we have a House for health,
a House for marriage,

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.750 align:middle line:84%
a House for career,
a House for friends,

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:57.310 align:middle line:90%
a House for earned income.

00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Each House
different for something.

00:14:58.410 --> 00:14:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Yeah,
and you really want

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.120 align:middle line:84%
to know what's going
on in that House,

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.510 align:middle line:84%
so you can activate
its full energy.

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What determines
what the Houses are?

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Now, that is--

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
we looking at here?

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Well, that is
actually the first step

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.510 align:middle line:90%
in making a visual collage.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.190 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that I came up with.

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:18.130 align:middle line:90%
We saw your natal chart.

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:20.590 align:middle line:84%
That is what a chart looks
like, and it's very confusing

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:24.490 align:middle line:84%
to a lot of my clients,
so I created my deck

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:27.220 align:middle line:84%
to create a visual
representation

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.630 align:middle line:90%
of that natal chart.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:31.180 align:middle line:84%
So the first step is
you take out my 12

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.438 align:middle line:90%
cards that are the House cards.

00:15:33.438 --> 00:15:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you do that?

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.102 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Mm-hmm, and then
you put them in a circle.

00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:38.560 align:middle line:84%
So then all of a
sudden, you're not

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.540 align:middle line:84%
looking at a blank
box saying, what

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.790 align:middle line:84%
did Heather Arielle
tell me that meant?

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:44.350 align:middle line:90%
You're saying, oh, second House.

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:46.930 align:middle line:84%
It says earned income
right on the House,

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:48.310 align:middle line:90%
and also the image reveals.

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:52.240 align:middle line:84%
So it allows for immediate
comprehension of your chart,

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.590 align:middle line:90%
and it's also beautiful.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:57.250 align:middle line:84%
So that is the first step I
would do with people to create

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:58.870 align:middle line:90%
that visual representation.

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And does that give
them a pretty good understanding

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:05.220 align:middle line:84%
of what direction they
should take with their life?

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:07.150 align:middle line:84%
What's the basis
of the astrology?

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Yes, the
basis of the astrology

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.340 align:middle line:84%
is that when you're
present with your energy,

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:14.390 align:middle line:84%
you're able to use those
skills, and you're also

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.550 align:middle line:90%
able to understand.

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:18.440 align:middle line:84%
If there's going to
be something that

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.300 align:middle line:84%
may be a little
challenging, it's always

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:21.750 align:middle line:90%
good to have the awareness.

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:24.720 align:middle line:84%
So you go, and it's just like if
you know a hurricane is coming,

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.220 align:middle line:84%
it's better to know it's coming
and prepare than to say, oh,

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.610 align:middle line:90%
my gosh, there's a hurricane.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:30.620 align:middle line:90%
So you always want to know.

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:34.130 align:middle line:84%
You want to be as prepared
as possible and present.

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, the planetary
alignments sometimes that

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:40.730 align:middle line:84%
occur, and the
retrogrades that pop up--

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:42.940 align:middle line:90%
how important is all that?

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Retrogrades
are really important.

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:47.340 align:middle line:84%
We have several Mercury
retrogrades a year.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.140 align:middle line:90%
I also--

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.223 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're in one now.

00:16:49.223 --> 00:16:50.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes, yes, we are.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:54.260 align:middle line:90%
We talk about Venus and Mars.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Those are the three personal
planets that go retrograde.

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:01.760 align:middle line:84%
When we're in retrogrades,
I like to use the RE rule.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:05.010 align:middle line:84%
I say, if you can RE
it, you can do it.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:07.160 align:middle line:84%
So think about words
that begin with RE.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a time to rejuvenate,
return to something you know,

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.250 align:middle line:90%
research, reignite.

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:14.720 align:middle line:90%
You want to use--

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.520 align:middle line:90%
it's a reflective time.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.871 align:middle line:84%
If you can make time
to do that, you're

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:20.829 align:middle line:84%
really going to get more
out of the retrograde.

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:21.920 align:middle line:90%
It's personal.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:22.910 align:middle line:90%
Go in.

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:24.910 align:middle line:84%
Do extra meditation
during retrogrades.

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:27.319 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'll come back
to more retrograde stories.

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:30.290 align:middle line:10%
Now, this, of course, is your
personal planets collage.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:31.200 align:middle line:10%
>>ARIELLE: Yes, yes.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:31.880 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Explain that.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:32.820 align:middle line:10%
>>ARIELLE: This is
really important.

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:34.612 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we have outer
planets, but I always

00:17:34.612 --> 00:17:37.460 align:middle line:10%
tell people, really look
at your personal planets.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:41.450 align:middle line:10%
Really get to know them, because
they reveal so much about you.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:42.660 align:middle line:10%
The sun is the light.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.540 align:middle line:10%
The moon, going to
be your emotions.

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.720 align:middle line:10%
Mercury, your communication,
how you think.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.200 align:middle line:10%
Venus is how you relate, how
you give and receive love.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:55.250 align:middle line:10%
Mars is our energy, our
ability to take action.

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:58.040 align:middle line:10%
And then the ascendant is really
our physical body and energy

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.020 align:middle line:10%
we give off when we
first meet people.

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:01.970 align:middle line:10%
So it reveals much about us.

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:05.200 align:middle line:10%
That is one thing that
we do in the collage,

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.990 align:middle line:10%
is I help people find where
their personal planets go.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:11.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They've always said
that Mars is a warring planet.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: It's
the-- yeah-- warrior.

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:13.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why do they say that?

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: It's energy
because it's all about

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.910 align:middle line:84%
whether we can
take action or not.

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:21.080 align:middle line:84%
So if you have Mars
in Libra, it may be

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.640 align:middle line:90%
harder for you to take action.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.720 align:middle line:90%
Mars in Aries?

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.460 align:middle line:90%
It is full steam ahead.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.910 align:middle line:84%
So Mars can tell us whether
you're passive, assertive,

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:31.100 align:middle line:90%
aggressive, or being a bully.

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Not only what sign it's in,
but what aspects it's making,

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:35.300 align:middle line:90%
what house it's in.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.400 align:middle line:84%
So and it also then rules
our physical health.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.330 align:middle line:84%
How quickly will we
recover from something?

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:40.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:43.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't like to equate
success with merely money,

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:46.670 align:middle line:84%
but if you were to look at
the charts of Jeff Bezos

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:50.840 align:middle line:84%
from Amazon, Bill Gates
from Microsoft, Elon Musk--

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.560 align:middle line:84%
PayPal and his rocketry, would
they all have similar traits?

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Because they all seem to
be very successful people.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: I would have
to look at those charts.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.470 align:middle line:84%
But I have looked at the charts
of many successful people,

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:06.440 align:middle line:90%
and you do see certain things.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you see
stallions, which

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:12.110 align:middle line:84%
is when they have three to
five planets in one sign,

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:15.080 align:middle line:84%
and it creates this
intense kind of energy.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:19.160 align:middle line:84%
It builds, and it also
can create Aries energy,

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.130 align:middle line:84%
and areas is that
pioneering energy.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think Jeff Bezos does
have some Aries energy, which

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:26.390 align:middle line:90%
would make him a pioneer.

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:29.210 align:middle line:84%
So you do tend to
see some pioneer

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.870 align:middle line:84%
energy, some visionary
energy, some very

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:34.247 align:middle line:90%
strong concentrated energy.

00:19:34.247 --> 00:19:36.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you'll see
similarities there--

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:36.820 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, yes, you will.

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --between,
let's say, the three.

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:38.290 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes.

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:39.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:42.020 align:middle line:84%
I haven't looked at those
three, but normally,

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:44.120 align:middle line:84%
when I do see very
driven people,

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.360 align:middle line:84%
or depending on what
type of the success is,

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.340 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see
certain things, yes.

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you did the
chart of someone who was not

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:57.710 align:middle line:84%
a good person, and for
lack of better words,

00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:59.780 align:middle line:84%
let's say you did
the chart of Hitler.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.010 align:middle line:90%
Would that show up?

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:02.621 align:middle line:84%
Would you see this
meanness in there.

00:20:02.621 --> 00:20:03.454 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Well, OK.

00:20:03.454 --> 00:20:07.210 align:middle line:90%
This is a very good question.

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:10.430 align:middle line:84%
So Oprah Winfrey
and Richard Nixon--

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:13.190 align:middle line:84%
they share a very
similar aspect.

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:14.357 align:middle line:90%
Mercury opposes their Pluto.

00:20:14.357 --> 00:20:15.773 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And two
different people.

00:20:15.773 --> 00:20:17.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Two completely
different people.

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:20.540 align:middle line:84%
This is why I stress
the nuance and duality.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:23.000 align:middle line:84%
This is why I talk about,
are we in or out of balance?

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.210 align:middle line:84%
If you are in balance
with your energy,

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:28.070 align:middle line:90%
all energy is beautiful.

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:29.750 align:middle line:84%
When you are out
of balance, that's

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:30.853 align:middle line:90%
when we get into trouble.

00:20:30.853 --> 00:20:33.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you start to look
at Goring, and Goebbels,

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:38.660 align:middle line:84%
and some scary people, Capricorn
and Scorpio out of balance

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:41.837 align:middle line:84%
can be really, really scary,
but it's out of balance.

00:20:41.837 --> 00:20:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But would you
know that in advance?

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:46.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: You could
see and say, oh, boy.

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:49.880 align:middle line:84%
A lot of Scorpio, there is a
temptation to abuse your power.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Capricorn, you
become authoritarian.

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:56.480 align:middle line:84%
It just means if these
people get out of balance,

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.130 align:middle line:90%
and there are afflictions.

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:01.280 align:middle line:84%
If you have that opposition,
you have to work harder

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.675 align:middle line:90%
to be in balance.

00:21:02.675 --> 00:21:03.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:05.490 align:middle line:90%
Now, what is the sun in a chart?

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:06.732 align:middle line:90%
And why is that important?

00:21:06.732 --> 00:21:07.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: So the sun--

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:10.860 align:middle line:84%
if we don't feel
connected to our sun,

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.050 align:middle line:84%
we don't ever feel
completely alive.

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:16.410 align:middle line:84%
So I always start with the
sun sign with my clients.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:19.950 align:middle line:10%
I say, OK, so if we're
going to build a collage,

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:21.762 align:middle line:10%
let's take the sun.

00:21:21.762 --> 00:21:22.970 align:middle line:10%
OK, so your sun is in Gemini.

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:23.760 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, here we go.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:24.180 align:middle line:10%
>>ARIELLE: Yeah.

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:24.470 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right?

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.930 align:middle line:10%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, there it is.

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:25.730 align:middle line:10%
Perfect.

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:29.760 align:middle line:10%
I would pull the Gemini card and
you have a very prominent sun.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.290 align:middle line:10%
It's in your 10th house.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:34.020 align:middle line:10%
You need to know, in
what house is that sun?

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:36.990 align:middle line:10%
Because for you to feel
completely illuminated,

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:40.020 align:middle line:10%
you need to make the most
of 10th house energies.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:40.950 align:middle line:10%
That is public.

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:42.930 align:middle line:10%
That is having a public persona.

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:44.340 align:middle line:10%
That is career.

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And you obviously are
incredibly public person,

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.450 align:middle line:90%
so you are in alignment.

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:50.140 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:52.560 align:middle line:84%
You're in alignment
with your Gemini sun,

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:56.340 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to want to
use those wonderful Gemini

00:21:56.340 --> 00:22:00.150 align:middle line:84%
communicative qualities in
your career, which you do.

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:02.310 align:middle line:90%
You use your words all the time.

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And then you want to incorporate
the air and the mutability,

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:07.440 align:middle line:84%
the ideas, and
being able to adapt.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And you're really one of
the most adaptable people.

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:13.110 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to interview
somebody, my goodness,

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:16.360 align:middle line:84%
that's the essence of being
adaptable and being quick.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you can tell all
that with these Oracle cards?

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, absolutely.

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:20.170 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, would you say that I'm a
complete person after you've

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:26.820 align:middle line:90%
looked at all these?

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:27.910 align:middle line:90%
Here's the ascendant Leo.

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:28.710 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, this is one
of my most favorite parts

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:32.800 align:middle line:90%
when I do workshops.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.100 align:middle line:84%
So the ascendant-- it's also
called your rising sign.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.490 align:middle line:90%
So your rising sign is Leo.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And then your ascendant
is around 22 degrees Leo.

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:44.040 align:middle line:84%
That's the degree to
which it's rising.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:47.070 align:middle line:84%
That is the energy you give
off when you first meet people.

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:51.450 align:middle line:84%
So Tompkins likes to say,
it's like your front door.

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:54.075 align:middle line:84%
Most people are not
so aware of that.

00:22:54.075 --> 00:22:55.950 align:middle line:84%
They know that they're
having those energies,

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:57.750 align:middle line:90%
but they lead with the sun.

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:00.090 align:middle line:84%
So what I like to do
with people is to say,

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:03.720 align:middle line:84%
get to know the qualities
of your ascendant,

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.490 align:middle line:84%
because if you use
those, you will

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:07.620 align:middle line:90%
appear to be more authentic.

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:10.770 align:middle line:84%
You will make a better
first impression.

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:12.030 align:middle line:90%
So you're Leo.

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:12.990 align:middle line:90%
Leo is a star.

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:14.850 align:middle line:90%
Leo is enthusiastic.

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:17.970 align:middle line:90%
It's leadership.

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:19.230 align:middle line:90%
It's creative.

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:20.650 align:middle line:90%
It's very dynamic.

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:22.080 align:middle line:90%
It's inspirational.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And so you lead with
those qualities,

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:26.130 align:middle line:84%
you're going to win
people over instantly,

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:29.260 align:middle line:84%
and then you can share all
your wonderful Gemini ideas

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.060 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And so it's something to know
the qualities of your ascendant

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.988 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
first impression.

00:23:34.988 --> 00:23:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And if you try to hide them--
it's not that people are hiding

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:40.440 align:middle line:84%
them, it's that they're
not so aware of them--

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.040 align:middle line:84%
then you can come off
as not as authentic.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.705 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And this
last picture seems

00:23:44.705 --> 00:23:46.648 align:middle line:10%
to be everything I've done here.

00:23:46.648 --> 00:23:48.190 align:middle line:10%
>>ARIELLE: [LAUGHS]
Yeah, here we go.

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:49.290 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Is that the
finished version of me?

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:50.090 align:middle line:10%
>>ARIELLE: OK.

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:51.900 align:middle line:10%
This is the finished
version of what I

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:55.170 align:middle line:10%
would do in the first workshop.

00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:56.520 align:middle line:90%
And it has a lot.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:01.110 align:middle line:84%
We see your Mars and Virgo
in the third house, the earth

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:02.500 align:middle line:90%
that's connected to that.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:06.120 align:middle line:90%
We see your Aquarius moon.

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we see a lot
going on in that,

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:10.560 align:middle line:90%
a lot of personal planets.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.140 align:middle line:84%
We can go further, but that
would be in the advanced.

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:15.540 align:middle line:84%
This is a lot for somebody
to go home with to study.

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:18.452 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what would
you say overall about me

00:24:18.452 --> 00:24:20.160 align:middle line:84%
based on everything
we've just looked at?

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.535 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Based
on everything, I

00:24:21.535 --> 00:24:24.660 align:middle line:84%
would say that you are a
tremendous communicator.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:28.170 align:middle line:84%
You have wonderful ideas
that are also unique.

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And you have all of
the tenacious energy

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.770 align:middle line:90%
to manifest them.

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And that for you
to feel fulfilled,

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.520 align:middle line:84%
you really do need
to be in the public,

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:38.340 align:middle line:84%
because not only do you have
the 10th house energies,

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:39.330 align:middle line:90%
but you're Leo.

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:41.355 align:middle line:84%
Leos are supposed to
be in front of people.

00:24:41.355 --> 00:24:42.480 align:middle line:90%
It's about self-expression.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.438 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They enjoy it.

00:24:43.438 --> 00:24:45.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.860 align:middle line:84%
They're great at it and
they inspire people.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.700 align:middle line:10%
So you really are supposed
to be forwarding your ideas

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:55.805 align:middle line:10%
through your voice and through
your ideas in front of people.

00:24:55.805 --> 00:24:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I do
a lot of live events

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:58.630 align:middle line:90%
that are around the country.

00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.754 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes.

00:24:58.754 --> 00:24:59.554 align:middle line:90%
It's perfect.

00:24:59.554 --> 00:25:00.510 align:middle line:90%
Leo rising?

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:01.310 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh.

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm on sold out
theaters wherever I am.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.050 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: I am surprised.

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:05.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:05.190 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And before the show
starts, my producer, Tom

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:11.070 align:middle line:84%
Danhizer, and I will kind
of peek through the curtain

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:12.840 align:middle line:90%
to make sure everybody's in.

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And if I see one
empty chair, maybe

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:17.350 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the
theater, I freak out.

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:18.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Oh.

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:18.415 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:25:18.415 --> 00:25:19.832 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I say,
Tom, I'm not going

00:25:19.832 --> 00:25:21.510 align:middle line:90%
until that seat is filled.

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:24.030 align:middle line:84%
So he may run around
and find somebody,

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:25.610 align:middle line:84%
and say, you got
to sit down there.

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:26.700 align:middle line:90%
He's not coming out.

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:27.540 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:28.645 align:middle line:90%
Why do I act that way?

00:25:28.645 --> 00:25:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Well, OK.

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Your Mars is in Virgo, and
Virgo is very specific energy.

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:37.830 align:middle line:84%
So your energy is you're
going to notice details.

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:40.270 align:middle line:90%
Virgo notices the details.

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:42.745 align:middle line:84%
And so your energy
is being used,

00:25:42.745 --> 00:25:44.620 align:middle line:84%
you're always going to
notice little details.

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.320 align:middle line:84%
So I always say,
take a step back.

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.750 align:middle line:90%
See the big picture, George.

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:50.610 align:middle line:84%
You've got almost a
complete audience.

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:52.980 align:middle line:84%
One person-- maybe that
person's in the bathroom.

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:53.940 align:middle line:90%
See the big picture.

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Get them out now.

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:56.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: [LAUGHS]

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, divination
through your cards,

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:01.050 align:middle line:90%
the fundamentals of astrology.

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:02.548 align:middle line:84%
What is divination,
first of all?

00:26:02.548 --> 00:26:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: So that is really a
way to connect to your guides.

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:09.450 align:middle line:84%
It's saying, how can
I connect to my guides

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:11.850 align:middle line:84%
to receive messages
that will help

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:13.580 align:middle line:90%
me reach my full potential?

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's then using-- there
are many divination tools.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:19.170 align:middle line:84%
I use my Oracle deck now, but
I've used other Oracle decks,

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:21.450 align:middle line:90%
as well, as a tool to do that.

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Radleigh Valentine,
who is a expert, intuitive,

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:27.660 align:middle line:84%
and teacher of Tarot,
talked about divination

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:28.870 align:middle line:90%
on Gaia's "Open Minds."

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:30.033 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: OK.

00:26:30.033 --> 00:26:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: OK.

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:34.097 align:middle line:10%
So we're going to get into
the notion of interpretation

00:26:34.097 --> 00:26:35.180 align:middle line:10%
when you're reading cards.

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:35.510 align:middle line:10%
>>RADLEIGH VALENTINE: Sure, yes.

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:37.380 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: Some people
have intuitive abilities,

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.360 align:middle line:10%
some don't, and they're
just left with the words

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.693 align:middle line:10%
and they're left with the image.

00:26:40.693 --> 00:26:43.350 align:middle line:10%
So let's talk about
that for a moment.

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:45.890 align:middle line:10%
>>VALENTINE: I believe that
anybody can play the piano.

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:48.920 align:middle line:10%
Maybe not everybody
is a concert pianist,

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.050 align:middle line:10%
but anybody can play the piano.

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:54.890 align:middle line:10%
I believe that we all have a
touch of the divine within us

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:56.450 align:middle line:10%
because that's who we are.

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:59.870 align:middle line:10%
We have a bit of the magic
of the divine inside us.

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:03.890 align:middle line:10%
So I believe everybody
has divine gifts.

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:06.680 align:middle line:10%
It's do you want
to use them or not?

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:08.120 align:middle line:10%
Are you afraid of them?

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.930 align:middle line:10%
Are you going to practice?

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:12.230 align:middle line:10%
Because it is practice,
practice, practice.

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:16.460 align:middle line:10%
So anybody can do
this if they want it.

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:19.160 align:middle line:10%
But you were talking about
the whole intuitive part.

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.620 align:middle line:10%
The thing about tarot, when
I teach it to my students,

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:24.120 align:middle line:10%
is that, OK, there's a picture.

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.700 align:middle line:10%
There are words.

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:28.620 align:middle line:10%
And there are meanings
behind all of this.

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:30.380 align:middle line:10%
There's tons of symbolism.

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:33.230 align:middle line:10%
You can go down that rabbit
hole if you want about all

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:34.400 align:middle line:10%
of that symbolism--

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:38.170 align:middle line:10%
I certainly do-- or you can not.

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:41.680 align:middle line:10%
It's your call, but
you have to trust.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:42.680 align:middle line:10%
You have to have faith.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.690 align:middle line:10%
You have to look at
the cards and go,

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:47.270 align:middle line:10%
where are my eyes drawn?

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:49.160 align:middle line:10%
And I teach my
students, it's like,

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.047 align:middle line:10%
are your eyes drawn
to a particular phrase

00:27:51.047 --> 00:27:52.130 align:middle line:10%
at the bottom of the card?

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:54.920 align:middle line:10%
Are your eyes drawn
to the picture?

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.350 align:middle line:10%
Are you thinking about
the meaning of the card?

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:59.400 align:middle line:10%
Where, intuitively?

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
of what he just said?

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.983 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, I
think it's wonderful.

00:28:02.983 --> 00:28:08.010 align:middle line:84%
I think anyone can absolutely
strengthen their intuition.

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:10.640 align:middle line:84%
It's like learning a
new language, I say,

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.890 align:middle line:84%
so that's why I tell
people, start simply.

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:14.450 align:middle line:90%
Pick one card a day.

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:15.620 align:middle line:90%
Keep a journal.

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:17.030 align:middle line:90%
Write down what you think--

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:20.150 align:middle line:84%
after you look it up in the book
and you see what it might mean,

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:21.380 align:middle line:90%
write one sentence.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:22.250 align:middle line:90%
Synthesize.

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:24.050 align:middle line:90%
What do you think--

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:26.270 align:middle line:84%
how is this card supposed
to be inspiring you?

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Come back to it at
the end of the day,

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.160 align:middle line:84%
and you'll learn a word at a
time, and then after a while,

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.660 align:middle line:90%
you'll be speaking sentences.

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:34.950 align:middle line:90%
And so just be patient.

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:38.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you connect to your
guides, they want to help you.

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:41.030 align:middle line:84%
They believe in free will,
so all you have to do

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:44.000 align:middle line:84%
is reach out, have
crystal clear intentions,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.480 align:middle line:84%
be very specific in what
you ask, be consistent,

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:50.750 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to be getting
stronger and stronger messages.

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:53.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You seem to
be very enlightened.

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:58.817 align:middle line:84%
When I talk to you, I don't
pick up anything evil about you.

00:28:58.817 --> 00:29:01.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: [LAUGHS]

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does that
have a lot to determine

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:06.510 align:middle line:84%
whether the individual
is the same?

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Do you pinpoint who that person
is because of your personality?

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:14.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Well, I am very
connected to my guides.

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:15.070 align:middle line:90%
I do meditation.

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:17.980 align:middle line:84%
I do transcendental meditation,
very advanced techniques

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:18.780 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:19.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Daily, probably.

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:20.777 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, my gosh, yes.

00:29:20.777 --> 00:29:22.980 align:middle line:90%
And I go on extended retreats.

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:24.780 align:middle line:84%
I went on a 10-day
retreat where I

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:27.030 align:middle line:84%
meditated about six hours
a day and came back,

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:28.950 align:middle line:84%
and I channeled a
lot of my messages.

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:30.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Six hours a day?

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:30.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yeah.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.878 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you do,
just sit there and om?

00:29:32.878 --> 00:29:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Well, it involves
asanas, yoga positions,

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:37.260 align:middle line:90%
pranayama, meditation.

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.960 align:middle line:84%
It's called rounding when
you start doing [INAUDIBLE]..

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:44.880 align:middle line:84%
But so I use my guides to help
my clients, but then one reason

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.980 align:middle line:84%
I created the deck is
because I didn't just

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:49.470 align:middle line:84%
want to fish for my clients,
I wanted to teach them how

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:50.513 align:middle line:90%
to fish for themselves.

00:29:50.513 --> 00:29:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is important.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:52.972 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes, it's important.

00:29:52.972 --> 00:29:54.270 align:middle line:90%
I want to empower people.

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why I'm
working with them.

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:57.620 align:middle line:90%
I keep the journals.

00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And they strengthen
their intuition.

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:04.680 align:middle line:84%
If you use these cards,
you will do that.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give us an example of
a reading you've done that has

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:08.860 align:middle line:90%
come true--

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.950 align:middle line:90%
most of them probably have--

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:13.560 align:middle line:84%
that you would just say is one
of the most dramatic things

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:14.810 align:middle line:90%
I've done.

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:15.610 align:middle line:90%
What would that be?

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:16.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: OK.

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.237 align:middle line:84%
Well, sometimes there
are all kinds of things.

00:30:18.237 --> 00:30:20.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll just say one that
I've done with my Oracle deck,

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.793 align:middle line:84%
because typically, I do
astrology and Oracle.

00:30:23.793 --> 00:30:25.210 align:middle line:84%
That's where I'm
most comfortable.

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You combine it?

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:28.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Yes,
because I like to see

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:31.020 align:middle line:84%
when the Oracle
echoes and reinforces

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:32.730 align:middle line:90%
what I see in the astrology.

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:34.230 align:middle line:84%
Then that strengthens
the message.

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:35.940 align:middle line:84%
But I had one client
where she just

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:37.800 align:middle line:90%
loves to do just the cards.

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.260 align:middle line:84%
So all I had to go
on were the cards.

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:41.460 align:middle line:90%
And she wanted to know--

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.748 align:middle line:84%
she was married-- if this was
a good time to get pregnant.

00:30:44.748 --> 00:30:46.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She's asking you this?

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes.

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.540 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah.

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:47.350 align:middle line:90%
A good time?

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:48.480 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.760 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And so I used the cards
in a four-card spread

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.960 align:middle line:84%
that I really like,
and the first card

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.180 align:middle line:90%
would kind of cover the topic.

00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the first
card was the moon card, which

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.650 align:middle line:90%
says hidden forces are in play.

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:06.390 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't mean it's
bad, but it just means, hm.

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:07.830 align:middle line:90%
Something's being hidden.

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
card, which is

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:14.310 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be influencing, that
was the 12 house card reversed.

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:16.320 align:middle line:84%
A secret is about
to be revealed.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.065 align:middle line:84%
So already, we're
developing a theme.

00:31:18.065 --> 00:31:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And are
you puzzled when

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:19.910 align:middle line:90%
these things are happening?

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:20.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Well, no.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:23.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a four-card reading,
so I say, let's play it out.

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:24.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It just is what it is.

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:25.427 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: So then
the third card,

00:31:25.427 --> 00:31:28.300 align:middle line:84%
which is my favorite
card, is the advice card.

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:30.600 align:middle line:84%
That was the Mercury
retrograde card.

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:33.330 align:middle line:84%
When you get that as the
advice, that's saying, let's

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:35.640 align:middle line:90%
take a wait-and-see approach.

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.410 align:middle line:84%
There's always
hidden information

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:38.850 align:middle line:90%
in Mercury retrogrades.

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Then the potential
outcome, especially

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:45.340 align:middle line:84%
if she takes that advice,
that was the Aries card.

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And that was very
startling, because Aries

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.540 align:middle line:90%
is individual energy.

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:53.970 align:middle line:84%
It is all about
being self-reliant.

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:57.720 align:middle line:84%
It is do it yourself, and
it's a serious new beginning.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.200 align:middle line:90%
So we're saying, hm.

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.380 align:middle line:84%
A lot's being kept
from us, but it's

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:03.390 align:middle line:84%
going to lead to a
significant new beginning.

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:06.800 align:middle line:84%
So my advice to her was
saying, hold off right now.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.730 align:middle line:84%
We got to let some
of this information--

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:10.147 align:middle line:84%
and work with your
guides, and you

00:32:10.147 --> 00:32:11.870 align:middle line:84%
can ask your guides
in meditation,

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:13.740 align:middle line:84%
will you please
lift these veils?

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:16.410 align:middle line:84%
Allow me to see this
situation more clearly.

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Allow me to see this
person more clearly.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happened
in that reading--

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:24.240 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know why
she should hold off.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And she's like,
well, what's hidden?

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:27.030 align:middle line:90%
You've got to tell me.

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:28.950 align:middle line:84%
So one thing, if
you're going to get

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:31.530 align:middle line:84%
more out of any
kind of Oracle deck,

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:34.020 align:middle line:84%
I would say, ask a
specific message.

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:36.360 align:middle line:90%
Be grateful to get the answer.

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:38.850 align:middle line:84%
Don't think you're going
to know all the details.

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:40.990 align:middle line:84%
You're receiving the
message you need.

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:43.723 align:middle line:84%
If they're telling you,
it's not a good idea.

00:32:43.723 --> 00:32:45.390 align:middle line:84%
There's more information
to be revealed,

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:47.160 align:middle line:90%
there is divine timing.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.510 align:middle line:90%
Allow things to unfold.

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:51.090 align:middle line:84%
In a week, you can
ask again, because we

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:55.000 align:middle line:84%
have to learn how to receive
messages, not control them.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:55.840 align:middle line:90%
And that happens.

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.130 align:middle line:84%
Especially early on, they'll
ask me the same question

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:00.360 align:middle line:90%
10 different times.

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:02.212 align:middle line:84%
And after a few times,
I'm saying, look,

00:33:02.212 --> 00:33:03.420 align:middle line:90%
you're getting the same card.

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:06.720 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Take the message.

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
Heather retrogrades?

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:11.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: So retrogrades
are when planets appear

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.680 align:middle line:90%
to move backwards in the sky.

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And what I really focus
on are the personal planet

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:16.910 align:middle line:90%
retrogrades--

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:18.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you mean,
backwards in the sky?

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: --Mercury,
Venus, Mars.

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:20.970 align:middle line:90%
Well, they don't really.

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:22.740 align:middle line:84%
They don't really,
but they appear to.

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:23.460 align:middle line:90%
And so the appearance is--

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:24.668 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like spin backwards?

00:33:24.668 --> 00:33:28.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Yeah, they
appear to slow down.

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah, so we have several
Mercury retrogrades a year.

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:35.310 align:middle line:90%
We have Venus retrograde.

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:36.747 align:middle line:90%
We have Mars retrograde.

00:33:36.747 --> 00:33:37.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're constant.

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes.

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:39.200 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Mercury
is several times.

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:42.460 align:middle line:84%
The Venus and Mars
are not so often.

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And every
year, they're the same?

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:46.127 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: They're always
in a different sign,

00:33:46.127 --> 00:33:48.100 align:middle line:84%
and so it always matters
what sign they're in.

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.440 align:middle line:84%
But you can always
apply that RE rule.

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, if it's a Venus
retrograde, you

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:56.790 align:middle line:84%
want to apply the RE rule
to areas that Venus rules--

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:58.790 align:middle line:90%
love, money, art.

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:02.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's a time to re-evaluate
your relationships.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So each
planetary retrograde

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.770 align:middle line:84%
has something different
to do with you.

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:08.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes, absolutely.

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:10.130 align:middle line:84%
So even though you're
rethinking things

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:12.290 align:middle line:84%
and you're doing the RE--
it's a reflective time--

00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:14.420 align:middle line:84%
you're reflecting
on different things.

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:16.489 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and then in
Mars, Mars retrograde

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:18.889 align:middle line:84%
is the trickiest
because it's a time

00:34:18.889 --> 00:34:22.170 align:middle line:84%
to rethink how we
use our energy.

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're coming on
too strong in a situation,

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:26.929 align:middle line:90%
it's a time to pull back.

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:28.880 align:middle line:84%
If you've maybe been
more of a doormat,

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.710 align:middle line:90%
it's a time to assert yourself.

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:33.770 align:middle line:84%
So you want to be
rethinking that area.

00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Those retrogrades--
are they the same for everybody?

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:42.679 align:middle line:84%
Like you mentioned what Venus
is, money and things like that.

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Would you say if we're
in retrograde for Venus,

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:48.469 align:middle line:84%
everybody should be
affected by this?

00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:49.429 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: OK.

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:51.409 align:middle line:84%
It is an opportunity
for everyone

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:53.420 align:middle line:84%
to re-evaluate
their relationships,

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:55.760 align:middle line:84%
to refinance, if you
want to refinance,

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.500 align:middle line:90%
with Venus in retrograde.

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:00.830 align:middle line:84%
It is going to impact if
you have-- so say you've

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:02.060 align:middle line:90%
got Taurus in your chart.

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Venus is connected to Taurus.

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:06.650 align:middle line:90%
That may impact you more.

00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:07.700 align:middle line:90%
Even Gemini.

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.192 align:middle line:84%
Mercury is connected to
Gemini, so Mercury retrograde

00:35:10.192 --> 00:35:11.150 align:middle line:90%
could connect you more.

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:14.810 align:middle line:84%
So it could have more
emphasis, but it's always

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:16.380 align:middle line:90%
going to impact you.

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:19.220 align:middle line:84%
So you always want to be
embracing the RE rule.

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:20.900 align:middle line:90%
It's a meditative time.

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:24.350 align:middle line:84%
You should always be a little
more personal reflection

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:25.490 align:middle line:90%
during retrograde.

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:26.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Rick
Levine-- you know him?

00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:27.500 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes.

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:28.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:31.800 align:middle line:84%
He's an astrologer, and he
talks about Mercury retrograde.

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:32.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: OK.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.520 align:middle line:10%
>>RICK LEVINE: The
key to succeeding,

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:37.340 align:middle line:10%
to surviving Mercury
retrograde is

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:40.550 align:middle line:10%
to pay attention to the
details and to take the time

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:42.032 align:middle line:10%
and read the fine print.

00:35:42.032 --> 00:35:43.490 align:middle line:10%
I have a friend
who was out looking

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:46.340 align:middle line:10%
for a car who decided,
on a Mercury retrograde,

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:47.632 align:middle line:10%
that he was going to buy a car.

00:35:47.632 --> 00:35:49.340 align:middle line:10%
And he said, I'm going
to go out looking.

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:51.260 align:middle line:10%
And the first afternoon
he went out looking,

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:56.030 align:middle line:10%
he came across a purple
little sports car,

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:57.790 align:middle line:10%
fell in love with
it, and bought it.

00:35:57.790 --> 00:35:59.240 align:middle line:10%
And it took him
about a week or so

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.920 align:middle line:10%
to realize it was a
pretty stupid thing

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:03.380 align:middle line:10%
to do because he had dogs.

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:06.123 align:middle line:10%
And it was like an impulse.

00:36:06.123 --> 00:36:07.790 align:middle line:10%
And you see, the thing
is is that if you

00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:12.710 align:middle line:10%
go out and buy a computer, or
buy a car, or sign a contract

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:16.760 align:middle line:10%
and don't take the time to
go over all the fine print--

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.740 align:middle line:10%
because when Mercury
is retrograde,

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:21.830 align:middle line:10%
it's covering territory in the
sky where it's already been.

00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:24.920 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes, we feel
a great sense of urgency

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:27.830 align:middle line:10%
that if I don't buy that car
today, I'll miss the chance.

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:29.690 align:middle line:10%
That car won't be
there tomorrow.

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:32.540 align:middle line:10%
So again, the practice
with Mercury retrograde

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:33.830 align:middle line:10%
is slow down.

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:36.470 align:middle line:10%
Remember, you have more
time than you think,

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:40.130 align:middle line:10%
that Mercury retrogrades,
and turns direct, and turns

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:42.230 align:middle line:10%
retrograde, and turns direct.

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:44.630 align:middle line:10%
And as long as you
follow the flow,

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:47.690 align:middle line:10%
and tie up those loose
ends the best you can,

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:52.610 align:middle line:10%
you won't fall into the abyss
of the problem of Mercury

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:53.507 align:middle line:10%
retrograde.

00:36:53.507 --> 00:36:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you agree with that?

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: There is a tremendous
urgency during Mercury

00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:59.330 align:middle line:90%
retrogrades, absolutely.

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And part of the problem is
also, so much is hidden.

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Whatever we think is the problem
is not really the problem.

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:10.250 align:middle line:84%
So it's a much better
time to reflect, journal,

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:12.270 align:middle line:84%
and then once
Mercury goes forward,

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:14.250 align:middle line:90%
then you can implement.

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:15.180 align:middle line:90%
And it is very good.

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:16.850 align:middle line:84%
You should absolutely
cross your Ts

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:18.860 align:middle line:84%
and dot your Is
during retrograde,

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:20.323 align:middle line:90%
because we miss things.

00:37:20.323 --> 00:37:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And
different retrogrades

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:23.060 align:middle line:90%
mean different things, right?

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:23.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes.

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:27.020 align:middle line:84%
With Mercury, it's
more about technology.

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:29.060 align:middle line:84%
I would not be buying
new appliances.

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:32.780 align:middle line:84%
You can repair your
appliances-- it's the RE--

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:35.960 align:middle line:84%
but that's more about
communication technology.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:39.110 align:middle line:84%
With Venus, it's going to
be relationship snafus,

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:41.510 align:middle line:90%
or ooh, I mismanaged my money.

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:44.090 align:middle line:84%
With Mars, it could be
inappropriate displays

00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:48.917 align:middle line:84%
of anger and aggression coming
out because it's energy.

00:37:48.917 --> 00:37:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does the moon fit
into some of this [INAUDIBLE]??

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: The moon is one
of the most complicated parts

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:54.260 align:middle line:90%
of the chart.

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:55.730 align:middle line:90%
It rules so much.

00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:56.990 align:middle line:90%
It rules our emotions.

00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:59.990 align:middle line:84%
It rules women, our
mothers especially.

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:01.370 align:middle line:90%
It rules past lives.

00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:06.020 align:middle line:84%
It rules our physical home and
also people living in our home.

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And we're least
conscious of that energy.

00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:12.770 align:middle line:84%
So you should really get
to know, be comfortable,

00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:14.480 align:middle line:90%
with your moon's energy.

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had interviewed some
emergency medical technicians

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:20.360 align:middle line:84%
and we talked about
the full moon.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And they said, without
question, during a full moon,

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:29.420 align:middle line:84%
they get more calls for
emergencies and strange things

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:30.830 align:middle line:90%
than anything.

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And they're convinced
that the moon

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:34.580 align:middle line:90%
has something to do with it.

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Well, I
follow the moon cycles

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.930 align:middle line:84%
and I work with my
clients to be very

00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:42.890 align:middle line:84%
aware of the time between the
new moon and the full moon.

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:45.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a two-week
period every month.

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And when you're talking
about the full moon,

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.790 align:middle line:90%
that is fruition.

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:52.850 align:middle line:90%
That is a culmination of energy.

00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And so it's going to
be especially intense.

00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:58.280 align:middle line:84%
It's everything comes to
a head in a full moon.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.350 align:middle line:84%
The new moon is
great for when we're

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:01.480 align:middle line:90%
trying to begin something.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:03.920 align:middle line:90%
It represents new beginnings.

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:06.650 align:middle line:84%
Anything you start between
a new and full moon

00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:10.480 align:middle line:84%
will grow and blossom, and
the full moon is that growth.

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And so things are going
to come to a head,

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:14.220 align:middle line:90%
for sure, with that full moon.

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the human body
is made up of so much water,

00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:20.798 align:middle line:84%
and the moon, we know, has a
gravitational pull on water.

00:39:20.798 --> 00:39:22.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's got to affect
people somehow.

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:23.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, absolutely.

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:23.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:24.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They get strange.

00:39:24.350 --> 00:39:25.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: [LAUGHS]

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very strange, indeed.

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:29.960 align:middle line:84%
How does the moon fit
into your Oracle cards?

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:33.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Well, I have a
beautiful card for the moon.

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And I put it all into
the visual collage.

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And I also have a
new moon spread.

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:43.160 align:middle line:84%
So that new moon
spread would require--

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:47.030 align:middle line:84%
if somebody put my Oracle
deck into categories--

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:51.310 align:middle line:84%
because I have houses,
planets, elements, modalities--

00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:52.110 align:middle line:90%
I cover everything.

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You cover all
your bases, don't you?

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yes.

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:57.740 align:middle line:84%
So if you make piles of
categories of my deck,

00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:00.440 align:middle line:84%
for every time
there's a new moon,

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:03.230 align:middle line:84%
I would say, pull one
card from the element.

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Pull one card from the
modality, from the planet sign.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And then you can say you want
to incorporate those energies so

00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:13.160 align:middle line:84%
that if you get the
fire, then you say, oh,

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:14.960 align:middle line:84%
that's kind of like,
do it yesterday.

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:17.810 align:middle line:84%
It's saying, you go
forward with your plans.

00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And then so whatever cards
you get, it's saying,

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:24.530 align:middle line:84%
these are qualities to
incorporate and nurture

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:26.010 align:middle line:90%
for the next two weeks.

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were
a parent, would you

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.302 align:middle line:84%
get an astrological
chart on your kid?

00:40:30.302 --> 00:40:31.135 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, yeah.

00:40:31.135 --> 00:40:32.700 align:middle line:84%
I do child astrology
all the time.

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do?

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.125 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: It's great
because it's just

00:40:35.125 --> 00:40:36.230 align:middle line:90%
showing some potential.

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And also children-- what
most people don't know--

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:41.540 align:middle line:90%
they act from their moon.

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:44.100 align:middle line:84%
We have to grow
into our sun sign.

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:47.630 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody's sun is very
different from the moon,

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:51.410 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be acting
from those moon qualities.

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And then between ages 7 and
13, we grow into our Mercury,

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:56.870 align:middle line:90%
so we grow into our chart.

00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And then I just did a
reading for a child,

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:01.368 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't have any
earth in his chart.

00:41:01.368 --> 00:41:03.410 align:middle line:84%
So when you don't have
any earth-- because that's

00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:04.580 align:middle line:90%
what makes us grounded.

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:07.560 align:middle line:84%
It's practical-- I then
say, you know what?

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.860 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you make sure
he plays with clay,

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:12.980 align:middle line:84%
or he's building things,
or plant flowers with him.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:15.065 align:middle line:84%
Make sure that he's
grounded in nature--

00:41:15.065 --> 00:41:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just play
with the earth, yeah.

00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:17.197 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: --because
he's missing earth.

00:41:17.197 --> 00:41:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And if we totally lack
an element or modality,

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:22.120 align:middle line:84%
sometimes we completely
overcompensate and become

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:22.920 align:middle line:90%
obsessed with it.

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.080 align:middle line:84%
But often, it's just
kind of neglected.

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:26.930 align:middle line:84%
So a way to be in
balance with our energy

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:29.570 align:middle line:84%
is to make sure it's
incorporated early on.

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If I pick one
card from your Oracle deck,

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:34.780 align:middle line:90%
can you say something about me?

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: OK,
well, it depends--

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.580 align:middle line:90%
if you're going to ask--

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:38.380 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:40.190 align:middle line:90%
I have not blessed this deck.

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:41.567 align:middle line:90%
Can I bless the deck?

00:41:41.567 --> 00:41:42.650 align:middle line:90%
Because that's something--

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:44.025 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
you bless a deck?

00:41:44.025 --> 00:41:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: All right.

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:48.710 align:middle line:84%
When people first get a
deck, they should bless it.

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And they actually need
to make it their own.

00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And they should look at
each card and take it in.

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:55.382 align:middle line:84%
So this will be great
because then people at home

00:41:55.382 --> 00:41:58.910 align:middle line:84%
can bless the deck, because
this, we just opened.

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:04.040 align:middle line:84%
So [NON-ENGLISH],, angels and
guides, please bless this deck.

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:05.630 align:middle line:90%
Please activate it.

00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:07.970 align:middle line:90%
Free it of all past energies.

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:10.550 align:middle line:84%
Please allow me to
receive accurate messages.

00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And please allow me to
accurately interpret

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:14.540 align:middle line:90%
those messages.

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And allow me to use
this deck to receive

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:19.560 align:middle line:84%
accurate messages
for George Noory

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:23.520 align:middle line:84%
so he can reach his full
potential of perfect health,

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:25.640 align:middle line:90%
happiness, and abundance.

00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:26.540 align:middle line:90%
OK, so--

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:27.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So now it's blessed.

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:28.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: It's blessed.

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:28.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So I'm going
to take one card.

00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:31.078 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: So pull a card
and then pull it up to you,

00:42:31.078 --> 00:42:32.900 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
area you touch.

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:35.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:36.240 align:middle line:90%
Mars retrograde.

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Ooh.

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:37.850 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK.

00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:38.650 align:middle line:90%
Mars retrograde.

00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:40.483 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are you
all excited about this?

00:42:40.483 --> 00:42:43.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Well [LAUGHS] I
guess I just get really excited.

00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:44.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh.

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:46.250 align:middle line:84%
I thought maybe I hit
the lottery or something.

00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: It's very exciting.

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, I do feel that it's
a very energetic card,

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:51.290 align:middle line:84%
and you give off
a lot of energy.

00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And we just talked
about Mars retrograde.

00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:55.520 align:middle line:90%
So Mars retrograde.

00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:59.210 align:middle line:84%
This means right now, this
is a perfect time for you

00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:02.652 align:middle line:84%
to be rethinking all the
ways you use your energy.

00:43:02.652 --> 00:43:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if I had
pulled a different card?

00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:05.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Well, then,
that's the message

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:07.070 align:middle line:90%
to incorporate that energy.

00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:07.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:08.260 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yeah.

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:11.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's saying,
if you incorporate

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:15.140 align:middle line:84%
this energy, that could be
really beneficial to you today.

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And so it could
even be, you might

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.460 align:middle line:84%
want to think about
your exercise routine.

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Think about maybe some
things that you're eating.

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And also, there
could be an issue

00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.833 align:middle line:84%
that you even want to assert
yourself more strongly,

00:43:26.833 --> 00:43:29.000 align:middle line:84%
or maybe there's where
you're saying, you know what?

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to lay off of
that one for a while.

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you use the
cards for your daily routine,

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:33.980 align:middle line:90%
I guess.

00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Yeah.

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Very simple-- inspire and
prepare me for the day.

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:40.512 align:middle line:90%
So what's next for you?

00:43:40.512 --> 00:43:41.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Well I am touring.

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:43.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm going all over the country.

00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:45.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing events
where I'm helping

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.300 align:middle line:84%
people build these
visual collages,

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:48.770 align:middle line:90%
showing them how to use this.

00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:51.690 align:middle line:90%
I teach astrology with the deck.

00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm also
developing a new deck.

00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:58.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm coming out
with a download PDF

00:43:58.070 --> 00:44:00.380 align:middle line:84%
of all kinds of
wonderful spreads

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:02.600 align:middle line:90%
that you can use with my deck.

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.803 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important are
computers to your work?

00:44:04.803 --> 00:44:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, they're very
important because it speeds it

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:07.550 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:08.330 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my goodness.

00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what I thought.

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:11.007 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: When we used to
have to-- it took forever

00:44:11.007 --> 00:44:11.990 align:middle line:90%
to build a chart.

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:13.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can type
in the information

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:14.960 align:middle line:90%
and we see the chart.

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:16.310 align:middle line:90%
So it goes much faster.

00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:17.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's accurate.

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:19.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, it's
very accurate, yes.

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:20.145 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:44:20.145 --> 00:44:22.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Well, because the
skill is in the interpretation.

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:23.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now there's
programs for that, too?

00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:28.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Well, yeah,
but I don't look at those.

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're more
hands-on, aren't you?

00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:33.240 align:middle line:10%
>>ARIELLE: Well, once you
learn, every astrologer is going

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.040 align:middle line:10%
to have--

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:35.390 align:middle line:10%
there's interpretation.

00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:37.220 align:middle line:10%
I'm very personal, practical.

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:39.410 align:middle line:10%
I want to help people
in their daily lives.

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:40.610 align:middle line:10%
There's all different types.

00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:42.720 align:middle line:10%
Some astrologers
are really esoteric.

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:44.290 align:middle line:10%
It's just we all
have a specialty.

00:44:44.290 --> 00:44:47.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And are the cards based
for you, for an astrologer,

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:51.200 align:middle line:84%
or for some individual who might
want to do their own thing?

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE: Oh, you can use
this as only an Oracle deck.

00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:56.120 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to know
anything about astrology.

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:57.380 align:middle line:90%
You look the card up.

00:44:57.380 --> 00:44:58.520 align:middle line:90%
It's color-coded.

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:01.640 align:middle line:84%
You read the messages that
are connected to the card .

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.070 align:middle line:90%
And then you incorporate those.

00:45:03.070 --> 00:45:05.300 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to know
anything about astrology.

00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Heather, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:08.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE: Thanks so much.

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:09.260 align:middle line:90%
It's my pleasure.

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:10.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's great having you.

00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:13.370 align:middle line:10%
Astrology is so cool
because it really

00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:17.000 align:middle line:10%
tells you things about your
future and about your present

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.190 align:middle line:10%
that you might not have
known about before.

00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:21.420 align:middle line:10%
I just learned a lot about me.

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:22.460 align:middle line:90%
I kind of like it.

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:23.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:30.000 align:middle line:90%
