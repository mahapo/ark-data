00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:17.888 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.888 --> 00:00:19.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.780 align:middle line:10%
We have a fascinating
program for you.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.860 align:middle line:10%
Kimo Kepano is a
lightseer and practices

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.100 align:middle line:10%
at the nexus between
the Aboriginal practices

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.000 align:middle line:10%
of ancient Hawaiian high seeing
and new intuitive healing

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.900 align:middle line:10%
modalities.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.122 align:middle line:10%
Kimo, welcome to the program.

00:00:35.122 --> 00:00:36.330 align:middle line:10%
>>KIMO KEPANO: Aloha, George.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.420 align:middle line:10%
Mahalo for having me.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.070 align:middle line:10%
I really appreciate it.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.445 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Were you
born in Hawaii?

00:00:39.445 --> 00:00:42.270 align:middle line:10%
>>KEPANO: I was born in
Hawaii, but I've also migrated

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.553 align:middle line:10%
all over the United States.

00:00:43.553 --> 00:00:44.970 align:middle line:10%
I currently live
in New York City.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.860 align:middle line:10%
I've been there since the '90s.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.790 align:middle line:10%
The 1890s is what it feels like.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.330 align:middle line:10%
But I do migrate all over and
I'll be going to New Zealand

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.130 align:middle line:10%
soon.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.198 align:middle line:84%
So trying to spread my
information as far as I can.

00:00:55.198 --> 00:00:56.365 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're a lightseer.

00:00:56.365 --> 00:00:57.180 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Yeah.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.350 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: It's such
a strange thing

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.379 align:middle line:84%
because a lightseer
is a combination

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.940 align:middle line:90%
of multiple modalities.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.570 align:middle line:84%
Technically, I would be
considered a high seer because

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.420 align:middle line:84%
of the way that my
abilities kind of harmonize

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.290 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.260 align:middle line:84%
But I call myself a lightseer,
and that's by choice

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.540 align:middle line:84%
because I choose to
take my abilities

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.600 align:middle line:84%
and allow them to help me
transmute the things that I can

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.970 align:middle line:84%
see to be of
assistance and to be

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.217 align:middle line:84%
in service to the
individuals around me.

00:01:26.217 --> 00:01:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fantastic.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.710 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Thank you.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.362 align:middle line:84%
Some of the things that
I'd like to clarify

00:01:31.362 --> 00:01:32.820 align:middle line:84%
from the very
beginning when we are

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.520 align:middle line:84%
speaking to our
wonderful medium friends.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.540 align:middle line:84%
A medium is someone who is
able to be in communication

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.980 align:middle line:84%
with the living and
spirit energy, the living

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:43.780 align:middle line:90%
and the dead.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And when I was young,
as a small child,

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.730 align:middle line:90%
that is very much what I did.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.490 align:middle line:84%
However, when we go
into psychic worlds,

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.120 align:middle line:84%
we are talking to someone
who is in tune with senses--

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.480 align:middle line:84%
with all their intuitive
senses, which is something

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.660 align:middle line:90%
that I'm able to do.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.270 align:middle line:84%
But the high seer
is someone who is

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.830 align:middle line:84%
able to interlace all those
other abilities between spirit

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.307 align:middle line:90%
energy and energy.

00:02:06.307 --> 00:02:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you born this way?

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.030 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: I was born this way.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a firm
believer that everyone

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.310 align:middle line:84%
is born with very
unique abilities,

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.870 align:middle line:84%
though it does tend to ebb
and flow as we grow up.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: I'm an educator.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.550 align:middle line:84%
I've been an educator
since I was 16 years old

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.470 align:middle line:84%
specializing in
children and youth

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.953 align:middle line:90%
between the ages of 3 to 18.

00:02:23.953 --> 00:02:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: And I use,
all of my students--

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.380 align:middle line:84%
and when I do workshops and
working with other individuals,

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.920 align:middle line:84%
I use my ability and when I'm
working with someone to really

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.770 align:middle line:84%
kind of be a template of what
can I learn from this very

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.290 align:middle line:84%
small experience either working
with these three-year-olds

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.780 align:middle line:84%
or these 30-year-olds
or these 80-year-olds.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And I use my ability to see
energy and to see spirit energy

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.220 align:middle line:84%
and to tune into my own
senses to figure out

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.720 align:middle line:90%
how can I be of assistance.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.085 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can you see spirits?

00:02:53.085 --> 00:02:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Yes.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.785 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I
started off doing when

00:02:55.785 --> 00:02:56.910 align:middle line:90%
I was a three-year-old kid.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.210 align:middle line:90%
And I was documented.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.010 align:middle line:90%
I was filmed--

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.147 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Three years old?

00:03:00.147 --> 00:03:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Three years old.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.272 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that when you
find your first spirit?

00:03:03.272 --> 00:03:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Yeah, well, I would
like to say that it found me.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And when I was young,
my parents just

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.550 align:middle line:84%
thought, well, we've got a kid
with a really wild imagination.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And there is some really
interesting parallels

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.377 align:middle line:84%
between our imagination
and our intuition.

00:03:16.377 --> 00:03:18.210 align:middle line:84%
There are some really
interesting parallels.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.580 align:middle line:84%
But I was bringing in
evidence that I shouldn't

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.930 align:middle line:90%
have known at the age of three.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.340 align:middle line:90%
I was bringing in names.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.920 align:middle line:84%
I was bringing in the way
that people were passing away.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.530 align:middle line:84%
I was bringing in what had
happened to the body, where

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.140 align:middle line:84%
they were found,
first and last names

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.820 align:middle line:90%
by the age that I was three.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.740 align:middle line:84%
We made the assumption that I
was a kid who could just see.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.430 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't until I was older,
until around the age of 13,

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.220 align:middle line:84%
where I started to have
very cognitive thoughts

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.200 align:middle line:84%
of understanding that I was
seeing much more than spirit

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.000 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.740 align:middle line:90%
And I felt a little wild.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.170 align:middle line:84%
I felt a little crazy with
the things that I could see.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.640 align:middle line:84%
But now, in my DNA
who I am now, I

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.370 align:middle line:84%
allow myself to grow
through my abilities.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.540 align:middle line:84%
So way beyond spirit and way
beyond my intuitive senses

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.970 align:middle line:84%
and trying to figure
out why energy

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.500 align:middle line:84%
looks the way that
it looks to me,

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.690 align:middle line:84%
and once again,
how I can use that

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.920 align:middle line:84%
to be of assistance
to those around me,

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.600 align:middle line:84%
whether that's helping them
diagnose maladies or ailments

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.209 align:middle line:84%
or trying to figure out
where different kinds

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.899 align:middle line:84%
of emotional energy is
compacted inside of the body

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:24.870 align:middle line:84%
or where you might be getting
sick because of architecture

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:25.710 align:middle line:90%
or even landmass.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Your name, Kimo Kepano.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.430 align:middle line:90%
Was that your birth name?

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well, Kimo is my
birth name, but Kepano--

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.350 align:middle line:90%
Kepano is so interesting.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Because Kepano is technically
not my given last name.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.510 align:middle line:84%
When I was a kid, when
I was three years old,

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.780 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting in the very
back seat of my dad's car.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.870 align:middle line:84%
So my father asked
me, he says, OK, Kimo,

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.900 align:middle line:84%
so it is time to
give you a new name.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And Hawaiians have very,
very long descriptive names.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And I hadn't been given my
long descriptive name yet.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.230 align:middle line:84%
So my father says, I
think that it's time.

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's a whole
divining process

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.380 align:middle line:90%
that Hawaiians go through.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.140 align:middle line:84%
So he says to me, so
let's start to think

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.700 align:middle line:90%
about what your name could be.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And then, I heard him
say Kepano is your name.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:12.990 align:middle line:90%
So I agreed with him.

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Kepano
is my name, dad.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.380 align:middle line:90%
And he says, really?

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.360 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes, that's my name.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.725 align:middle line:84%
And he says, OK,
that's your name.

00:05:20.725 --> 00:05:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
it mean in Hawaiian?

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well, Kepano
is a very strange name

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.530 align:middle line:84%
to identify because it doesn't
come from very well understood

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:29.893 align:middle line:90%
Hawaiian language.

00:05:29.893 --> 00:05:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Hawaiian language always had
to go through different caste

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.110 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.490 align:middle line:84%
The way that I understood
Kepano as a kid

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.860 align:middle line:90%
was he who sees with light.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.780 align:middle line:90%
He who sees with light.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, as I grew up and I was
working in New York City,

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.085 align:middle line:84%
so I called my
father up and I said,

00:05:46.085 --> 00:05:47.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm so grateful to
bear your last name,

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.830 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to be
changing it to Kepano.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And my father said,
well, that makes

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.355 align:middle line:90%
sense since you named yourself.

00:05:53.355 --> 00:05:54.527 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was all for it.

00:05:54.527 --> 00:05:56.860 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: He was all for it,
but my father was confused.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.443 align:middle line:84%
He was like, wait a second, but
you've already named yourself.

00:05:59.443 --> 00:06:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And I was wildly confused
by that statement.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.110 align:middle line:84%
I said, I didn't name
myself, you named me.

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.430 align:middle line:90%
He says, I never named you.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.100 align:middle line:84%
I said, dad, I have the
memory of an elephant.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.440 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting in the
backseat of your car.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.930 align:middle line:84%
You asked if I was ready
for my Hawaiian name

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.310 align:middle line:90%
and you told me Kepano.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.260 align:middle line:84%
He says, I never
said that to you.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.070 align:middle line:84%
I asked if you are ready for
your Hawaiian middle name.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And I had heard clear as
day your name is Kepano.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.290 align:middle line:84%
So I had said that to
him and he changed it

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:26.290 align:middle line:90%
on my birth certificate.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When he did
he made it legal.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well, he made it
legal as my middle name.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.850 align:middle line:90%
But my father is a genealogist.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And he did find after
I made that statement

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:41.100 align:middle line:84%
that I do have an ancient
ancestor by the name of Kepano.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.500 align:middle line:84%
But when my father
asked me that question

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.220 align:middle line:84%
as a three-year-old kid, not
only could I hear your name

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.840 align:middle line:84%
is Kepano, but I knew that there
was a gentleman sitting next

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:50.640 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.840 align:middle line:84%
So now, as an adult, when
I took my middle name

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.340 align:middle line:84%
to be my last name, I can
see very, very clearly still

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.640 align:middle line:84%
this gentleman off of my
shoulder who I would now

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.000 align:middle line:84%
identify that as being one of my
spirit guides, one of my spirit

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.950 align:middle line:90%
teams, by the name of Kepano.

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:09.990 align:middle line:84%
I can pull in the evidence
of where he's from,

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.320 align:middle line:90%
what he did in his life.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And when I give my
father that evidence, who

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.150 align:middle line:84%
is the genealogist,
my father says,

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:19.440 align:middle line:84%
it's really quite spectacular
that you have this connection

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.550 align:middle line:90%
with this spirit guide.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.740 align:middle line:84%
So I make the joke
that, technically, I

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.362 align:middle line:84%
bear the name of my
own spirit guide.

00:07:24.362 --> 00:07:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who were your spiritual
teachers while growing up?

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: So my
spiritual teachers--

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.370 align:middle line:84%
I grew up with a variety
of spiritual teachers.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And I had religious teachers
when I was a young kid.

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:39.000 align:middle line:84%
But I started to kind of
challenge that religious dogma

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.250 align:middle line:84%
because it didn't really
quite make sense with the way

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.190 align:middle line:84%
that it looked because
everything is so visual for me.

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:45.640 align:middle line:90%
It didn't quite make sense.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.730 align:middle line:84%
So I started to
venture out and I

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.850 align:middle line:84%
started to speak
to other people who

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:55.080 align:middle line:84%
identify as high seers, Kahuna,
Huna, Brujos, Curandera,

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.520 align:middle line:90%
shamans, medicine men.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.760 align:middle line:10%
I went down the route of
other Aboriginal Indigenous

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.650 align:middle line:10%
and Native practitioners
to see if I

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:04.440 align:middle line:10%
could find out as much
information about myself

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.650 align:middle line:10%
as possible.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And when I did that,
I started to find out

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.460 align:middle line:84%
that I was speaking in
such a strong language

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.950 align:middle line:84%
of energetic understanding
that I actually became

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:16.660 align:middle line:84%
the teacher as I was the
student simultaneously.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.560 align:middle line:10%
Now, the majority of
my teachers are not

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.860 align:middle line:10%
even physical in
life expression.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.490 align:middle line:84%
I've learned how to tune in, in
multiple different modalities,

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:28.260 align:middle line:84%
but teachers from
different practices

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.215 align:middle line:84%
and different lineages and
different times and more.

00:08:31.215 --> 00:08:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had this
ability when you were three.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.595 align:middle line:90%
When did it kick in?

00:08:35.595 --> 00:08:38.507 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well, even though I
had this at the age of three--

00:08:38.507 --> 00:08:40.049 align:middle line:84%
if you could listen
to three-year-old

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Kimo speak in these recordings,
you would really laugh.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.630 align:middle line:84%
But when it really started to
kick in-- really wasn't until I

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.370 align:middle line:84%
was an adult. I was getting
really confused by all

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:49.170 align:middle line:90%
of my abilities.

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:51.090 align:middle line:84%
By the time I was
in high school,

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.090 align:middle line:84%
I started to have very open
dialogue with my friends

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.880 align:middle line:84%
and my friendship circle in
very, very intuitive ways.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.560 align:middle line:10%
Though, I didn't
completely understand

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.630 align:middle line:10%
that I was having
intuitive conversations,

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.970 align:middle line:10%
I was using my own terminology.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:04.800 align:middle line:10%
And I still use my
own terminology.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.310 align:middle line:84%
There are many, many things that
I can see that I cannot find

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.430 align:middle line:84%
as evidence in any book
with any other practitioner.

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:14.430 align:middle line:84%
So instead of searching
for information out there,

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:16.000 align:middle line:84%
I search for the
information in here.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.650 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm working with
clients and other practitioners,

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:22.710 align:middle line:84%
I've had to learn how to utilize
my own language in a way that

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.420 align:middle line:84%
can help the collective
make sense of all

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.960 align:middle line:84%
the wild stuff that is going
on inside of my vision.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My daughter is
in New York as we speak.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:31.880 align:middle line:90%
She's doing some actress work.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Nice.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just starting to
pick up little tiny movies

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:36.150 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.478 align:middle line:84%
And I understand that
you're an actor, aren't you?

00:09:38.478 --> 00:09:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Yeah, so in New
York City, when I moved there

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:44.400 align:middle line:84%
in the '90s, I moved to New
York City to be an educator,

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.960 align:middle line:84%
to be an actor,
to be a performer.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And I have had a very
successful career as a performer

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:50.310 align:middle line:90%
in New York City.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And I always thought,
George, that I

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:56.790 align:middle line:84%
had to disassociate my
intuitive ability from my acting

00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:00.660 align:middle line:84%
career and my education
to my acting career or--

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.910 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't want anyone
to get the wrong idea about me.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:04.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh, he's an actor.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.790 align:middle line:84%
So does he make
all this stuff up?

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:08.247 align:middle line:84%
When I was working
as a performer,

00:10:08.247 --> 00:10:10.080 align:middle line:84%
no one knew that I was
an educator because I

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.390 align:middle line:84%
didn't want them to think,
well, why are you teaching this?

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Shouldn't you be doing
something completely different?

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.770 align:middle line:84%
So now, I have learned that we
can blend all of our abilities

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:19.570 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.180 align:middle line:84%
So if I was talking
to your daughter,

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.472 align:middle line:84%
what I would do is I would
have a sit-down conversation

00:10:23.472 --> 00:10:26.430 align:middle line:84%
with her about what is the
unique intuition in terms

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:27.990 align:middle line:90%
of its energy around her?

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:31.320 align:middle line:84%
How can she better amplify that
to give her stronger success

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.850 align:middle line:90%
rates as an actress?

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:35.040 align:middle line:84%
We look at everyone
holistically.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.285 align:middle line:84%
We look at everyone very
bespoke because everyone is.

00:10:38.285 --> 00:10:40.005 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could I
look you up on IMDb?

00:10:40.005 --> 00:10:41.020 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: You could.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:41.820 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.090 align:middle line:90%
Don't you dare, though.

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:43.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm just joking.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:44.850 align:middle line:90%
You could, you could.

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:46.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So you do a lot, huh?

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: I do think
that I am able to juggle

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:50.820 align:middle line:90%
multiple modalities.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:56.010 align:middle line:84%
But I have found that this
current avatar of me really

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:58.620 align:middle line:84%
blending my ability
of intuition insight

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.800 align:middle line:84%
through education with my
creative background, this

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.315 align:middle line:84%
is the avatar that
I like the best.

00:11:03.315 --> 00:11:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we surrounded
by energy zones?

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.430 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: George,
if you could see

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:11.490 align:middle line:84%
what it looks like-- if I
could put my goggles on you,

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:14.220 align:middle line:84%
here is some of the
things that you would see.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:17.220 align:middle line:84%
You would see approximately
seven different energetic zones

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.090 align:middle line:90%
that run outside of your body.

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:21.473 align:middle line:84%
Now, those energetic
zones, they do have names.

00:11:21.473 --> 00:11:23.140 align:middle line:84%
These are not names
that I have created.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.470 align:middle line:84%
However, because
I can see them, I

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:27.510 align:middle line:84%
have learned that I
can gain more insight

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:29.010 align:middle line:84%
into those energetic
zones that have

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:32.100 align:middle line:84%
been talked about for
centuries and centuries.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And what I have found to
be the most fascinating

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:37.440 align:middle line:84%
is every single energetic
zone not only has

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.840 align:middle line:84%
a different vibration,
but different colors

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.320 align:middle line:90%
and shapes and more.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.660 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: So in fact, if I were
to just take a moment to tune

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.892 align:middle line:90%
in, your vibration moving out--

00:11:47.892 --> 00:11:49.350 align:middle line:84%
may I tune in for
a moment, George?

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:49.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:50.250 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Thank you.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tune me in.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:51.653 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Thank you.

00:11:51.653 --> 00:11:54.360 align:middle line:84%
Your vibration in your sixth
and your seventh energy zone,

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.280 align:middle line:84%
which is kind of the
highest energy zones,

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.100 align:middle line:84%
they radiate certain
colors for me.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And those colors,
I have learned,

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.270 align:middle line:84%
connect to a part of
you that will always

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:06.180 align:middle line:84%
be this way, regardless if you
are in this life expression.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.800 align:middle line:90%
Regardless if you're sleeping.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Regardless if you pass away
and you go into the spirit--

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:11.730 align:middle line:90%
they stay with you always.

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.070 align:middle line:84%
You are born with
this energetic color

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:16.260 align:middle line:84%
and you will pass away
with that energetic color.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And that has become so
much more fascinating to me

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:19.920 align:middle line:90%
than the aura.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.183 align:middle line:84%
We talk about aura
being in connection

00:12:22.183 --> 00:12:24.600 align:middle line:84%
to some of the energetic zones
because they're connected--

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So this is
different from the aura?

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:27.372 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: It is
very, very different.

00:12:27.372 --> 00:12:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Aura is always in
a state of change,

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:30.990 align:middle line:84%
or it will change when
your mood changes.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And that mood is connected
to different energetic zones.

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:37.530 align:middle line:84%
So if we can go way
beyond the normal,

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.140 align:middle line:84%
three to four energetic zones,
again, going into our sixth

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.540 align:middle line:84%
and seventh, there are
hidden colors in there.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And these colors are
very rarely photographed.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.377 align:middle line:84%
Someone might take a photo
with a Kirlian camera

00:12:49.377 --> 00:12:51.210 align:middle line:84%
that can photograph
your energetic frequency

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:52.410 align:middle line:90%
and color for aura.

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:55.950 align:middle line:84%
But I have very rarely seen
any aspect of your sixth

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:57.942 align:middle line:84%
and seventh energy
zone in those photos

00:12:57.942 --> 00:12:59.400 align:middle line:84%
that you might take
with your aura.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:12:59.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Sometimes,
I think it depends

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.640 align:middle line:90%
on the person to be honest.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.780 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.750 align:middle line:84%
It's very rare that that
color can be photographed.

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:09.360 align:middle line:84%
If we had more time, I would
fill your head, George,

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.640 align:middle line:84%
with all the colors that
I can see and vibrations.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And if we get really specific,
not only do I see the colors

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.200 align:middle line:84%
and vibrations
moving around you,

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.260 align:middle line:84%
but then, this would be what I
think most people would assume

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:24.090 align:middle line:84%
is an opening or a veil or a
portal where other information

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:28.050 align:middle line:84%
can come through, meaning your
own spirit team and maybe some

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:29.490 align:middle line:90%
of your own guides and more.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kimo, what
are soul skin colors?

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:35.850 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: So soul skin
colors, they do move

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:38.250 align:middle line:84%
through the spectrum
of primary colors.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.810 align:middle line:84%
They do move through
the spectrum of chakra.

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:44.310 align:middle line:84%
But I haven't found
evidentially, at least not yet,

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:47.640 align:middle line:84%
that they are directly
connected to your chakra.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:51.270 align:middle line:84%
I think that they are maybe
interlaced a little bit.

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:55.380 align:middle line:84%
But the soul skin color is the
most profound brilliant color

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.390 align:middle line:90%
of who you are and what you are.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:00.420 align:middle line:84%
So I have found that if
I'm looking at you, George,

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:05.610 align:middle line:84%
and if I were to tune in to
any of George's past life

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:06.570 align:middle line:90%
regressions or your--

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You would see that?

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:08.865 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: I would see that.

00:14:08.865 --> 00:14:11.137 align:middle line:84%
But they would also
be the same color.

00:14:11.137 --> 00:14:13.470 align:middle line:84%
May I speak openly about what
your colors are over here?

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:14.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Yeah, so your colors
range between an orange color

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:17.790 align:middle line:90%
and a red color.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:19.200 align:middle line:90%
The red is more of a magenta.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.120 align:middle line:90%
It's not a bright ruby red.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And the orange is more
of a blood red color.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:25.770 align:middle line:84%
So if I were to
tune in, I haven't

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:28.782 align:middle line:84%
taken the time to look at all of
your other past lives and more.

00:14:28.782 --> 00:14:30.990 align:middle line:84%
But I would guarantee you
that they would all come in

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:32.198 align:middle line:90%
with the same color spectrum.

00:14:32.198 --> 00:14:33.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which means what?

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.150 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well, the color
spectrum of these over here

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:37.830 align:middle line:84%
I've learned that
a lot of magentas

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:40.230 align:middle line:84%
are very much in
every life expression

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:41.880 align:middle line:84%
that you're a part
of someone who

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.590 align:middle line:90%
really needs a lot of choice.

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:46.500 align:middle line:84%
Someone who needs to be able
to change their mind whenever

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.340 align:middle line:90%
they want.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.140 align:middle line:84%
Someone who needs
to be able to say,

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.660 align:middle line:84%
this is how I feel
autonomously and please

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.320 align:middle line:90%
don't try to change my mind.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.010 align:middle line:84%
But when I go into the
orange spectrum of that,

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:57.390 align:middle line:90%
this is all quality.

00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:00.930 align:middle line:84%
Quality conversations,
quality experiences,

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:02.868 align:middle line:90%
quality connections, and more.

00:15:02.868 --> 00:15:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's the thing
that I have seen

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:06.435 align:middle line:84%
evidentially true for
everyone in that spectrum.

00:15:06.435 --> 00:15:08.357 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that a
good reading on me?

00:15:08.357 --> 00:15:10.440 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: I think that
you're wonderful, actually.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:10.930 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.070 align:middle line:84%
I think this is a
really wonderful--

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:14.460 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know you,
George, besides you sitting

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.600 align:middle line:90%
in front of me like this.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.220 align:middle line:84%
But I would guarantee you that
if we could kind of unwrap

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:20.720 align:middle line:84%
all of these
different colors, we

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.030 align:middle line:84%
would find the purest
spectrum of who you are.

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:25.010 align:middle line:10%
Now, I am not an astrologer.

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:26.210 align:middle line:10%
I don't study astrology.

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:29.870 align:middle line:10%
But I have been told by many
astrologers and people who

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.810 align:middle line:10%
read the cosmos that everything
that I see within soul skin

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:36.320 align:middle line:10%
colors and more is a direct
reflection of your zodiac.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.685 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You have twin sisters.

00:15:37.685 --> 00:15:38.570 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: I do.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've used them
in your own case studies.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: I do.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.390 align:middle line:84%
So I use-- all of my
siblings are seers

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:46.170 align:middle line:90%
in very, very different ways.

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:49.340 align:middle line:84%
My sisters are six
years younger than me.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:50.720 align:middle line:90%
And they're seers as well.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:53.510 align:middle line:84%
But I first started to
see soul skin colors

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:56.630 align:middle line:84%
when I looked at their cribs
when they were newborn babies.

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:59.090 align:middle line:84%
There's no aura in that
little baby when they're

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:01.910 align:middle line:84%
born because aura is
connected to emotions and more

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:03.690 align:middle line:90%
that hasn't grown into them yet.

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:06.230 align:middle line:84%
But what I could see is
their soul skin colors.

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:09.290 align:middle line:84%
One was a violet color
and the other one

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:10.927 align:middle line:84%
was a spectrum of
a blood orange red.

00:16:10.927 --> 00:16:11.885 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Two separates.

00:16:11.885 --> 00:16:14.630 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Two completely
separate entities.

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:18.170 align:middle line:84%
So I used them as case
studies my entire life

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:21.230 align:middle line:84%
to get to know what those color
spectrum individuals mean.

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And today, I can
very, very clearly

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:27.470 align:middle line:84%
get a read on someone who is
in the spectrums of the purples

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:29.330 align:middle line:84%
and the violets and
someone who is in the--

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You use your
sister as templates.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: I totally
cheated, right?

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:36.410 align:middle line:84%
100% I used them as the template
of my first understanding,

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:37.920 align:middle line:90%
but I do continue to do this.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.360 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm a chronic
investigator at all times.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Always trying to look for
examples in my everyday life,

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:48.180 align:middle line:84%
regardless if I'm working with
children or with grandparents.

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:48.980 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm always trying to find as
much information as possible.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.730 align:middle line:90%
Insatiable.

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:54.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is amazing work.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: I appreciate
that, George.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do people get
addicted to their own emotions?

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.580 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well, when
it comes to addiction,

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.050 align:middle line:90%
that is such a great question.

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Out of all of the
different energies,

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:08.990 align:middle line:84%
George, that I can see, all
energy is very exogenous.

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:11.270 align:middle line:84%
All energy comes in
and you are affected

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:12.690 align:middle line:90%
by the energy around you.

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:15.109 align:middle line:84%
We don't necessarily
realize how much we are

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:16.730 align:middle line:90%
affected by energy around us.

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:19.890 align:middle line:84%
But energy has shape
and dimension to me.

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:23.060 align:middle line:84%
So for example, before
we talk about addictions,

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.770 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about
some of the energies

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:26.960 align:middle line:84%
that move around individuals
that tend to come in

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.490 align:middle line:90%
before addiction comes in.

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Because stress is
an actual energy.

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:33.740 align:middle line:90%
So is--sarcasm is an energy.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:34.800 align:middle line:90%
Depression is an energy.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:35.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Anger.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Anger, anxiety,
but also, so is love.

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
energies physically

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:43.800 align:middle line:84%
look like something when they
move into your energetic zone.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.610 align:middle line:84%
So if I were to be walking
around the streets of New York

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:48.063 align:middle line:90%
City and if I were--

00:17:48.063 --> 00:17:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you have.

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:50.150 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Right, and I have.

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:52.490 align:middle line:90%
I can be quite nosy sometimes.

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:54.860 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm walking around
the streets of New York City

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:57.020 align:middle line:84%
and if I choose to
tune in and just

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.790 align:middle line:84%
look at the
exogenous energy that

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:00.650 align:middle line:84%
is moving around
those individuals,

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:03.650 align:middle line:84%
I will be able to tell
how depressed someone is,

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.660 align:middle line:84%
how anxious someone
is, or how stressed out

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.712 align:middle line:84%
they are not because
of body language,

00:18:07.712 --> 00:18:10.170 align:middle line:84%
but because of the exogenous
energy around that individual.

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:10.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:12.770 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Now,
because those all look

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:14.630 align:middle line:84%
like something, their
shapes, their colors,

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.100 align:middle line:90%
and their densities.

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.692 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we were to
meet in a session

00:18:18.692 --> 00:18:20.150 align:middle line:84%
and if you were to
show up and if I

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:23.090 align:middle line:84%
were to tune in and to see how
much energy is moving around

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:25.340 align:middle line:84%
you way beyond
color, then I would

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.663 align:middle line:84%
be able to give you a
diagnostic of, well,

00:18:27.663 --> 00:18:30.080 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about some of these
emotions that are going on.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:34.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, addiction is one of the
most surreptitious energies

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:35.480 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And many of us have a little
bit of addiction energy

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:41.360 align:middle line:90%
without realizing it.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.210 align:middle line:90%
I tend--

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:43.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Isn't that normal?

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:44.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: It is a little normal.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.070 align:middle line:90%
More normal than you realize.

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:50.030 align:middle line:84%
I think that we have an
assumption that all addiction

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:53.990 align:middle line:84%
energy must be in connection
to narcotics or alcohol

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:55.710 align:middle line:90%
or maybe sex addiction and more.

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:57.840 align:middle line:90%
But it goes way beyond that.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And if I see even
the smallest thread

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:03.020 align:middle line:84%
of what that energy
looks like, then I

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.870 align:middle line:84%
start to help you
unwind what that is.

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And most people have
a small addiction

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:11.930 align:middle line:84%
to phones or to maybe
relationships that maybe aren't

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:15.290 align:middle line:84%
so good for them or to fix
someone else without kind

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:18.230 align:middle line:84%
of going inward or
certain kinds of emotions

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:20.330 align:middle line:84%
that they are prone to
feeling all the time.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:22.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are addictions
good or bad, Kimo?

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well, in terms
of what they look like,

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:26.360 align:middle line:90%
addictions drain the body.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.430 align:middle line:84%
Addictions not only
drain the adrenals,

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:32.490 align:middle line:84%
but addictions are draining all
of the endocrines at all times.

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And when I have
this conversation

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:39.050 align:middle line:84%
with psychologists, when I
studied psychology in college,

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:42.170 align:middle line:84%
we learned all these
things about, sometimes,

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:43.940 align:middle line:90%
it does drain serotonin.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And now, I feel like so many
psychologists are learning

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:50.180 align:middle line:84%
so much more than what
we were taught back

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:53.540 align:middle line:84%
in the '90s and the early 2000s
where we're learning, well,

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:56.270 align:middle line:84%
there is so much more going on
than just serotonin drainage.

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:59.690 align:middle line:84%
But when I take a look at
depression energy, George,

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.720 align:middle line:84%
and the addiction
energy, that energy

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.780 align:middle line:84%
does have a drainage of certain
kinds of things that are moving

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:08.330 align:middle line:84%
in, whether that's moving
through the hypothalamus,

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:10.490 align:middle line:84%
regardless if that's moving
through the neocortex,

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:12.330 align:middle line:90%
it is in a state of drainage.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:15.018 align:middle line:84%
So that helps me
identify how much of that

00:20:15.018 --> 00:20:16.310 align:middle line:90%
is going on inside of the body.

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.245 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is shadow energy?

00:20:18.245 --> 00:20:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Shadow-- oh,
what a great question.

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Shadow energy is
wildly misunderstood.

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:26.210 align:middle line:10%
I think that there are
so many individuals who

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:29.720 align:middle line:10%
have the ability to maybe
tune in a little bit

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.730 align:middle line:10%
and they'll catch a little
glimpse of shadow energy.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And they make the assumption
that, therefore, it

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:37.730 align:middle line:84%
is bad because we can't
understand what it is.

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And our wonderful
neurological brains

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:42.930 align:middle line:84%
are always trying to
help us figure out,

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:43.875 align:middle line:90%
well, what was that?

00:20:43.875 --> 00:20:45.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
that is, therefore, I

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:46.920 align:middle line:90%
should be doubtful of it.

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.850 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, I should be wary of
it, or even maybe even afraid

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:52.070 align:middle line:84%
of what I'm tuning into
or feeling around me

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:54.090 align:middle line:84%
because I can't
give it an answer.

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:56.570 align:middle line:84%
So shadow energy tends
to be one of those things

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:59.630 align:middle line:84%
that people either
energetically will pick up on,

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:01.880 align:middle line:84%
something is going on in
this room or this space,

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.550 align:middle line:84%
or they maybe even might
catch a glimpse of it.

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:07.190 align:middle line:84%
But shadow energy could
be a variety of things.

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:09.440 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that could
be you catching a glimpse

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.840 align:middle line:84%
of the density of how
energy moves around you.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:15.320 align:middle line:84%
It could be a glimpse of
maybe your spirit team.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.390 align:middle line:84%
It could be a glimpse of
some of the energetics

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:20.000 align:middle line:84%
around architecture,
which absolutely exists.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.780 align:middle line:84%
But we have a tendency to
prejudge that as something that

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:23.580 align:middle line:90%
is wrong.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:26.420 align:middle line:84%
So if I could say anything
to the collective who

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.910 align:middle line:84%
might be watching
this is to understand

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:31.250 align:middle line:84%
that there is so much more
out there that we just

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:32.550 align:middle line:90%
don't understand.

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And if we could realize
that our brains are

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:38.627 align:middle line:84%
wired to try to second guess all
the information that we don't

00:21:38.627 --> 00:21:40.460 align:middle line:84%
understand, then if we
use a little bit more

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:43.120 align:middle line:84%
critical thinking in
connection to spirituality,

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.870 align:middle line:84%
we would glean a lot
more information that

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:46.310 align:middle line:90%
is actually helpful for us.

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:48.653 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I picked up a
part of my spirit team.

00:21:48.653 --> 00:21:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I picked up on an
energetic of something

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:51.260 align:middle line:90%
trying to be helpful.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.285 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where does the
shadow energy come from?

00:21:53.285 --> 00:21:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: George, that
is a question that I

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:56.690 align:middle line:90%
wish I knew the answer to.

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:58.650 align:middle line:90%
I really, really do.

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:02.780 align:middle line:84%
I do my homework and I tune in
as much as possible a little

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:04.100 align:middle line:90%
bit every single day.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And when I try to tune into
the energetics of shadow work,

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:13.070 align:middle line:84%
it goes into a place that is so
wildly amorphous and confusing

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:15.440 align:middle line:84%
that I might sound a little
wild talking about it.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.900 align:middle line:84%
But there is always
energy out there

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.900 align:middle line:84%
that seems to have an imprint
or a blueprint of what

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:22.650 align:middle line:90%
its job might be.

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:25.640 align:middle line:84%
For example, the job
of depression energy

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:28.260 align:middle line:84%
is to do something very
specific to these bodies.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:32.510 align:middle line:84%
The job of shadow energy might
be to be a little confusing.

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps it's a
reminder to say, well,

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.280 align:middle line:84%
if you tuned in just
a little bit more,

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.600 align:middle line:90%
it wouldn't be so murky.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.250 align:middle line:84%
It would be a little
bit more clear.

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:43.050 align:middle line:84%
Moving with your
pineal gland and more.

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:45.320 align:middle line:84%
Moving through
your alphic system

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:48.230 align:middle line:84%
to understand that those things
that we are catching glimpses

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:50.960 align:middle line:84%
of, or seeing in the
background, could

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.570 align:middle line:84%
be helpful to us as
opposed to terrifying.

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:56.405 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you do
medical scans of people?

00:22:56.405 --> 00:22:58.220 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: I do
offer medical scans.

00:22:58.220 --> 00:22:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, there
are some doctors

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:03.800 align:middle line:84%
that are very, very open
to having conversations way

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.150 align:middle line:90%
outside of Western medicine.

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:06.860 align:middle line:84%
I've had actually
had a lot of doctors

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:09.620 align:middle line:84%
and surgeons approach me
about wanting to know more

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:10.670 align:middle line:90%
about Eastern medicine.

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:12.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't consider myself
to be a person who

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:14.250 align:middle line:90%
works with Eastern medicine.

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:17.030 align:middle line:90%
However, I do love that idea.

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:19.010 align:middle line:84%
That there are
individuals out there

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:20.460 align:middle line:90%
who are much more open to that.

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:23.300 align:middle line:84%
So if I were to do a
medical scan, George,

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.250 align:middle line:84%
I place the person
in front of me.

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, all of my sessions I
do are actually virtual.

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.550 align:middle line:84%
But I take a look at
them energetically

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:32.810 align:middle line:84%
and I tune into all the
things that I can see.

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And I go through the
whole entire system

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.070 align:middle line:84%
from the top of the
crown all the way down

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:38.360 align:middle line:90%
to the soles of their feet.

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And I just pay attention
to what seems off.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:43.830 align:middle line:84%
I've learned that certain
colors within the body--

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.500 align:middle line:84%
these are non-auric colors,
non-soul skin colors,

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.890 align:middle line:84%
all the colors in the
body that are a little bit

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.950 align:middle line:84%
off will have a very
specific output of where

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:53.330 align:middle line:90%
the emotion came from.

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:56.120 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, sometimes the energy
will compact a little bit.

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.220 align:middle line:84%
I've learned that
compact energy tends

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:01.260 align:middle line:84%
to be in more
connection to tumors,

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.410 align:middle line:84%
whether they're
benign or malignant.

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Maybe sometimes of cancers
that might be recently

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:10.610 align:middle line:84%
diagnosed or actually
haven't been diagnosed yet.

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:13.700 align:middle line:84%
I have seen some cancers
inside of the body months

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.110 align:middle line:90%
before they are picked up on.

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:17.420 align:middle line:84%
But that's just because
I'm going through the body

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.880 align:middle line:84%
to scan to see
what is in harmony.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.170 align:middle line:90%
What looks a little off.

00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:23.635 align:middle line:84%
Are there meridians that
are kind of overlapping

00:24:23.635 --> 00:24:26.135 align:middle line:84%
and crossing in a way that isn't
really helpful to the body?

00:24:26.135 --> 00:24:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
beginning to use dogs

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:31.490 align:middle line:90%
to sniff out cancer victims.

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:32.900 align:middle line:90%
Do you do that, too?

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:33.770 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Yeah.

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:35.585 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'll put a
little collar on you

00:24:35.585 --> 00:24:36.620 align:middle line:90%
and lead you away.

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:37.420 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:39.230 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: I would love that.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:41.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is something
that I'm able to do.

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:44.580 align:middle line:84%
But I am-- and I say this
from the very beginning.

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Though I have really
profound abilities,

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:48.860 align:middle line:84%
I truly believe that
I am not the doyen

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:52.160 align:middle line:84%
of everything metaphysical
and wonderful that I can see.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Many people have
these abilities.

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:56.500 align:middle line:84%
They are just untapped
and misunderstood.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And many of the times,
people will kind of

00:24:58.250 --> 00:24:59.390 align:middle line:90%
veer away from that.

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:02.960 align:middle line:84%
If I smell, for example, if
you were sitting in front of me

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.963 align:middle line:84%
and I'll tell you what
it smells like to me

00:25:04.963 --> 00:25:06.380 align:middle line:84%
if you were a
little sick, George.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is the way that
it resonates from my brain.

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:11.030 align:middle line:84%
This would not be the exact
way that it would resonate

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:12.410 align:middle line:90%
for everyone with this ability.

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:14.810 align:middle line:10%
But if I tuned into
my ability to smell,

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:18.680 align:middle line:10%
and if I smelt hot
pennies, hot pennies

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.840 align:middle line:10%
is the smell that I
pick up on if someone

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:21.980 align:middle line:10%
is going to have the flu.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:22.855 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hot pennies.

00:25:22.855 --> 00:25:23.990 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Hot pennies.

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.790 align:middle line:90%
And if I--

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:25.707 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mini pennies?

00:25:25.707 --> 00:25:26.720 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: What was that?

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:27.335 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Little pennies?

00:25:27.335 --> 00:25:28.910 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Little teeny pennies.

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:31.215 align:middle line:84%
And I've never smelt a hot
penny a day in my life.

00:25:31.215 --> 00:25:32.840 align:middle line:84%
But that's how my
brain registers that.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And how much hot
penny I will smell

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:37.460 align:middle line:84%
will tell me how
quickly you are going

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:40.280 align:middle line:84%
to catch the flu, which means
I can usually catch the flu

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.750 align:middle line:90%
about three days out.

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:46.130 align:middle line:10%
If someone has cancer, if
someone is experiencing cancer,

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:51.360 align:middle line:10%
either diagnosed or undiagnosed,
I smell warm nickel.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Weird.

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.505 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Isn't that so odd?

00:25:53.505 --> 00:25:54.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is weird.

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Those nickels
smell like someone

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:58.070 align:middle line:84%
has rubbed burnt
toast over them.

00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:00.920 align:middle line:84%
If someone is schizophrenic,
either diagnosed

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.170 align:middle line:84%
or undiagnosed, I always
smell burnt toast.

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And I have found, for
example, if a friend says,

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.850 align:middle line:84%
Kimo, I'm feeling a
little odd, a little sick,

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:09.927 align:middle line:84%
will you please tune
in briefly to see if I

00:26:09.927 --> 00:26:11.135 align:middle line:90%
have any of those sicknesses.

00:26:11.135 --> 00:26:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you do.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:12.800 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: And I do.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And if I catch that glimpse I
will say, please go get tested.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:16.440 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough,
that's what I find.

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Isn't that so wild?

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
teach yourself this?

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well, I had to
because I didn't know how

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.520 align:middle line:90%
to find out this information.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, and I love working
with mediums and psychics

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:29.540 align:middle line:90%
and intuitives.

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:32.960 align:middle line:84%
But I have found that I have
not been satiated by looking up

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.180 align:middle line:84%
any information either
in an online journal,

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:37.340 align:middle line:84%
medical journal, or
any kind of book.

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:39.560 align:middle line:84%
I have not been
completely satisfied

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.350 align:middle line:84%
with anyone's understanding
of the full spectrum

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:43.460 align:middle line:90%
of intuitions.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.840 align:middle line:90%
I haven't been satisfied yet.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.330 align:middle line:84%
So I am slowly writing
a book so I can

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:48.590 align:middle line:90%
help teach this information.

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:51.200 align:middle line:84%
But this ability
to smell would be

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.570 align:middle line:84%
one of your intuitive
abilities that many people

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:55.370 align:middle line:90%
can tune into, not just me.

00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:57.650 align:middle line:84%
We know that by
having conversations

00:26:57.650 --> 00:26:59.870 align:middle line:84%
with multiple individuals
with different abilities,

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:01.910 align:middle line:84%
psychic senses and
more, that we can

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:03.650 align:middle line:90%
tune into approximately four.

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:06.950 align:middle line:84%
I have also known that some
psychics and intuitives can

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:09.290 align:middle line:84%
tune into approximately
seven, depending

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:10.770 align:middle line:90%
on how developed they are.

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:13.940 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to this
ability, this is only one

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:17.090 align:middle line:84%
of 12 different senses
that I pick up on.

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:20.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, I say 12 because
this is going way outside

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:23.420 align:middle line:84%
of the top four, way outside
of the top seven or eight

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:27.320 align:middle line:84%
because all of these different
intuitions have a visual to me.

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.300 align:middle line:84%
They have a very
specific vibration.

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:31.040 align:middle line:84%
That vibration might
bring in color,

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.610 align:middle line:90%
it might bring in density.

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:35.300 align:middle line:84%
So if I was to be working
with someone who I can see

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:37.970 align:middle line:84%
has the vibration of being
able to smell energy,

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:40.275 align:middle line:84%
then I would focus and
capitalize on that for them.

00:27:40.275 --> 00:27:41.400 align:middle line:90%
Hey, let's talk about this.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you train
people to do what you do?

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:44.662 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: I believe that I can.

00:27:44.662 --> 00:27:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And I've been in practice for
a long time being able to tune

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:48.490 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:51.140 align:middle line:84%
I haven't been teaching in this
modality for my entire life.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.960 align:middle line:84%
I've been teaching workshops
since I was 16, but not

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.210 align:middle line:90%
the specifics of intuition.

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And I work with
all ages, George.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.262 align:middle line:84%
And I prefer to
work with all ages.

00:28:00.262 --> 00:28:02.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't want this to feel like
it's any kind of gatekeeping

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.100 align:middle line:84%
that you have to
be a certain age

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:05.780 align:middle line:84%
or you can't get
this information

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:06.830 align:middle line:90%
after a certain age.

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:08.240 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't exist.

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How emphatic
do you get, Kimo?

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well, it
depends on the individual.

00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And again, because
I'm always trying

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.780 align:middle line:84%
to read the energy of
the person and the room,

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:21.590 align:middle line:84%
I will cater my
speech and my energy

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:24.590 align:middle line:84%
to help that other
individual understand.

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:26.790 align:middle line:90%
So I'll give you an example.

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:30.260 align:middle line:84%
If I am going to see a
Broadway show in New York City,

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:32.450 align:middle line:84%
if I were to go
see a film, I know

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:34.820 align:middle line:84%
that five minutes before
the curtain goes up

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:37.340 align:middle line:84%
or five minutes before
the lights go down,

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:41.460 align:middle line:84%
my body will have all of these
intuitive feelings and senses

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:42.260 align:middle line:90%
happen.

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:43.885 align:middle line:84%
I feel things through
all of my clairs.

00:28:43.885 --> 00:28:45.885 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everything is
working on all cylinders.

00:28:45.885 --> 00:28:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Everything
becomes quite synesthetic.

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:51.690 align:middle line:84%
But I was quite confused about
this as I was growing up.

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:54.350 align:middle line:84%
But the example that I'll give
you-- one of the anecdotes

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:58.700 align:middle line:84%
is that when I am sitting in
these auditoriums or theaters

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.440 align:middle line:84%
or more, five
minutes before, I'll

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.945 align:middle line:84%
hear something
very, very specific.

00:29:01.945 --> 00:29:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And it happens
every single time.

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.195 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In your ear?

00:29:04.195 --> 00:29:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: In both of my ears.

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:07.072 align:middle line:84%
But it's not even
in the actual ear.

00:29:07.072 --> 00:29:08.780 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like in
the back of my head.

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:13.100 align:middle line:84%
But I will hear what I describe
as a really large tractor that

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.260 align:middle line:84%
rolls forward and
then always veers

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.310 align:middle line:90%
to my right for some reason.

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:18.480 align:middle line:90%
Now, what does that mean?

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have learned that,
for me, and the energetics

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:23.990 align:middle line:84%
that I tune into, that's
how my body understands

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:27.170 align:middle line:84%
a really large group
of people having

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:29.270 align:middle line:90%
the vibration of anticipation.

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And it will always
sound like that.

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:33.800 align:middle line:84%
So if I were to be having
a one-on-one conversation

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.510 align:middle line:84%
with someone or a
group of people,

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:38.090 align:middle line:84%
and if I were to hear
even the slightest

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:41.360 align:middle line:84%
amount of that vibration
that rolls in and veers

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.250 align:middle line:84%
to the left-- or
veers to the right,

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:45.530 align:middle line:84%
then I will know that
my body is receiving

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:48.140 align:middle line:84%
the message that this person
is feeling quite anxious.

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.060 align:middle line:84%
So then my job,
as a practitioner,

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:53.690 align:middle line:84%
is to quiet my voice,
change my body language,

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:55.820 align:middle line:84%
allow myself to enmesh
with your energy

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:58.425 align:middle line:84%
so that way we can find
more equilibrium so that way

00:29:58.425 --> 00:29:59.675 align:middle line:90%
I don't overwhelm your senses.

00:29:59.675 --> 00:30:02.667 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You do medical
intuitive work too, don't you?

00:30:02.667 --> 00:30:04.250 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: I do medical
intuitive work.

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:07.887 align:middle line:84%
And though I don't tell
a lot of individuals

00:30:07.887 --> 00:30:09.470 align:middle line:84%
I do a lot of medical
intuitive work--

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:10.970 align:middle line:84%
and I do that for a
very specific reason

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:12.360 align:middle line:90%
I'll go into in just a moment.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.720 align:middle line:84%
But I do the medical
intuition as a way

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.050 align:middle line:84%
to give that person
evidence and validations.

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Because I can see it usually
before it's even diagnosed.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Or even if it's recently
diagnosed, someone might say,

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:27.152 align:middle line:84%
well, we know that my
cells are misfiring

00:30:27.152 --> 00:30:28.610 align:middle line:84%
and all these things
are happening,

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:30.010 align:middle line:90%
but we don't know why.

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:32.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, for me, I like
to find out the why.

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And the why will
always be in connection

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:38.560 align:middle line:84%
to some kind of emotional
energy or environmental energy.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's just helpful for
the brain to release that.

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:43.440 align:middle line:90%
To understand what that is.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the
things that I do when

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:46.660 align:middle line:90%
it comes to medical intuitions.

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't usually tell individuals
right off the bat, let's tune

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:52.000 align:middle line:84%
into all the vibrations
around poor health.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Because what I learned when
I was a young intuitive

00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:57.970 align:middle line:84%
is that if I could
be Kimo and help

00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:00.730 align:middle line:84%
move that energy out-- because
I can move that energy out.

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:03.580 align:middle line:84%
I learned that that
energy will come back.

00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:06.790 align:middle line:84%
It comes back almost
instantly because you

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:10.870 align:middle line:84%
have muscle memory in
connection to those emotions

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:12.490 align:middle line:84%
or those feelings
that will start

00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:15.610 align:middle line:84%
to eventually calcify, become
malignant, and then start

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:17.480 align:middle line:84%
to create some kind
of malady or ailment.

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:20.260 align:middle line:84%
So what I prefer to
do now is to teach you

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:21.472 align:middle line:90%
how to move that energy out.

00:31:21.472 --> 00:31:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And let
me worry about it.

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:23.260 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:24.430 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Exactly.

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:28.340 align:middle line:84%
So that way you can be
consistent with those emotions.

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:30.010 align:middle line:84%
So that way, even
if you are going

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:32.800 align:middle line:84%
through some kind of radiation
or chemotherapy treatment,

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.620 align:middle line:84%
when it's passed, you will
have a stronger foundation

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:37.150 align:middle line:90%
of how to keep it out.

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not discounting any
kind of Western medicine.

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:41.060 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:44.560 align:middle line:84%
But I do think that if we can
allow ourselves to incorporate

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.650 align:middle line:84%
the idea of Western
medicine into larger

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:49.540 align:middle line:90%
conversations with intuition--

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:51.910 align:middle line:84%
intuitive design and
intuitive body and more

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:54.833 align:middle line:84%
that we can create much
stronger lasting effects.

00:31:54.833 --> 00:31:56.875 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kimo, what is
the highway of dimensions?

00:31:56.875 --> 00:31:57.675 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:31:57.675 --> 00:31:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: I love this
question, George.

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:02.830 align:middle line:84%
So highway of dimensions
is just Kimo terminology

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:04.900 align:middle line:84%
that I use to
describe what it looks

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.180 align:middle line:84%
like if I tune into all
the energetics of what's

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.230 align:middle line:90%
going on around you.

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:09.760 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
George, if you were

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.530 align:middle line:84%
to say tune into my
highway of dimensions,

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:12.947 align:middle line:84%
I would quickly
tune into how much

00:32:12.947 --> 00:32:14.380 align:middle line:90%
vibration is moving around.

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And then, we would create
a conversation based on,

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.310 align:middle line:84%
but now, what
information do I want?

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:19.870 align:middle line:84%
Do I want to know
about timelines,

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:23.080 align:middle line:84%
which would be just variations
of your imminent probabilities?

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:25.180 align:middle line:90%
Timelines all overlap for me.

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:29.290 align:middle line:84%
If you were to say, please help
me know more information about

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:30.790 align:middle line:84%
are there any
sicknesses in my body?

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Then, I look at
those other timelines

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.210 align:middle line:84%
and those other colors
that move around.

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:39.070 align:middle line:84%
But the world to me, when I
put on my magical Kimo goggles,

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:43.300 align:middle line:84%
the world to me looks like
a playground of emotions

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:47.080 align:middle line:84%
and frequencies and timelines
and colors and dimensions

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:49.720 align:middle line:84%
and vortices and
portals and more.

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:52.930 align:middle line:84%
It is an everlasting
playground for me.

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:56.135 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you see
people and their futures?

00:32:56.135 --> 00:32:58.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Well, I do.

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:03.030 align:middle line:84%
However, I don't believe that
there's one version of future.

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:04.020 align:middle line:90%
I really don't.

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:04.843 align:middle line:90%
What I believe--

00:33:04.843 --> 00:33:05.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Options, huh?

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Always options,
and those options

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:09.810 align:middle line:90%
are contingent on choice.

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, some of my most
favorite movies to watch

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:16.260 align:middle line:84%
are any movie that has to do
with an idea of a multiverse.

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Because you watch these
films and it's, here's

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:20.878 align:middle line:84%
one thought that could
lead to this timeline.

00:33:20.878 --> 00:33:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Here's another thought
that can lead us to that--

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To a
different timeline.

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Exactly.

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:25.632 align:middle line:84%
But that's what the
world looks like.

00:33:25.632 --> 00:33:27.990 align:middle line:84%
If you were to ask me,
Kimo, can you please help

00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:31.840 align:middle line:84%
me understand the timelines
that I have in my poor health.

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Then, I would quickly
silent my mind

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:36.360 align:middle line:84%
and see all the different
variations of all the timelines

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:37.890 align:middle line:84%
that are going on
with poor health.

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And then, what I
would focus on is,

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:41.550 align:middle line:90%
what is the most dominant one?

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:43.410 align:middle line:90%
What is the largest one?

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Because timelines do take
up a density, George.

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:48.930 align:middle line:84%
They actually take
up shape and form.

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Some of the smaller timelines
I'm not so concerned about.

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:53.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm more concerned
about the larger ones.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:56.700 align:middle line:84%
So then, we would focus in
on what that larger one is.

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:58.800 align:middle line:84%
We would try to
focus in on what is

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:01.080 align:middle line:84%
the seed, the genesis,
the root of what

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.180 align:middle line:84%
is starting that
imminent probability.

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And then, we would
start to eradicate it.

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:07.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kimo, do you
tap into spirit guides?

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:08.469 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: I do.

00:34:08.469 --> 00:34:11.219 align:middle line:84%
I tap into-- first of
all, I work with my own.

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:13.150 align:middle line:90%
And then, I work with yours.

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:14.040 align:middle line:90%
So when I--

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:14.624 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How many do we have?

00:34:14.624 --> 00:34:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Oh well, it
depends on the person.

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:20.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't recommend that we look
for any more than five or six.

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:23.730 align:middle line:84%
I've had some clients that have
said, oh, I have like 15,000.

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:25.782 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well,
that's too much.

00:34:25.782 --> 00:34:26.699 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Way too much.

00:34:26.699 --> 00:34:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: It's way too much
because every spirit guide

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:34.830 align:middle line:84%
or guide-- and to really quickly
differentiate that language.

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:36.900 align:middle line:84%
For me a spirit guide
would be someone who

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.719 align:middle line:90%
was in body who has had spent--

00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:40.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Had a life.

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:42.239 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Yeah, had a life.

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Had spent time on the
other side in spirit form

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:48.090 align:middle line:84%
to learn and to grow to come
in to be of assistance to you.

00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:51.060 align:middle line:84%
But guide energy, I would
not describe that way.

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:54.060 align:middle line:84%
Guide energy would be an
energy that was never in body

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:55.860 align:middle line:84%
and never will be
in body, right?

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And so those are
different forms.

00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:00.810 align:middle line:84%
But in communication with our
spirit guide and our guides,

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:03.490 align:middle line:84%
I have my team work
with your team.

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And if we could create
approximately five to six

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:10.660 align:middle line:84%
different guides that we are
aware of that we can work with,

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:13.770 align:middle line:84%
then you get to learn what every
one of their languages are.

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:16.590 align:middle line:84%
For example, when I work
with my own guide team, which

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:20.190 align:middle line:84%
is a combination of spirit guide
and a combination of guide,

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:22.230 align:middle line:84%
I have a very
specific spirit guide

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:24.570 align:middle line:84%
that I am in
communication with if I'm

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:27.720 align:middle line:84%
going to a new location
to tune into architecture.

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:30.007 align:middle line:84%
The architecture
around this place.

00:35:30.007 --> 00:35:31.590 align:middle line:84%
I have a different
spirit guide that I

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:35.520 align:middle line:84%
use if I'm trying to figure
out family genealogical stuff.

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.990 align:middle line:84%
I have another spirit guide
that I use if I'm looking for--

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:39.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Expertise everywhere.

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Exactly.

00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:43.050 align:middle line:84%
So if we can learn each
of their own languages,

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:44.790 align:middle line:84%
then we will have
better insight.

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:47.210 align:middle line:84%
George, everyone wants to
know who their team is.

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:48.210 align:middle line:90%
Everyone wants to know--

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:49.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is a
spirit guide, though?

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well, a spirit guide
is not what most people think.

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:54.570 align:middle line:84%
Most people think
that a spirit guide

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:56.580 align:middle line:84%
is spirit information
that comes in

00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:59.890 align:middle line:84%
to tell you, here's what to do,
here's how to do it, and more.

00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:01.920 align:middle line:84%
But that's not what
a spirit guide is.

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:05.070 align:middle line:84%
We want that to happen, but
they're not allowed to do that.

00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:07.440 align:middle line:84%
They're not allowed to come
in and reshape our lives.

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.400 align:middle line:90%
They can nudge.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.050 align:middle line:90%
They can offer insight.

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:12.360 align:middle line:84%
They can offer a
visual which might

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:16.710 align:middle line:84%
come in some sense of a psychic
vision or something like that.

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:18.480 align:middle line:90%
I call it psychic sign language.

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:21.810 align:middle line:84%
It's just a few visuals
or nudges or hunches.

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:23.318 align:middle line:84%
That's what they
are able to offer.

00:36:23.318 --> 00:36:25.860 align:middle line:84%
But they can't offer anything
else than that because it would

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:27.132 align:middle line:90%
be breaking our cosmic rules.

00:36:27.132 --> 00:36:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we have different
kinds of spirit guides?

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:30.190 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: We do.

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:32.550 align:middle line:84%
But I've also found that
it depends on the person.

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Because some people,
their spirit guide

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:36.180 align:middle line:90%
might come in an animal form.

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:39.960 align:middle line:84%
It might be a pet or
animals that they may

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:41.625 align:middle line:90%
have-- maybe leopard or snake.

00:36:41.625 --> 00:36:43.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Favorite dog that died.

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Or eagle.

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:44.460 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So spirit guide will
communicate to you in the way

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:49.110 align:middle line:90%
that you feel most connected.

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Some people it's being
outdoors with energy,

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:55.230 align:middle line:84%
with the nature energy, with
tree energy, with fae energy,

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:56.430 align:middle line:90%
with river energy.

00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:57.840 align:middle line:90%
For some people, it is animal.

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.420 align:middle line:90%
For some people, it's history.

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:03.180 align:middle line:84%
It might be old
oracles and more.

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:05.650 align:middle line:90%
It might be in the architecture.

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:08.520 align:middle line:84%
We know that there is memory
in stone and memory in bone.

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.170 align:middle line:84%
So it just depends
on the individual.

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was your
favorite acting part?

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:13.250 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well, as an actor
my strongest success was roles

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:19.620 align:middle line:84%
that I was being
given as a dancer.

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:21.820 align:middle line:84%
I was a dancer my
whole entire life.

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:24.300 align:middle line:84%
I was lucky to grow
up in the dance world.

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in my mid-forties now
and I only recently retired.

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:29.880 align:middle line:84%
But there's no way I
could tell you a favorite.

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:33.120 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you my
favorite experiences are based

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.610 align:middle line:84%
in moments that I have
with different casts--

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:37.380 align:middle line:84%
and I work as a
creative as well--

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.930 align:middle line:84%
if we can find a way
to be in communication

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:43.410 align:middle line:84%
to our super sensories and in
communication to our artistry.

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:46.238 align:middle line:84%
Those are my favorite
times to be working

00:37:46.238 --> 00:37:47.280 align:middle line:90%
as a creative individual.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind of
dancing did you do?

00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:49.800 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: I was very fortunate.

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.420 align:middle line:90%
I grew up dancing Polynesian.

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:53.560 align:middle line:84%
But then, as I was
in high school,

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:56.150 align:middle line:84%
I learned that I was a
very, very quick study

00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:57.260 align:middle line:90%
to classical dance.

00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:58.978 align:middle line:84%
So then, I went into
classical ballet.

00:37:58.978 --> 00:38:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And then, from there, I learned
that I was a very quick study

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.750 align:middle line:90%
into contemporary modern work.

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:06.170 align:middle line:84%
So my work as a
dancer allowed me

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:08.030 align:middle line:84%
to start to make those
kinds of connections

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:09.890 align:middle line:84%
and I traveled the
world as a dancer,

00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:12.360 align:middle line:84%
whether I was overseas or
working at different companies

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:13.160 align:middle line:90%
and more.

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You must
have been pretty good.

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:15.680 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Oh, I was very good.

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:16.480 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: However,
I do believe--

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:21.740 align:middle line:84%
and everyone who has met
me in my entire life,

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:23.690 align:middle line:84%
regardless if you
met me as a student

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:26.990 align:middle line:84%
or if you've met me as a
performer-- one of the things

00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:30.560 align:middle line:84%
that I hope everyone will
say is, well, that's Kimo.

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:31.520 align:middle line:90%
That's who Kimo is.

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:35.120 align:middle line:84%
Kimo was a connector, either
through intuitive thought

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:37.790 align:middle line:84%
or through teaching or
through performance and more.

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Because my desire is
always to be a connector.

00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And my soul skin color,
very different than yours,

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:47.690 align:middle line:84%
my soul skin color is always
a soul skin that will always

00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:49.280 align:middle line:90%
be in the connective zones.

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:52.070 align:middle line:84%
In no matter what life
expression I'm a part of.

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:53.620 align:middle line:84%
No matter where
am I in the world.

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:56.120 align:middle line:84%
No matter if I'm in this life
expression or a different life

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:58.290 align:middle line:84%
expression, it will
always be a connector.

00:38:58.290 --> 00:39:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And I come from a line
of connectors, actually.

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:02.900 align:middle line:90%
My grandmother was a connector.

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:04.798 align:middle line:84%
My father is an intuitive
connector as well.

00:39:04.798 --> 00:39:06.215 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
your next project?

00:39:06.215 --> 00:39:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well, I hope, George,
that my next project would

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:11.990 align:middle line:90%
to be sitting where you are.

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:14.720 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:17.270 align:middle line:84%
But my next project,
really, is to be

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:22.520 align:middle line:84%
able to take my whole pedagogy
of moving through the world

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:25.280 align:middle line:84%
with energy, understanding
of what's going on

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.870 align:middle line:90%
around us with no fear.

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:28.100 align:middle line:90%
With absolutely no fear.

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you have fear now?

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: I had
when I was a kid.

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:32.610 align:middle line:84%
I was a kid who
experienced a lot of fear.

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:33.568 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's normal.

00:39:33.568 --> 00:39:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Totally normal because
of the things that I could see.

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:39.650 align:middle line:84%
However, when I learned to
see the energy that I could

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:43.310 align:middle line:84%
see with my choice of seeing it
through light frequency, which

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:44.930 align:middle line:84%
is why I call
myself a lightseer,

00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:46.370 align:middle line:90%
that is always by choice.

00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:50.750 align:middle line:84%
I've learned that fear is always
a choice and fear is a muscle.

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:53.625 align:middle line:84%
So then, the thing that I
always explain to someone else

00:39:53.625 --> 00:39:56.000 align:middle line:84%
is, well, what muscle are you
going to choose to work out

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:56.800 align:middle line:90%
today?

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to work
out critical thinking

00:39:58.820 --> 00:39:59.625 align:middle line:90%
and intuition?

00:39:59.625 --> 00:40:01.250 align:middle line:84%
Or are you going to
work out that fear?

00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:03.090 align:middle line:90%
Because the fear will grow.

00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:03.890 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:05.870 align:middle line:90%
This ocean of emotion.

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:07.190 align:middle line:90%
It will grow if we feed it.

00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:08.810 align:middle line:90%
So I don't do that anymore.

00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Are there things
that startle me?

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:11.270 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:13.100 align:middle line:90%
Are there things that shock me?

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:14.450 align:middle line:90%
All the time.

00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:16.580 align:middle line:84%
But I don't experience
the fear element.

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:18.710 align:middle line:84%
So it makes me
insatiably curious.

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:21.050 align:middle line:84%
If I were to see spirit
energy move forward

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:24.290 align:middle line:84%
that looked quite terrifying
in terms of the way

00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:25.342 align:middle line:90%
that the body was found--

00:40:25.342 --> 00:40:26.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like devilish.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:27.890 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Well, not devilish.

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:29.713 align:middle line:90%
That is a whole other energy.

00:40:29.713 --> 00:40:31.130 align:middle line:84%
But if I were to
see spirit energy

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:34.250 align:middle line:84%
that maybe someone was
stabbed or shot in the body--

00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:35.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Left for dead.

00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Left for dead.

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, the body
does-- the spirit does

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:40.370 align:middle line:90%
come in that shape or form.

00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:43.400 align:middle line:84%
But I've learned that it
comes in in that shape or form

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.260 align:middle line:90%
for very specific reasons.

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Usually because there
is someone still living

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:50.990 align:middle line:84%
that only can visualize
them in that form as opposed

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:51.870 align:middle line:90%
to something else.

00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:53.345 align:middle line:84%
So then, I try to
work with the living.

00:40:53.345 --> 00:40:53.630 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
get ahold of you?

00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:58.170 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: People can get
ahold of me in many ways.

00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:02.360 align:middle line:10%
I have a social media presence
on Instagram, on TikTok,

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.490 align:middle line:10%
I do have my online business.

00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:07.020 align:middle line:10%
You can find me through
my website and more.

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:08.930 align:middle line:10%
But what I really
want to be able to do

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:12.980 align:middle line:10%
is to take this pedagogy
of ideas that I have

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:16.010 align:middle line:10%
and to travel and to have
much larger workshops.

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:18.740 align:middle line:84%
My workshops that I offer
tend to be quite small.

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And I started doing workshops
when I was 16 years old.

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:26.113 align:middle line:84%
But ranging from five
people to 35 people.

00:41:26.113 --> 00:41:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to do that
in a much larger aspect.

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:28.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hundreds.

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Hundreds.

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:31.715 align:middle line:84%
So that way we could
plant the seeds

00:41:31.715 --> 00:41:35.910 align:middle line:84%
and then sow those seeds from
one individual to another

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:38.720 align:middle line:84%
and start to understand
that the world around us

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:41.553 align:middle line:84%
does not have to be so
scary and terrifying.

00:41:41.553 --> 00:41:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's challenging,
George, because we

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:45.410 align:middle line:84%
have to work through
a lot of our ideology,

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:48.650 align:middle line:84%
whether that be dogmatic or
religious institutions, things

00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:49.883 align:middle line:90%
that we've been told.

00:41:49.883 --> 00:41:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And I was told all of
these things growing up.

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:53.660 align:middle line:84%
Be careful you don't do
this because you're going

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:55.040 align:middle line:90%
to bring in some kind of demon.

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:57.560 align:middle line:84%
But when we understand
that that energy is

00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.810 align:middle line:84%
only energy that
is misunderstood,

00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:02.030 align:middle line:84%
then we can
understand how to be--

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:03.630 align:middle line:84%
exactly, in better
connection to that.

00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:07.148 align:middle line:84%
So we can understand how we
can be autonomous and sovereign

00:42:07.148 --> 00:42:09.440 align:middle line:84%
and not necessarily affected
by all those other things.

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you play
with the Ouija board?

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:12.047 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: I haven't, actually.

00:42:12.047 --> 00:42:13.130 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not opposed to it.

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:16.130 align:middle line:84%
I think that growing up I was
very fearful of Ouija boards

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:17.090 align:middle line:90%
because of--

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:18.620 align:middle line:90%
everyone is told the same thing.

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:20.790 align:middle line:84%
Careful, you're going
to bring in something.

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:22.700 align:middle line:84%
But we bring in
something every time.

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:24.320 align:middle line:84%
We bring in something
through prayer.

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.360 align:middle line:84%
We bring in something
through meditation.

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:29.280 align:middle line:84%
You bring in something on
a nice long walk in nature.

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:32.480 align:middle line:84%
So the differences are
how do you understand how

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:34.010 align:middle line:90%
to move with your own clarity?

00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:36.530 align:middle line:84%
So those kinds of
things like Ouija boards

00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:38.660 align:middle line:84%
don't become
confusing, they just

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:40.520 align:middle line:90%
become a form of connection.
