GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.270 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

It's called the Institute
for Exoconsciousness.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.850 align:middle line:10%
It's headed up by a woman by
the name of Rebecca Hardcastle.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.990 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Do humans
have an innate ability

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.290 align:middle line:84%
to experience
extraterrestrial contact?

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.890 align:middle line:84%
That is the question that
motivated Rebecca Hardcastle

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Wright to found the Institute
for Exoconsciousness.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.870 align:middle line:84%
There, she and other researchers
study extraterrestrial origins,

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.490 align:middle line:84%
dimensions, and the ability
of human consciousness

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.520 align:middle line:90%
to connect with them.

NOORY: Rebecca,
you have the luxury

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.420 align:middle line:10%
of knowing someone who
has since passed on,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.760 align:middle line:10%
a dear friend of all of ours,
astronaut Edgar Mitchell.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.375 align:middle line:10%

REBECCA HARDCASTLE
WRIGHT: I did.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.070 align:middle line:10%
I worked for five years,
around five years,

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.200 align:middle line:10%
for Edgar's organization
called Quantrek.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.380 align:middle line:10%
Edgar founded the Institute
of Noetic Sciences,

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.710 align:middle line:10%
and then moved on from there
to go into Zero Point Energy

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.250 align:middle line:10%
research, which became
Quantrek organization.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And I worked with
Edgar and his team

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.219 align:middle line:90%
of international scientists.

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:34.760 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: We're going to talk a
lot about Edgar on this program,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.320 align:middle line:84%
but you had an experience
as a little girl that

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.450 align:middle line:90%
shaped your life.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.240 align:middle line:90%
What happened to you?

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.180 align:middle line:84%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: My earliest
memory is of three years old,

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.940 align:middle line:84%
of be taken to star
school to be on board,

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.260 align:middle line:84%
I guess, I would say
a craft at that point,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.500 align:middle line:90%
that I was in another dimension.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.270 align:middle line:84%
I was connecting
and communicating

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.760 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrials.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And I maintain that, most
of my early childhood,

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.510 align:middle line:84%
that went through
somewhat of a progression

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.790 align:middle line:84%
as I moved through growing
up and my acculturation.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.910 align:middle line:84%
I had I would call extra
dimensional experiences

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.440 align:middle line:84%
as an early childhood
ET experiencer.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And I would like
to say that there

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.110 align:middle line:84%
are many of us who came in as
early childhood experiencers.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.840 align:middle line:84%
But I also had what I call an
intra-dimensional experience

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.450 align:middle line:84%
as a child, where I was
literally below the ground.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.250 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: Really?

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.370 align:middle line:10%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: Yes.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.174 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: Like in a
hell type place?

00:02:37.174 --> 00:02:38.090 align:middle line:10%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: No.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.450 align:middle line:10%
Like in an Earth
dimension type place.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And I was there
quite frequently.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.177 align:middle line:84%
I lived in a small town called
Clarksburg, West Virginia.

00:02:49.177 --> 00:02:50.010 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Know it well.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.050 align:middle line:90%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: Gray Barker.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.260 align:middle line:90%
Men in Black.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.400 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: I get callers
from there all the time.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.050 align:middle line:10%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT:
I'm sure you do.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Full of mines, and
there's a little town

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.200 align:middle line:84%
there called Bridgeport,
with a golf course.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.140 align:middle line:84%
You can run your golf
cart on the golf course

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.860 align:middle line:84%
and hear the hollow
ground underneath.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.340 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: Then you're through the
whole city, just like that.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.360 align:middle line:10%
Well, with this experience, did
you share it with other people

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.460 align:middle line:10%
when you were younger?

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you did, what
was their reaction?

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.990 align:middle line:84%
There's something wrong with
our little girl, Rebecca?

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.440 align:middle line:84%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT:
I did share some.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.630 align:middle line:84%
But for me, my early experiences
I would label more organic.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.566 align:middle line:84%
They were just
part of who I was.

00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:30.150 align:middle line:90%
I was in the ground.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.430 align:middle line:90%
I was above the ground.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.290 align:middle line:90%
I was with my family.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.830 align:middle line:84%
I had literally a
multi-dimensional childhood.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:37.860 align:middle line:90%
It was free.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:38.720 align:middle line:90%
It was organic.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.420 align:middle line:90%
It was easy.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.920 align:middle line:84%
Actually, George, it was
only when I got married,

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.750 align:middle line:84%
had children, moved
into adulthood,

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.370 align:middle line:84%
became part of-- did
you know Ruth Hover?

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.170 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Yes.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.086 align:middle line:90%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: OK.

00:03:52.086 --> 00:03:56.370 align:middle line:84%
Ruth was my mentor, and I
attended her experiencer group

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.320 align:middle line:84%
in Fountain Hills
for many years.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.290 align:middle line:84%
During that part, I
really began to sort

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.760 align:middle line:84%
of dissect what was
happening to me,

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.480 align:middle line:84%
analyze it, look at it from
every possible perspective,

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.070 align:middle line:90%
talk to other experiencers.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I was comfortable,
sometimes was uncomfortable.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.279 align:middle line:84%
But the experiences
continued until today.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:22.400 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm back more to
the childhood, organic,

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.610 align:middle line:90%
easy flowing connection.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.100 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: What have you
concluded about what

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.427 align:middle line:84%
has happened to you in
this journey you're on?

00:04:30.427 --> 00:04:32.010 align:middle line:84%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT:
What I've concluded

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.630 align:middle line:84%
is I founded the Institute
for Exoconsciousness

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.750 align:middle line:84%
because I believe that every
human-- not some humans

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.780 align:middle line:84%
but every human-- has
the innate ability

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.990 align:middle line:84%
to connect and communicate with
extraterrestrials, that we have

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.850 align:middle line:84%
within our consciousness, I
would call it exoconsciousness,

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.820 align:middle line:84%
that we have that ability, that
consciousness beyond our brain,

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.940 align:middle line:84%
to move interdimensionally
as humans.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And some of us identify
different ET races,

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:08.460 align:middle line:90%
some of us don't.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Some of us just feel
that it's an experience.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.110 align:middle line:84%
They don't really have a label
for it, but that this is really

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.230 align:middle line:84%
an essence of one of the
things that makes us human.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.730 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Edgar Mitchell, Apollo
14, walked on the moon.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:24.980 align:middle line:90%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: Nine hours.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.870 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Had an incredible
views on the universe.

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.300 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that first.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.100 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.225 align:middle line:84%
EDGAR MITCHELL: But certainly,
life in the universe

00:05:33.225 --> 00:05:34.450 align:middle line:90%
seems to be ubiquitous.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.920 align:middle line:84%
The notion that we are
alone in the universe

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:42.470 align:middle line:84%
is clearly absurd, particularly
with the modern Hubble

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.090 align:middle line:90%
telescope pictures.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.430 align:middle line:84%
We start to see the
vastness of the universe

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.430 align:middle line:84%
and the vast galaxies and
galactic clusters filling

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.910 align:middle line:84%
all of space that we can
observe, far beyond anything

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.760 align:middle line:84%
we've imagined before
having those pictures.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And so it puts a new
impetus on the smallness

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.800 align:middle line:84%
of our little galaxy and
our little solar system,

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.310 align:middle line:84%
that it's just a
tiny, little speck

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.230 align:middle line:84%
of sand in the greatness
of all that's around us.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.446 align:middle line:90%


00:06:14.446 --> 00:06:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And the likelihood that
we're the only living

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.460 align:middle line:84%
substance in all of this
is absolutely absurd.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.360 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.110 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Rebecca, how right
he was about the universe.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And his trip to the
moon on Apollo 14

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.870 align:middle line:84%
really changed his
life too, where

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.100 align:middle line:84%
he started doing mind
experiments, the Noetic

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Institute he formed
when he came back.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get
into a lot of that,

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.840 align:middle line:84%
but he told me once
on Coast to Coast--

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.890 align:middle line:84%
and I'll never forget it--
when I asked him specifically

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:46.836 align:middle line:90%
about extraterrestrial life.

00:06:46.836 --> 00:06:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And I said, did you see
anything on the moon?

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:49.540 align:middle line:90%
Come on tell me.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.340 align:middle line:90%
Tell me.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.480 align:middle line:84%
Because we heard all these
stories about Apollo 11

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.690 align:middle line:84%
and Neil Armstrong
and Buzz Aldrin.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.630 align:middle line:10%
And he said, George, I'm
going to tell you two things.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.730 align:middle line:10%
One, I never saw
anything on the moon,

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.480 align:middle line:10%
and I would tell you if I did.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.380 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see anything unusual.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.570 align:middle line:10%
But I will tell you
this, I have been

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:11.820 align:middle line:10%
told by key members of
government and military

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.050 align:middle line:10%
that we're being visited,
that we've been visited,

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.180 align:middle line:10%
and I believe them, and
that's good enough for me.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And that was so
provocative to me,

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.390 align:middle line:84%
to be able to hear a
real astronaut, who

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:28.170 align:middle line:84%
walked on the moon,
actually tell you,

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.670 align:middle line:84%
I believe we have
extraterrestrials

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.190 align:middle line:84%
in this universe,
we're being visited,

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:34.920 align:middle line:90%
and I've been told that.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.840 align:middle line:90%
So I believe him.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:41.040 align:middle line:84%
I've always wondered, did these
people tell him the truth?

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.210 align:middle line:90%
I sure hope so.

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.549 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:07:43.549 --> 00:07:45.840 align:middle line:84%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: I think
for Edgar, it was the truth.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And working with
Edgar, I began to see

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.680 align:middle line:84%
how he approached the subject
of ufology, how he approached

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.910 align:middle line:90%
the subject of ETs.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.510 align:middle line:10%
It was always very measured.

00:07:58.510 --> 00:07:59.310 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: Deliberate.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:00.800 align:middle line:10%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: Deliberate.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.790 align:middle line:10%
Somewhat conservative,
I would say.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.790 align:middle line:84%
He never made any
startling claims.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:07.770 align:middle line:84%
Except he did make
startling claims.

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:08.655 align:middle line:10%
They were very--

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:10.780 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: Just by saying it,
it was a startling claim.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.071 align:middle line:10%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: By say
it, it was a startling claim.

00:08:13.071 --> 00:08:15.660 align:middle line:84%
But he never attached
any ornaments

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.320 align:middle line:90%
to it, any labels or--

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.684 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: And he didn't embellish.

00:08:19.684 --> 00:08:21.600 align:middle line:84%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: And
he didn't scare people.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:27.580 align:middle line:84%
So I think for Edgar, there was
something inside of him that

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.520 align:middle line:90%
resonated with this as truth.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.990 align:middle line:84%
When people spoke with
him, you know, he was very,

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.309 align:middle line:84%
very-- he went to
the Cape once a month

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:38.409 align:middle line:84%
for training throughout
his life, probably

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:40.240 align:middle line:90%
up until the end of his life.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:45.650 align:middle line:84%
So I think that was
what spoke with him.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.900 align:middle line:84%
The other piece for
me, personally, I

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:52.220 align:middle line:84%
would say, was the fact
that Edgar reached out

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:56.630 align:middle line:84%
to me, an ET experiencer,
a woman who had just

00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:01.240 align:middle line:84%
written a book on consciousness,
and brought me into his group.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.130 align:middle line:90%
To me, that spoke volumes.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:03.930 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Absolutely.

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:05.638 align:middle line:84%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: I
wasn't on a faculty.

00:09:05.638 --> 00:09:09.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I do teach, but
I wasn't on the faculty

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.210 align:middle line:84%
of a major university
in science,

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.580 align:middle line:90%
but I was a researcher.

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.390 align:middle line:10%
But I think for Edgar,
the thing for him

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:19.170 align:middle line:10%
was I was an experiencer.

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:21.610 align:middle line:10%
One of the things we did
with Quantrek, George,

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:28.910 align:middle line:10%
was Edgar, at the end Quantrek,
which has now been closed,

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:36.730 align:middle line:10%
when we began to integrate Zero
Point Energy, consciousness,

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:38.880 align:middle line:10%
and the extraterrestrial
presence.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.680 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: All three.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:40.888 align:middle line:90%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: All three.

00:09:40.888 --> 00:09:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And for a scientist
and an astronaut

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.296 align:middle line:84%
to go forward publicly
and talk about--

00:09:49.296 --> 00:09:50.670 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Oh, he
stuck now his neck.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.378 align:middle line:84%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: He
stuck his neck out.

00:09:52.378 --> 00:09:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And we at the time were working
with well-known scientists.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Bernie Haisch was doing
Zero Point Energy with us.

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:05.080 align:middle line:84%
People who were ET
experiencers were calling us

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:05.910 align:middle line:90%
with inventions.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:06.900 align:middle line:90%
It was so exciting.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually moving
that into my work now.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:10.450 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Good for you.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.820 align:middle line:10%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT:
But he began to see

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:18.350 align:middle line:10%
that this piece is foundational,
the extraterrestrial piece.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.810 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: When he wrote his
book, The Way of the Explorer,

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.290 align:middle line:84%
which was my first
association with him,

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:26.240 align:middle line:84%
when I was doing my local
radio show in St. Louis,

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.000 align:middle line:84%
I was the Nighthawk,
and I had him on.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.690 align:middle line:84%
We just hit it off, and we
stayed friends for a long time.

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.750 align:middle line:84%
Sat next to him for dinner
at one of Stephen Bassett's

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.627 align:middle line:90%
Washington DC events.

00:10:38.627 --> 00:10:39.460 align:middle line:90%
And we stayed close.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.500 align:middle line:84%
But he told me some
profound things

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.450 align:middle line:84%
about how that
journey to the moon

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:49.520 align:middle line:84%
changed his life, consciously
and subconsciously.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And he came back, formed
the Noetic Institute,

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.020 align:middle line:84%
really pushed it
and developed it.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.940 align:middle line:84%
He was a big believer
in consciousness.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And as we get into
this with you today,

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.440 align:middle line:84%
Rebecca, let's take one
more look at Edgar Mitchell.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.344 align:middle line:90%


00:11:04.344 --> 00:11:05.144 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:05.144 --> 00:11:08.240 align:middle line:84%
MITCHELL: The conclusions,
concerning consciousness,

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.350 align:middle line:90%
are still incomplete.

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:16.730 align:middle line:84%
But it's clearly rooted in
the quantum nature of things.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And for the last 80 years
in the 20th century,

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:24.000 align:middle line:84%
the physicists have insisted
that quantum mechanics only

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.050 align:middle line:90%
pertained to subatomic matter.

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And they continued to adhere
to the Cartesian dualism that

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.230 align:middle line:84%
said body, mind,
physicality, spirituality

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:38.322 align:middle line:84%
are different realms of
reality that don't interact.

00:11:38.322 --> 00:11:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out
to be dead wrong.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:45.550 align:middle line:84%
It's just not the case, that the
quantum entanglement phenomena

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:48.800 align:middle line:84%
causes effects at all
scale sizes of nature,

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.410 align:middle line:90%
not just the subatomic realm.

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.450 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:55.860 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: You know, and as
much as you and I miss him,

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.145 align:middle line:84%
he lives on video tape
forever, doesn't he?

00:11:58.145 --> 00:11:59.270 align:middle line:90%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: He does.

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I came
to deeply respect about Edgar

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:08.500 align:middle line:84%
was he not only stuck
his neck out, as you say,

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.590 align:middle line:84%
around the extraterrestrial
presence issue,

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.740 align:middle line:84%
he stuck his neck out
around quantum science.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:13.540 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Yes.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.970 align:middle line:84%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: When
I worked with Edgar,

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:18.620 align:middle line:84%
I had the opportunity to
work with many consciousness

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.860 align:middle line:84%
scientists in a way that I
had never believed possible.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.050 align:middle line:90%
I had written this book.

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:27.400 align:middle line:84%
I had gone into Stuart
Hameroff, Penrose.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.367 align:middle line:84%
I'd gone into all
these-- David Chalmers--

00:12:29.367 --> 00:12:31.450 align:middle line:84%
I'd gone in to all these
consciousness scientists.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:31.890 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: The giants.

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:32.500 align:middle line:90%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: Oh, yeah.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:33.600 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.170 align:middle line:10%
And with Edgar,
we were emailing.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:38.880 align:middle line:84%
I was on discussion
boards with them.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.280 align:middle line:90%
I was talking with him.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.730 align:middle line:90%
It was a steep learning curve.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:45.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just want
to be clear that there

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.290 align:middle line:84%
was a lot of humility
involved in that,

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:50.270 align:middle line:84%
because there was a lot of
science to learn in that.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:55.830 align:middle line:10%
What Edgar did was he was
trying to find the math in order

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:59.424 align:middle line:10%
to unite metaphysics
and science.

00:12:59.424 --> 00:13:00.340 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: He wanted that.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.807 align:middle line:10%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: He
wanted that so desperately.

00:13:02.807 --> 00:13:04.140 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: And he knew it was there.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.806 align:middle line:10%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT:
He knew it was there.

00:13:05.806 --> 00:13:08.170 align:middle line:10%
And one of the ways he found
it was a German scientist

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:09.047 align:middle line:10%
named Walter Schempp.

00:13:09.047 --> 00:13:10.380 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if you know of him.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.140 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: I don't know of him.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.150 align:middle line:84%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT:
Walter Schempp in 1992

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.930 align:middle line:84%
wrote the first paper on
the quantum hologram, which

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:19.100 align:middle line:84%
then became Edgar's work
in Quantrek on the quantum

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:23.920 align:middle line:84%
hologram, and Walter Schempp
was part of the team.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And it was as though-- it's kind
of like Hameroff and Penrose.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:29.720 align:middle line:84%
It's that beautiful,
you know, the science

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.650 align:middle line:90%
and the anesthesiologist.

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:35.900 align:middle line:84%
For Edgar it was the astronaut
and the mathematician,

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.787 align:middle line:84%
because Walter Schempp
was a mathematician.

00:13:38.787 --> 00:13:40.620 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Sounds like one
of the Three Stooges.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:40.920 align:middle line:90%
Schempp.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.260 align:middle line:10%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: Actually,
he was related to Kepler.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:43.680 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: Really?

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:44.638 align:middle line:10%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: Yes.

00:13:44.638 --> 00:13:45.514 align:middle line:10%
Fascinating.

00:13:45.514 --> 00:13:46.680 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: Geniuses of our time.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.150 align:middle line:10%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT:
Absolute genius.

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think this
gave Edgar a place

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.680 align:middle line:84%
to say, let's take
this information,

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.450 align:middle line:90%
and let's move it forward.

00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's see where we
can go with this.

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's see what the quantum
field-- and since then, George,

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:08.600 align:middle line:84%
I have come to have a
deep and abiding respect

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.620 align:middle line:90%
for consciousness scientists.

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.410 align:middle line:90%
It's not an easy path.

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:13.730 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: It's not.

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:15.930 align:middle line:10%
Subject to ridicule.

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:18.600 align:middle line:10%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: Subject to
so much academic and scientific

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.400 align:middle line:10%
ridicule.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.200 align:middle line:84%
I have dear friends
who I met through Edgar

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.420 align:middle line:90%
who are independent scientists.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And maybe worked for
a while with ions

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.840 align:middle line:84%
and then have moved
out on their own.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.090 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Why are they ridiculed?

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:32.520 align:middle line:84%
Because they
believe that there's

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:35.370 align:middle line:84%
something else in this
universe that science

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.630 align:middle line:90%
has yet been able to explain?

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:40.250 align:middle line:84%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT:
Science is a very

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:46.420 align:middle line:84%
conservative, deliberate,
metric-based topic,

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.170 align:middle line:90%
study, field.

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
adhere to that, and you

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.730 align:middle line:84%
begin to bring in
new information--

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:56.790 align:middle line:84%
so Newtonian science,
I would say, equated

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:58.410 align:middle line:90%
to a rather closed system.

00:14:58.410 --> 00:14:59.220 align:middle line:90%
This works.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.020 align:middle line:90%
We know it works.

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.000 align:middle line:90%
We can be engineers.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.050 align:middle line:90%
We can build bridges.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:05.400 align:middle line:84%
We can send rockets into
space with this science.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.710 align:middle line:90%
Why do we need this?

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:08.200 align:middle line:90%
Why do we need quantum?

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.400 align:middle line:84%
So I think for this generation
of quantum sciences,

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.440 align:middle line:84%
it's all about we have
to bring in the proof.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.750 align:middle line:90%
It's not unlike ufology.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.086 align:middle line:84%
UFOlogists are always
bringing-- this

00:15:19.086 --> 00:15:20.960 align:middle line:84%
is the piece I'm going
to bring to the table.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.220 align:middle line:90%
Will you please look at it?

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:23.887 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes they do,
sometimes they don't.

00:15:23.887 --> 00:15:25.053 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: Sometimes they don't.

00:15:25.053 --> 00:15:27.450 align:middle line:10%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: But the
universities as a whole

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:30.660 align:middle line:10%
have not been ready
to embrace that.

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:37.130 align:middle line:84%
I feel like there's so
many closed systems today

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:42.320 align:middle line:84%
that are collapsing,
that it's going

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.010 align:middle line:84%
to be an opening for
people in ufology,

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.490 align:middle line:84%
for people in consciousness,
scientists, for people

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:52.130 align:middle line:84%
in spirituality to say,
we have an open system.

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:54.400 align:middle line:84%
This is the information
that's coming to us.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm part of that movement.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.130 align:middle line:84%
My work in exoconsciousness
is part of that.

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:01.870 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Rebecca, tell me about
your work, exoconsciousness.

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:04.590 align:middle line:90%
Exactly what does that mean?

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:07.120 align:middle line:84%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT:
Exoconsciousness,

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.940 align:middle line:84%
if I can tell a little
story, came to me--

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:12.530 align:middle line:84%
I was a single mother
raising my children.

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:13.330 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Not easy.

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:14.040 align:middle line:90%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: Not easy.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.070 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Not easy.

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.280 align:middle line:84%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: And my
alarm went off one morning.

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.920 align:middle line:84%
I'd been studying
with Ruth Hover.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.790 align:middle line:84%
I'd been reading every
book I could read.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.180 align:middle line:84%
I've been gone in to
consciousness scientists.

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.945 align:middle line:84%
I was part of the
Phoenix Lights group.

00:16:24.945 --> 00:16:25.570 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: Were you?

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:26.226 align:middle line:10%
With Lynne Kitei?

00:16:26.226 --> 00:16:27.200 align:middle line:10%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT:
With Lynne Kitei.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:27.860 align:middle line:10%
All good friends.

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:28.893 align:middle line:10%
I did not see the craft.

00:16:28.893 --> 00:16:29.693 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: Ah!

00:16:29.693 --> 00:16:31.736 align:middle line:10%
How could you miss
a mile-long craft?

00:16:31.736 --> 00:16:32.610 align:middle line:10%
That's another story.

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:34.760 align:middle line:10%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT:
That's another story.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.560 align:middle line:10%
And so one morning,
my alarm went off.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.667 align:middle line:10%
And I was-- remember the
alarm, hit the alarm,

00:16:39.667 --> 00:16:41.000 align:middle line:10%
turning off the old clock radio?

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.130 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: I hate waking
up to an alarm.

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:42.800 align:middle line:10%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT:
Yeah, I love that.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.675 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: I like it when
your body wakes you up.

00:16:44.675 --> 00:16:46.660 align:middle line:10%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: I
know, and the music,

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:50.120 align:middle line:10%
and all the good sounds
coming from there.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And I remember distinctly,
I just fell back

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:58.350 align:middle line:84%
against my pillow and thought,
OK, I've got five minutes.

00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:59.660 align:middle line:90%
I've got lunches to pack.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.330 align:middle line:90%
I've got to get to work.

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:04.190 align:middle line:84%
I've got to get
my kids to school.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.779 align:middle line:90%
We've got to get this train.

00:17:05.779 --> 00:17:06.579 align:middle line:90%
I'm the locomotive.

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:08.337 align:middle line:90%
Got to get this train moving.

00:17:08.337 --> 00:17:10.170 align:middle line:10%
Hope all the wheels are
around this morning.

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:11.211 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: Get it going fast.

00:17:11.211 --> 00:17:12.970 align:middle line:10%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT:
It's going fast.

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And as I leaned back
against my pillow,

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:22.460 align:middle line:84%
this word came into
my mind, literally.

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.670 align:middle line:84%
If you've read the
Bible, "And the Word

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:27.170 align:middle line:84%
became flesh and
dwelt among us,"

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:28.890 align:middle line:90%
I had that kind of experience.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:29.690 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: An epiphany.

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:30.648 align:middle line:90%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: Yes.

00:17:30.648 --> 00:17:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And literally, a word,
exoconsciousness.

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And I knew from then
that that was the word

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:38.783 align:middle line:90%
that my work was to embody.

00:17:38.783 --> 00:17:39.790 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Fascinating.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:41.165 align:middle line:84%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT:
So I got busy,

00:17:41.165 --> 00:17:46.010 align:middle line:84%
and I started to think
about how do I define this?

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And so initially,
I defined it as

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:52.890 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrial--
underlined--

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:55.600 align:middle line:84%
origins, dimensions,
and abilities

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.580 align:middle line:90%
of human consciousness.

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.330 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: And then you
just combined it, huh?

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:00.080 align:middle line:84%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: And
I combined all that

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:05.330 align:middle line:84%
into an academic study, wrote
the book, began my research,

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:08.660 align:middle line:84%
actually began my research
with the book, in that way.

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And then as I began
to work with Quantrek,

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:14.970 align:middle line:90%
I moved to Washington DC.

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And in Washington
DC, I began to see

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:26.250 align:middle line:84%
that while my first definition
held a lot of academic weight,

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:28.690 align:middle line:84%
I needed to broaden
the definition,

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:32.060 align:middle line:84%
to reach out into where we were
today with ufology, because we

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:35.600 align:middle line:84%
were at a different place than
we were in 2000, for example,

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.974 align:middle line:90%
or '96 or whatever.

00:18:36.974 --> 00:18:39.140 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: And five years from
now we'll be even higher.

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:39.880 align:middle line:10%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: Absolutely.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:40.870 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: Or should be.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.370 align:middle line:10%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT:
So what I did was

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:44.960 align:middle line:10%
I founded the Institute
for Exoconsciousness,

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:50.740 align:middle line:10%
and I defined its mission
as bringing together

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:56.220 align:middle line:10%
ET experiencers and coming
forth with the information

00:18:56.220 --> 00:19:01.260 align:middle line:10%
that every human, every
human, has the innate ability

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.890 align:middle line:10%
to connect and communicate
with extraterrestrials.

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:07.440 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: So would you like
these ET contactees, when

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.940 align:middle line:84%
they get together--
would you like

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.700 align:middle line:84%
them to, when they
talk about this,

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:17.080 align:middle line:84%
do they express a similar thing
that has happened to them?

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:18.370 align:middle line:90%
Or are they all different?

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:21.320 align:middle line:90%


00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:25.210 align:middle line:84%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: Consciousness
is a lived experience.

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness equals
lived experience.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:30.590 align:middle line:84%
It's the meaning that
you make of your life.

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:36.540 align:middle line:84%
It's not a binary code that is
put into you, in other words.

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:38.986 align:middle line:10%
So when people do get
together as experiencers

00:19:38.986 --> 00:19:40.360 align:middle line:10%
and talk about
what has happened,

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:43.750 align:middle line:10%
there, for sure,
is some meeting.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.500 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: And they're
emotional, aren't they?

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.083 align:middle line:10%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT:
And it's emotional.

00:19:47.083 --> 00:19:50.850 align:middle line:10%
But it's also very individual.

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things I feel ufology

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:59.170 align:middle line:84%
is moving into at this point
is we've dissected for so long,

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:06.130 align:middle line:84%
we have analyzed and taken
apart experiencers for so long,

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:11.820 align:middle line:84%
we've analyzed craft studies for
so long, it's time now to say,

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:13.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm an ET experiencer.

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:14.754 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to do with it?

00:20:14.754 --> 00:20:16.420 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: We've got some
emails in for you.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:19.410 align:middle line:84%
James from the Bronx in
New York, "What can I

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:25.702 align:middle line:84%
do in my daily life to
become exoconscious?"

00:20:25.702 --> 00:20:27.160 align:middle line:84%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT:
Exoconsciousness

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.810 align:middle line:90%
is a lived experience.

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
it's something that

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.610 align:middle line:90%
unfolds in your life over time.

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:37.460 align:middle line:90%
It's not just an event.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:40.270 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us are being
triggered by events.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:42.440 align:middle line:84%
This event happened,
it's affecting me.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes with
exoconsciousness,

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:48.290 align:middle line:84%
you have a visitation, you
see an orb, you see a UFO,

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:49.970 align:middle line:84%
you see a movie,
you read a book.

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:51.440 align:middle line:90%
Those are events.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:54.170 align:middle line:84%
It's what happens
after that event, how

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:58.000 align:middle line:84%
that begins to integrate
into your identity.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.330 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I believe that
humans have an ET identity--

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:05.730 align:middle line:84%
and we can talk about that--
an ET identity that is flavored

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:08.640 align:middle line:90%
by what their personality is.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And so what we do is,
in exoconsciousness,

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:16.480 align:middle line:84%
is we begin to orient our
life around that event,

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.650 align:middle line:84%
around that happening, around
the meaning that experience

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:24.450 align:middle line:84%
brought to them, and
then begin to allow

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:30.260 align:middle line:84%
our psychic intelligence to
begin to move us in directions,

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:34.910 align:middle line:84%
bring opportunities to us,
give us food for thought,

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:38.220 align:middle line:84%
maybe downloads of information
that we haven't seen before.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.420 align:middle line:84%
We move into psychic
intelligence.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:45.750 align:middle line:84%
We move into living our life
via analogies, via symbolism.

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:51.210 align:middle line:84%
We begin to operate
at a level of life

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:55.030 align:middle line:84%
where we're not a brain,
we're not a machine--

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:56.730 align:middle line:84%
and I'm actually
writing my next book

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:59.330 align:middle line:84%
on the exoconscious human--
we're not a machine.

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:01.260 align:middle line:90%
We are an exoconscious human.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And as such, we live and
have our being and identity

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:11.730 align:middle line:84%
within a consciousness field
that communicates with us.

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:14.370 align:middle line:90%
And some of that is ET.

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:16.740 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Marla from
Los Angeles, she

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:20.910 align:middle line:84%
wants to contact the ET groups
through exoconsciousness.

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:22.700 align:middle line:90%
How does she do that?

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.830 align:middle line:90%
She wants to be a member.

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:30.040 align:middle line:84%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: I have people
who contact me with emails.

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:33.079 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they're
quite heart-rendering.

00:22:33.079 --> 00:22:35.370 align:middle line:84%
I sat in my backyard-- I'm
sure you've heard them, too.

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:37.140 align:middle line:84%
I sat in my backyard
for 10 years.

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:39.130 align:middle line:90%
They never show up.

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:40.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm so depressed.

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:46.020 align:middle line:10%
And all I can say at that point
is, work on your consciousness,

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:49.500 align:middle line:10%
work on your psychic
ability, find a group

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.011 align:middle line:10%
that you can relate to which
is part of the mission--

00:22:52.011 --> 00:22:53.510 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: Which is
part of what you do.

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:55.100 align:middle line:10%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: Which
is part of the Institute

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.190 align:middle line:10%
for Exoconsciousness.

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:57.500 align:middle line:90%
Find a group.

00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:00.960 align:middle line:84%
Learn the language,
because sometimes we're

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.450 align:middle line:84%
having an experience
but we've blocked it

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:05.640 align:middle line:84%
because we don't have the
language to talk about it.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.690 align:middle line:84%
We're creating
language right now.

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:10.290 align:middle line:84%
The Institute for
Exoconsciousness

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:11.560 align:middle line:90%
is creating language.

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.620 align:middle line:84%
ET experiencer groups
is creating language.

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Word is very important
because that's

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:21.760 align:middle line:84%
how we frame and give reality
to what's happening to us.

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.940 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Rebecca, what do
you think is happening?

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:25.590 align:middle line:84%
What's the bottom
line here, with that

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:28.820 align:middle line:84%
the ET contact, with the
tapping in of consciousness?

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.230 align:middle line:90%
What's happening to us?

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:33.460 align:middle line:90%


00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:34.990 align:middle line:84%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT:
I think it's not

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:40.270 align:middle line:84%
unlike what's happened to humans
at other points of their life.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:43.730 align:middle line:84%
I was just recently in the
Berkshires at a conference,

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:49.500 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't help but feel
like I was-- in Massachusetts,

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:52.550 align:middle line:84%
where Massachusetts and New
York meet-- that I was standing

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:57.180 align:middle line:84%
on a ground that had
been occupied by Quakers,

00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:01.040 align:middle line:84%
by Shakers, by-- Sufis
are there-- by-- the Great

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.710 align:middle line:90%
Awakening was there.

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:06.740 align:middle line:84%
There's always been this
force within human nature

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:10.050 align:middle line:84%
that has propelled
us into wanting

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:12.500 align:middle line:90%
to know who we are as humans.

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And that means moving out into
the field of consciousness.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.970 align:middle line:84%
For some people, it
means the Genome Project.

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:25.080 align:middle line:84%
For other people it means
technology implants.

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:28.070 align:middle line:84%
For ET experiencers,
it means moving out

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:29.900 align:middle line:84%
into that field
of consciousness.

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think within religion,
within different times,

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:37.190 align:middle line:84%
there's been almost
like tsunamis

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:38.550 align:middle line:90%
of awakening of people.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And we're in a
big one right now.

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.270 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: To someone who
does not tap into this,

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:47.830 align:middle line:84%
does not use consciousness
in their day to day living,

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:49.706 align:middle line:90%
are they missing something?

00:24:49.706 --> 00:24:52.610 align:middle line:10%
Is there some void
in their life?

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:56.760 align:middle line:10%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: I would say
every human uses consciousness.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.434 align:middle line:84%
Many people attribute their
consciousness to their brain.

00:24:59.434 --> 00:25:01.100 align:middle line:84%
You know, oh my golly,
I'm going to have

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Alzheimer's or whatever,
that my consciousness lives

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:08.610 align:middle line:90%
inside this bony structure.

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:11.220 align:middle line:84%
Exoconsciousness does
not believe that.

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:14.510 align:middle line:84%
Exoconsciousness is part of
the field of consciousness

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:17.850 align:middle line:84%
scientists that
says, oh my golly,

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:20.340 align:middle line:84%
you're missing 75% of
your brain and you're

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.400 align:middle line:90%
doing just fine as an adult?

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.395 align:middle line:90%
How'd that happen?

00:25:23.395 --> 00:25:24.520 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: How did that happen?

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.144 align:middle line:84%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT:
How did that happen?

00:25:26.144 --> 00:25:28.780 align:middle line:84%
Obviously,
consciousness is-- thank

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:32.890 align:middle line:84%
you Rupert-- a morphic
field, somewhere beyond,

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:36.680 align:middle line:84%
that our entire body
is participating in.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:42.130 align:middle line:10%
So I think for people who are
exoconscious, for people who

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:49.180 align:middle line:10%
are ET experiencers,
just having the courage

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:54.380 align:middle line:10%
and being willing to be in
community with other people who

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:57.050 align:middle line:10%
are having the courage
to step out and say,

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:59.945 align:middle line:10%
I've had these experiences,
that's how you go there.

00:25:59.945 --> 00:26:02.070 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: For people who want
to get a hold of you so,

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:05.294 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to answer 1,000
e-mails, how do they find you?

00:26:05.294 --> 00:26:06.960 align:middle line:10%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT:
Exoconsciousness.com.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:07.915 align:middle line:10%
I'm on Facebook.

00:26:07.915 --> 00:26:09.040 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: And here's the book.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.831 align:middle line:84%

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:15.560 align:middle line:10%
Rebecca, I'm so glad
you had that opportunity

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.700 align:middle line:10%
to know Edgar Mitchell.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.720 align:middle line:10%
He was definitely one of a kind.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.510 align:middle line:10%
And some of the things that
he has imparted to you,

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:23.912 align:middle line:10%
you share with us.

00:26:23.912 --> 00:26:24.870 align:middle line:10%
And thank you for that.

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:25.440 align:middle line:10%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT: Thank you.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.770 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: Thanks for
being on the program.

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:27.720 align:middle line:10%
HARDCASTLE WRIGHT:
Thanks you for having me.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.980 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: Consciousness,
a powerful tool

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.860 align:middle line:10%
that you should use
every day of your life.

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:36.100 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thank
you for watching Beyond Belief.
