>> GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.470 align:middle line:10%
What a program we have for you.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.980 align:middle line:10%
Bill McKenna, the author
of The Only Lesson

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.660 align:middle line:10%
and the founder of the
Cognomovement system

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.130 align:middle line:10%
is back with us again.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.100 align:middle line:84%
We had such a response when
he was last on with me.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.930 align:middle line:90%
We brought him back for you.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And in our last episode
with Bill McKenna,

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.540 align:middle line:84%
we explored the telepathy
of autistic children,

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.850 align:middle line:84%
a topic now gaining
mainstream attention.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.110 align:middle line:84%
For years parents
and practitioners

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.140 align:middle line:84%
have observed these abilities,
but they feared speaking out.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Some professionals even
face losing their licenses

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.260 align:middle line:90%
for even discussing it.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, before we get started,
let's take a look at this.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Liz Larsen, Bill's
business partner,

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.890 align:middle line:84%
is going to be reading a message
from a non-verbal autistic child

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.460 align:middle line:90%
addressed to our viewers.

- 17-year-old Lynn, a
non-speaking autistic girl,

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.540 align:middle line:10%
and her mom--
incorporates Cognomovement

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.590 align:middle line:10%
into their routine.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.700 align:middle line:10%
Lynn was invited to share
a message with the Gaia

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.420 align:middle line:10%
audience and the world.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.460 align:middle line:10%
Here is the message that Lynn
wanted us to share with you.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.790 align:middle line:10%
"Remember, love
has no boundaries.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.620 align:middle line:10%
Look inside at my world.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.510 align:middle line:10%
The physical world is not
something that's kind to me.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.960 align:middle line:10%
It's something that
hurts all of the time.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.680 align:middle line:10%
It has sharp edges and
it's always changing

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.410 align:middle line:10%
and I can never get my footing.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.540 align:middle line:10%
The other world is
soft and flowing

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.320 align:middle line:10%
and is where beauty lives.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.050 align:middle line:10%
I'm here for all of us.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.140 align:middle line:10%
And I'm here so
that you can learn

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.410 align:middle line:10%
the ways of softness and love.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.450 align:middle line:10%
You want to pull
me into this world

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.230 align:middle line:10%
where I'm not compatible with
your rules and boxes of how

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.630 align:middle line:10%
people should be.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.500 align:middle line:10%
Love is how we should be.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.360 align:middle line:10%
This is what love
is always flowing.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.630 align:middle line:10%
Love moves between us, not
belonging to one person.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.960 align:middle line:10%
This love is my language.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:30.020 align:middle line:10%
I might be hard in my
body, but I know love.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.230 align:middle line:10%
When we use telepathy,
we are all one--

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.860 align:middle line:10%
one voice.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.570 align:middle line:10%
Please get it."

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.900 align:middle line:10%
When her mom asked if I
could share this message,

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.320 align:middle line:10%
she responded, "We
need love, so yes."

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.780 align:middle line:10%
A message that she gave
directly to her mom for us,

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.030 align:middle line:10%
but could be directed to all
of us hearing these words are,

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.040 align:middle line:10%
"Please lead us in love."

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.900 align:middle line:90%

>> NOORY: What a powerful letter
from an autistic child, Bill.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.890 align:middle line:10%
>> BILL MCKENNA: Yeah, and the
interesting thing is that with

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.960 align:middle line:10%
her abilities, they knew,
she knew about the platform

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.100 align:middle line:10%
and the ability to get the
message out there to the world.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.800 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Do most autistic
people, children especially,

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.350 align:middle line:10%
have these kinds of
feelings within themselves?

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.230 align:middle line:10%
>> MCKENNA: They do.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.860 align:middle line:10%
They're-- the ones
that are nonverbal,

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.930 align:middle line:10%
have pretty much the
most perfect disguise.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.630 align:middle line:84%
They don't have control
over their body.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And with that, people think
that they are not there.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.700 align:middle line:84%
They feel like there's
nothing going on.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.380 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Are they savants?

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.270 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: Many of them are
savants and they know about,

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:00.170 align:middle line:84%
say, other languages like a
two-year-old knowing Hindi,

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Aramaic and having abilities
that they have no business

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.000 align:middle line:90%
knowing.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.570 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Where did
they learn it from?

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:09.710 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKENNA: They learn it.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Actually, interestingly
enough, when

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.710 align:middle line:84%
they are out of their
bodies and they're

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.860 align:middle line:90%
out there on the astral plane--

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:18.660 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, boy.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.890 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And they pick up all that
information, other languages,

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.770 align:middle line:84%
you name it-- that
they never knew before?

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: Yeah, their
abilities to write poetry

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.340 align:middle line:90%
in other languages.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.340 align:middle line:90%
So many things.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.360 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why are so many
autistic kids dismissed as being

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.210 align:middle line:90%
"something's wrong"?

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.150 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: It's because
they don't have control

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.300 align:middle line:90%
of their body.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.490 align:middle line:84%
The non-verbal
autistic kids that

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.060 align:middle line:84%
don't have control
over their body,

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.610 align:middle line:84%
they appear as if
they can't understand.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.600 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is that
their understanding is well

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.640 align:middle line:90%
beyond ours.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.310 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are they
telepathic as well?

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.760 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKENNA: They are.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Especially, the ones, very
specifically those non-speaking

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.830 align:middle line:84%
or non-verbal, they are
telepathic, and all of it

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.470 align:middle line:84%
has recently come out
into the mainstream.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And with that, the understanding
that all along they've

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.920 align:middle line:84%
been able to know,
not only what's

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.440 align:middle line:84%
going on with their mom and dad,
but everyone else around them.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Where does
this gift come from?

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: This gift primarily
comes because they are actually

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.410 align:middle line:90%
out of their bodies.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:46.980 align:middle line:90%
They're out of their body.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And just like others that have
had near-death experiences

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.600 align:middle line:90%
or psychedelic experiences.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.710 align:middle line:84%
When you're out of your
body, as soon as you get out

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.840 align:middle line:84%
of your body, you
have the ability

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.190 align:middle line:84%
to know what's going
on with the doctor.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.810 align:middle line:84%
How is he feeling, what's
going on in the waiting room,

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.380 align:middle line:84%
and what are the people
thinking and feeling there.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The medical
community, however,

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.450 align:middle line:84%
doesn't grasp this
at all, do they?

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: Well, it's
beyond not grasping it.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.910 align:middle line:90%
It is actually suppressed.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:27.180 align:middle line:84%
If you are a medical doctor or
somebody who holds a license,

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.710 align:middle line:84%
you could find yourself
with your ticket punched,

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.412 align:middle line:90%
and they actually have done it.

00:06:33.412 --> 00:06:34.620 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's interesting.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, telepathy is rooted in
the nervous system, isn't it?

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: It is rooted
in the nervous system.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.520 align:middle line:90%
So we interpret all--

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.350 align:middle line:84%
everything through
our nervous system.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Our vision, our hearing,
our smell, touch, taste--

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.600 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Empathy, everything.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: Everything comes
through your nervous system.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:07:00.090 align:middle line:84%
The nervous system is how
we transmit and we receive.

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:05.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, the communication is
really a quantum communication

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.780 align:middle line:90%
in telepathy.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.690 align:middle line:84%
We don't even have
the instruments

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:13.770 align:middle line:84%
to measure the actual packet
of information that goes.

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.320 align:middle line:84%
But we know that it's
actually happening.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Bill, you brought us
a graphic showing us how two

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.770 align:middle line:84%
people's nervous systems
react and interact.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.100 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at this.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: So as you can see,
there's a field that surrounds

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.282 align:middle line:90%
everyone.

00:07:31.282 --> 00:07:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's like an aura--

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: Kind
of like an aura.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:39.800 align:middle line:10%
And with it, there's information
within that field and there's

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:46.080 align:middle line:10%
information that is transmitted
in between the two parties,

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.810 align:middle line:10%
even though we
might not know it--

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:51.100 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Or even say it.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.460 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKENNA: Or say it.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.580 align:middle line:84%
There's actually
this communication

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.240 align:middle line:90%
going on constantly.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do you have to be
autistic in order to grasp this?

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:02.180 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: You
don't have to be.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.750 align:middle line:90%
And everybody has it.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.330 align:middle line:84%
You're constantly
in a state where

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.330 align:middle line:84%
when you go into the grocery
store or anywhere else,

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:15.440 align:middle line:84%
you know who the person that
has a problem or a bad feeling.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.300 align:middle line:84%
So many of us have had the
experience, where somebody calls

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.800 align:middle line:84%
and before we even see the
phone and turn it over,

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.910 align:middle line:90%
you know who it is.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What about that
special connection between

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.540 align:middle line:90%
parents and the child?

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: There is a
special connection in between

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:37.789 align:middle line:84%
the parents and child
because it is biological.

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:42.130 align:middle line:84%
There's-- with a mother,
especially because the mother

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:45.320 align:middle line:90%
holds the baby in the womb.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
when they separate,

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:55.720 align:middle line:84%
they still share so much
biologically and energetically.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:00.470 align:middle line:84%
This is really a
quantum entanglement.

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And if we make a
change in one, we

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.540 align:middle line:84%
know from this quantum
entanglement spooky

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:12.220 align:middle line:84%
action at a distance, it
actually affects the other.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Explain quantum
entanglement for us, Bill.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:20.050 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: So let's say a
particle has been connected

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:21.290 align:middle line:90%
at one point.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.370 align:middle line:84%
If you separate that
particle into two

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:27.760 align:middle line:84%
and you could separate it
as far as the United States,

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.530 align:middle line:84%
one could be on the
East Coast and one

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:30.740 align:middle line:90%
could be on the West Coast.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:31.540 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:35.702 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: Einstein calls it
spooky action at a distance.

00:09:35.702 --> 00:09:40.780 align:middle line:84%
When we would manipulate
one on this Coast,

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.430 align:middle line:84%
instantaneously on
the other Coast,

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.815 align:middle line:90%
the other one reacts the same.

00:09:45.815 --> 00:09:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is that how autistic
kids communicate with each

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:50.290 align:middle line:90%
other?

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: There is a
basic oneness that is,

00:09:54.700 --> 00:10:00.140 align:middle line:84%
they are feeling
and experiencing,

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:04.780 align:middle line:84%
and with this they are
experiencing instantaneous

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:05.960 align:middle line:90%
communication.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I have a friend of
mine in Saint Louis whose child

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:10.130 align:middle line:90%
is autistic.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:15.800 align:middle line:84%
When he told us about this years
ago, we thought, oh my God,

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.940 align:middle line:90%
how tragic, how sad.

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.640 align:middle line:90%
Now, this kid is growing up.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell you, Bill,
he's almost like a genius.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.230 align:middle line:84%
He still has a little
bit of problems

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:30.590 align:middle line:84%
dealing with other kids, but I
mean, he seems to be intuitive.

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:33.920 align:middle line:90%
He knows things, and he's on it.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: Yeah,
well, he's not alone.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:42.260 align:middle line:84%
The abilities are off the
charts with these kids.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.910 align:middle line:84%
Some of them can actually
just put their hand on a book

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:47.540 align:middle line:90%
and summarize it.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:48.400 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Wow.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: Instantly knowing
everything that's there.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:58.820 align:middle line:84%
They can do things that
really have been just legend.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Like, the ability to see into
the future, into the past.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.320 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Do they get emotional?

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKENNA: They certainly do.

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:14.860 align:middle line:84%
But it's really
not what we think.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:18.350 align:middle line:90%
They have really a duality.

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:20.710 align:middle line:84%
Part of them is
out of their body

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:24.410 align:middle line:84%
in this state of
love, joy and bliss.

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And the other part, a much
more minor part of them

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:32.830 align:middle line:84%
is in their body and
doesn't have necessarily

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:35.450 align:middle line:90%
control over their body.

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:38.080 align:middle line:84%
So they may do
things that appear

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:43.630 align:middle line:90%
as violent or some aggression.

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:46.640 align:middle line:90%
But in fact, they don't mean it.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.775 align:middle line:84%
It's as if their body
is moving on its own.

00:11:49.775 --> 00:11:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Bill, are
they put in school,

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:57.880 align:middle line:84%
class with other kids or are
they put in separate places?

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.610 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: It depends
upon the severity.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:03.140 align:middle line:84%
The ones that we're
talking about,

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:09.550 align:middle line:84%
non-verbal kids that are
severe, they're typically,

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:14.200 align:middle line:84%
either homeschooled or they're
put into special schools

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.500 align:middle line:90%
where they're all together.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They can't interact
with kids who are not autistic.

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: Yeah, it's very
difficult. Very difficult.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:23.260 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Why is that?

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: Because they don't--
they lack the control over

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.860 align:middle line:90%
their bodies.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:37.600 align:middle line:84%
They are seen as maybe
they can't understand,

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.210 align:middle line:90%
but it's not really true.

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:43.670 align:middle line:84%
They understand way
better than everyone else.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:46.390 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If you tell an
autistic child I'm thinking

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:49.960 align:middle line:90%
of a number, can they guess it?

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: So very specifically
non-verbal autistic children,

00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:02.650 align:middle line:84%
what they've figured out is
that they can communicate with

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:03.980 align:middle line:90%
spelling.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.670 align:middle line:84%
So they'll set up a
little card and they will

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:09.590 align:middle line:90%
type to spell something out.

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:10.880 align:middle line:90%
It's very difficult.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.600 align:middle line:84%
You imagine trying to
type when you don't

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.010 align:middle line:90%
have very control of your body.

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:19.570 align:middle line:84%
You type something,
whatever you want

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:24.980 align:middle line:84%
to say on either a computer
or this little plastic sheet.

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And we've discovered
that they actually are

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:32.720 align:middle line:90%
communicating with this way.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.280 align:middle line:84%
It's very specifically
this enabled people

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:41.450 align:middle line:84%
to start asking questions like,
hey, what number am I thinking?

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And with it, they were able
to actually type the number.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.960 align:middle line:90%
Like, I'm 5, 6, 7--

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.300 align:middle line:90%
5, 6, 7.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:50.470 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Accurately?

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKENNA: 100% accurate.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:52.630 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Amazing.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.110 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKENNA: In many cases.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Most of them are over
95% to 100% accurate,

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:02.630 align:middle line:84%
which is absolutely
statistically unheard of.

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: During 9/11, Bill,
we saw random generators go out

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.300 align:middle line:90%
of sight.

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.880 align:middle line:84%
They just recorded
things that people

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.470 align:middle line:90%
were thinking and assuming.

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:15.190 align:middle line:84%
Does that work with
autistic kids too?

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:19.570 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: Well, the way that
random number generators are

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:26.240 align:middle line:84%
utilized with these
nonverbal kids is to test.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.810 align:middle line:84%
So they'll set up a
random number generator

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:32.840 align:middle line:84%
and they will hit to
get a random number.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.250 align:middle line:90%
They'll get the random number.

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And the mother will look
at the random number

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:39.450 align:middle line:84%
and then the kid
will type it out.

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And they can do this
time and time and time

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:46.220 align:middle line:84%
again, which the
ability to do that is

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.300 align:middle line:90%
like quadrillions to one.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.600 align:middle line:84%
They utilize, not only
random number generators,

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.020 align:middle line:84%
but they'll pick any
random book, open it up.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.110 align:middle line:84%
The mother will
start to read, not

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.130 align:middle line:84%
reading out loud,
but just reading,

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.010 align:middle line:84%
and the child would be able to
type whatever they're reading.

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How does that happen?

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:06.530 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: They are
actually fully connected

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:08.780 align:middle line:84%
because they're
out of their body.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.680 align:middle line:90%
They are everywhere.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.950 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do they know
they're out of their body?

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: They don't really
know that they have a body,

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:18.560 align:middle line:90%
oftentimes.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.430 align:middle line:90%
They can't feel it.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They cry.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.530 align:middle line:90%
They show emotion.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.860 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKENNA: Yes, but to--

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:29.660 align:middle line:84%
for many of them, when they
actually first come in and start

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:34.080 align:middle line:84%
to feel their body, it's
like, oh my gosh, I have arms,

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.180 align:middle line:90%
I have fingers.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.090 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
was very interesting

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:40.600 align:middle line:84%
on the last interview we
did when we discussed that--

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Liz Larsen and the
square technique,

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:49.480 align:middle line:84%
which helped them to come
into their body for the very

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.340 align:middle line:90%
first time and feel it.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When an autistic
child becomes an adult,

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:58.390 align:middle line:84%
can they have a
relationship with people?

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.550 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKENNA: Many of them do.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:02.660 align:middle line:90%
And again, it's a spectrum.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.540 align:middle line:84%
But the very
specific group we're

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:08.260 align:middle line:84%
talking about that really
seems to have the telepathy

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.630 align:middle line:90%
is the nonverbal ones.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:17.215 align:middle line:84%
But there's many cases where
they've actually had romances

00:16:17.215 --> 00:16:23.440 align:middle line:84%
and even though they might not
physically interact very much,

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.935 align:middle line:90%
they're very much in love.

00:16:24.935 --> 00:16:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They're loving
people, aren't they?

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: Very
much, very much so.

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people because
they can feel everything

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:37.460 align:middle line:84%
that everyone else can and all
the judgment, a lot of times

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.300 align:middle line:90%
it gets clouded over.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:43.560 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What is the mythical
hill that we hear so much about?

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: So the
hill is so interesting.

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:52.040 align:middle line:84%
It turns out because all these
kids, they leave their body

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.560 align:middle line:90%
and they are all communicating.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.530 align:middle line:84%
In the last episode,
we had talked

00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:01.250 align:middle line:84%
about, we asked a
question, hey, why

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:03.980 align:middle line:84%
are you two, that are
spelling, why don't you

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.569 align:middle line:90%
just spell to each other?

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And the comment
came back, well, we

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.900 align:middle line:84%
don't need to because we
already know what they're doing

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.680 align:middle line:84%
and we know everything that
they're thinking and feeling.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out that
it's well beyond that.

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:24.359 align:middle line:84%
They go to what
they call the hill.

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:26.720 align:middle line:84%
It's not a physical
location, but it's a place

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:30.060 align:middle line:84%
that they gather and
there's so many of them.

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.200 align:middle line:84%
The energy is so
thick that it kind of

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.070 align:middle line:90%
resembles a hill to them.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:37.880 align:middle line:84%
This place is a place
where they experience joy,

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.070 align:middle line:90%
they experience laughter.

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:41.570 align:middle line:90%
They experience love.

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:45.110 align:middle line:84%
They exchange ideas
with each other.

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:46.760 align:middle line:90%
They educate each other.

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:51.010 align:middle line:84%
So when you say, well,
how did this kid know

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:53.060 align:middle line:90%
about astrophysics?

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, somebody over there
had already educated him.

00:17:56.390 --> 00:18:00.580 align:middle line:84%
They become friends
across the globe.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.460 align:middle line:90%
They establish relationships--

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:04.970 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Out of their body.

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:06.970 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKENNA: Out of their body.

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do they ever establish
a relationship in the physical

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.230 align:middle line:90%
body?

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: Yes, and the
interesting thing is that even

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:18.980 align:middle line:84%
though the parents are
in different states,

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:22.130 align:middle line:84%
like one kid in
Georgia will say, oh,

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:26.860 align:middle line:84%
my friend Mikey and-- in Ohio
and the other guy in Ohio will

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:32.730 align:middle line:84%
say, oh, my best friend Billy in
Georgia and somehow the parents

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:33.530 align:middle line:90%
connect.

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out it
was-- it was all true.

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:39.067 align:middle line:90%
They had all those details--

00:18:39.067 --> 00:18:41.150 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Amazing-- without
a cell phone involved?

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: No cell
phone, no technology.

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:45.950 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are you
baffled by this, Bill?

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKENNA: I'm really not.

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Because I've known about
this whole out of body

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:53.750 align:middle line:90%
experience for a long time.

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of
those things that we,

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.830 align:middle line:84%
in the other episodes
that we've had,

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:59.860 align:middle line:84%
we've talked about these
different dimensions

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:04.210 align:middle line:84%
and that as we move from the
third dimension of judgment

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:07.330 align:middle line:84%
and conditional love
to the fifth dimension

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:11.230 align:middle line:84%
of unconditional
love, what happens

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:14.090 align:middle line:90%
is these abilities are natural.

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:17.150 align:middle line:84%
They happen to all of
us when we reach it.

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do you have to
be autistic to reach these

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:22.010 align:middle line:90%
plateaus?

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:23.380 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKENNA: No, you don't.

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:26.960 align:middle line:84%
Actually, just
need to be absent.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Absent your-- all of the things
that keep you from love and joy.

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:35.210 align:middle line:84%
In other words, all
of our reactions.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:41.840 align:middle line:84%
So as we have a reaction, let's
say anger, resentment, jealousy,

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:45.860 align:middle line:84%
blame, manipulation,
all of those things,

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:50.830 align:middle line:84%
they keep us from this
fifth dimension on the hill

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:54.500 align:middle line:90%
where of all these children are.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:58.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a place because
all is known,

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.370 align:middle line:84%
all communications,
instantaneous.

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:05.030 align:middle line:84%
What happens is that
there is no manipulation.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:06.470 align:middle line:90%
There are no lies.

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:09.130 align:middle line:90%
There isn't any deceit.

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:10.730 align:middle line:90%
They're simply one.

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What can happen
to an autistic child to lose

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.350 align:middle line:90%
their telepathic abilities?

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:24.310 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: Well, some have
actually descended down

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:26.050 align:middle line:90%
into their body.

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:29.300 align:middle line:90%
It's called landing, coming in.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And for some, they were
at one point in that state

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.990 align:middle line:84%
where they didn't have control,
then they come into their bodies

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:39.470 align:middle line:90%
in the density.

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:43.930 align:middle line:84%
But primarily, what
happens, even--

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:47.270 align:middle line:84%
most of them retain it when
they come into their body.

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:49.540 align:middle line:84%
But the number one
thing that will

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:54.080 align:middle line:84%
keep somebody who has the
ability and then they lose,

00:20:54.080 --> 00:21:01.630 align:middle line:84%
it is anxiety and fear
in their own bodies

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:05.510 align:middle line:84%
or the people around them
because they feel everything.

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:middle line:84%
As the anxiety and the
pressure builds, what happens

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:15.580 align:middle line:84%
is it pushes them down into the
third dimension, where telepathy

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.840 align:middle line:90%
is much more difficult.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: My late aunt
was a psychiatrist, Bill,

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:25.270 align:middle line:84%
who decided to devote her entire
practice into investigating

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:26.800 align:middle line:90%
telepathy.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.380 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Shafica Karagulla.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:32.540 align:middle line:84%
She wrote a book called
Breakthrough to Creativity.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:36.230 align:middle line:84%
She was obsessed with
telepathic things.

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:39.790 align:middle line:84%
She would have loved
talking to you.

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:40.720 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKENNA: Wow.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:45.710 align:middle line:10%
Well, she would have loved
working with these autistic kids

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:47.360 align:middle line:10%
because it is--

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.670 align:middle line:10%
it is undeniable.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did they know about
autistic kids 70 years ago?

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: They were very,
very rare, very rare back then.

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:06.130 align:middle line:84%
It's really only been since
1989 when the number of them

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:08.240 align:middle line:90%
just started exploding.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now, when you say
nonverbal, they still speak,

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.250 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKENNA: So not--

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:17.060 align:middle line:84%
when we say nonverbal,
they do speak.

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.260 align:middle line:90%
They'll make noises.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.110 align:middle line:84%
They could even
recite things in rote.

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:27.060 align:middle line:84%
But non-speaking would be
that they don't really have

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:31.150 align:middle line:84%
the ability to communicate
very well with--

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:31.950 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Verbally.

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:33.158 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKENNA: They're verbally.

00:22:33.158 --> 00:22:37.390 align:middle line:84%
They may have a word or two like
yes, no, that sort of thing--

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:38.190 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Grunt.

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:40.750 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: And
grunting, making noise.

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:45.240 align:middle line:84%
You may find-- almost
sounds like an animal.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:49.720 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What is it about the
brain that has created this?

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.600 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: So nobody
knows for sure,

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:56.640 align:middle line:84%
but it appears that some sort
of brain damage at some point

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.012 align:middle line:90%
in time.

00:22:58.012 --> 00:22:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That is
truly remarkable.

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:02.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, this bond that you
talked about earlier

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:08.640 align:middle line:84%
between mother and child, what
creates this strong feeling?

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.950 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: With the
mother and child,

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:19.110 align:middle line:84%
it's the telepathy aspect of
it is because that child is out

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:24.480 align:middle line:84%
of the body and they are
transmitting whatever

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:29.530 align:middle line:84%
their thoughts and
feelings to the mother.

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:32.220 align:middle line:84%
But most of the time
the mother is so dense

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.660 align:middle line:90%
because they're the caretaker.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And when I say
dense, you're dealing

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.700 align:middle line:84%
with these third dimensional
thing-- no, no, no.

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:43.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have a household
you're cleaning up.

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:46.650 align:middle line:84%
But the opposite way,
the communication

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:49.330 align:middle line:90%
is very, very easy.

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:53.340 align:middle line:84%
The child knows what the mother
is thinking and feeling, as well

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:55.855 align:middle line:90%
as all the other people around.

00:23:55.855 --> 00:23:58.230 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Tell us about the
relationship between a mother

00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:01.830 align:middle line:84%
named Tia and her
child named Bowie.

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: So Tia is a
cognitive movement practitioner,

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:08.740 align:middle line:84%
who has a daughter
by the name of Bowie.

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:12.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, Bowie has something
called Angelman syndrome.

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:15.930 align:middle line:90%
And Angelman syndrome is--

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:18.870 align:middle line:84%
it's called Angelman
for a reason--

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:24.190 align:middle line:84%
when you encounter her, there's
this immense feeling of love.

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, she can't speak and she's
also developmentally disabled.

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:33.750 align:middle line:84%
But the relationship
between them

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:38.700 align:middle line:84%
is very interesting
because it proves out

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:44.340 align:middle line:84%
that quantum entanglement is
very, very real with these kids

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:46.060 align:middle line:90%
that are on the spectrum.

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Tia had been in a
situation where life

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:53.640 align:middle line:90%
was very, very hard for her.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Her daughter, for the
first 10 years of life,

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:59.970 align:middle line:84%
would go to the
bathroom number 2

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:04.330 align:middle line:84%
and then would pull it out of
her diaper and begin to paint.

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:06.450 align:middle line:90%
They went through like what?

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:09.012 align:middle line:90%
7, 10 couches.

00:25:09.012 --> 00:25:12.962 align:middle line:84%
The couches-- replace
the couch, get a new one.

00:25:12.962 --> 00:25:18.510 align:middle line:84%
She'd be sleeping in bed
and Bowie would reach in

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:20.380 align:middle line:90%
because she wants to be safe.

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:22.800 align:middle line:84%
The daughter is with her
in bed and she reaches in

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:27.990 align:middle line:84%
and he's sleeping and
Tia just wake up and oh--

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Stench was horrible.

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKENNA: Unbelievable.

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.200 align:middle line:90%
You can't have anything.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if that
happened, you'd be like,

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:38.040 align:middle line:84%
even Mother Teresa
would be like, [GROANS]

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:41.340 align:middle line:90%
It's like so hard.

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:49.770 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, one day Liz
Larsen said to Tia, hey, Tia,

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:51.370 align:middle line:90%
this is super frustrating.

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you do a
session on yourself.

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And she did the
session when she did

00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:00.330 align:middle line:84%
the session, what
ended up happening

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:06.060 align:middle line:84%
is she accessed a
memory where she grew up

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:12.430 align:middle line:84%
in New Zealand on a farm with
sheep, and at five years old,

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:15.280 align:middle line:84%
she walked in and saw the
sheep being butchered,

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:18.412 align:middle line:84%
didn't really process it
and asked, how can I help?

00:26:18.412 --> 00:26:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And they said, oh, OK,
you're going to clean up

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:22.330 align:middle line:90%
the entrails and the poop.

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:23.770 align:middle line:90%
And she did.

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:25.920 align:middle line:90%
It was traumatizing for her.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:32.250 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, fast forward,
she completes the session

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:34.680 align:middle line:84%
where she no longer
is traumatized

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:38.160 align:middle line:84%
by that whole experience
when she was a child.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And after 10 years,
Bowie stopped.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:42.900 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Done.

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.230 align:middle line:90%

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:47.400 align:middle line:90%
You can finally buy a couch.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:54.460 align:middle line:10%
- My name is Tia Woods.

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:57.510 align:middle line:10%
I'm a Cognomovement
practitioner and mother

00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:00.420 align:middle line:10%
to Bowie, who has
Angelman syndrome.

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:03.360 align:middle line:10%
- [MUMBLING]

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:09.000 align:middle line:10%
- We're having a chronic issue
with fecal smearing everywhere,

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.290 align:middle line:10%
at least once or twice a day.

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:16.020 align:middle line:10%
Liz Larson suggested that I do a
Cognomovement session on myself.

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:19.260 align:middle line:10%
And the insights I got
and the learning I got

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:23.230 align:middle line:10%
was the crux of it, that
I was running in PTSD,

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:28.060 align:middle line:10%
was having to kill lambs when
I was about five years old,

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:31.500 align:middle line:10%
and my job was to move
the entrails with all

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.620 align:middle line:10%
the fecal matter into the
bucket from the dead lambs

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.250 align:middle line:10%
that I've just been speaking to.

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:41.250 align:middle line:10%
So, of course, I was running
that program of fear and stress

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:45.370 align:middle line:10%
and anxiety and cleaning
up fecal matter.

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:48.790 align:middle line:10%
Bowie was taking that
from my nervous system,

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:51.060 align:middle line:10%
anchoring onto that
because it was the biggest

00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:52.480 align:middle line:10%
program I was running.

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:56.200 align:middle line:10%
It was the biggest amount
of stress and anxiety.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:59.800 align:middle line:10%
And so she was literally
acting that out.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:03.450 align:middle line:10%
And from that day, after
I'd done that session

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:06.810 align:middle line:10%
and had that realization
and really regulated

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:09.420 align:middle line:10%
my nervous system
and cleared it,

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.920 align:middle line:10%
we haven't had anything
for three years.

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.190 align:middle line:10%
There has not been one
poop smearing incident.

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.990 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:18.880 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Bill, that was
an amazing part from Tia.

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:22.680 align:middle line:90%
Tell me how that all happened.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:29.590 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: So this whole thing
where there's a connection,

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:32.950 align:middle line:84%
most people think that
it's just telepathic,

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:35.170 align:middle line:90%
but it's so much more than that.

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:38.860 align:middle line:84%
This quantum entanglement
is very real,

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:44.610 align:middle line:84%
and you can resolve an
issue with the child

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:47.230 align:middle line:90%
by resolving it in the parent.

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:52.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, Cognomovement doesn't
cure any name disease.

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:59.200 align:middle line:84%
All it does is it simply causes
a relaxation response, processes

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:03.340 align:middle line:84%
trauma, allows
somebody to relax.

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:09.760 align:middle line:84%
So when that happens with the
mother, it affects the child.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have
to be a mother.

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:17.220 align:middle line:84%
It could be the caretaker,
it could be the teacher.

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.480 align:middle line:90%
They can feel everything.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:22.720 align:middle line:84%
So when they're out of
their body like that,

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.160 align:middle line:90%
they're affected.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The child
who had seizures--

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:29.790 align:middle line:90%
and this helped eliminate them.

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:31.270 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKENNA: It's ridiculous.

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:34.780 align:middle line:84%
She had grand mal seizures,
not just seizures.

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And those seizures were
going on for years.

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And she would have one after
the next after the next.

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And when that went away,
you can imagine the relief.

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:50.770 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Tia was able to find
success treating these seizures.

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:51.700 align:middle line:90%
But how?

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: She was simply able
to process her own anxiety,

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.080 align:middle line:90%
her own stress.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:03.670 align:middle line:84%
So when she did the work on
herself to de-stress herself,

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:06.960 align:middle line:84%
then it was no longer
felt by the child.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Bill, here's another
clip of Tia describing her

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:12.020 align:middle line:90%
amazing experience with Bowie.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.290 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:18.150 align:middle line:10%
- So Bowie was having a lot of
seizures, three different types

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:20.590 align:middle line:10%
of seizures over the years.

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:24.910 align:middle line:10%
And after I'd had great success
with the fecal smearing,

00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:29.040 align:middle line:10%
I decided we'd
give seizures a go.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.290 align:middle line:10%
Because what I was
noticing was a pattern

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:35.970 align:middle line:10%
I was running, where Bowie
would be seizure free for months

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:37.920 align:middle line:10%
or weeks, and I'd
think to myself,

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.990 align:middle line:10%
oh God, we haven't had
a seizure for ages.

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:44.170 align:middle line:10%
And just like that
seizure instantly.

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:47.230 align:middle line:10%
It could be within the
next hour of the afternoon.

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:51.780 align:middle line:10%
So when I did the session, I
was instantly transported back

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:52.840 align:middle line:10%
to when I was a kid.

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.445 align:middle line:10%
I was standing on the
corner on my way to school.

00:30:55.445 --> 00:30:57.820 align:middle line:10%
I could see my home behind
me, the school in front of me,

00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:01.560 align:middle line:10%
and then I could feel
every bit of shock

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:05.510 align:middle line:10%
from a traumatic event that had
happened that morning or the day

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:06.310 align:middle line:10%
before.

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:11.160 align:middle line:10%
I could feel all my
stress and anxiety

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.440 align:middle line:10%
and really abject terror.

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:16.200 align:middle line:10%
And what I realized
is this is what

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:19.590 align:middle line:10%
it feels like before a
seizure, and that Bowie

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:22.350 align:middle line:10%
was literally
physically acting out

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:26.050 align:middle line:10%
how I felt, how my nervous
system was running.

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:29.010 align:middle line:10%
And as I had that
realization and that I

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:31.820 align:middle line:10%
wasn't the small child anymore,
I wasn't stuck in that trauma

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:32.620 align:middle line:10%
anymore.

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:35.980 align:middle line:10%
It all dissolved and dissipated.

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:37.920 align:middle line:10%
It literally melted away.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:45.150 align:middle line:10%
And from that moment on, the
seizures just disappeared,

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:46.000 align:middle line:10%
and I didn't--

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.780 align:middle line:10%
I no longer thought, oh, we
haven't had one for ages.

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:53.970 align:middle line:10%
And so I was able to do this
with three different types

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:57.990 align:middle line:10%
and recognize what I needed
to clear in my field for her

00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:59.413 align:middle line:10%
to be safe.

00:31:59.413 --> 00:32:00.360 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.358 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Quite
remarkable, Bill.

00:32:02.358 --> 00:32:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKENNA: It really is.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And as a parent, when
you see your child

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:12.850 align:middle line:84%
go through something like
that, it's horribly traumatic.

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Does this happen
with most autistic kids?

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: It's some autistic
kids have seizures as well.

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:26.730 align:middle line:84%
But I think what no one
realizes is the effect

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:32.530 align:middle line:84%
that we around them have,
because they can feel it all.

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:37.740 align:middle line:84%
They feel everything wearing
the absolute perfect mask,

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:39.265 align:middle line:90%
where we think they don't.

00:32:39.265 --> 00:32:41.640 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But what do you
recommend to parents who may be

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:46.500 align:middle line:84%
watching this program right
now, whose children are autistic

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:51.570 align:middle line:84%
and they're not privy to the
information like Tia had?

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: So the first
part of it is awareness.

00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:01.860 align:middle line:84%
Awareness that there's
more going on with a child

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:03.520 align:middle line:90%
than we might think.

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And that our stress,
whatever that might be

00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:12.460 align:middle line:90%
can be felt by the child.

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.070 align:middle line:90%
They're very-- I--

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:15.970 align:middle line:90%
not saying anything new to them.

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:17.620 align:middle line:90%
They're very, very sensitive.

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:21.060 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting
thing here is

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:24.150 align:middle line:84%
that they are
empathic, meaning they

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:28.450 align:middle line:90%
feel what I feel as their own.

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And with that, they
tend to act it out,

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:36.570 align:middle line:84%
not in the way that I would,
but in the way they would.

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:39.640 align:middle line:90%
The solution is very simple.

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Whoever is
surrounding the child,

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:46.170 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the caretaker,
the teacher, that sort of thing

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:48.900 align:middle line:84%
is to be aware of
what they're thinking

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:51.270 align:middle line:84%
and what they're
feeling, and how that

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:53.890 align:middle line:90%
might be impacting the child.

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:55.810 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Tell us more
about Cognomovement.

00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:57.930 align:middle line:90%
Exactly how does that work.

00:33:57.930 --> 00:34:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: So Cognomovement is
a simple method that pretty much

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:05.200 align:middle line:90%
anybody can do.

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:12.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a system where you can
find a neurological glitch.

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that I have a real
feeling like Tia did, about--

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:20.270 align:middle line:84%
who wouldn't have a feeling
about having fecal matter spread

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:21.070 align:middle line:90%
everywhere?

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh my God.

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:22.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.690 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: Who wouldn't-- who
wouldn't feel something about

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:25.530 align:middle line:90%
that?

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:30.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you do
these sessions,

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:34.929 align:middle line:84%
you let yourself feel how you
do and you move your eyes.

00:34:34.929 --> 00:34:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And there's also other
physical movements

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:45.060 align:middle line:84%
where we can detect where in the
brain that bad feeling might be.

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:51.639 align:middle line:84%
And when that part of the
nervous system gets corrected,

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:53.880 align:middle line:90%
the feeling goes away.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:59.310 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, we're doing
sessions through the eyeballs

00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:03.040 align:middle line:84%
because your eyeballs are
directly connected to the brain.

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere you look is a
different part of the brain.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And not only are we able to
detect where the issue might be,

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:19.330 align:middle line:84%
but also to engage other parts
of the brain to process it.

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:23.200 align:middle line:84%
This also goes beyond to
the entire nervous system,

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.310 align:middle line:84%
the spinal cord, and all the
nerves throughout the body.

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Does this tap into
one's psychic abilities as well?

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: It will when one
solves all of the reactions,

00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:41.830 align:middle line:84%
like all of us have reactions
that we have all day long,

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:46.500 align:middle line:84%
we can't go to 7-Eleven without
having some situation where

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:49.590 align:middle line:90%
we're trying to get there.

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And we've got a feeling because
someone won't let us over

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:54.610 align:middle line:90%
into their lane.

00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:58.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, all of these reactions
are the things that keep us

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:01.870 align:middle line:90%
from those natural abilities.

00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:03.310 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has them.

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:07.750 align:middle line:84%
When the-- when we
solve all the reactions,

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:09.700 align:middle line:90%
I no longer feel them.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And instead of feeling
them, a feeling

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:15.360 align:middle line:84%
of gratitude, love,
contentment, joy

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.750 align:middle line:84%
emerges, which is
associated with the states

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:22.930 align:middle line:84%
where these abilities
automatically appear.

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But if the people who
are non-autistic had a little

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:30.750 align:middle line:84%
bit of autism in their system,
what kind of person would that

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:32.760 align:middle line:90%
make them?

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: Oftentimes,
people like that are highly

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:37.270 align:middle line:90%
intelligent.

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:43.155 align:middle line:84%
They are people that
might have certain skills

00:36:43.155 --> 00:36:47.470 align:middle line:84%
in business or in
mathematics or in science.

00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Psychic
abilities, intuitiveness.

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:52.410 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: They
might be like that.

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:55.660 align:middle line:90%
Elon Musk is on the spectrum.

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:59.630 align:middle line:84%
He has Asperger's, so
he's extraordinarily

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:01.800 align:middle line:90%
good at figuring things out.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Like it or
not, he's a genius.

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:05.390 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKENNA: He is.

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What is the nervous
system have to do with this?

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:14.300 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: The nervous system
has everything to do with

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:15.510 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Meaning it's not only
our communication, how

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:23.390 align:middle line:84%
we communicate with another
and the signals that we send

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:29.780 align:middle line:84%
but when we simply can
regulate that what happens

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:34.670 align:middle line:84%
is others around us
become regulated as well.

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is this a new
science, the study of autism?

00:37:39.350 --> 00:37:41.190 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: The study
of autism, well,

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:43.770 align:middle line:84%
they've been studying
it for a long time.

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:47.630 align:middle line:84%
However, what's going
on with this study

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:54.200 align:middle line:84%
around the whole
telepathy and that realm

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:56.780 align:middle line:90%
of this understanding.

00:37:56.780 --> 00:38:02.100 align:middle line:84%
It's been understood here
for over 30 years or so,

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:06.210 align:middle line:84%
but people weren't really
talking about it very much.

00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:07.500 align:middle line:90%
It was very hush hush.

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:11.300 align:middle line:84%
Nobody wanted to talk about
it or admit it, especially

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:13.200 align:middle line:90%
in the professional circles.

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:17.570 align:middle line:84%
However, today there's
been an absolute explosion,

00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:23.210 align:middle line:84%
where it's coming out because
of the advent of assisted typing

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:25.290 align:middle line:90%
or typing to communicate.

00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, people are
realizing the truth,

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:31.190 align:middle line:84%
and it's gone from
a situation where

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:36.060 align:middle line:84%
these kids that there
was a pushing away,

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:40.400 align:middle line:84%
people didn't want to be
around them to now everybody's

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:44.700 align:middle line:84%
realizing, oh my God,
these are amazing kids,

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:46.380 align:middle line:90%
and everybody's gone--

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:47.880 align:middle line:90%
and just like, oh my God.

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:49.470 align:middle line:90%
Everybody wants to know more.

00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:50.640 align:middle line:90%
Be around them now.

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:51.660 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Do they laugh?

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:52.950 align:middle line:90%
Do they sing?

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:54.320 align:middle line:90%
Do they have fun?

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.400 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKENNA: Yes, yes they do.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:57.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they do.

00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And for many of them,
this is primarily

00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:03.750 align:middle line:90%
what the hill is about.

00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:08.370 align:middle line:84%
They'll go and isolate
themselves and go to the hill.

00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:10.910 align:middle line:84%
This is the place where
they're out of their body

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:12.990 align:middle line:84%
and having fun
with their friends.

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:18.900 align:middle line:84%
There's no situation where they
feel controlled or manipulated.

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:20.580 align:middle line:90%
They're not judged.

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:23.600 align:middle line:90%
They're loved and understood.

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What does the
future hold for autistic kids?

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: I think that,
especially for the kids,

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:33.960 align:middle line:84%
the severe ones that
were non-speaking,

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:38.480 align:middle line:84%
I think that the future
is amazingly bright

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:43.880 align:middle line:84%
because of this, because it's
coming to the surface now

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:48.210 align:middle line:84%
in very broad terms
for the population.

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:52.490 align:middle line:84%
People are aware that these
kids are brilliant, not only are

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:55.440 align:middle line:90%
they brilliant, but they act.

00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Their intention is to act out
of love and that sort of realm.

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:06.050 align:middle line:84%
So when they're in
this place, I think

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:12.748 align:middle line:84%
that their future has
application throughout society.

00:40:12.748 --> 00:40:16.440 align:middle line:84%
Suzy Miller, who's been
on Gaia multiple times,

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:21.530 align:middle line:84%
she was a person that spent the
past quarter century or more

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:24.890 align:middle line:90%
working with the population.

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And she said that they are now
talking about something called

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:35.390 align:middle line:84%
landing, that they are ready
to come into their body

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:40.440 align:middle line:84%
and be their full selves,
fully connected to the hill,

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:44.220 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, having
control over their body.

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And it appears that there's
some incidents where they're

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:52.640 align:middle line:84%
coming into their
bodies more and more

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:57.170 align:middle line:84%
and technology to allow this
to happen like we talked about

00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:59.330 align:middle line:90%
at the last episode.

00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:01.880 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Should we be
doing a better job, Bill,

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:06.860 align:middle line:84%
tapping into the brain
power of an autistic person?

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: I think that the
first is to recognize that they

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:14.280 align:middle line:90%
are much, much more.

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:18.390 align:middle line:84%
Once it's recognized that
they are much, much more,

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:26.000 align:middle line:84%
tapping into that incredible
power has benefit for humankind,

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.770 align:middle line:84%
whether you're in
technology or governance

00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:34.920 align:middle line:84%
on a national level
or religious studies.

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:39.170 align:middle line:84%
Imagine, imagine being
tapped into somebody

00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:42.420 align:middle line:84%
who taps into
infinite intelligence,

00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:46.100 align:middle line:84%
infinite intelligence,
and they're doing it

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:49.650 align:middle line:90%
from a place of love for all.

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:55.250 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is the autistic
parent give off an autistic kid?

00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:57.750 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKENNA: No, not necessarily.

00:41:57.750 --> 00:42:03.810 align:middle line:84%
We found that they're across
every culture, everybody,

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:06.410 align:middle line:90%
anybody could have an autistic.

00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:09.020 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is it anything the
mother does during pregnancy

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:10.590 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that?

00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:13.310 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKENNA: It's not known.

00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:14.460 align:middle line:90%
It's not known.

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:15.680 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Possible?

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: I think
anything's possible.

00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:21.500 align:middle line:90%
We just don't know.

00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:24.950 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Like she could have
fallen or something, who knows?

00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:27.032 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKENNA: I don't know.

00:42:27.032 --> 00:42:30.620 align:middle line:84%
I tend to think
that it's probably

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:33.440 align:middle line:84%
something to do with
the environment based

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:41.370 align:middle line:84%
upon the acceleration since
19, I believe, 89 or so,

00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:44.250 align:middle line:90%
when the population exploded.

00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You've got free
classes for Gaia viewers.

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:49.740 align:middle line:84%
How do they get to
participate in them?

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:54.490 align:middle line:84%
>> MCKENNA: So we have a free
seven hours of Cognomovement

00:42:54.490 --> 00:42:55.290 align:middle line:90%
sessions.

00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:56.332 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's intense.

00:42:56.332 --> 00:42:57.600 align:middle line:90%
>> MCKENNA: Seven hours.

00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:02.240 align:middle line:10%
And we really want all the
caretakers and everyone else out

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:10.910 align:middle line:10%
there to get this for free,
cognomovement.com/beyond.

00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:15.360 align:middle line:10%
Now, these classes
anybody can use.

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And with it we'll actually be
able to affect the other people

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:24.360 align:middle line:84%
around us even if they're
not on the spectrum.

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:28.110 align:middle line:84%
All of us are constantly
impacting others.

>> NOORY: The next time you come
across somebody who's autistic,

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:38.840 align:middle line:84%
remember this program because
it truly is remarkable what

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:41.700 align:middle line:84%
