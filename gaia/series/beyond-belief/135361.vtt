[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: On
"Beyond Belief," we

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.360 align:middle line:84%
are talking about
controlling the human mind.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.863 align:middle line:84%
>> He knows mind control is
no longer the stuff of science

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:30.656 align:middle line:90%
fiction.

00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:35.118 align:middle line:84%
Well-known author, lecturer,
and researcher Dr. Nick Begich

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:37.454 align:middle line:84%
says the secretly
developed technology now

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:39.748 align:middle line:84%
exists to either
enslave our minds

00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:42.084 align:middle line:84%
or free us to our
higher potential.

00:00:42.084 --> 00:00:45.337 align:middle line:84%
And since this technology will
impact consciousness itself,

00:00:45.337 --> 00:00:47.965 align:middle line:84%
he believes we must
debate it openly.

00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:49.466 align:middle line:84%
Although most
people tend to focus

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.468 align:middle line:84%
on the military application
of mind control,

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:54.763 align:middle line:84%
Nick examines the private-sector
implications-- today

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:57.933 align:middle line:90%
on "Beyond Belief."

00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.851 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Nick Begich,
welcome to the program.

00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:01.186 align:middle line:90%
So great to see you.

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:02.312 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK BEGICH: Hey, it's so
good to be with you again.

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:04.313 align:middle line:84%
It's been a while since
we've done one of these.

00:01:04.313 --> 00:01:06.149 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, and the
last time we talked,

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.527 align:middle line:84%
it was about HAARP and what's
going on up there in Alaska

00:01:08.527 --> 00:01:09.736 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:11.697 align:middle line:90%
Has anything changed with that?

00:01:11.697 --> 00:01:13.407 align:middle line:84%
>>BEGICH: The project
continues to go on.

00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:15.284 align:middle line:84%
Every couple of years
they say it shuts down.

00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:17.577 align:middle line:84%
But what they really do is
transfer the funding source.

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:18.870 align:middle line:90%
So it's still being operated.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.081 align:middle line:84%
It's actually now under the
control of the University

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.083 align:middle line:90%
of Alaska in Fairbanks.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.544 align:middle line:84%
And then it's doing projects
for DARPA and many, many--

00:01:25.544 --> 00:01:26.795 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Whatever it's doing.

00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:29.339 align:middle line:84%
>>BEGICH: Same customers,
just a different owner

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:30.173 align:middle line:90%
at the present time.

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:32.342 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And now you've
moved into the area that is

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:34.761 align:middle line:84%
fascinating-- controlling
the human mind.

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:35.554 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: Right.

00:01:35.554 --> 00:01:38.765 align:middle line:84%
And for me, this is, I think,
one of most important areas.

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:41.476 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of the spin-off
from my work on the HAARP

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:42.269 align:middle line:90%
project.

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:44.479 align:middle line:84%
But this, the idea
of manipulating

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.565 align:middle line:84%
human behavior, the
sinister side of it,

00:01:46.565 --> 00:01:48.650 align:middle line:84%
is what everybody
always focuses on.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.029 align:middle line:84%
And certainly I've dealt with
that a lot over the years.

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:54.197 align:middle line:84%
But there's an upside
to this, the idea

00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:56.575 align:middle line:84%
of stimulating the mind,
stimulating consciousness

00:01:56.575 --> 00:01:59.619 align:middle line:84%
in a way that enhances
our potentials,

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.038 align:middle line:84%
what I think is
the most exciting.

00:02:01.038 --> 00:02:01.747 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It sort
of goes both ways.

00:02:01.747 --> 00:02:02.831 align:middle line:84%
>>BEGICH: Absolutely
goes both ways.

00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:05.334 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now, and when you
talk about controlling the human

00:02:05.334 --> 00:02:08.377 align:middle line:84%
mind, are we talking
about technology doing it?

00:02:08.377 --> 00:02:13.550 align:middle line:84%
Are we talking about just
doing it in terms of episodes

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.054 align:middle line:84%
where you bombard people with
information and they change?

00:02:17.054 --> 00:02:18.263 align:middle line:90%
What's the concept here?

00:02:18.263 --> 00:02:19.723 align:middle line:84%
>>BEGICH: There's
a number of ways.

00:02:19.723 --> 00:02:21.600 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
kind of the spectrum,

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.978 align:middle line:84%
from the propaganda
kind of approaches

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:27.314 align:middle line:84%
of the past to
more sophisticated

00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:30.442 align:middle line:84%
electronic approaches, where you
literally manipulate the brain,

00:02:30.442 --> 00:02:32.444 align:middle line:84%
you manipulate the
behavior of people.

00:02:32.444 --> 00:02:34.279 align:middle line:84%
And what has been
discovered is that there

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:37.074 align:middle line:84%
is what's called a frequency
following response, where

00:02:37.074 --> 00:02:39.826 align:middle line:84%
an external signal,
whether it be, say,

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:42.829 align:middle line:84%
a radio signal or a
pulse-modulator radio

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.500 align:middle line:84%
signal flickering light
at a certain flicker rate.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.835 align:middle line:84%
Sound waves interacting
in a certain way

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:50.754 align:middle line:84%
can drive the brain,
force the brain

00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:54.091 align:middle line:84%
into following that pattern,
frequency following response.

00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:57.511 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is
those responses that

00:02:57.511 --> 00:03:03.850 align:middle line:84%
are associated with particular
emotions-- anger, calmness

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.436 align:middle line:84%
or peacefulness--
you can manipulate

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:08.688 align:middle line:84%
the overall sort
of brain activity

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:10.190 align:middle line:90%
to push a person this way.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.567 align:middle line:84%
And you can use any
electromagnetic carrier

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:13.485 align:middle line:90%
to achieve that end.

00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's just on
the emotional side.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.782 align:middle line:84%
As you get a higher resolution,
an ability to kind of

00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:20.784 align:middle line:90%
tune that more finely.

00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:23.412 align:middle line:84%
And there's a couple of
projects that I can mention

00:03:23.412 --> 00:03:24.538 align:middle line:90%
that are dealing with that.

00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:28.250 align:middle line:84%
There's some DARPA programs
now to look at the brain

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.002 align:middle line:84%
to determine what a person
is actually thinking

00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:33.880 align:middle line:84%
and then create complex
signals, to take those patterns

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.133 align:middle line:84%
and impose them on another
to see if you can literally

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:38.301 align:middle line:84%
transfer thought from
one person to another.

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:42.305 align:middle line:84%
This is ongoing experimentation
of our government,

00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:44.808 align:middle line:84%
and it's kind of
mirroring what probably we

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:46.852 align:middle line:90%
can do naturally in any case.

00:03:46.852 --> 00:03:51.565 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Nick, advertising has
really captured exactly what

00:03:51.565 --> 00:03:54.526 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about
in a scientific way.

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:57.404 align:middle line:84%
They know exactly what
to put in a commercial,

00:03:57.404 --> 00:03:59.489 align:middle line:90%
how to stimulate somebody.

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.075 align:middle line:84%
They know they know what
buttons to push, don't they?

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:03.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: Yeah, and they do it.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.536 align:middle line:90%
Because it's no regulation.

00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:06.037 align:middle line:84%
And so anyone who
studies psychology

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:08.665 align:middle line:84%
in any of the major
institutes in the world

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:10.584 align:middle line:84%
now understand frequency
following response.

00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:11.960 align:middle line:84%
So when you apply
to advertising,

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.838 align:middle line:84%
within 20, 30 seconds
you can create just

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:16.798 align:middle line:84%
on a light effect,
just a flicker effect,

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:18.048 align:middle line:90%
you can create an entrainment.

00:04:18.048 --> 00:04:20.051 align:middle line:84%
And so when you think
about-- think about people

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:20.969 align:middle line:90%
in front of a TV set.

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:22.804 align:middle line:84%
When your spouse
is cooking dinner

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:24.723 align:middle line:84%
and they're hollering
at you, dinner is ready,

00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:29.561 align:middle line:84%
dinner is ready, and you're
in a very light trance state,

00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:30.353 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:32.564 align:middle line:84%
You're in a low
alpha, high theta

00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:35.525 align:middle line:84%
rate, which is where you're
highly suggestive, where you

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:37.944 align:middle line:84%
can take in information
that sort of lines

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:40.780 align:middle line:84%
up with what you think anyway,
and you just kind of move right

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.573 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:04:41.573 --> 00:04:45.577 align:middle line:84%
So the 6 o'clock news becomes
an incredibly powerful tool

00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:47.037 align:middle line:90%
in terms of propaganda.

00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:48.872 align:middle line:84%
Advertising as such
becomes a tool.

00:04:48.872 --> 00:04:49.664 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Huge.

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:51.332 align:middle line:84%
>>BEGICH: And so when
you start to think

00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:54.169 align:middle line:84%
about just simple
manipulation like this

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.172 align:middle line:84%
can move just enough
of a population

00:04:57.172 --> 00:04:59.925 align:middle line:84%
to maybe decide presidential
elections, as an example.

00:04:59.925 --> 00:05:02.761 align:middle line:84%
You've got these close,
close things that

00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:06.348 align:middle line:84%
happen in political arenas,
and just a little bit

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:09.434 align:middle line:84%
of a push one way or the
other is really all it takes.

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:11.269 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do both
sides understand that,

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:13.855 align:middle line:84%
I mean oppositions
in this stuff?

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:16.233 align:middle line:84%
Because I know if I
were running a campaign

00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:18.276 align:middle line:84%
and I were the
candidate, I would

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:21.947 align:middle line:84%
use everything
technologically I could

00:05:21.947 --> 00:05:26.159 align:middle line:84%
to manipulate the mind, to get
people to want to vote for you.

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.912 align:middle line:84%
>>BEGICH: If the candidates
don't do it directly,

00:05:28.912 --> 00:05:30.372 align:middle line:90%
the consultants probably do.

00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:32.165 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I say
that is because you've

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:32.957 align:middle line:90%
got a lot at stake.

00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:38.088 align:middle line:84%
People are spending millions on
ads, billions now on campaigns.

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:40.799 align:middle line:84%
And so the amount of money
it takes to just layer

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:42.717 align:middle line:84%
that up a little bit
is not that much.

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:44.344 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of giving
people that kind

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:45.637 align:middle line:84%
of happy, good
feeling when they're

00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:48.056 align:middle line:84%
seeing the ad, that's what you
want them to walk away with.

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:49.849 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Music is tied
into it, everything.

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:50.267 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: Right.

00:05:50.267 --> 00:05:52.394 align:middle line:84%
And now when you start
to think about taking it

00:05:52.394 --> 00:05:55.146 align:middle line:84%
from the old propaganda
and combining the tools,

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:57.399 align:middle line:84%
like when you think about
internet, as an example--

00:05:57.399 --> 00:06:00.026 align:middle line:84%
internet is a way
to profile people

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:01.611 align:middle line:90%
like we've never done before.

00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:04.072 align:middle line:84%
When you consider all the
things that are electronically

00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:07.117 align:middle line:84%
tracked and kept track of, and
these end up in data warehouse.

00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:08.535 align:middle line:84%
People say, oh,
it's not a problem.

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:10.245 align:middle line:90%
We can't even sort that data.

00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:14.416 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not today, but we will
be able to sort that data.

00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:15.375 align:middle line:90%
And that's the point.

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:19.254 align:middle line:84%
Storing it is valuable
inventory for the future.

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:22.007 align:middle line:84%
As our resolution ability
to sort that data changes,

00:06:22.007 --> 00:06:24.759 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be able to
profile people so perfectly

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:27.429 align:middle line:84%
and be able to tailor
ads directly for them.

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:29.598 align:middle line:84%
I wrote about this 16
years ago in a book

00:06:29.598 --> 00:06:31.099 align:middle line:84%
called "Earth Rise
and Revolution,"

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:32.017 align:middle line:90%
that this was coming.

00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:33.101 align:middle line:84%
Where they're going
to tailor ads--

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:34.269 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You were spot on.

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:35.353 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: And here we are.

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at it, whether
it's on your smartphone or any

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.487 align:middle line:84%
of your devices, the idea of
knowing that's you, number one,

00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:47.198 align:middle line:84%
identifying you as a
person, and then tying

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:50.368 align:middle line:84%
the data that tells them sort
of where your frame of reference

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:52.370 align:middle line:84%
is so they-- like in
a political campaign.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.413 align:middle line:90%
There's 99 issues.

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:54.831 align:middle line:90%
One them you agree with.

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:57.167 align:middle line:84%
That's the only one you're
going to hear in the future.

00:06:57.167 --> 00:07:00.295 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I was watching some
advertisers look at a project

00:07:00.295 --> 00:07:02.088 align:middle line:84%
they were working
on technologically.

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:05.133 align:middle line:84%
And they were doing research,
and it was just amazing.

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:07.052 align:middle line:84%
They were showing
a car commercial

00:07:07.052 --> 00:07:10.555 align:middle line:84%
with an attractive woman
walking by the car,

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:13.099 align:middle line:84%
kind of like touching the
sides of it and stuff.

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:15.352 align:middle line:84%
And then they
researched guys who

00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:17.896 align:middle line:84%
were the buyers of
these kind of cars,

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:20.523 align:middle line:84%
and none of them--
none of them--

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:21.775 align:middle line:90%
knew what the car looked like.

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:24.069 align:middle line:84%
They remembered the
name of the car,

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:25.779 align:middle line:90%
and they remember the girl.

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:28.239 align:middle line:84%
But they don't remember
the car at all, other

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:31.326 align:middle line:84%
than it was a car
with this brand name.

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:35.205 align:middle line:84%
And they said this was
a very successful test.

00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they
ran with for that ad.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.832 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: Right.

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:39.918 align:middle line:84%
Now, even more
sophisticated testing

00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:43.880 align:middle line:84%
would be to hook the
viewers up to EEGs

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.675 align:middle line:84%
and look at what's going
on within the brain

00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:48.635 align:middle line:84%
as they're watching
the ad in real time.

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, they do this
with gaming now,

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.515 align:middle line:84%
because the idea is they want
the game, through the light

00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:56.935 align:middle line:84%
and sound effects, to stimulate
the same portions of the brain

00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:59.479 align:middle line:84%
that are associated with
addictive behaviors,

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:02.565 align:middle line:84%
sexual activity, the kinds of
things that highly stimulate

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:08.363 align:middle line:84%
the brain, release endorphins
and brain chemicals that just

00:08:08.363 --> 00:08:10.407 align:middle line:84%
excite the heck
out of the person.

00:08:10.407 --> 00:08:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And what you see is that kind of
addictive behavior manifesting

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:15.912 align:middle line:90%
in gaming.

00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:18.623 align:middle line:84%
Because it's
designed to do that.

00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:20.582 align:middle line:84%
That is what it's
supposed to do,

00:08:20.582 --> 00:08:24.003 align:middle line:84%
because they want to sell
millions of these units.

00:08:24.003 --> 00:08:26.297 align:middle line:84%
And the way they do them
is exactly this way.

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:29.843 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's the advertising
or the device itself

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:31.761 align:middle line:84%
that you're interacting
with-- virtual reality

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:34.389 align:middle line:84%
is another place where
this will be applied.

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:37.433 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, when you start to
think about just the direction

00:08:37.433 --> 00:08:39.059 align:middle line:84%
in which all of these
things are going,

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:42.188 align:middle line:84%
the idea of manipulating
what's going

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:46.151 align:middle line:84%
on within a brain for
nefarious purposes,

00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:47.152 align:middle line:90%
everyone can see that.

00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:49.237 align:middle line:84%
And everybody goes, ah,
what do we do about that?

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:51.072 align:middle line:84%
But if you flip it
around-- and this

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:55.076 align:middle line:84%
is where my research led me that
that was the most surprising,

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:58.580 align:middle line:84%
is that when you flip this
around, what you find out

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.039 align:middle line:84%
is that what they
really discovered

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:03.042 align:middle line:84%
was the potential of human
beings, that we have what

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:05.336 align:middle line:84%
they call now anomalous
human capabilities,

00:09:05.336 --> 00:09:06.129 align:middle line:90%
or human potential.

00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:08.673 align:middle line:84%
Shows up in the military
literature all over the place,

00:09:08.673 --> 00:09:12.510 align:middle line:84%
what we used to call Extra
Sensory Perceptions, ESP.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.513 align:middle line:84%
But that has kind of a bad
connotation because the '70s

00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:17.515 align:middle line:84%
and '60s kind of wrapped
it up with the occult

00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:18.892 align:middle line:90%
and all kinds of stuff.

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:22.395 align:middle line:84%
But the scientific literature
in this area continues to grow.

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And through my own experience
and from interacting

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:27.484 align:middle line:84%
with people that have
had these experiences

00:09:27.484 --> 00:09:31.613 align:middle line:84%
and talking to experts,
PhD-level biophysicists,

00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:35.784 align:middle line:84%
they believe that this is the
next evolution of humankind,

00:09:35.784 --> 00:09:38.077 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to
achieve these capabilities.

00:09:38.077 --> 00:09:39.746 align:middle line:84%
And you know the one
thing that blocks

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:42.707 align:middle line:84%
higher states of
consciousness-- the one thing?

00:09:42.707 --> 00:09:43.625 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What's that?

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:45.418 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: Fear and anxiety.

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:49.130 align:middle line:84%
You cannot reach higher states
of consciousness in a state

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:50.340 align:middle line:90%
of fear and anxiety.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.635 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at the media
and what it sends us.

00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:54.469 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:09:54.469 --> 00:09:54.928 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: That's it.

00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:55.720 align:middle line:90%
That's the message.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.264 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Or government--
terrorism this, that,

00:09:58.264 --> 00:09:59.390 align:middle line:90%
keeping you on edge.

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.894 align:middle line:84%
You remember in the beginning
of 9/11, that horrible tragedy,

00:10:02.894 --> 00:10:04.896 align:middle line:90%
we went to a color scheme.

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:06.773 align:middle line:90%
I hated that, Nick.

00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:12.445 align:middle line:84%
I thought that was the grossest
presentation of mind control

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:15.365 align:middle line:84%
by talking about various
stages of colors.

00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:17.367 align:middle line:84%
They were manipulating
the mind, weren't they?

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:17.659 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: Right.

00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:18.451 align:middle line:90%
They were indeed.

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:20.578 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, they were
doing a couple of things.

00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:22.914 align:middle line:84%
First, by creating
that level of anxiety,

00:10:22.914 --> 00:10:27.210 align:middle line:84%
you shut off the highly
intellectual parts

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.212 align:middle line:84%
of the brain, the parts
that aren't related

00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:30.588 align:middle line:84%
to the flight-or-flight
response,

00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:32.423 align:middle line:84%
but the ones that
actually analyze a problem

00:10:32.423 --> 00:10:34.050 align:middle line:84%
and begin to come
up with solutions.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:38.596 align:middle line:84%
But when you infect a
population with fear

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:41.182 align:middle line:84%
and then expect them
to make good decisions,

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:43.601 align:middle line:90%
you bet wrong every time.

00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:46.145 align:middle line:84%
Think about 9/11, as
you were mentioning.

00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:49.607 align:middle line:84%
Right afterwards, 99
people in the US Senate

00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:52.360 align:middle line:84%
passed the Patriot Act, which
wasn't patriotic at all.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.488 align:middle line:84%
In fact, how many legislatures
and governments said,

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:57.156 align:middle line:90%
hey, this is totally wrong.

00:10:57.156 --> 00:11:02.245 align:middle line:84%
But 99 senators in a panic
passed that legislation.

00:11:02.245 --> 00:11:04.789 align:middle line:84%
So fear and anxiety are not
the place we want to be.

00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:07.208 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that is the
absolute adversary

00:11:07.208 --> 00:11:08.835 align:middle line:84%
for higher states
of consciousness.

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:11.129 align:middle line:84%
The kinds of things we're
seeing in the country today

00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:13.381 align:middle line:84%
are not the kinds of things
that build solutions.

00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:15.592 align:middle line:84%
They're the kinds of things
that exacerbate problems.

00:11:15.592 --> 00:11:19.012 align:middle line:84%
We need a calm sense
of our self so we

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:21.139 align:middle line:84%
can start to analyze
how we see the world

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:22.849 align:middle line:84%
and how we want to
participate in it.

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:25.101 align:middle line:84%
Because the fact
of the matter is,

00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:27.145 align:middle line:90%
we can see significant change.

00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:29.814 align:middle line:84%
What you saw in this
last cycle of elections

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:31.733 align:middle line:90%
was anger manifest.

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:34.485 align:middle line:84%
And whether it was from
the right or from the left,

00:11:34.485 --> 00:11:37.280 align:middle line:84%
people were angry and
mad because of what

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.573 align:middle line:90%
has happened over the last 50--

00:11:38.573 --> 00:11:39.407 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And
they're still angry.

00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:41.576 align:middle line:84%
>>BEGICH: Yeah, and they
still are, because we still

00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:42.577 align:middle line:90%
don't have solutions.

00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:44.537 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: In my earlier
days in television news

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:47.874 align:middle line:84%
as an executive, Nick, we would
use what was called a galvanic

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:52.587 align:middle line:84%
skin testing, where we would
research anchorpeople we wanted

00:11:52.587 --> 00:11:53.671 align:middle line:90%
to hire.

00:11:53.671 --> 00:11:56.090 align:middle line:90%
And we'd hook up the people.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:12:01.012 align:middle line:84%
And if their skin pulsed and
sweated and stuff like that,

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:04.682 align:middle line:84%
this machine would read
that, and we'd say-- even

00:12:04.682 --> 00:12:06.225 align:middle line:84%
with our own gut
instincts, we would

00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:09.020 align:middle line:84%
know if they were good or bad,
but this would back it up.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:09.812 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:12:09.812 --> 00:12:13.858 align:middle line:84%
That person is creating
some kind of energy flow

00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:15.485 align:middle line:90%
to the viewer.

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:18.905 align:middle line:84%
And we'd hire people or not
hire people based on that.

00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:19.739 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BEGICH: Well, and when you
think about energy coming off

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.411 align:middle line:84%
the body, most of us can sense
heat energy, but some of us

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:26.996 align:middle line:84%
can sense a little
bit more than that.

00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:31.542 align:middle line:84%
And when you think about
energy emanating from the body,

00:12:31.542 --> 00:12:33.294 align:middle line:84%
most people think
about different systems

00:12:33.294 --> 00:12:34.087 align:middle line:90%
within the body.

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:37.006 align:middle line:84%
Think about the nervous system
as an energy transfer system.

00:12:37.006 --> 00:12:38.758 align:middle line:90%
And then you have the overlay.

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:41.803 align:middle line:84%
Now, acupuncture has gotten
a lot more credibility

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:43.930 align:middle line:84%
in the last couple of
decades than it used to have.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.431 align:middle line:84%
Because people
didn't understand it.

00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:47.225 align:middle line:84%
Because it didn't line
up with the muscle

00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:50.645 align:middle line:84%
system or the circulatory
system or the nervous system.

00:12:50.645 --> 00:12:51.980 align:middle line:90%
There's a fourth system.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.314 align:middle line:90%
And you can actually measure it.

00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:55.858 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this little
device does that.

00:12:55.858 --> 00:12:56.526 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You want to
hook me up on that?

00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:56.776 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: Yeah.

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:57.860 align:middle line:90%
It's really simple.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.237 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And
explain what it is.

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:01.698 align:middle line:84%
>>BEGICH: What this is, is
this is measuring the skin

00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:04.283 align:middle line:84%
resistance, so it's similar
to what you were using with

00:13:04.283 --> 00:13:05.076 align:middle line:90%
a galvanic--

00:13:05.076 --> 00:13:06.035 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: The galvanic test.

00:13:06.744 --> 00:13:09.205 align:middle line:84%
>>BEGICH: And what this does
is-- each acupuncture point

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:12.208 align:middle line:84%
on the body has a different
electrical characteristic.

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:14.669 align:middle line:84%
So what this does is this
is kind of the ground

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:15.795 align:middle line:90%
to complete a circuit.

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:17.839 align:middle line:90%
So the power goes through you.

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:19.674 align:middle line:90%
It's not generating much.

00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:21.843 align:middle line:84%
I can just demonstrate
it on myself.

00:13:21.843 --> 00:13:23.302 align:middle line:84%
I'm holding the
ground, and there's

00:13:23.302 --> 00:13:25.096 align:middle line:84%
an acupuncture point
located right here

00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:26.514 align:middle line:90%
and another one here.

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:28.474 align:middle line:84%
And so if I move
this over the skin--

that telling you?

00:13:32.562 --> 00:13:34.605 align:middle line:84%
>>BEGICH: That's telling
me that I got the point.

00:13:34.605 --> 00:13:36.691 align:middle line:84%
And so now if I
were a practitioner,

00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:40.319 align:middle line:84%
I could actually hit that point
with a great deal of accuracy.

00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:42.321 align:middle line:90%
Now, there's other devices--

00:13:42.321 --> 00:13:44.240 align:middle line:84%

another spot of your body.

00:13:45.616 --> 00:13:47.994 align:middle line:90%
Different sound.

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:48.911 align:middle line:90%
Nothing now, right?

00:13:48.911 --> 00:13:49.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: No.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.539 align:middle line:84%
And I can turn it down so
it's a little less sensitive.

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:54.167 align:middle line:84%
So only when it hits
the points will it go.

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:55.084 align:middle line:90%

me have the other hand.

00:14:04.927 --> 00:14:08.139 align:middle line:84%
And then this has-- acupuncture

00:14:08.139 --> 00:14:10.600 align:middle line:90%
[BUZZING]

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.726 align:middle line:90%
That time you hit it.

00:14:11.726 --> 00:14:13.352 align:middle line:90%
And so it's used for locating.

00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:18.066 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's other devices
that do a locating activity.

00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:21.569 align:middle line:84%
But what they also do is you
can then depress a signal,

00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:23.196 align:middle line:84%
and now it will send
electrical current

00:14:23.196 --> 00:14:25.406 align:middle line:84%
into that acupuncture point,
having the same effect

00:14:25.406 --> 00:14:26.449 align:middle line:90%
as needling.

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:28.367 align:middle line:84%
But the difference
is with needling

00:14:28.367 --> 00:14:30.828 align:middle line:90%
you have to be right on.

00:14:30.828 --> 00:14:31.788 align:middle line:90%
You can't be out.

00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:34.373 align:middle line:84%
With an electromagnetic field,
you've got about a centimeter--

00:14:34.373 --> 00:14:34.749 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You can
be just in a range--

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:35.665 align:middle line:90%
you've got a range there.

00:14:35.665 --> 00:14:36.876 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: You've got a range.

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:40.046 align:middle line:84%
Because your magnetic field is
still going to hit that point.

00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:41.839 align:middle line:84%
The current is still
going hit that point.

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:43.591 align:middle line:90%
So you stimulate it every time.

00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:46.677 align:middle line:84%
Now, a good friend of
mine, one of my mentors--

00:14:46.677 --> 00:14:48.429 align:middle line:84%
he was an electrophysiologist
in Finland--

00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:52.558 align:middle line:84%
developed a system using
lasers, a class four laser,

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:55.061 align:middle line:84%
doesn't burn you, but it's
a very powerful laser.

00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:56.729 align:middle line:90%
And around it is an electrode.

00:14:56.729 --> 00:15:02.068 align:middle line:84%
And they work in harmony
through harmonics

00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:05.446 align:middle line:84%
to create a really powerful
electromagnetic effect.

00:15:05.446 --> 00:15:07.698 align:middle line:84%
And so you can run it in,
say, through a general point

00:15:07.698 --> 00:15:10.868 align:middle line:84%
on the top of the head, where
it's hitting every major point.

00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:13.454 align:middle line:84%
And the places where
you have dysfunction,

00:15:13.454 --> 00:15:15.456 align:middle line:84%
the primary points
will light up red.

00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:18.417 align:middle line:84%
So like I had at one
time had pneumonia.

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:20.378 align:middle line:84%
So I have one lung
that's got scar tissue.

00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:22.547 align:middle line:84%
So you looked at the
primary lung points,

00:15:22.547 --> 00:15:26.217 align:middle line:84%
and you could see this red
dot about the size of a dime

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:27.552 align:middle line:90%
appear on one side, very bright.

00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:28.177 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Clearly shows up.

00:15:28.177 --> 00:15:28.845 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: And shows up.

00:15:28.845 --> 00:15:30.179 align:middle line:90%
And he's not anywhere near it.

00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:33.182 align:middle line:84%
And it's the way the energy
roll through, hits resistance,

00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:34.684 align:middle line:90%
and then you get feedback.

00:15:34.684 --> 00:15:36.394 align:middle line:84%
And the idea with
acupuncture is just

00:15:36.394 --> 00:15:39.564 align:middle line:84%
to get the energy
flow to work properly.

00:15:39.564 --> 00:15:43.734 align:middle line:84%
And when you think about the
body interacting with energy,

00:15:43.734 --> 00:15:45.361 align:middle line:90%
think about it like a radio.

00:15:45.361 --> 00:15:47.196 align:middle line:84%
You tune through the
stations, and when

00:15:47.196 --> 00:15:49.282 align:middle line:84%
you get resonance, harmony
between the transmitter

00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:49.949 align:middle line:90%
and receiver--

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:51.075 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Or find my show.

00:15:51.075 --> 00:15:51.909 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: Right.

00:15:51.909 --> 00:15:55.079 align:middle line:84%
And then you get the right show,
you get the right frequency.

00:15:55.079 --> 00:15:57.165 align:middle line:84%
The same is true
with every element

00:15:57.165 --> 00:15:59.000 align:middle line:90%
that composes the human body.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.296 align:middle line:84%
Every element, every
atom, every molecule,

00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:07.341 align:middle line:84%
every configuration of a
cell, every body component,

00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:10.052 align:middle line:84%
and the body itself all
have resonant frequencies

00:16:10.052 --> 00:16:11.429 align:middle line:90%
that are unique to them.

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:13.347 align:middle line:84%
So, for instance,
with RF you can

00:16:13.347 --> 00:16:15.516 align:middle line:84%
affect the heart, the liver,
the lungs, the kidneys,

00:16:15.516 --> 00:16:17.810 align:middle line:84%
turn them on, turn them off,
cause them to malfunction.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:18.811 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Positive or negative.

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:20.146 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: Or negative-- right.

00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:22.523 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, it
was the Air Force

00:16:22.523 --> 00:16:24.734 align:middle line:84%
that did work at the
University of Utah on this

00:16:24.734 --> 00:16:27.153 align:middle line:84%
to analyze radio
frequency, as an example.

00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:30.573 align:middle line:84%
But as we've
jumped-- and now it's

00:16:30.573 --> 00:16:33.951 align:middle line:84%
been, what, 22 years I've
been writing on these topics,

00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:36.078 align:middle line:84%
and as you look at
these last two decades,

00:16:36.078 --> 00:16:38.748 align:middle line:84%
and what we were talking
about 22 years ago,

00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:43.502 align:middle line:84%
mainstream is talking about now
in terms of these technologies

00:16:43.502 --> 00:16:44.378 align:middle line:90%
as they move forward.

00:16:44.378 --> 00:16:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And you see little
bits in the news

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.007 align:middle line:84%
every once in a
while, breakthroughs,

00:16:48.007 --> 00:16:50.218 align:middle line:84%
like one of the things that
they're talking about now

00:16:50.218 --> 00:16:52.720 align:middle line:84%
is post-traumatic
stress syndrome

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.473 align:middle line:84%
and the idea of wiping out
the memories associated

00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:57.016 align:middle line:90%
with that stress.

00:16:57.016 --> 00:17:00.019 align:middle line:84%
Now, see, whenever I talk
about that, I get chills.

00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:01.395 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You get
chills on that.

00:17:01.395 --> 00:17:05.191 align:middle line:84%
>>BEGICH: Because fundamentally
stop and think about-- now,

00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:09.528 align:middle line:84%
we have people out there
doing the work of our country

00:17:09.528 --> 00:17:10.988 align:middle line:84%
that we've determined
to have done.

00:17:10.988 --> 00:17:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And whether we agree with
it or not, these people, men

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:14.032 align:middle line:90%
and women--

00:17:14.032 --> 00:17:15.117 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Putting their

00:17:15.117 --> 00:17:16.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BEGICH: These are

These are our
brothers and sisters.

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:19.329 align:middle line:90%
These are people we care about.

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:20.498 align:middle line:90%
And so they go into combat.

00:17:20.498 --> 00:17:21.707 align:middle line:90%
They experience these things.

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:26.337 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they do some things
that they shouldn't have done.

00:17:26.337 --> 00:17:28.547 align:middle line:90%
Should we wipe memory out?

00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:29.966 align:middle line:90%
Is that the real solution?

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:31.759 align:middle line:84%
And what memories do
we decide to wipe out?

00:17:31.759 --> 00:17:34.387 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I was going to
say, once you decide to start

00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:38.641 align:middle line:84%
controlling, who's going to
stop somebody from controlling

00:17:38.641 --> 00:17:39.433 align:middle line:90%
everything?

00:17:39.433 --> 00:17:40.309 align:middle line:84%
>>BEGICH: Or you
get to the point

00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:42.520 align:middle line:84%
where you go, well, those
aren't good memories.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.313 align:middle line:84%
Those aren't the
politically correct things

00:17:44.313 --> 00:17:45.773 align:middle line:84%
we want you to be
thinking about.

00:17:45.773 --> 00:17:46.899 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Let's erase them.

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:47.066 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: Yeah.

00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:50.027 align:middle line:84%
When do we get to that point in
our society and in our culture?

00:17:50.027 --> 00:17:52.071 align:middle line:90%
And are we headed that way?

00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:55.950 align:middle line:84%
Are people more willing to give
up their personal sovereignty

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:59.078 align:middle line:84%
in exchange for some
collective good?

00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:01.455 align:middle line:84%
This is where I think
where some of the anger,

00:18:01.455 --> 00:18:04.333 align:middle line:84%
too, comes in terms of how
our population looks at it.

00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:06.043 align:middle line:90%
Because we feel so manipulated.

00:18:06.043 --> 00:18:07.003 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you feel
manipulated every time

00:18:07.003 --> 00:18:08.504 align:middle line:90%
you turn on the television set.

00:18:08.504 --> 00:18:10.965 align:middle line:84%
Why is the media in
such bad rapport?

00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:13.801 align:middle line:84%
Because people don't
trust it anymore.

00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:14.969 align:middle line:90%
And there's a variety.

00:18:14.969 --> 00:18:16.679 align:middle line:84%
You can get any
information you want now.

00:18:16.679 --> 00:18:18.806 align:middle line:84%
You can go to the internet,
find anything you want.

00:18:18.806 --> 00:18:20.224 align:middle line:84%
You got the
worldwide mind, which

00:18:20.224 --> 00:18:21.934 align:middle line:90%
is really the next evolution.

00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:23.644 align:middle line:84%
Because if you read
the literature-- even

00:18:23.644 --> 00:18:25.563 align:middle line:90%
PBS is talking about this.

00:18:25.563 --> 00:18:27.523 align:middle line:84%
They have a special they
ran a number of years

00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:29.817 align:middle line:84%
ago called "The Worldwide
Mind," where they believe

00:18:29.817 --> 00:18:31.235 align:middle line:84%
the next evolution
of the internet

00:18:31.235 --> 00:18:32.695 align:middle line:84%
is where our minds
are all connected.

00:18:32.695 --> 00:18:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They're all connected.

00:25:00.416 --> 00:25:03.293 align:middle line:84%
with a different set of actors,
a different set of players,

00:25:03.293 --> 00:25:07.256 align:middle line:84%
but the same net result. Freeing
the mind to our own potential

00:25:07.256 --> 00:25:08.632 align:middle line:90%
is where the answers lie.

00:25:08.632 --> 00:25:10.300 align:middle line:90%
Each of us has that potential.

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.219 align:middle line:84%
Every major revolution,
every evolution

00:25:12.219 --> 00:25:13.971 align:middle line:84%
is started with one
or two people thinking

00:25:13.971 --> 00:25:16.640 align:middle line:84%
a little differently, whether
it's in art, science, business,

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.474 align:middle line:90%
politics.

00:25:17.474 --> 00:25:18.851 align:middle line:90%
The same is true today.

00:25:18.851 --> 00:25:21.854 align:middle line:84%
We need a higher caliber of
leaders that engage the mind.

00:25:21.854 --> 00:25:24.940 align:middle line:84%
They use the mind in a way
that's not for manipulation,

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:26.942 align:middle line:84%
but to enhance our
performance so we can make

00:25:26.942 --> 00:25:28.402 align:middle line:90%
better collective judgments.

00:25:28.402 --> 00:25:29.653 align:middle line:90%
That's what changes the world.

00:25:29.653 --> 00:25:32.948 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: In a perfect world,
Nick, that would be great.

00:25:32.948 --> 00:25:35.409 align:middle line:90%
But they're going to abuse this.

00:25:35.409 --> 00:25:36.201 align:middle line:90%
Aren't they?

00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:37.244 align:middle line:84%
>>BEGICH: There's
a lot of abuse.

00:25:37.244 --> 00:25:39.204 align:middle line:84%
And here's what's exciting
from my perspective.

00:25:39.204 --> 00:25:41.415 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the great research
that's coming out of this

00:25:41.415 --> 00:25:42.791 align:middle line:90%
isn't in governmental labs.

00:25:42.791 --> 00:25:45.169 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of independent
people figuring this out.

00:25:45.169 --> 00:25:46.503 align:middle line:90%
And you see more and more of it.

00:25:46.503 --> 00:25:47.921 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
I would say is

00:25:47.921 --> 00:25:49.214 align:middle line:90%
it's not about the technology.

00:25:49.214 --> 00:25:51.341 align:middle line:84%
These are natural
attributes that we all have

00:25:51.341 --> 00:25:52.551 align:middle line:90%
that we can enhance.

00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:54.261 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots of
disciplines out there

00:25:54.261 --> 00:25:56.513 align:middle line:90%
that lead us in that direction.

00:25:56.513 --> 00:25:59.099 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're going to see
more of that as time moves on.

00:25:59.099 --> 00:26:01.643 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't take a mob.

00:26:01.643 --> 00:26:03.604 align:middle line:90%
It only takes a few.

00:26:03.604 --> 00:26:04.438 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:26:04.438 --> 00:26:07.316 align:middle line:84%
And every major thing that's
ever happened on this planet

00:26:07.316 --> 00:26:10.444 align:middle line:84%
happened with a few seeing it
just a little bit differently.

00:26:10.444 --> 00:26:12.070 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's what we need.

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:14.990 align:middle line:84%
We need leadership that can see
it a little bit differently.

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:17.284 align:middle line:84%
But we also need to
recognize technologies

00:26:17.284 --> 00:26:19.286 align:middle line:90%
are sort of the backdrop.

00:26:19.286 --> 00:26:22.331 align:middle line:84%
We always try to duplicate
nature with our technology.

00:26:22.331 --> 00:26:25.083 align:middle line:84%
But some of these things that
we naturally have maybe are off

00:26:25.083 --> 00:26:26.376 align:middle line:90%
limits or should be off limits.

00:26:26.376 --> 00:26:29.129 align:middle line:84%
Controlling other people's
thought processes, in my view,

00:26:29.129 --> 00:26:30.339 align:middle line:90%
should be off limits.

00:26:30.339 --> 00:26:33.175 align:middle line:84%
Owning our digital data
in terms of the internet.

00:26:33.175 --> 00:26:34.635 align:middle line:84%
No longer is your
personal life--

00:26:34.635 --> 00:26:35.636 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's not ours.

00:26:35.636 --> 00:26:36.303 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: No.

00:26:36.303 --> 00:26:36.762 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's not ours.

00:26:36.762 --> 00:26:38.514 align:middle line:84%
>>BEGICH: You go
into your house,

00:26:38.514 --> 00:26:40.933 align:middle line:84%
and your house is your
home of privacy, right?

00:26:40.933 --> 00:26:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Everything in it is
supposed to be private.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:42.768 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Supposed to be.

00:26:42.768 --> 00:26:43.936 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: Right.

00:26:43.936 --> 00:26:49.024 align:middle line:84%
Today, your digital doorway is
your house in the 21st century.

00:26:49.024 --> 00:26:51.693 align:middle line:84%
And this generation needs
to protect that house

00:26:51.693 --> 00:26:54.321 align:middle line:84%
as much as you protected the
threshold of your doorway.

00:26:54.321 --> 00:26:56.323 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: God knows
what they know about us.

00:26:56.323 --> 00:26:56.865 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: Exactly.

00:26:56.865 --> 00:26:57.699 align:middle line:90%
And they shouldn't.

00:26:57.699 --> 00:26:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And commercial interests
shouldn't have it, either.

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:01.745 align:middle line:84%
And once a transaction
is complete

00:27:01.745 --> 00:27:04.331 align:middle line:84%
and the ability to dispute
the transaction is complete,

00:27:04.331 --> 00:27:05.499 align:middle line:90%
the data ought to be wiped.

00:27:05.499 --> 00:27:07.668 align:middle line:84%
And they ought not to be
able to get our permission.

00:27:07.668 --> 00:27:08.377 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: But it's not.

00:27:08.377 --> 00:27:09.086 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: No, it's not.

00:27:09.086 --> 00:27:09.545 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: But it's not.

00:27:09.545 --> 00:27:11.713 align:middle line:84%
>>BEGICH: And this
is, again, the change

00:27:11.713 --> 00:27:14.383 align:middle line:84%
in our technology, which
has been used to manipulate.

00:27:14.383 --> 00:27:16.969 align:middle line:84%
No one is standing up for the
little guy, which is again

00:27:16.969 --> 00:27:19.596 align:middle line:84%
where that anger comes from that
we see across the country in so

00:27:19.596 --> 00:27:20.514 align:middle line:90%
many different areas.

00:27:20.514 --> 00:27:22.558 align:middle line:84%
No one is standing
up for little guy.

00:27:22.558 --> 00:27:23.392 align:middle line:90%
They rationalize it.

00:27:23.392 --> 00:27:24.935 align:middle line:84%
Oh, we need it for
national security.

00:27:24.935 --> 00:27:26.562 align:middle line:84%
We need it for better
commercial sales.

00:27:26.562 --> 00:27:28.272 align:middle line:84%
We need it for this,
we need it for that.

00:27:28.272 --> 00:27:31.108 align:middle line:84%
What we need is the maintenance
of our personal liberty

00:27:31.108 --> 00:27:32.526 align:middle line:84%
and freedom so that
we can continue

00:27:32.526 --> 00:27:35.737 align:middle line:84%
to have a productive
dialogue and maybe get back

00:27:35.737 --> 00:27:38.657 align:middle line:84%
to a more productive dialogue,
not just in this country,

00:27:38.657 --> 00:27:39.533 align:middle line:90%
but around the world.

00:27:39.533 --> 00:27:41.869 align:middle line:84%
What we saw in the United
States is not unique.

00:27:41.869 --> 00:27:44.538 align:middle line:84%
This is happening
in every place I go.

00:27:44.538 --> 00:27:46.248 align:middle line:84%
On one level or
another, people are

00:27:46.248 --> 00:27:48.584 align:middle line:84%
angry because we've
been forgotten.

00:27:48.584 --> 00:27:51.587 align:middle line:84%
And it's time to wake
up in a different way

00:27:51.587 --> 00:27:53.046 align:middle line:84%
with a different
consciousness, not

00:27:53.046 --> 00:27:55.424 align:middle line:84%
one based on anger
and fear, but based

00:27:55.424 --> 00:27:58.927 align:middle line:84%
on thinking, based on progress,
and recognizing that today we

00:27:58.927 --> 00:28:00.888 align:middle line:84%
can even group fund
individual work.

00:28:00.888 --> 00:28:03.390 align:middle line:84%
There's people getting funding
for projects that would never

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:04.892 align:middle line:90%
have gotten funding before.

00:28:04.892 --> 00:28:06.852 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of
opportunity for change

00:28:06.852 --> 00:28:08.896 align:middle line:84%
as much as there
is for disaster.

00:28:08.896 --> 00:28:11.023 align:middle line:84%
And whenever you see
the pendulum swinging

00:28:11.023 --> 00:28:13.358 align:middle line:84%
this far in one direction,
it's the opportunity

00:28:13.358 --> 00:28:14.943 align:middle line:90%
to swing it back the other way.

00:28:14.943 --> 00:28:17.738 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Nick, let's look
at how this can be applied

00:28:17.738 --> 00:28:22.242 align:middle line:90%
to medical applications.

00:28:22.242 --> 00:28:24.077 align:middle line:90%
>> Capsule has magnets inside.

00:28:24.077 --> 00:28:28.165 align:middle line:84%
And another external magnet
can exert force on his capsule.

00:28:28.165 --> 00:28:30.876 align:middle line:84%
And inside your body,
this can be navigated.

00:28:30.876 --> 00:28:33.337 align:middle line:84%
So it can roll
inside your stomach.

00:28:33.337 --> 00:28:34.671 align:middle line:90%
It can be stopped.

00:28:34.671 --> 00:28:38.467 align:middle line:84%
It can go backward and
forward as a robot.

00:28:38.467 --> 00:28:41.011 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, how would
you put it in you?

00:28:41.011 --> 00:28:41.887 align:middle line:90%
>> So you swallow it.

00:28:41.887 --> 00:28:42.804 align:middle line:90%
So it's a pill size.

00:28:42.804 --> 00:28:43.597 align:middle line:90%
>> You swallow it?

00:28:43.597 --> 00:28:44.389 align:middle line:90%
>> So, yeah.

00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:48.185 align:middle line:84%
This is completely mindless
robot, as you see in the video.

00:28:48.185 --> 00:28:52.314 align:middle line:84%
It's made out of a soft
material so that it can deform,

00:28:52.314 --> 00:28:54.608 align:middle line:84%
and it's very safe to
use, as you mentioned.

00:28:54.608 --> 00:28:57.194 align:middle line:84%
Safety is our first
rule about the design.

00:28:57.194 --> 00:29:01.156 align:middle line:84%
And by rolling inside your
stomach's tissue surface,

00:29:01.156 --> 00:29:02.866 align:middle line:90%
the doctor can stop it.

00:29:02.866 --> 00:29:05.077 align:middle line:84%
And then by controlling
the external force,

00:29:05.077 --> 00:29:06.578 align:middle line:90%
you can indeed eject a drug.

00:29:06.578 --> 00:29:08.413 align:middle line:84%
Here you see this blue
thing is [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:08.413 --> 00:29:08.538 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:29:08.538 --> 00:29:10.582 align:middle line:84%
It spilled-- it made
little pee or something.

00:29:10.582 --> 00:29:12.209 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:12.209 --> 00:29:13.251 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:29:13.251 --> 00:29:15.796 align:middle line:90%
And it can do this many times.

00:29:15.796 --> 00:29:18.882 align:middle line:84%
And it can actively
image your body

00:29:18.882 --> 00:29:22.427 align:middle line:84%
so that you can see
where you want exactly.

00:29:22.427 --> 00:29:24.554 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What an amazing
little tiny machine.

00:29:24.554 --> 00:29:25.055 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: Right.

00:29:25.055 --> 00:29:27.307 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to see them
get smaller and smaller.

00:29:27.307 --> 00:29:29.476 align:middle line:84%
And this is, again, the
nature of the technology.

00:29:29.476 --> 00:29:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And when you think about the
convergence of technology,

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:34.022 align:middle line:84%
nanotechnologies that
take devices and make

00:29:34.022 --> 00:29:36.650 align:middle line:84%
them very small-- when
you take computing

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:39.486 align:middle line:84%
power as an example and
the speed of computing--

00:29:39.486 --> 00:29:41.196 align:middle line:84%
and this is the big
change that's coming.

00:29:41.196 --> 00:29:44.282 align:middle line:84%
This is where all of it falls
into a whole other niche,

00:29:44.282 --> 00:29:47.202 align:middle line:84%
is when you think about
supercomputing today, we

00:29:47.202 --> 00:29:50.789 align:middle line:84%
do I think 280, 300
teraflops a second,

00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:53.041 align:middle line:84%
which is like
everybody on the planet

00:29:53.041 --> 00:29:57.671 align:middle line:84%
with a calculator for 60 hours
doing calculations in a second.

00:29:57.671 --> 00:30:02.968 align:middle line:84%
Now, the computers
that are coming

00:30:02.968 --> 00:30:07.639 align:middle line:84%
will do what a supercomputer
does in a trillion years in one

00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:08.598 align:middle line:90%
hour.

00:30:08.598 --> 00:30:09.725 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: In one an hour.

00:30:09.725 --> 00:30:10.308 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: In one hour.

00:30:10.308 --> 00:30:10.684 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Amazing.

00:30:10.684 --> 00:30:13.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BEGICH: Now, this changes
everything about everything.

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.564 align:middle line:84%
Because whoever reaches
that threshold first,

00:30:15.564 --> 00:30:17.774 align:middle line:90%
encryption becomes obsolete.

00:30:17.774 --> 00:30:18.567 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:30:18.567 --> 00:30:20.527 align:middle line:84%
Because that amount
of computing power

00:30:20.527 --> 00:30:22.946 align:middle line:84%
can rip anything
apart as far as-- when

00:30:22.946 --> 00:30:24.698 align:middle line:84%
you think about
controlling-- whoever

00:30:24.698 --> 00:30:28.535 align:middle line:84%
gets there first-- whoever
gets there first on quantum

00:30:28.535 --> 00:30:30.704 align:middle line:90%
computing wins.

00:30:30.704 --> 00:30:34.082 align:middle line:84%
Because you have control of
every electromagnetic system

00:30:34.082 --> 00:30:36.668 align:middle line:84%
that has an entry point
through a data point.

00:30:36.668 --> 00:30:38.754 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Has somebody
already gotten there first?

00:30:38.754 --> 00:30:40.005 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: Maybe.

00:30:40.005 --> 00:30:41.965 align:middle line:84%
Some have said
that our government

00:30:41.965 --> 00:30:43.175 align:middle line:90%
has reached that stage.

00:30:43.175 --> 00:30:45.677 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that we have.

00:30:45.677 --> 00:30:46.762 align:middle line:90%
But we're close.

00:30:46.762 --> 00:30:49.056 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you consider
the kinds of experiments

00:30:49.056 --> 00:30:51.558 align:middle line:84%
that are going on,
monitoring the brain activity

00:30:51.558 --> 00:30:53.852 align:middle line:90%
requires huge computing power.

00:30:53.852 --> 00:30:55.687 align:middle line:84%
This will allow it
so that you could

00:30:55.687 --> 00:30:58.690 align:middle line:84%
take those complex signals
and then generate signals just

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:01.818 align:middle line:84%
like them and push them
into a specific individual.

00:31:01.818 --> 00:31:04.154 align:middle line:84%
This is where DARPA
has spent money

00:31:04.154 --> 00:31:06.740 align:middle line:84%
doing work for our
government researching

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:09.868 align:middle line:84%
these very things for the
idea of training people.

00:31:09.868 --> 00:31:12.662 align:middle line:84%
So you get your training
and download of a language--

00:31:12.662 --> 00:31:15.582 align:middle line:84%
just right out of
science fiction,

00:31:15.582 --> 00:31:18.877 align:middle line:84%
where you can go and get
that kind of direct feed

00:31:18.877 --> 00:31:19.669 align:middle line:90%
into the brain.

00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:20.545 align:middle line:90%
That's what they're working on.

00:31:20.545 --> 00:31:21.755 align:middle line:90%
That's what the objective is.

00:31:21.755 --> 00:31:23.173 align:middle line:90%
That's the goal.

00:31:23.173 --> 00:31:25.133 align:middle line:84%
At the same time to
take your adversaries

00:31:25.133 --> 00:31:26.593 align:middle line:84%
and disrupt their
mental processes,

00:31:26.593 --> 00:31:28.428 align:middle line:84%
they can't even
operate the equipment

00:31:28.428 --> 00:31:31.765 align:middle line:84%
that they're responsible
for-- this is where

00:31:31.765 --> 00:31:33.433 align:middle line:90%
the sinister side pops out.

00:31:33.433 --> 00:31:36.103 align:middle line:84%
Because you can
rationalize it in one way,

00:31:36.103 --> 00:31:39.815 align:middle line:84%
but think about teaching your
kids in 30 years from now

00:31:39.815 --> 00:31:41.566 align:middle line:90%
as this technology moves down.

00:31:41.566 --> 00:31:44.236 align:middle line:84%
So you go to school, and instead
of getting a lesson that you

00:31:44.236 --> 00:31:47.781 align:middle line:90%
interact with, you get a feed.

00:31:47.781 --> 00:31:49.116 align:middle line:90%
Who controls that curriculum?

00:31:49.116 --> 00:31:50.909 align:middle line:84%
Who decides what goes
into your kid's head?

00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:50.992 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:31:50.992 --> 00:31:53.078 align:middle line:84%
Or when you go to sleep,
they just feed it to you.

00:31:53.078 --> 00:31:55.539 align:middle line:84%
>>BEGICH: Or what about being
able to wipe out a memory

00:31:55.539 --> 00:31:56.915 align:middle line:90%
or give you a new one?

00:31:56.915 --> 00:31:59.793 align:middle line:84%
Which is the work of the
electromagnetic directorate

00:31:59.793 --> 00:32:01.461 align:middle line:84%
of the Air Force in
a publication called

00:32:01.461 --> 00:32:02.045 align:middle line:90%
"Technology Rises."

00:32:02.045 --> 00:32:03.213 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Wipe out total memory.

00:32:03.213 --> 00:32:03.463 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: Yeah.

00:32:03.463 --> 00:32:04.756 align:middle line:84%
Take a memory out
and put a new one in.

00:32:04.756 --> 00:32:05.966 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Because
we are only memory.

00:32:05.966 --> 00:32:06.508 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: Right.

00:32:06.508 --> 00:32:08.927 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's face it. if I
wake up in the morning and I

00:32:08.927 --> 00:32:11.138 align:middle line:84%
think I'm Nick Begich
and somebody has fed that

00:32:11.138 --> 00:32:12.639 align:middle line:90%
into my brain, that's who I am.

00:32:12.639 --> 00:32:13.431 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: Yeah.

00:32:13.431 --> 00:32:15.016 align:middle line:84%
But think about it
from the standpoint

00:32:15.016 --> 00:32:17.102 align:middle line:90%
of evidence in a trial.

00:32:17.102 --> 00:32:17.978 align:middle line:90%
Did you see that?

00:32:17.978 --> 00:32:19.146 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah, I saw that.

00:32:19.146 --> 00:32:21.314 align:middle line:90%
You'll swear to it.

00:32:21.314 --> 00:32:23.817 align:middle line:84%
This changes everything
about everything.

00:32:23.817 --> 00:32:27.195 align:middle line:84%
This is why it is so important
to look at these technologies

00:32:27.195 --> 00:32:30.157 align:middle line:84%
now while they're still-- I
wouldn't say in their infancy,

00:32:30.157 --> 00:32:32.951 align:middle line:84%
but they're in their
teenage years, OK?

00:32:32.951 --> 00:32:34.494 align:middle line:84%
They're a little
reckless. [CHUCKLES]

00:32:34.494 --> 00:32:35.579 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's kind
of frightening, Nick.

00:32:35.579 --> 00:32:36.288 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: And it is.

00:32:36.288 --> 00:32:36.913 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's kind
of frightening.

00:32:36.913 --> 00:32:38.081 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: It is frightening.

00:32:38.081 --> 00:32:40.625 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, the awareness

00:32:40.625 --> 00:32:43.295 align:middle line:84%
of it, the fact that it's
happening, become aware of it,

00:32:43.295 --> 00:32:45.964 align:middle line:84%
look at the technologies,
become more critical of them.

00:32:45.964 --> 00:32:49.134 align:middle line:84%
But the key element is
look at those things that

00:32:49.134 --> 00:32:51.553 align:middle line:84%
enhance your own
performance, that you can do,

00:32:51.553 --> 00:32:55.140 align:middle line:84%
the simple things you can
do To dissipate anxiety,

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:58.185 align:middle line:84%
to dissipate fear so that you
can function at your highest

00:32:58.185 --> 00:32:58.977 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:32:58.977 --> 00:33:00.854 align:middle line:84%
And then look for those
technologies that enhance that,

00:33:00.854 --> 00:33:01.730 align:middle line:90%
because they're out there.

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:03.190 align:middle line:84%
There's light and
sound device that

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:05.817 align:middle line:84%
can be used for enhancing
meditation, enhancing sleep,

00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:07.736 align:middle line:90%
concentration, super learning.

00:33:07.736 --> 00:33:09.571 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of
technologies that

00:33:09.571 --> 00:33:13.200 align:middle line:84%
are designed to do that so that
you can reach a better state

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.826 align:middle line:84%
and then continue to
evolve [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:14.826 --> 00:33:16.828 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, let's
look at some of the neuro-

00:33:16.828 --> 00:33:21.416 align:middle line:84%
and biofeedback with
this kind of technology.

00:33:21.416 --> 00:33:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>> --And neurofeedback refer
to technology which enables us

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:30.008 align:middle line:84%
to literally see what the
body is doing in real time.

00:33:30.008 --> 00:33:31.676 align:middle line:84%
It's like having a
mirror in which we

00:33:31.676 --> 00:33:34.012 align:middle line:84%
can see the
physiological signals

00:33:34.012 --> 00:33:37.015 align:middle line:90%
of the mind-body system.

00:33:37.015 --> 00:33:39.893 align:middle line:84%
And this enables us
to notice and learn

00:33:39.893 --> 00:33:43.939 align:middle line:84%
how to gain control over our
physiological state, our stress

00:33:43.939 --> 00:33:46.816 align:middle line:84%
levels, attention,
and performance.

00:33:49.611 --> 00:33:50.987 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I love
this technology.

00:33:50.987 --> 00:33:52.364 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: Biofeedback is great.

00:33:52.364 --> 00:33:54.366 align:middle line:84%
And they're using it in
a lot of different ways.

00:33:54.366 --> 00:33:57.035 align:middle line:84%
ADD, Attention Deficit Disorder,
they're using biofeedback.

00:33:57.035 --> 00:34:00.247 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So it does help a lot
in applications, doesn't it?

00:34:00.247 --> 00:34:02.707 align:middle line:84%
>>BEGICH: It is so good
for so many things.

00:34:02.707 --> 00:34:04.876 align:middle line:84%
I mean, with young kids
and learning disabilities

00:34:04.876 --> 00:34:06.253 align:middle line:84%
where we're
medicating them, they

00:34:06.253 --> 00:34:08.964 align:middle line:84%
have found that if
they can take a child

00:34:08.964 --> 00:34:12.842 align:middle line:84%
in 30 to 45 one-hour sessions
with neurobiofeedback,

00:34:12.842 --> 00:34:14.844 align:middle line:84%
where they have an
interaction with a machine,

00:34:14.844 --> 00:34:16.679 align:middle line:84%
so they can get a
bouncing ball or some kind

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:18.348 align:middle line:84%
of a visual effect,
and they learn

00:34:18.348 --> 00:34:22.601 align:middle line:84%
how to do that, within
30 to 45 sessions

00:34:22.601 --> 00:34:24.478 align:middle line:84%
they don't need
the device anymore.

00:34:24.478 --> 00:34:25.688 align:middle line:90%
They don't need the coaching.

00:34:25.688 --> 00:34:26.273 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They're
doing it on their own.

00:34:26.273 --> 00:34:27.357 align:middle line:84%
>>BEGICH: They've learned
how to do it on their own,

00:34:27.357 --> 00:34:30.360 align:middle line:84%
something that most of
us can't even do at will,

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:31.860 align:middle line:84%
get right into
that learning zone.

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:33.029 align:middle line:90%
Well, they can do it.

00:34:33.029 --> 00:34:34.697 align:middle line:84%
And they don't need
medications anymore.

00:34:34.697 --> 00:34:36.449 align:middle line:84%
They don't have things
that are destroying

00:34:36.449 --> 00:34:37.784 align:middle line:90%
the kidneys in the liver.

00:34:37.784 --> 00:34:38.994 align:middle line:90%
They're free of it.

00:34:38.994 --> 00:34:41.454 align:middle line:84%
And they're absolutely in
control of their own brain

00:34:41.454 --> 00:34:41.579 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:34:41.579 --> 00:34:43.581 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I've seen a
little kid, two years old,

00:34:43.581 --> 00:34:47.418 align:middle line:84%
playing a video game on a
smartphone that I can't even

00:34:47.418 --> 00:34:48.420 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:49.462 align:middle line:90%
How do they do this?

00:34:49.462 --> 00:34:51.214 align:middle line:84%
Their brains are
conditioned, aren't they?

00:34:51.214 --> 00:34:53.216 align:middle line:84%
>>BEGICH: Well, and they're
younger and younger.

00:34:53.216 --> 00:34:54.926 align:middle line:84%
What's happening with
younger children is

00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:56.511 align:middle line:84%
they're getting
exposed technologies,

00:34:56.511 --> 00:34:58.722 align:middle line:84%
and they become
almost-- I mean, it's

00:34:58.722 --> 00:35:01.141 align:middle line:84%
as natural as riding
a bicycle after riding

00:35:01.141 --> 00:35:01.975 align:middle line:90%
it a couple of time.

00:35:01.975 --> 00:35:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's amazing.

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:04.185 align:middle line:84%
You watch a little two-year-old
just doing their thing.

00:35:04.185 --> 00:35:05.603 align:middle line:84%
>>BEGICH: It's
amazing to me, too.

00:35:05.603 --> 00:35:08.064 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
at the technologies,

00:35:08.064 --> 00:35:10.525 align:middle line:84%
again, in terms of
where we're headed,

00:35:10.525 --> 00:35:14.237 align:middle line:84%
the technologies are used
to damage human beings

00:35:14.237 --> 00:35:17.991 align:middle line:84%
by military planners
for obvious purposes.

00:35:17.991 --> 00:35:19.200 align:middle line:90%
That is their mission.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.078 align:middle line:84%
But the same basic
mechanisms that they discover

00:35:22.078 --> 00:35:25.665 align:middle line:84%
about human physiology and about
how the system actually works

00:35:25.665 --> 00:35:29.586 align:middle line:84%
are so valuable in the other
areas, the healing arts,

00:35:29.586 --> 00:35:32.297 align:middle line:84%
that this is where we're
losing some of that dimension.

00:35:32.297 --> 00:35:34.174 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of things
become classified,

00:35:34.174 --> 00:35:36.885 align:middle line:84%
you wait years, maybe
decades, before they finally

00:35:36.885 --> 00:35:39.220 align:middle line:84%
get released and
you can use them,

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:40.638 align:middle line:90%
particularly in this area.

00:35:40.638 --> 00:35:44.642 align:middle line:84%
Electromedicine, the idea of
using electromagnetic fields

00:35:44.642 --> 00:35:46.644 align:middle line:84%
for effecting
health, is something

00:35:46.644 --> 00:35:49.356 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing exploding
all over the world,

00:35:49.356 --> 00:35:51.649 align:middle line:90%
more so now than ever before.

00:35:51.649 --> 00:35:54.152 align:middle line:84%
But I can go back to
the mid '80s, even,

00:35:54.152 --> 00:35:57.322 align:middle line:84%
and talk about technologies I
saw operating in Europe that

00:35:57.322 --> 00:36:02.118 align:middle line:84%
were quite amazing in this
area of electromedicine.

00:36:02.118 --> 00:36:05.080 align:middle line:84%
What we saw in the earlier
clip about the little--

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.456 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Robot,
whatever it was.

00:36:06.456 --> 00:36:08.625 align:middle line:84%
>>BEGICH: --probe, swallow
it, and it analyzes

00:36:08.625 --> 00:36:10.627 align:middle line:84%
and can dispense
medications and has cameras

00:36:10.627 --> 00:36:14.422 align:middle line:84%
and-- these are the 21st
century technologies

00:36:14.422 --> 00:36:15.632 align:middle line:90%
that we can expect to see.

00:36:15.632 --> 00:36:18.385 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully some
of these actually

00:36:18.385 --> 00:36:21.054 align:middle line:84%
drive costs down and
get visibility up

00:36:21.054 --> 00:36:23.807 align:middle line:84%
and actually head towards
curative scenarios rather than

00:36:23.807 --> 00:36:25.308 align:middle line:84%
maintenance of
symptoms scenarios

00:36:25.308 --> 00:36:27.560 align:middle line:84%
that we've seen in the
pharmaceutical direction

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:27.852 align:middle line:90%
that we've gone.

00:36:27.852 --> 00:36:30.063 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, if it works,
it's going to work well.

00:36:30.063 --> 00:36:31.815 align:middle line:84%
But if it doesn't
or if it's abused,

00:36:31.815 --> 00:36:33.024 align:middle line:90%
it could really backfire.

00:36:33.024 --> 00:36:35.276 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: And this is it.

00:36:35.276 --> 00:36:36.820 align:middle line:84%
Like all things, I
mean, an airplane

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:38.279 align:middle line:90%
can deliver your mail or a bomb.

00:36:38.279 --> 00:36:39.280 align:middle line:90%
Depends on the operator.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.156 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Good point.

00:36:40.156 --> 00:36:42.992 align:middle line:84%
Some questions for you have
been e-mailed in, Nick.

00:36:42.992 --> 00:36:44.994 align:middle line:84%
Benny from Salt Lake
City, how do you

00:36:44.994 --> 00:36:48.248 align:middle line:84%
feel about our government's
use of this kind of technology?

00:36:48.248 --> 00:36:50.333 align:middle line:84%
>>BEGICH: Well, I mean,
at this point it's misuse,

00:36:50.333 --> 00:36:51.709 align:middle line:90%
is probably the better phrase.

00:36:51.709 --> 00:36:57.215 align:middle line:84%
And I consider this
the most invasive area

00:36:57.215 --> 00:37:00.468 align:middle line:84%
of government
interference of anything

00:37:00.468 --> 00:37:02.512 align:middle line:84%
that we've ever
imagined, the idea

00:37:02.512 --> 00:37:04.639 align:middle line:84%
of affecting people's
free will, affecting

00:37:04.639 --> 00:37:06.099 align:middle line:84%
people's consciousness
is something

00:37:06.099 --> 00:37:09.018 align:middle line:84%
that most religious traditions
say God won't even do,

00:37:09.018 --> 00:37:11.146 align:middle line:84%
but governments think
they have a right to.

00:37:11.146 --> 00:37:14.399 align:middle line:84%
This needs to be eliminated
from the thinking

00:37:14.399 --> 00:37:15.608 align:middle line:90%
of military planners.

00:37:15.608 --> 00:37:18.695 align:middle line:84%
This is no longer and
should not be an option.

00:37:18.695 --> 00:37:19.946 align:middle line:90%
This should be a non-option.

00:37:19.946 --> 00:37:21.739 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: In a perfect
world, it should be.

00:37:21.739 --> 00:37:23.241 align:middle line:84%
>>BEGICH: Just like
blinding lasers

00:37:23.241 --> 00:37:26.077 align:middle line:84%
were decided to be a
non-option, just like using gas

00:37:26.077 --> 00:37:27.370 align:middle line:90%
in a battlefield.

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:29.956 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately, most
times it's not used.

00:37:29.956 --> 00:37:32.208 align:middle line:84%
These are the kinds of
restrictions I'm talking about,

00:37:32.208 --> 00:37:34.752 align:middle line:84%
where at least
most of the time we

00:37:34.752 --> 00:37:37.547 align:middle line:90%
have some sort of regulation.

00:37:37.547 --> 00:37:41.843 align:middle line:84%
And I would say along with
that the penalties for misuse

00:37:41.843 --> 00:37:44.596 align:middle line:84%
ought to be hard and
severe, and there

00:37:44.596 --> 00:37:45.680 align:middle line:90%
ought to be no exemptions.

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:46.473 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I agree.

00:37:46.473 --> 00:37:49.517 align:middle line:84%
>>BEGICH: Because that's
where-- you cross that line,

00:37:49.517 --> 00:37:52.395 align:middle line:84%
you're crossing a line
that God won't cross.

00:37:52.395 --> 00:37:54.981 align:middle line:84%
There needs to be a penalty, and
people need to understand it.

00:37:54.981 --> 00:37:55.899 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Good point.

00:37:55.899 --> 00:37:58.193 align:middle line:84%
Shannon from
Louisville, Kentucky,

00:37:58.193 --> 00:38:01.488 align:middle line:84%
do you think there is a big
controversy going on regarding

00:38:01.488 --> 00:38:02.989 align:middle line:90%
this kind of technology?

00:38:02.989 --> 00:38:03.781 align:middle line:90%
Obviously yes.

00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:04.783 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: Obviously yes.

00:38:04.783 --> 00:38:06.993 align:middle line:84%
And I think more so
now than ever before.

00:38:06.993 --> 00:38:10.788 align:middle line:84%
We were able to take this in in
the late '90s in the European

00:38:10.788 --> 00:38:12.999 align:middle line:84%
Parliament when we were
dealing with the HAARP issue.

00:38:12.999 --> 00:38:17.629 align:middle line:84%
And we got one line in
their military disarmament

00:38:17.629 --> 00:38:21.382 align:middle line:84%
and their biggest
resolution they ever passed

00:38:21.382 --> 00:38:22.884 align:middle line:90%
on military, multi-page thing.

00:38:22.884 --> 00:38:24.594 align:middle line:90%
It had five or six paragraphs.

00:38:24.594 --> 00:38:27.764 align:middle line:84%
And one was on the
manipulation of the human mind.

00:38:27.764 --> 00:38:30.433 align:middle line:84%
And the declaration
basically said, look,

00:38:30.433 --> 00:38:32.602 align:middle line:84%
we need treaty dialogue,
and we need to pursue this.

00:38:32.602 --> 00:38:34.562 align:middle line:84%
And they did through
the science directorate

00:38:34.562 --> 00:38:35.688 align:middle line:90%
of the European Parliament.

00:38:35.688 --> 00:38:37.232 align:middle line:90%
They looked into some of this.

00:38:37.232 --> 00:38:40.401 align:middle line:84%
And there is dialogue going
on at pretty high levels,

00:38:40.401 --> 00:38:41.903 align:middle line:84%
just from what
I'm familiar with.

00:38:41.903 --> 00:38:44.072 align:middle line:84%
And I know internally
in organizations,

00:38:44.072 --> 00:38:47.742 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of debate about
what's right, what's wrong.

00:38:47.742 --> 00:38:50.662 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately,
national security tends

00:38:50.662 --> 00:38:53.373 align:middle line:84%
to trump a lot of
times judgments

00:38:53.373 --> 00:38:55.458 align:middle line:84%
that other people might
make a little differently.

00:38:55.458 --> 00:38:56.834 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we see it
in our country.

00:38:56.834 --> 00:39:00.505 align:middle line:84%
We see torture, kidnapping,
extortion, blackmail.

00:39:00.505 --> 00:39:03.800 align:middle line:84%
That's our government
in operation, right?

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.093 align:middle line:90%
Where do we draw the lines?

00:39:05.093 --> 00:39:08.346 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's where people
are increasingly concerned

00:39:08.346 --> 00:39:09.597 align:middle line:90%
about this area of technology.

00:39:09.597 --> 00:39:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, let's
hope it's never abused.

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:11.850 align:middle line:90%
But it will be.

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:13.017 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: It will be abused.

00:39:13.017 --> 00:39:14.602 align:middle line:90%
It has been abused historically.

00:39:14.602 --> 00:39:16.271 align:middle line:90%
I don't think that will stop.

00:39:16.271 --> 00:39:20.483 align:middle line:84%
In fact, even the Navy protocol
on human experimentation

00:39:20.483 --> 00:39:24.445 align:middle line:84%
that was passed in 2006--
I have it on my website.

00:39:24.445 --> 00:39:27.615 align:middle line:84%
And it says right
in there, it takes

00:39:27.615 --> 00:39:30.785 align:middle line:84%
the Deputy Secretary of
the Navy to approve them,

00:39:30.785 --> 00:39:33.288 align:middle line:84%
but they still have
the right to approve--

00:39:33.288 --> 00:39:34.706 align:middle line:84%
and they say that
in these words--

00:39:34.706 --> 00:39:36.165 align:middle line:90%
mind control experiments.

00:39:36.165 --> 00:39:38.334 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Nick, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:39:38.334 --> 00:39:39.419 align:middle line:90%
>>BEGICH: Thanks for having me.

00:39:39.419 --> 00:39:41.546 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's called
"Controlling the Human Mind."

00:39:41.546 --> 00:39:44.090 align:middle line:90%
It's been going on for years.

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:46.551 align:middle line:84%
And more and more of
this is going to happen.

00:39:46.551 --> 00:39:50.513 align:middle line:84%
But you need to be aware of it
so you can fight back and not

00:39:50.513 --> 00:39:54.100 align:middle line:84%
let it happen to you so when
you wake up in the morning,

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:57.020 align:middle line:84%
you remember
exactly who you are.

00:39:57.020 --> 00:40:00.064 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:40:00.064 --> 00:40:03.985 align:middle line:90%
