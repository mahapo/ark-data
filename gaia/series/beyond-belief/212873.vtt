00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Dimitri, welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DIMITRI MORAITIS: Oh,
it's so great to be here.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:36.800 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for inviting me.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does it
mean to be spiritual

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.845 align:middle line:90%
with spiritual growth?

00:00:39.845 --> 00:00:44.240 align:middle line:10%
>>MORAITIS: Well, we wonder we
have this spiritual calling, we

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.750 align:middle line:10%
pursue different spiritual
ideas and practices,

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.140 align:middle line:10%
but why are you doing that?

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.680 align:middle line:10%
Why are we even on
a spiritual path?

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.410 align:middle line:10%
Well, what we teach is the
soul is actually growing

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.850 align:middle line:10%
through these experiences.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.980 align:middle line:90%
We're trying to evolve our soul.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.260 align:middle line:84%
So as we're practicing
these things,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.040 align:middle line:84%
we're literally trying to bring
our soul to a new heightened

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.715 align:middle line:84%
level of awareness and spiritual
place in the divine plan.

00:01:07.715 --> 00:01:10.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do we need to
teach people to be spiritual?

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Well, we
don't need to teach them,

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.030 align:middle line:90%
we're inherently spiritual.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.540 align:middle line:84%
We have a physical body but
we are a spiritual being.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Our soul is
inherently spiritual.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.800 align:middle line:84%
It kind of gets cloaked
in the physical material

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.880 align:middle line:84%
and in a sense we have to
rediscover that spiritual core

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.680 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.160 align:middle line:90%
And we do that through practice.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And there's a time
honored tradition of,

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.230 align:middle line:84%
like you go to school to
learn other things, to learn

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.990 align:middle line:84%
how to awaken that
inner part of you.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, there's good and
there's evil, in my opinion.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.790 align:middle line:90%
How about yours?

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: No,
no, there's-- well,

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.300 align:middle line:90%
here's the way we look at it.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.860 align:middle line:90%
The soul is inherently good.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.350 align:middle line:84%
There's no such thing
as an eternal damnation

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.030 align:middle line:90%
or an eternal hell.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.390 align:middle line:84%
But you're either cooperating
with the divine process

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.860 align:middle line:90%
or you're frustrating it.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
frustrating it, you

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.950 align:middle line:84%
can frustrate it
to such a degree

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.670 align:middle line:84%
that your behavior is evil and
you're doing evil things that

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.020 align:middle line:90%
are deteriorating.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.960 align:middle line:84%
You're degrading the spiritual
process, not increasing it.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And in that case, yes,
unfortunately there

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.315 align:middle line:84%
is evil in the world, there's
evil on the other side.

00:02:13.315 --> 00:02:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's something
we have to watch out

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.410 align:middle line:90%
for, just like a danger--

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.450 align:middle line:84%
a physical danger here
we have to watch out for.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happens
to the soul of somebody,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Dimitri, who might be like a
spiritual-- a serial killer?

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Well,
that's a tough one

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.352 align:middle line:90%
because it's multiple murders.

00:02:28.352 --> 00:02:29.185 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:02:29.185 --> 00:02:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Partly you have
to see what frame of mind

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.740 align:middle line:90%
were they in when they did it.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.840 align:middle line:84%
There's several things
they have to think on.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.840 align:middle line:84%
But it's a long road
back because they

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.660 align:middle line:84%
have to karmically atone
for everything they did,

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.730 align:middle line:84%
they have to even realize it
was a mistake to begin with.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.370 align:middle line:90%
And so that's a journey.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Same with tyrants
that lead countries

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.820 align:middle line:84%
into horrible situations or
dictators or things of that--

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.230 align:middle line:90%
they got a long road back.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.950 align:middle line:84%
But even they eventually would
be given that opportunity

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.615 align:middle line:90%
through a long, long process.

00:02:58.615 --> 00:02:59.795 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They can fix it.

00:02:59.795 --> 00:03:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: They can.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there's always
given a second chance.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What makes good old
planet Earth one of the best

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.070 align:middle line:90%
places to be in?

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: I'm glad you're
saying that because planet

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Earth has been getting a
bad rap lately a little bit,

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.360 align:middle line:90%
and it is a beautiful planet.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And it is-- from the
spiritual perspective,

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.530 align:middle line:90%
it is a school house.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.480 align:middle line:84%
Every single person--
we know we're

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.460 align:middle line:84%
here only for a
certain amount of time,

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.990 align:middle line:90%
and it's a school house.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And all the experiences
we're gathering,

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.120 align:middle line:90%
the soul is learning from it.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And because it's
difficult, because it's

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.338 align:middle line:84%
the physical and not the
spiritual, there's more stress

00:03:32.338 --> 00:03:33.380 align:middle line:90%
and there's more tension.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.660 align:middle line:84%
Just like if you're trying
to strengthen your muscles,

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.420 align:middle line:84%
you use weights which
creates more tension,

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.370 align:middle line:84%
and this gives more
opportunity to grow faster.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is the most--
the best places

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.760 align:middle line:84%
to grow spiritually is
right here right now.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.680 align:middle line:84%
So you want to look
at everything going on

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.750 align:middle line:84%
in your life--
really, good or bad--

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.070 align:middle line:90%
as a spiritual opportunity.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does spiritual
growth mean to you, Dimitri?

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Well, in our
teaching, in our philosophy,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.430 align:middle line:84%
in the tradition that we
follow, spiritual growth

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.000 align:middle line:84%
is the soul's evolution through
the many dimensions of life.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.910 align:middle line:84%
We know of the
physical dimension

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.820 align:middle line:84%
here that Christ spoke
of, "In my father's house

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.290 align:middle line:90%
are many mansions."

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.650 align:middle line:84%
On the other side there are
many dimensions, not one,

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and you and I are corresponding
to one of those dimensions

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.370 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying
to, shall we say,

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.980 align:middle line:84%
leave this Earth not only
better than the way we found it

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.140 align:middle line:84%
but a higher level
of consciousness

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.025 align:middle line:90%
than when we started.

00:04:28.025 --> 00:04:29.483 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
it mean, though,

00:04:29.483 --> 00:04:31.040 align:middle line:90%
to walk the path of ascent?

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: The
ascent is literally

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.340 align:middle line:84%
how your soul is building up
more power to literally grow

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.280 align:middle line:84%
through each
spiritual dimension.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.960 align:middle line:84%
If you read some of the
ancient mystical literature,

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.040 align:middle line:84%
they talk about this ascent
through the seven heavens.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.280 align:middle line:84%
It's in Jewish mysticism,
it's in Islamic mysticism,

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.310 align:middle line:84%
it's in Christian mysticism,
and it's all about

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.070 align:middle line:84%
going through these
different planes of awareness

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.050 align:middle line:90%
to reach this enlightened state.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's our
potential, spiritually?

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Well,
in the end we're all

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.710 align:middle line:90%
destined for greatness.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.780 align:middle line:90%
It's not if we're going to be--

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: all of us?

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: All of us.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:05.485 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:05:05.485 --> 00:05:06.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: Yeah.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.230 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] No one's
left out, yeah.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.940 align:middle line:84%
But not necessarily
all in this lifetime.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.860 align:middle line:84%
So in our philosophy,
again, we do

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.520 align:middle line:90%
this over multiple lifetimes.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.180 align:middle line:84%
You don't go to Heaven,
you grow to Heaven.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.350 align:middle line:90%
It's an evolutionary process.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.980 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm here and I know
I'm going to end up here,

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.440 align:middle line:84%
the question is-- and it
may take X amount of lives

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.750 align:middle line:84%
to do that-- in this
life, how far up can I go?

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.220 align:middle line:90%
And that's your potential.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.730 align:middle line:84%
That's the pinnacle
you're going to reach.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And we're supposed to do
everything we can to make it.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.160 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of wonderful
things to do in this world

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.190 align:middle line:84%
but nothing's more satisfying
than saying, no, I did it.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.426 align:middle line:90%
I reached my potential.

00:05:44.426 --> 00:05:46.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you a
spiritual teacher?

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: Yes, yes.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:48.605 align:middle line:90%
I was trained.

00:05:48.605 --> 00:05:51.710 align:middle line:84%
I started as a
spiritual student and--

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.660 align:middle line:90%
with a fantastic teacher.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense I'm
still her teacher--

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.100 align:middle line:84%
student right now
but she taught me

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.380 align:middle line:90%
to teach as kind of a lineage.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.970 align:middle line:84%
The mystical tradition is kind
of teacher student, teacher

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:03.770 align:middle line:90%
student.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.500 align:middle line:84%
In the East it's the
chela, guru, chela, guru.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.630 align:middle line:90%
It follows a lineage.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.730 align:middle line:84%
My teacher Barbara,
she had a teacher

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.560 align:middle line:84%
before her and we're following
the tradition, shall we say.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this the
real deal with our souls?

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, did the souls play games
with us or are they serious?

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Well,
the soul is eternal.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:25.820 align:middle line:84%
It's without
beginning, without end,

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.040 align:middle line:84%
it's always existed
in some form.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And, no, we're part of
a grand divine plan.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.740 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
beautifully designed plan.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Just like you go to school,
there's a curriculum,

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.740 align:middle line:84%
there's a structure
to it, the divine

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.860 align:middle line:84%
has created a structure for
us because we can't figure it

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:43.790 align:middle line:90%
all out on our own.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.260 align:middle line:84%
You can't say, Dimitri,
I'll give you two weeks,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.970 align:middle line:84%
figure out how to
do brain surgery.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.260 align:middle line:90%
I need training.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.290 align:middle line:90%
I need to go to school.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.290 align:middle line:84%
I need to work, hopefully,
with the best people.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.500 align:middle line:84%
I need to practice and
then I can eventually

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.180 align:middle line:90%
maybe become a brain surgeon.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And metaphysics is,
in a sense, even more

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.460 align:middle line:84%
demanding than that
because it asks

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.340 align:middle line:84%
you to work on all facets
of your nature, not just

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.150 align:middle line:90%
one particular one.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:10.515 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who do we cut the
deals with to grow spiritually?

00:07:10.515 --> 00:07:11.830 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: That's a
good way of putting it.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:16.720 align:middle line:90%
We're not alone.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.270 align:middle line:90%
We're not alone on this Earth.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.420 align:middle line:84%
The Talmud says, "For
every blade of grass,

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.480 align:middle line:84%
there's an angel bending
over saying grow."

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.330 align:middle line:84%
We have help from
the divine realms.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.460 align:middle line:84%
Our elder brothers
and sisters in light

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.860 align:middle line:84%
who are further along
the path than we are,

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.500 align:middle line:84%
who work with the divine
source-- call it God,

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.650 align:middle line:84%
call it the divine oneness,
what terminology you want it.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:42.000 align:middle line:84%
But this infinite intelligence
that we're all drawing from

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.880 align:middle line:84%
and these more developed
than us are helping

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.540 align:middle line:84%
us to do that to design the
plan just like our parents

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.850 align:middle line:84%
will help figure out
some of our experiences

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:51.940 align:middle line:90%
when we're very young.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Because we can't really
figure it out for ourselves,

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.440 align:middle line:90%
we'll make choices.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Don't get me wrong,
there's always free will.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:00.000 align:middle line:84%
We can cooperate
or not cooperate,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.100 align:middle line:84%
but they try to design
it in a way that

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.210 align:middle line:90%
will bring out the best.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.580 align:middle line:84%
They know our talents,
they know our desires,

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.730 align:middle line:84%
they know us in a sense
better than we know ourselves.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.430 align:middle line:84%
But they also see us from
that divine perspective.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.650 align:middle line:84%
They never lose sight
of the ideal us.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what
does it mean, Dimitri,

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.950 align:middle line:84%
to have a contract
with your soul?

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:18.750 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Well, I think maybe
that's a term we've heard here.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.830 align:middle line:84%
What happens is before
you come to Earth--

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.600 align:middle line:84%
again, the idea is we
incarnate on Earth.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.850 align:middle line:84%
We had a pre-existence
before there.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And we are seeing
in our terminology

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.780 align:middle line:90%
we don't call it a contract.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.539 align:middle line:90%
We call it the tapestry of life.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:40.289 align:middle line:84%
And that you are shown in a
sense key elements of what--

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:42.659 align:middle line:84%
not everything but key
things you're meant-- people

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:43.659 align:middle line:90%
you may be working with.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:46.290 align:middle line:84%
The children you may have,
parents you will have,

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:48.630 align:middle line:84%
marriages you may have,
careers you may have,

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:52.430 align:middle line:84%
spiritual potential,
things like that.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.700 align:middle line:84%
You've had the successful
career in journalism,

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.700 align:middle line:84%
no doubt that was in
your tapestry of life,

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.110 align:middle line:90%
but you had to weave it.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.400 align:middle line:90%
It didn't just happen.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.590 align:middle line:84%
You had to make
it happen, and it

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:05.730 align:middle line:84%
may have taken a lot to make it
happen but the energetics of it

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:06.975 align:middle line:90%
are already designed.

00:09:06.975 --> 00:09:10.312 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we reach
the spiritual potential?

00:09:10.312 --> 00:09:11.145 align:middle line:90%
How do we get there?

00:09:11.145 --> 00:09:12.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: OK, so let's make--

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.140 align:middle line:90%
I want to share one thing.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.850 align:middle line:84%
So we have potential
and purpose.

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:18.270 align:middle line:84%
So purpose is our part
in the divine plan.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.252 align:middle line:84%
So you asked if I
was a teacher, when

00:09:20.252 --> 00:09:21.960 align:middle line:84%
I was young I didn't
think that was going

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.960 align:middle line:84%
to be my purpose in
life but when I realized

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.500 align:middle line:90%
what it was, I pursued it.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:27.780 align:middle line:90%
So it's like a career.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:31.290 align:middle line:84%
Purpose is kind of like, well,
how am I helping other people?

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Potential is my own evolutionary
climb, how far up the ladder--

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.588 align:middle line:84%
it's like a talent, how
far can I build that?

00:09:38.588 --> 00:09:40.755 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you be taught
how to climb that ladder?

00:09:40.755 --> 00:09:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: Yes, absolutely.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.213 align:middle line:84%
I learned it and, again,
you have to practice it.

00:09:46.213 --> 00:09:48.630 align:middle line:84%
It's just like if you're going
to learn to play the piano,

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.180 align:middle line:84%
you can have a teacher but
you're the one that has to--

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.138 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're the one
who's hitting the keys.

00:09:53.138 --> 00:09:54.597 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: You
can't just show up.

00:09:54.597 --> 00:09:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Once a week and
say, OK, teacher,

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.960 align:middle line:84%
how come I'm not playing
the concerto yet?

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.660 align:middle line:84%
No, you have to put hours
and hours into this.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.030 align:middle line:84%
I've been meditating now
with this light meditation

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:04.290 align:middle line:90%
for 40 years.

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And I was so excited
when I started

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.370 align:middle line:90%
it and I'm more excited now.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And the experiences
are far deeper

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:13.440 align:middle line:84%
because I've made it such
an integral part of my life,

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.610 align:middle line:90%
but that's anything, right.

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:16.320 align:middle line:84%
You spend a lot of
time doing something,

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.250 align:middle line:90%
you get better at it.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever
disappoint yourself

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:21.980 align:middle line:90%
with your spiritual growth?

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.140 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever get to a
point where you went, God,

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.865 align:middle line:84%
I should have, would
have, could have.

00:10:25.865 --> 00:10:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Well, if
there's one thing-- now,

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:31.490 align:middle line:84%
some people were born with
like a spiritual awareness

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:33.030 align:middle line:90%
from day one.

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Like Barbara, my teacher, she
could see auras from age three.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.180 align:middle line:90%
That was not me.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.380 align:middle line:84%
I had a rather
dramatic awakening.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.530 align:middle line:84%
So in my case, I
think what happened

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:46.100 align:middle line:84%
was I had such a determination
that I didn't want to goof it

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.470 align:middle line:90%
up, I didn't want to skip it.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And Barbara can be a
little bit of a taskmaster

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:52.518 align:middle line:84%
to make sure you
don't goof it up.

00:10:52.518 --> 00:10:54.560 align:middle line:84%
There's another thing it
helps to have a teacher,

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.030 align:middle line:90%
they kind of keep you in line.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:59.270 align:middle line:84%
So I won't say I've ever been
disappointed but I always

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:01.620 align:middle line:90%
wonder, gee, am I doing enough?

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.205 align:middle line:84%
Am I doing all I can,
really, to make this happen?

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the Barbara
you're talking about

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:06.880 align:middle line:90%
is Barbara Martin.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.285 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: Exactly, exactly.

00:11:08.285 --> 00:11:09.755 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us a
little bit about her.

00:11:09.755 --> 00:11:11.713 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Oh my god,
what a remarkable woman.

00:11:11.713 --> 00:11:15.830 align:middle line:84%
So I can share-- maybe
start with how I met her.

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.470 align:middle line:84%
I had had a very dramatic
spiritual awakening which

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:22.200 align:middle line:84%
completely changed my life but I
didn't know what to do with it.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And one night I met Barbara
at a party, a dinner party,

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:27.390 align:middle line:90%
and she led a meditation.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.370 align:middle line:90%
It was a profound experience.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.800 align:middle line:84%
After one night I said,
this is my teacher.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.675 align:middle line:90%
I knew it right away.

00:11:32.675 --> 00:11:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
it, you knew it.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Yeah, it was
kind of like-- because--

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.700 align:middle line:84%
just-- she was putting
all these pieces,

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:39.930 align:middle line:90%
these things in my mind.

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And she put it all together
so sort of casually

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:45.330 align:middle line:84%
and easily and talking
from her own experiences.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.547 align:middle line:84%
Now in her case, she
was born clairvoyant.

00:11:47.547 --> 00:11:49.380 align:middle line:84%
At three years old she
was seeing the auras.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:50.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At three years old?

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Can you imagine
a little kid doing that?

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.230 align:middle line:84%
There's some great
stories with her at four

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:57.407 align:middle line:84%
because her father was this
Greek Orthodox priest--

00:11:57.407 --> 00:11:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they encourage her?

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: No, they didn't.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.760 align:middle line:84%
They thought there was
something wrong with her eyes.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.260 align:middle line:84%
They thought she
was having-- so she

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.927 align:middle line:84%
learned to shut up about it
because she would say things

00:12:06.927 --> 00:12:08.760 align:middle line:84%
like-- they were waiting
for an aunt to come

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.512 align:middle line:84%
and she say, oh,
auntie's not coming.

00:12:10.512 --> 00:12:11.595 align:middle line:90%
She died in a train crash.

00:12:11.595 --> 00:12:12.395 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:12:12.395 --> 00:12:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Oh my god, how would
you say such a terrible thing?

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it happened.

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: And
it happened, yeah.

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:19.620 align:middle line:84%
They got the Telegram, the aunt
was gone in the train crash.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:21.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got
a clip of Barbara,

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.250 align:middle line:84%
how she got started in
the world of metaphysics.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:24.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: Oh, wow.

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:25.230 align:middle line:90%
Oh great.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:26.030 align:middle line:90%
Oh great.

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:30.760 align:middle line:90%


00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Barbara was only four
years old, and she

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:34.750 align:middle line:90%
was playing with a ball.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.290 align:middle line:90%
It rolled into the kitchen.

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:38.290 align:middle line:84%
She was looking at her
mom and all of a sudden

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.670 align:middle line:90%
she saw these colors around her.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:43.090 align:middle line:84%
She didn't know
what it was but she

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:46.540 align:middle line:84%
had this magical, mystical world
that had started to open up.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And that was the beginning
of seeing the auric field.

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:52.030 align:middle line:84%
They thought something
was wrong with her eyes

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:53.663 align:middle line:90%
or kidneys or a brain tumor.

00:12:53.663 --> 00:12:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And all these things
they were wondering

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.460 align:middle line:84%
because she was describing
what she was experiencing.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.460 align:middle line:84%
So after several
of these things,

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.620 align:middle line:84%
Barbara realized people
are not experiencing

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:03.950 align:middle line:90%
what I'm experiencing.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.740 align:middle line:84%
So I better keep quiet
because I'm getting

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.660 align:middle line:90%
a lot of trouble about this.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:12.670 align:middle line:10%
But then she was 11 years old
when she met Dorothy Lamaze.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.730 align:middle line:84%
Dorothy said, I can
see the aura too.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:17.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually a
hermetic scientist.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:21.250 align:middle line:84%
My mother and grandmother
are both hermetic scientists.

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to teach you
a little bit about your gifts.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And she started teaching her
about metaphysics and things

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.170 align:middle line:84%
like what the colors
of the aura mean.

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.860 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly Barbara
could interpret the aura.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:37.480 align:middle line:90%


00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.940 align:middle line:90%
Then she came to California.

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.340 align:middle line:84%
It was the golden
age of Hollywood.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.260 align:middle line:10%
And at that point she
was kind of trying

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:45.680 align:middle line:10%
to live a normal life.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.950 align:middle line:84%
But the more she kind of
pushed away the metaphysics,

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:49.570 align:middle line:90%
the stronger it'd come back.

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And she gets this
experience with a higher

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:56.200 align:middle line:84%
coming in and
telling her, you're

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.210 align:middle line:90%
meant to teach metaphysics.

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:01.790 align:middle line:84%
So she honed her
skills such that she

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:03.020 align:middle line:90%
could be a trained mystic.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.820 align:middle line:84%
Not just being
able to see auras,

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:08.900 align:middle line:84%
but being able to really
work with it in detail.

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:12.905 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that moment
her career started.

00:14:12.905 --> 00:14:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
ever met anybody

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:15.830 align:middle line:90%
like Barbara Martin, Dimitri?

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Not with
that many gifts.

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.420 align:middle line:84%
I've met some gifted
people but they nickname

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.100 align:middle line:90%
her the Mozart of metaphysics.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.280 align:middle line:84%
It's an extraordinary
level of talent.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.878 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was this gift given to
her at that young age of four?

00:14:28.878 --> 00:14:30.170 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how did she acquire it?

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Well, she built
it up from past lives.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:35.040 align:middle line:90%
But even she had to develop it.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.850 align:middle line:84%
So in there we talk
about Dorothy Lamos at 11

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:39.320 align:middle line:84%
but when she was
in her early 20s

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.830 align:middle line:84%
she met another mystic with
tremendous spiritual gifts who

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:44.090 align:middle line:90%
trained her to be a teacher.

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:47.330 align:middle line:84%
So she went through 20 years
before she actually got

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.370 align:middle line:84%
on the platform
and really taught

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.380 align:middle line:84%
to get really good at
being able to do this.

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.405 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She must be
phenomenal right now.

00:14:53.405 --> 00:14:54.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: Oh, yeah, she is.

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:57.330 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately she's not on
the public platform anymore

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.620 align:middle line:84%
but she is still writing, she's
still working at the institute

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.695 align:middle line:84%
and helping out and doing her
best work, I think, right now.

00:15:03.695 --> 00:15:06.382 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Still sees
auras on people?

00:15:06.382 --> 00:15:07.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And other phenomena
experiences of the other side

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.960 align:middle line:90%
and the angels and all of that.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.550 align:middle line:90%
Those doors are all open to her.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.635 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dimitri, what happens
to be the astral realms?

00:15:17.635 --> 00:15:18.435 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:15:18.435 --> 00:15:21.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: So those are sort
of the next level from Earth.

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:25.410 align:middle line:84%
So we may have an
out-of-body experience

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:27.090 align:middle line:84%
where we literally
go out of our body

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:28.780 align:middle line:84%
but like, oh, I'm
looking at my body.

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:29.580 align:middle line:90%
It's right here.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.247 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's what
happened to me when

00:15:31.247 --> 00:15:35.460 align:middle line:84%
I was 11 years old, floating
above my bed on the ceiling,

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:36.840 align:middle line:90%
bouncing.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.150 align:middle line:84%
Looking down at my
body, but it was

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:43.238 align:middle line:84%
that jarring look that forced me
to go right back into my body.

00:15:43.238 --> 00:15:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: 11 years old.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.363 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I've never
been able to duplicate it.

00:15:46.363 --> 00:15:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Well, sometimes it
happens naturally like that.

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:51.060 align:middle line:84%
I've had similar
things as a young child

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:52.590 align:middle line:90%
where it just sort of--

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:54.132 align:middle line:90%
like it was effortless, right.

00:15:54.132 --> 00:15:55.590 align:middle line:84%
You were not trying
to do anything.

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It happened.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.933 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: It just
sort of happened, right.

00:15:57.933 --> 00:16:00.510 align:middle line:84%
But that's sort of you
and-- you were in your

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:03.330 align:middle line:84%
what we would call your astral
body, your duplicate body,

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.130 align:middle line:84%
but you were still
on the Earth plane.

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.020 align:middle line:84%
You were still in
the physical realm,

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:09.340 align:middle line:84%
which is why you could
see your physical body.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.700 align:middle line:84%
But when you're in
the astral planes,

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:15.060 align:middle line:84%
that's the actual
world of the astral.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.160 align:middle line:84%
Sri Yukteswar,
Yogananda's teacher

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.500 align:middle line:84%
said, the entire
physical universe

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.470 align:middle line:84%
hangs like-- hangs like
a basket on the tree

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:23.445 align:middle line:90%
of the astral universe.

00:16:23.445 --> 00:16:24.245 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:16:24.245 --> 00:16:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: It's a vast area
and there are many dimensions,

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.500 align:middle line:90%
many levels.

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And we'll go to one
of those dimensions,

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.630 align:middle line:84%
depending how much
spiritual power we built up.

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:35.460 align:middle line:90%
And that will continue--

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.340 align:middle line:84%
that will set the tone of our
continuing on the other side

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.720 align:middle line:84%
until it's our time
to come back again.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And there's some wonderful
things you can do in that.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.260 align:middle line:84%
Now look at you just
described you were floating,

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.440 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't just you were in a
body standing next to your bed,

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.755 align:middle line:90%
you were up on the ceiling.

00:16:50.755 --> 00:16:51.555 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I was up.

00:16:51.555 --> 00:16:52.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: Your astro body--

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If it wasn't
for the ceiling,

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:55.485 align:middle line:84%
I would have kept
going probably.

00:16:55.485 --> 00:16:56.430 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Did you tell
your parents about it?

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My mother
was into this.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: She was,
oh good, oh good.

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:04.869 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She helped a lot.

00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:05.940 align:middle line:90%
That's a show by itself.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.982 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Oh my god,
that would be fascinating.

00:17:07.982 --> 00:17:10.736 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now we have an artistic
rendering of these realms

00:17:10.736 --> 00:17:11.819 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about.

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:13.470 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
and have you explain

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:14.655 align:middle line:90%
to us what we're looking at.

00:17:14.655 --> 00:17:16.488 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Oh, this
is a beautiful picture.

00:17:16.488 --> 00:17:18.359 align:middle line:84%
OK, this was done--
by the way, this

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:22.600 align:middle line:84%
is an oil painting done by an
artist, local artist, Jonathan

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:23.400 align:middle line:90%
Wiltshire.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.849 align:middle line:84%
And he basically spent his
career doing spirit art,

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:29.220 align:middle line:84%
and he worked with another
clairvoyant years ago.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And we gave him the
guidelines of what to do

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:32.710 align:middle line:90%
and he made this happen.

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:34.410 align:middle line:90%
This is a-- look, this is--

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:37.710 align:middle line:84%
people think the other side is
just, oh, a dream land, fantasy

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:39.240 align:middle line:90%
land, it's as real--

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.142 align:middle line:84%
they call this the
dream land, right.

00:17:41.142 --> 00:17:42.600 align:middle line:84%
The other side is
the real-- that's

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.550 align:middle line:90%
a real temple on the other side.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:46.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a temple of healing.

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:48.660 align:middle line:84%
This angel is taking this
woman there for a healing.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where is this temple?

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: This is on the
top of the fifth astral plane.

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:55.020 align:middle line:84%
There's different
astral worlds, and you

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.790 align:middle line:84%
can do the float
walking on this plane.

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.880 align:middle line:84%
You can literally-- you learn
how to use mind over matter

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:04.050 align:middle line:84%
to move your astral form,
and she's going there.

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Now here she's getting a
healing, not a body healing

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.260 align:middle line:90%
but it's an emotional healing.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.570 align:middle line:84%
She had an experience
of seeing her father who

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:15.325 align:middle line:84%
also transitioned, it
didn't go very well.

00:18:15.325 --> 00:18:16.950 align:middle line:84%
They didn't forgive
each other on Earth

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:19.540 align:middle line:84%
and they were still not
forgiving each other

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:20.560 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.470 align:middle line:84%
But what she learned
is not only am

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:24.930 align:middle line:84%
I having trouble forgiving
the man that was my father

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:27.720 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, but I'm not a
very forgiving person.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And she's realizing she
has to build that skill.

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:33.000 align:middle line:84%
We have to build our
character, and this angel

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.380 align:middle line:84%
is helping her to get better
at the art of forgiveness.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why does the
angel have that glow to it?

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: Oh, well, it is--

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:42.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're not
even seeing its full--

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if this angel was
showing its full colors

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.280 align:middle line:84%
it would radiate
for 50 feet or more.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:51.390 align:middle line:84%
So the angels have
tremendous spiritual powers.

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:54.660 align:middle line:84%
He's cloaking it right
now not to overwhelm her

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:58.710 align:middle line:84%
so that she can relate to him
and not feel overwhelmed by it.

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And he'll escort
her into the temple,

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:02.460 align:middle line:84%
he'll be with her
the entire time,

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.680 align:middle line:84%
they'll get-- she'll get
the healing she needs

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:08.550 align:middle line:84%
and then he'll take her
back to the spiritual plane

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:09.650 align:middle line:90%
that she normally is on.

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:12.025 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who are the little
people going into the temple?

00:19:12.025 --> 00:19:14.025 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Well, those
are people of the realm.

00:19:14.025 --> 00:19:17.520 align:middle line:84%
So in time-- when
there's an angel,

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.160 align:middle line:84%
they can take you
to higher dimensions

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.590 align:middle line:84%
than you may be at
the evolutionary level

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:23.960 align:middle line:84%
so you can get these
extraordinary healings.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.700 align:middle line:84%
This is an extremely popular
temple on the other side.

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:27.700 align:middle line:90%
You can imagine healing.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's gorgeous.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: As a matter
of fact, Barbara's mother

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:33.230 align:middle line:84%
would have sometimes
visions, and she saw herself

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:35.090 align:middle line:84%
in one of these healing
temples because she

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:36.020 align:middle line:90%
was having problems.

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.010 align:middle line:90%
And she got scared.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:38.450 align:middle line:90%
She thought she was dying.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And the angel said, no,
no, we're here to help you.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:41.600 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.470 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:43.880 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:47.405 align:middle line:84%
She got over some very serious
problems with her physically.

00:19:47.405 --> 00:19:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dimitri, what
are interplanetary realms?

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: They are the
realms beyond the astral

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:55.190 align:middle line:90%
but not quite the heavenly.

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you study the
mystic literature,

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.290 align:middle line:84%
some hear about the causal
world and the mental world,

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:02.150 align:middle line:90%
those are those dimensions.

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And what's beautiful
there is you pull together

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.940 align:middle line:84%
all the different lifetimes
of all your accomplishments

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.610 align:middle line:84%
because when you do earn
the ranks of heaven,

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:12.080 align:middle line:90%
you're taking all of you.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Not just the good things
you did in this life

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.790 align:middle line:84%
but all the other lives, all
the knowledge, all the power,

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:18.707 align:middle line:90%
everything goes there.

00:20:18.707 --> 00:20:20.582 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
different realms are there?

00:20:20.582 --> 00:20:21.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: There's a lot.

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:23.670 align:middle line:84%
There's the seven
astral realms, there's

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:26.325 align:middle line:84%
the three interplanetary, and
then there's the seven heavens.

00:20:26.325 --> 00:20:28.242 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they each
have a separate purpose?

00:20:28.242 --> 00:20:29.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Yes,
they're all serving

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:31.470 align:middle line:90%
a different part in the plan.

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:34.410 align:middle line:84%
They all have literal locations
so you can literally visit,

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:36.690 align:middle line:84%
but they're also states
of consciousness.

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Earth is, though,
kind of a melting pot.

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.190 align:middle line:84%
You can have Mahatma
Gandhi and an Adolf Hitler,

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:42.990 align:middle line:84%
they could be in the
same room together,

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:45.030 align:middle line:90%
very different vibrations.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:46.860 align:middle line:84%
On the other side
you'll tend to be

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:49.200 align:middle line:84%
with people of a
similar not character

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.555 align:middle line:90%
as you but vibration like you.

00:20:51.555 --> 00:20:52.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.960 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at another
artistic rendering

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.590 align:middle line:84%
and tell us what
we're looking at here.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Oh, now this
is a masterful painting.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is amazing.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.220 align:middle line:90%
Who's the painter for this?

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: This, again,
is Jonathan Wiltshire.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.540 align:middle line:84%
He's a local painter
where we are.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And he's done an
amazing job with this.

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.540 align:middle line:84%
This Is on the--
so the other one

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.490 align:middle line:84%
was on the fifth astral
plane, this one's

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:19.440 align:middle line:90%
on the seventh astral plane.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.210 align:middle line:90%
So it's the top plane.

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:23.100 align:middle line:90%
And this is the Temple of Love.

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.020 align:middle line:84%
So imagine a whole
temple where you go in

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:28.260 align:middle line:84%
just to learn about love,
build up your love flow.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:32.580 align:middle line:84%
It's so critical because the
path of light is paved in love.

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.277 align:middle line:90%
You climb the ladder--

00:21:34.277 --> 00:21:36.652 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this a physical
temple or a spiritual temple?

00:21:36.652 --> 00:21:37.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: It's a
spiritual temple.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.450 align:middle line:84%
This is all in the
spiritual realms.

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And this woman has reached
the enlightened state.

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:44.010 align:middle line:84%
That's the crowning
glory of the astral world

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:46.020 align:middle line:84%
is that you reach the
enlightened state.

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:49.488 align:middle line:84%
And she's kind of enjoying
her accomplishment here.

00:21:49.488 --> 00:21:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And interesting you just
asked about the interplanetary

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:54.300 align:middle line:84%
worlds, her next
adventure will now

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.640 align:middle line:84%
be to start her evolution
in the interplanetary worlds

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.282 align:middle line:90%
in this enlightened state.

00:21:59.282 --> 00:22:00.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is she enlightened--

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Yes, yes, she's
got the pointed oval aura,

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.380 align:middle line:84%
she's got the fully
open crown chakra.

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes, she has reached that state.

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:10.000 align:middle line:84%
So, again, we wonder, well,
could we ever reach that?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.490 align:middle line:84%
It's not a matter of if
it's just a matter of when.

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:15.016 align:middle line:90%
We're all destined to do that.

00:22:15.016 --> 00:22:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take there.

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: The celebrations
you see a lot going on.

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:21.290 align:middle line:84%
There's dancing, there's all
sorts of things happening,

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:22.690 align:middle line:90%
beautiful gardens.

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:26.105 align:middle line:84%
Nature is on the other side,
and it's more vibrant and alive

00:22:26.105 --> 00:22:26.905 align:middle line:90%
than even here.

00:22:26.905 --> 00:22:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this like
a heavenly state?

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Almost,
not quite heaven.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Heavens, believe it or not, it's
even more beautiful than this,

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.260 align:middle line:84%
but it's moving
in that direction.

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
heavens are there?

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.555 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: Seven, seven.

00:22:37.555 --> 00:22:38.905 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Seven heavens?

00:22:38.905 --> 00:22:39.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: I know.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.850 align:middle line:10%
Well, they ask the
mystic Helena Blavatsky--

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:44.740 align:middle line:10%
she used slightly
different terminology--

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:47.410 align:middle line:10%
what happens when you reach
that state of perfection?

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:50.320 align:middle line:10%
And she said beautifully,
you grow from perfection

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.270 align:middle line:10%
to perfection.

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:53.387 align:middle line:90%
The growth is eternal.

00:22:53.387 --> 00:22:54.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we
get there, Dimitri?

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: We get
there by facing--

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.850 align:middle line:84%
by realizing every
opportunity, everything

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:01.600 align:middle line:84%
we're going through
here is an opportunity

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.400 align:middle line:90%
to evolve this whole, we--

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.300 align:middle line:90%
even our jobs.

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.700 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we say,
oh, is my Earth life,

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:10.060 align:middle line:84%
this is my spiritual
life, it's all spiritual

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:12.790 align:middle line:84%
and every piece in
it is part of that.

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And we do strongly
emphasize meditation

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.540 align:middle line:90%
and prayer and training.

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:18.562 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I trained--

00:23:18.562 --> 00:23:20.270 align:middle line:84%
I could have read
every metaphysical book

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:23.600 align:middle line:84%
there is and not got what I got
from Barbara because some of it

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.080 align:middle line:84%
has to be transmitted
kind of like this.

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.760 align:middle line:90%
It's a very ancient tradition.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.250 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient Greeks they
had the mystery schools.

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:35.322 align:middle line:84%
You join the mystery schools,
you learn the mysteries of--

00:23:35.322 --> 00:23:36.905 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or you got
invited into them.

00:23:36.905 --> 00:23:37.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Oh, yeah,
they were very--

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:39.005 align:middle line:90%
they were not easy to get into.

00:23:39.005 --> 00:23:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Harder than
even college today.

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:41.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would we be rejected
or would they let us in?

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:44.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: I don't know.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.517 align:middle line:90%
They would scrutinize.

00:23:45.517 --> 00:23:47.510 align:middle line:84%
They would even
scrutinize our families.

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:50.660 align:middle line:84%
They really wanted to get an
idea of the character of who

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.315 align:middle line:90%
we were, who the person was.

00:23:52.315 --> 00:23:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And even when they
first let them

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:56.660 align:middle line:84%
in it was probationary,
and then once in then

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:57.530 align:middle line:90%
you were really in.

00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:58.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is amazing.

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:01.430 align:middle line:84%
Are there darker regions
in some of these realms?

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:03.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Yeah,
unfortunately there are.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:03.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh.

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:04.805 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: I know.

00:24:04.805 --> 00:24:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I know it.

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: I know you
know it, yeah, yeah.

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:11.410 align:middle line:84%
What happens is--
you were asking

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:14.710 align:middle line:84%
what if you were a multiple
murderer or a tyrant--

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:18.290 align:middle line:84%
let's say you just do
horrible, horrible things,

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:20.280 align:middle line:90%
you're losing spiritual energy.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:23.990 align:middle line:84%
So what happens if you lose
so much light in your aura,

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:26.810 align:middle line:84%
you can't even go to the normal
places on the other side.

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:28.130 align:middle line:90%
You don't have enough power.

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:29.150 align:middle line:90%
You've lost too much.

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:31.520 align:middle line:84%
So you go to these
netherworld regions.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And, again, they're
not eternal hells,

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:36.740 align:middle line:84%
although they're
hellish, it's just

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:38.630 align:middle line:84%
that's the only
place you can go.

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:40.760 align:middle line:84%
They do try to lift
you up out of there

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.340 align:middle line:90%
but you're so immersed in--

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:46.070 align:middle line:84%
people think when they cross
over suddenly they figure it

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:47.990 align:middle line:90%
all out, no, you don't.

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:50.180 align:middle line:84%
If a tyrant crosses
over, they can still

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.530 align:middle line:90%
be tyrannical on the other side.

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:53.280 align:middle line:84%
They just don't have
anybody to tyrannize.

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:57.260 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] So they have to
wake up from that mesmerism

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:59.420 align:middle line:84%
and then the angels
have to help them

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:02.670 align:middle line:84%
get back up a little bit so they
can even start on the journey

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:03.470 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Should
everybody experience

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:09.650 align:middle line:90%
the other side, the dark side?

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:11.285 align:middle line:84%
Do we learn anything
if we do that?

00:25:11.285 --> 00:25:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: No,
no, no, we don't.

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:13.370 align:middle line:90%
It's better--

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:14.745 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
saying, avoid it.

00:25:14.745 --> 00:25:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: In other words,
we protect our house, right.

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:22.342 align:middle line:84%
We lock our doors, we lock our
cars, we lock our computers.

00:25:22.342 --> 00:25:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oops, I knew
I forgot something.

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:25.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: [LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.292 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way we have
to put spiritual protection

00:25:28.292 --> 00:25:30.500 align:middle line:84%
because that's another thing
Barbara would emphasize,

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.360 align:middle line:84%
there are these
mischievous spirits

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.070 align:middle line:84%
that do want to try
to trip things up.

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:35.840 align:middle line:90%
I hate to say it but it's true.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:39.650 align:middle line:84%
But if-- one of the teachings of
the aura is no negative energy

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:43.400 align:middle line:84%
can enter your aura unless
somewhere you're permitting it.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And that can be done through
fear, through anxiety,

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:46.340 align:middle line:90%
through worry.

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.340 align:middle line:84%
So as long as you keep that
protective light around you

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:52.040 align:middle line:84%
and don't rush in where
angels fear to tread,

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:53.110 align:middle line:90%
you're going to be OK.

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you do feel like you're
being confronted by something

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:58.580 align:middle line:90%
evil, you call on the light.

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:01.470 align:middle line:84%
This wasn't evil but when
I moved into a house--

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:02.630 align:middle line:90%
it was a probate house.

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:04.790 align:middle line:84%
The guy that had
lived in it died,

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:06.380 align:middle line:90%
and he had died in the house.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And it was a rush
to get in, I was

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:10.520 align:middle line:84%
sleeping on the floor in the
living room with all the boxes.

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And I wake up in the
morning and there's

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.170 align:middle line:90%
this guy trying to throttle me.

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, oh,
this is a one crazy dream.

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:19.410 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not dreaming.

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:22.710 align:middle line:84%
There's a man trying to choke
me but it's not a physical man.

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to shake
it loose and I finally did,

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:27.870 align:middle line:90%
and it turned out to be him.

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:29.860 align:middle line:90%
He didn't know he had died.

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:31.633 align:middle line:84%
He thought I was the
intruder and he was

00:26:31.633 --> 00:26:32.800 align:middle line:90%
trying to protect his house.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tying to
protect his property.

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: Right.

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And even with all
our prayers still

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:39.360 align:middle line:84%
took three days to tell
him, you're done with Earth.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.450 align:middle line:90%
Follow the angels home.

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:41.325 align:middle line:90%
It's time to go home.

00:26:41.325 --> 00:26:42.465 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you convince him?

00:26:42.465 --> 00:26:43.785 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Yeah, he
finally did leave.

00:26:43.785 --> 00:26:44.595 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And off he went.

00:26:44.595 --> 00:26:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: And off he went.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.940 align:middle line:84%
But it was his dream house,
he was building his family

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.595 align:middle line:84%
so he wasn't ready to cut
all that loose just yet.

00:26:50.595 --> 00:26:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important
is inspiration

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:53.250 align:middle line:90%
in the scheme of things?

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:54.625 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Oh,
that's everything

00:26:54.625 --> 00:26:56.820 align:middle line:84%
because inspiration--
every great idea

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:58.590 align:middle line:84%
as we know that has
built civilization,

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:00.720 align:middle line:84%
our own life has
been inspiration,

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.980 align:middle line:84%
and it comes from
the other side.

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:04.930 align:middle line:84%
So one of the big
things that we do,

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:08.160 align:middle line:84%
one of the reasons we call
it Spiritual Arts Institute

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:12.030 align:middle line:84%
is to try to bring in more
of that inspirational power.

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:15.180 align:middle line:84%
Every day the Higher
prompts us with something.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:18.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, it may not be the theory
of relativity every day

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.470 align:middle line:90%
but it's something.

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:22.320 align:middle line:84%
But too often we are either
too engrossed in the cares

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.330 align:middle line:84%
of the world we
don't pay attention

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:26.790 align:middle line:84%
or it's not what we wanted
to hear and we ignore it.

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:29.520 align:middle line:84%
If we just start
listening to it more

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.690 align:middle line:90%
and be more responsive to it--

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:34.350 align:middle line:90%
I love the stories of Beethoven.

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:37.200 align:middle line:84%
They say you'd be having lunch
with a guy, he'd have this--

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.700 align:middle line:84%
suddenly in the
middle of lunch he'd

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.500 align:middle line:84%
get this wild look in his
eye and he'd say, I'm sorry,

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:41.300 align:middle line:90%
lunch over.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:42.120 align:middle line:90%
I got to write.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.425 align:middle line:84%
He was getting
these musical ideas.

00:27:43.425 --> 00:27:44.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're having
lunch with Beethoven

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:46.595 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden he
goes, bum, bum, bum, bum.

00:27:46.595 --> 00:27:47.678 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:27:47.678 --> 00:27:50.090 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And you're
thinking, was that

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:51.340 align:middle line:90%
the order for the main course?

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:51.945 align:middle line:90%
Was that--

00:27:51.945 --> 00:27:53.025 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was that way.

00:27:53.025 --> 00:27:53.825 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: Yeah.

00:27:53.825 --> 00:27:55.320 align:middle line:90%
But we have to be like that.

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.990 align:middle line:84%
When you get that
inspiration, act on it.

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does spiritual
attainment mean to you?

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Spiritual
attainment means

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:04.020 align:middle line:90%
you are hitting those marks.

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:06.752 align:middle line:84%
You have made-- one of the
things we hope to encourage

00:28:06.752 --> 00:28:08.460 align:middle line:84%
and maybe hopefully
out of this interview

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:12.030 align:middle line:84%
is wherever you are in
your spiritual interests

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:15.780 align:middle line:84%
and pursuits, strive to make
it an even higher priority

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:17.790 align:middle line:84%
in your life because
it will lead you

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:18.897 align:middle line:90%
to extraordinary places.

00:28:18.897 --> 00:28:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And once you hit those places,
you've reached your attainment.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we all need
a spiritual teacher

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:26.655 align:middle line:84%
to get to this level or
can we do it on our own?

00:28:26.655 --> 00:28:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Well, first
of all, let's be clear,

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:30.870 align:middle line:84%
even with the teacher
you're still doing it

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:31.930 align:middle line:90%
in a sense on your own.

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:33.390 align:middle line:90%
You have to do your own growing.

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:34.630 align:middle line:90%
No one can do that for you.

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:36.720 align:middle line:84%
Anyone that says, oh,
here's the five easy steps

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.220 align:middle line:84%
to enlightenment,
run the other way.

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.890 align:middle line:84%
They don't know what
they're talking about.

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you do
need to kind of search

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:44.560 align:middle line:90%
the path on your own.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:46.470 align:middle line:84%
You have to seek like
I did in the beginning.

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:49.530 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't met Barbara right away,
I had about a year on my own.

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:51.940 align:middle line:84%
But there's an old expression,
when the student is ready,

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:53.250 align:middle line:90%
the teacher appears.

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:56.520 align:middle line:84%
So when you've kind of
taken it as far as you can,

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.445 align:middle line:84%
that's when you need
a teacher to go.

00:28:58.445 --> 00:28:59.820 align:middle line:84%
There was a
gentleman that talked

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:02.800 align:middle line:84%
about going to these different
weekend events for years.

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:03.880 align:middle line:90%
And he said, it's fun.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.430 align:middle line:84%
It's exciting to go to
these spiritual events

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:06.870 align:middle line:84%
but I feel like
I've gone nowhere.

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:09.640 align:middle line:84%
It's three years and I'm
back where I started from.

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.120 align:middle line:84%
So it's like-- that's like
a merry go round, right.

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:14.310 align:middle line:90%
It's not really the path upward.

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got
students that you

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.160 align:middle line:84%
teach on a regular
basis, and some of them

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.885 align:middle line:90%
decided to talk about it.

00:29:21.885 --> 00:29:23.125 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: Oh-oh.

00:29:23.125 --> 00:29:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I think SAI just kind of
showed up at the right time

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:29.460 align:middle line:84%
when it was time for me to go
deeper into my spiritual work.

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:31.420 align:middle line:84%
I only wish I would
have done it sooner.

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:33.750 align:middle line:84%
I signed up for change
your aura, change your life

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:35.220 align:middle line:90%
and I went through that program.

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:38.525 align:middle line:90%
And it was life changing.

00:29:38.525 --> 00:29:43.620 align:middle line:84%
>> It challenges you to let
go of any preconceived ideas,

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:45.520 align:middle line:90%
ideology, and beliefs.

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Stepping into the classes was
like putting language to a very

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:52.710 align:middle line:84%
long journey where I had
searched for a long time

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:53.790 align:middle line:90%
for answers.

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:56.865 align:middle line:10%
And they started to give
me a language for those.

00:29:56.865 --> 00:30:01.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Spiritual Arts will give you
the tools you need to help make

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.460 align:middle line:90%
changes.

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:07.020 align:middle line:84%
Once you learn it
and you practice it,

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:10.700 align:middle line:84%
it just brings so
much into your life.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:13.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I came for the very first
time and there was just this

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:17.550 align:middle line:84%
inexplicable energy
that you felt,

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:22.050 align:middle line:84%
kind of like hits you like a
wall almost and almost like all

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:24.690 align:middle line:84%
this like energy
and light and love.

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:27.880 align:middle line:90%
And I was just like, whoa.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.225 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is amazing.

00:30:29.225 --> 00:30:30.225 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: That's nice.

00:30:30.225 --> 00:30:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does
that enhance the soul,

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:33.605 align:middle line:90%
what they were talking about?

00:30:33.605 --> 00:30:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Well,
I think they're

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:37.870 align:middle line:84%
describing-- all those
people were spiritual truth

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:38.670 align:middle line:90%
seekers, right.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:41.867 align:middle line:84%
They already had their
awakening and they

00:30:41.867 --> 00:30:42.825 align:middle line:90%
were trying something--

00:30:42.825 --> 00:30:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Prior to coming to you.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:45.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: Exactly, exactly.

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.000 align:middle line:84%
But then when they found
this teaching it's like,

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.320 align:middle line:84%
wow, the pieces started
to come together.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.995 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the exact same
feeling I had when I started.

00:30:52.995 --> 00:30:55.423 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, now I understand
this, this, and this.

00:30:55.423 --> 00:30:56.590 align:middle line:90%
It all starts to make sense.

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:57.715 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it an epiphany?

00:30:57.715 --> 00:30:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Yeah,
it's a great word.

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:01.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it is like an epiphany.

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just like
anything when you're

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.610 align:middle line:84%
struggling to solve a problem
in your life or anything

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:09.390 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly, oh, I
didn't think of it that way,

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:11.227 align:middle line:84%
you get these
epiphanies and it starts

00:31:11.227 --> 00:31:12.435 align:middle line:90%
to put things in perspective.

00:31:12.435 --> 00:31:13.545 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: These aha moments.

00:31:13.545 --> 00:31:14.503 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:31:14.503 --> 00:31:17.142 align:middle line:84%
But if they hadn't done the
searching they already did,

00:31:17.142 --> 00:31:18.600 align:middle line:84%
they might not have
gotten to that.

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.270 align:middle line:84%
We have to-- there's a
great ancient saying,

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:23.670 align:middle line:84%
the seeking of the
philosopher's stone

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:25.860 align:middle line:90%
sets the condition to find it.

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:29.320 align:middle line:84%
So as we're searching, even if
you haven't found the answers

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:33.100 align:middle line:84%
yet, keep searching because it's
literally changing your psyche

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:35.380 align:middle line:84%
and the changing process
that will lead you

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.205 align:middle line:90%
to the revelations you need.

00:31:37.205 --> 00:31:40.385 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The soul, what
does it mean to you?

00:31:40.385 --> 00:31:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: We are a soul.

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:46.230 align:middle line:84%
We have a body, we have a mind,
we have an aura, we are a soul.

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:49.305 align:middle line:84%
And quite simply
the soul is life.

00:31:49.305 --> 00:31:51.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has anybody
ever been soulless?

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:53.535 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: No, no
because they are a soul.

00:31:53.535 --> 00:31:54.493 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can't be done.

00:31:54.493 --> 00:31:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Well,
you are a soul.

00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:59.100 align:middle line:84%
You can be-- now, when
we say people are soul--

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.770 align:middle line:84%
oh, you have no soul,
let's say someone

00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:02.760 align:middle line:84%
that's done
something evil, we're

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:06.420 align:middle line:84%
saying they're so out of touch
with their soul, their soul

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:09.540 align:middle line:84%
disconnected from it
that it feels like, well,

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:10.680 align:middle line:90%
where is that soul?

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.990 align:middle line:84%
You're doing these horrible
things, where is it?

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:17.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, we can bury it deep
but never completely.

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:20.350 align:middle line:84%
We must remember life
is not a happy accident.

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:23.430 align:middle line:84%
It's not some primordial
ooze that came together

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:25.110 align:middle line:90%
and the electricity created.

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:27.180 align:middle line:84%
There may have been
primitive forms of life

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:30.120 align:middle line:84%
like that but life is
immortal, it's eternal,

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.680 align:middle line:90%
and it's inherently good.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:36.718 align:middle line:84%
And the life that's in you, the
life that's in me is sacred.

00:32:36.718 --> 00:32:41.015 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this a special
time in our life right now?

00:32:41.015 --> 00:32:42.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: It really is.

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:43.070 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:46.020 align:middle line:84%
There are so many things
converging right now

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:46.820 align:middle line:90%
for humanity.

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:49.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we feel it on a
physical level, right.

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just the
technological changes.

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, can we even
keep up with it all?

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:53.780 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:56.150 align:middle line:84%
I think some of the anxiety
is coming just from that.

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I just learned
this, now there's this?

00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:00.080 align:middle line:84%
I haven't even
finished learning one,

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:02.360 align:middle line:84%
you got to learn
something new but it's

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:04.370 align:middle line:90%
an accelerated time in general.

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, interestingly
enough, if you

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:09.530 align:middle line:84%
follow some of the Indian
philosophy, the ages,

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:12.050 align:middle line:84%
we came out of the Dark
Age, the Kali Yuga,

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:14.700 align:middle line:84%
we're in the Dvapara
Age right now,

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.130 align:middle line:84%
which is the age of
mental acceleration.

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:18.710 align:middle line:90%
So that's coming up right now.

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:20.450 align:middle line:90%
That's changing dynamics.

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And also the higher is
coming in right now.

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:25.070 align:middle line:84%
There's more people
interested in metaphysics

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:26.950 align:middle line:84%
than ever before,
and it's happening--

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:27.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It seems to be.

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:28.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: Yeah.

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's not coming from
one place in the world, it's

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:35.600 align:middle line:84%
coming-- or one person,
it's like this grass that

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.440 align:middle line:90%
seems to be growing everywhere.

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:41.712 align:middle line:84%
And this is why a conversation
like this, a couple

00:33:41.712 --> 00:33:43.170 align:middle line:84%
hundred years ago
we'd be having it

00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:44.545 align:middle line:84%
in a mystery school
or an ashram,

00:33:44.545 --> 00:33:46.350 align:middle line:90%
not on the public platform.

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:47.378 align:middle line:90%
But right now--

00:33:47.378 --> 00:33:49.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They'd be
burning us at the stake.

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Well, they
might be trying, yeah.

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Those were scary
years where you had

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.250 align:middle line:84%
to hide that because some
were trying to suppress

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:58.110 align:middle line:90%
exactly what you say, yeah.

00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:59.940 align:middle line:84%
So you see we've look--
it shows you again

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:02.760 align:middle line:84%
how much we've come
out of that now there's

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.410 align:middle line:90%
this reemergence of metaphysics.

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And Barbara called it
years ago, she said,

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:08.020 align:middle line:90%
this is just the beginning.

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:10.409 align:middle line:84%
This is just a clarion
call, and now we're

00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:13.050 align:middle line:84%
moving into a different
phase of that clarion call

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:14.429 align:middle line:90%
and it's going to get more.

00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:17.280 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be more
interest, more knowledge.

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:20.250 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I'm so excited
about, I remember when we--

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:23.082 align:middle line:84%
20 years ago when we were
starting some of this,

00:34:23.082 --> 00:34:24.540 align:middle line:84%
people were very
interested in what

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:28.230 align:middle line:84%
I would call the phenomenal
things about the metaphysics,

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:30.120 align:middle line:84%
but now they really are
asking the questions

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:30.989 align:middle line:90%
you're bringing up.

00:34:30.989 --> 00:34:32.699 align:middle line:90%
How can I grow my soul?

00:34:32.699 --> 00:34:35.730 align:middle line:84%
So that tells me the whole
movement is maturing now

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:38.310 align:middle line:84%
and people are asking even
more essential and important

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:39.239 align:middle line:90%
questions.

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:41.429 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we get
this enlightenment?

00:34:41.429 --> 00:34:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Well, that's
a maturity-- that's

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:44.980 align:middle line:90%
a maturing process.

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:47.520 align:middle line:84%
So that's like as
we grow from a child

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.980 align:middle line:84%
to an adult, many
different things change.

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:53.340 align:middle line:84%
As the soul grows from one
state to a more mature state,

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.830 align:middle line:84%
it starts awakening
these internal powers,

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:57.750 align:middle line:84%
and enlightenment
and our philosophy

00:34:57.750 --> 00:35:00.210 align:middle line:84%
is having the God
within experience.

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Understanding there is a
divine intelligence guiding us,

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:04.920 align:middle line:84%
and you're having
that experience

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:08.650 align:middle line:84%
through your own internal direct
not through an intermediary.

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:10.770 align:middle line:84%
This is you direct
with the divine.

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a
moment in time-- what

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:15.340 align:middle line:84%
happens in a moment in time,
but it's a transformation.

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:16.140 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:19.140 align:middle line:84%
After that point, you're
a different person.

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Yogananda would say the goal is
to see God face to face while

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:24.670 align:middle line:90%
in a physical body.

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:28.740 align:middle line:84%
I didn't mean a literal face
but he meant that inner divine

00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:31.920 align:middle line:84%
knowing of God, the God that's
closer than hands and feet.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:35.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you talked
about auras and Barbara Martin

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:38.916 align:middle line:84%
being able to see them at such
a young age, what is an aura?

00:35:38.916 --> 00:35:40.041 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean to you?

00:35:40.041 --> 00:35:42.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Aura is the
invisible vibratory essence

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:44.240 align:middle line:84%
that surrounds
all living things.

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:47.280 align:middle line:84%
It's the energetic
blueprint of the soul.

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Everything you're
thinking right now,

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:52.344 align:middle line:84%
feeling is coming
through an energy.

00:35:52.344 --> 00:35:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the
foundation of everything.

00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:59.400 align:middle line:84%
So if I want to change
something in my life,

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.510 align:middle line:90%
I start with my aura.

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:03.750 align:middle line:84%
If the energy is in my
aura, it'll be on my life.

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:04.590 align:middle line:90%
A simple example.

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:06.990 align:middle line:84%
When I first met Barbara, I
was still in the film biz,

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:08.910 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes it's
a feast or famine.

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:10.500 align:middle line:84%
You're working all
the time like crazy

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:11.010 align:middle line:90%
or you're not working at all.

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or you're
not working at all.

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:12.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: Yeah.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was in that moment of
not working at all but she

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:16.800 align:middle line:84%
was looking at my
heart center which

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.690 align:middle line:84%
has a lot to do
with world affairs,

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:21.630 align:middle line:84%
saw this turquoise light
which is prosperity

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:23.412 align:middle line:84%
and said, oh, you're
going to get it.

00:36:23.412 --> 00:36:25.120 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get
a good job real soon.

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And two weeks later, I
got the most lucrative job

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:30.210 align:middle line:84%
I got in the business
up to that point.

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:33.302 align:middle line:84%
It was already in my
aura, the energy of it,

00:36:33.302 --> 00:36:35.010 align:middle line:84%
but it just hadn't
physically manifested.

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:36.765 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She knew
it before you did.

00:36:36.765 --> 00:36:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:41.640 align:middle line:84%
So it taught me it
really is in your aura.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.140 align:middle line:84%
If it's in your aura,
it'll be in your life.

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not in your
aura, don't complain.

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:47.287 align:middle line:90%
Just build it up.

00:36:47.287 --> 00:36:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we look at
somebody and say, well,

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:51.030 align:middle line:90%
how come they're so successful?

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:53.010 align:middle line:84%
How come they have all
the things they want?

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:54.690 align:middle line:90%
Well, use them as an example.

00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:56.520 align:middle line:90%
Use them as a blueprint.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:59.460 align:middle line:84%
Build it up yourself,
get that energy moving

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:00.435 align:middle line:90%
and you'll have it too.

00:37:00.435 --> 00:37:02.721 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are chakra points?

00:37:02.721 --> 00:37:05.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Well, if the
aura is the first place

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:07.650 align:middle line:84%
you make changes in
your aura, the chakras

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:09.990 align:middle line:84%
are the first place you
make changes in your aura.

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:11.740 align:middle line:90%
They are the energy centers.

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:13.605 align:middle line:84%
They're deep within
the auric field.

00:37:13.605 --> 00:37:14.772 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How many are there?

00:37:14.772 --> 00:37:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Well,
there's seven of them

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.830 align:middle line:84%
and they are kind of
contact points for the light

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:21.390 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness.

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And we bring in--
in our meditations

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:26.850 align:middle line:84%
we bring in light into those
chakras to transform them.

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:28.350 align:middle line:84%
Like this one here
is the mental.

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:30.840 align:middle line:84%
So right now the
mental chakra is

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.180 align:middle line:84%
radiating energy corresponding
to the quality of my thinking.

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I'm thinking
great thoughts,

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.312 align:middle line:84%
that energy is
going to wonderful.

00:37:37.312 --> 00:37:40.260 align:middle line:84%
If I'm really upset and
mad about something,

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:42.030 align:middle line:84%
some of those colors
may change a little.

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:44.430 align:middle line:84%
I want to change my
thinking, I want to keep--

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:47.100 align:middle line:84%
how can I make the things
I want reality if I'm

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:48.660 align:middle line:90%
harboring these dark thoughts?

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.120 align:middle line:84%
We have one connected
to our words,

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.850 align:middle line:84%
our actions, and another one
connected to our emotions.

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:56.670 align:middle line:84%
These four are
crucial because these

00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:59.100 align:middle line:84%
are the ones where we make
a lot of energetic changes

00:37:59.100 --> 00:37:59.900 align:middle line:90%
in ourselves.

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:01.788 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can we control them?

00:38:01.788 --> 00:38:02.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: Yes, you can.

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:03.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like chakra points?

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:04.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: Yeah.

00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:06.243 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can-- well, for
example, take the emotion.

00:38:06.243 --> 00:38:07.660 align:middle line:84%
So I would ask the
question, well,

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:09.160 align:middle line:84%
are you in control
of your emotions?

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:10.825 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Some may say--

00:38:10.825 --> 00:38:11.935 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who knows, right?

00:38:11.935 --> 00:38:12.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: Yeah.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.805 align:middle line:84%
But you want to develop
a control over them.

00:38:15.805 --> 00:38:19.420 align:middle line:84%
So if I see you I have
an unhealthy emotion,

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:20.902 align:middle line:84%
I got to start
turning that around.

00:38:20.902 --> 00:38:22.360 align:middle line:84%
I got to start
turning that around.

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you see, Dimitri,

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:27.100 align:middle line:84%
is the difference between
meditation and prayer

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:28.030 align:middle line:90%
or are they the same?

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:30.113 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Oh, wow, that's
such a great question.

00:38:30.113 --> 00:38:32.240 align:middle line:84%
No, they're actually the
complement of each other.

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:35.380 align:middle line:84%
So in our work we do what
we call meditative prayers.

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:37.690 align:middle line:84%
So prayer is
petitioning the divine.

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:39.490 align:middle line:90%
It's a reaching out of energy.

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:41.770 align:middle line:84%
It's you connecting
with the divine.

00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:44.270 align:middle line:84%
Meditating is a receiving
from the divine.

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:48.250 align:middle line:84%
So in our prayer work we make
a petition to the divine.

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Let's say I ask to
receive the love energy.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And then we receive in
meditation the love energy

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:55.510 align:middle line:90%
and it complete the circuit.

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:59.390 align:middle line:84%
You need both daily
meditation and prayer.

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:00.795 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating, isn't it?

00:39:00.795 --> 00:39:02.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Yeah, it's
just so much to learn.

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:03.795 align:middle line:90%
It's really quite exciting.

00:39:03.795 --> 00:39:05.225 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's next for you?

00:39:05.225 --> 00:39:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Well, we have
a new book coming out,

00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:10.650 align:middle line:84%
a 25 anniversary edition
of "Change Your Aura."

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:12.480 align:middle line:84%
We've added some new
chapters on there

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.790 align:middle line:84%
on the rhythms of the
aura, a little bit

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:17.220 align:middle line:84%
about the transcendent
consciousness you were asking

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:19.800 align:middle line:90%
about, and also some aids.

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Like crystals and candles,
how they help with that.

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:24.930 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be working
on a book on consciousness,

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:28.020 align:middle line:84%
understanding how to bring in
what you just asked earlier,

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:30.360 align:middle line:84%
more inspirational
power so that we

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.280 align:middle line:90%
can live a more inspired life.

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:35.040 align:middle line:90%
And the classes are a delight.

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Working with people
is so exciting.

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:39.120 align:middle line:84%
When you're with a
group of people--

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:42.220 align:middle line:84%
part of the journey of
metaphysics is community.

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:44.295 align:middle line:84%
So when you're with others
that are of like mind,

00:39:44.295 --> 00:39:45.795 align:middle line:84%
if they aren't
physically with you--

00:39:45.795 --> 00:39:46.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You feed off them.

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Yeah,
support each other

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:50.730 align:middle line:84%
because often maybe even
our immediate family

00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:53.200 align:middle line:84%
is not so understanding
of what we're doing.

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:56.550 align:middle line:84%
But if we can find out, oh,
you're interested in this too,

00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:58.230 align:middle line:90%
it just helps to build.

00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
with people that are

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.600 align:middle line:84%
looking to better
themselves, there's

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:02.750 align:middle line:90%
nothing better than that.

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:04.460 align:middle line:90%
It's a very rewarding.

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:06.400 align:middle line:84%
I have to say it's been
a very rewarding work

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.270 align:middle line:90%
to be part of this.

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the ride
continues for you.

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:10.213 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: Oh, very much.

00:40:10.213 --> 00:40:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Oh my god, we have a
lot more books to write,

00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:13.940 align:middle line:90%
a lot more people to reach.

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:15.880 align:middle line:84%
We want to grow the
organization more.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.335 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot ahead of us, yes.

00:40:17.335 --> 00:40:19.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The late
American Prophet

00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:23.930 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Cayce could read
auras as well as anybody.

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And one day he was getting
into an elevator in a high

00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:28.990 align:middle line:90%
rise building--

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:30.692 align:middle line:90%
this is way back, way back.

00:40:30.692 --> 00:40:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: Very interesting.

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:33.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The door
opens up and he

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:36.130 align:middle line:84%
sees three or four
people in there

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:39.250 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't see one
aura around them.

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:42.250 align:middle line:84%
It scared the living
daylights out of him, Dimitri.

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:43.390 align:middle line:90%
He stepped back.

00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:45.040 align:middle line:90%
He didn't go into the elevator.

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.720 align:middle line:90%
He didn't know what was wrong.

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:49.480 align:middle line:84%
All he knew was these
are people without auras.

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.520 align:middle line:90%
He's never seen this before.

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:57.190 align:middle line:84%
The door closed, the cables
snapped and they all died.

00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:58.575 align:middle line:90%
He saved his life--

00:40:58.575 --> 00:40:59.965 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: But not those three.

00:40:59.965 --> 00:41:00.805 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But not those people.

00:41:00.805 --> 00:41:02.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.690 align:middle line:90%
Well, he was an amazing man.

00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:07.210 align:middle line:84%
My first book I ever
read when I woke up--

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:09.310 align:middle line:84%
I had my awakening was
"There is a River,"

00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:11.200 align:middle line:90%
the story of Edgar Cayce.

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.610 align:middle line:90%
It's a remarkable story.

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:16.160 align:middle line:90%
He was a remarkable man.

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And, yes, I mean, as
Barbara would say,

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:22.520 align:middle line:84%
it's not always
fun seeing the aura

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:26.400 align:middle line:84%
because you can see some pretty
unhealthy and ugly things.

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And like you're saying, if
you see that the energies are

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:32.700 align:middle line:84%
starting to withdraw and then
it was already in the atmosphere

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:35.310 align:middle line:84%
that these people were going
to make their transition,

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:38.460 align:middle line:84%
it was not his time yet
so he stayed back there.

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:40.920 align:middle line:90%
But, yes, the aura doesn't lie.

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.780 align:middle line:84%
We can kind of fib
with each other

00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:45.330 align:middle line:84%
but either it's in
your aura or it's not.

00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And the aura always
tells the truth.

00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the
divine light God?

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: It's
the light of God.

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:53.320 align:middle line:84%
It's the conduit
of consciousness.

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:58.260 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is let's
say I'm in a state of anger,

00:41:58.260 --> 00:41:59.655 align:middle line:84%
I'm mad at somebody
or something.

00:41:59.655 --> 00:42:00.455 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or bliss.

00:42:00.455 --> 00:42:01.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: Or bliss.

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:04.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was trying to show
the transforma-- so, yeah,

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:06.870 align:middle line:84%
if you're in bliss that means
you have this light of God

00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:08.190 align:middle line:90%
flowing through you.

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:13.070 align:middle line:84%
But if for some reason you're
not in that blissful state,

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:15.110 align:middle line:84%
the light can bring
you back into that

00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:17.420 align:middle line:84%
because it brings the
consciousness of, let's say,

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:18.625 align:middle line:90%
love or peace or wisdom.

00:42:18.625 --> 00:42:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have to do that
yourself or does it happen?

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.262 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: It
happens automatically.

00:42:22.262 --> 00:42:24.050 align:middle line:84%
We all are blessed
but when you add--

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:27.900 align:middle line:84%
when you cooperate with
the process, it multiplies.

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:30.683 align:middle line:84%
So everyone receives
divine light otherwise

00:42:30.683 --> 00:42:32.600 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't be able to
function on this Earth.

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And every time, by
the way, when you

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:36.080 align:middle line:84%
are trying to be
a better person,

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:37.820 align:middle line:84%
you're building up
that through what--

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:40.430 align:middle line:84%
we say through every good
word, thought, act, and deed.

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:46.120 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, we can
be more diligent to build it up

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:47.950 align:middle line:90%
but we still have to apply it.

00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:49.620 align:middle line:84%
For example, let's
say you're trying

00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:52.560 align:middle line:84%
to get that raise at that
job and you chicken out

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:53.850 align:middle line:90%
going to the boss's office.

00:42:53.850 --> 00:42:54.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:55.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You get scared.

00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:56.475 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: You get scared.

00:42:56.475 --> 00:42:58.380 align:middle line:84%
So in your aura you
might have a little bit

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:00.360 align:middle line:90%
of gray, a little bit of fear.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:03.690 align:middle line:84%
But the energy of courage
and confidence is gold.

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:05.760 align:middle line:84%
So you could meditate
with that gold light,

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:06.958 align:middle line:90%
bring it into your aura.

00:43:06.958 --> 00:43:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Now you still have to walk
into the boss's office

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.715 align:middle line:84%
and ask for the raise
but you may notice,

00:43:11.715 --> 00:43:13.715 align:middle line:84%
hey, I have a little more
confidence to do this.

00:43:13.715 --> 00:43:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if you
go to sleep and dream

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:21.030 align:middle line:84%
on it, sending messages to
your boss in the dream state,

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:22.650 align:middle line:90%
and he does it on his own.

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Well,
that's a possibility.

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:25.515 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they will.

00:43:25.515 --> 00:43:27.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dimitri, we're
giving you a raise today.

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:29.520 align:middle line:84%
You've been here
for 22 years, you've

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:31.190 align:middle line:90%
never increased your salary.

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:32.010 align:middle line:90%
That happens.

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:33.385 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Yeah,
it does happen,

00:43:33.385 --> 00:43:34.930 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes that works.

00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:39.030 align:middle line:84%
But part of the lesson is to
have the courage to ask for it.

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:41.730 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we have
to build our character.

00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:45.362 align:middle line:84%
So if I have the fear, I don't
want to have the fear anymore.

00:43:45.362 --> 00:43:46.570 align:middle line:90%
I want to be able to ask her.

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:48.820 align:middle line:84%
But you're right, sometimes
working with the light,

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:50.320 align:middle line:90%
it happens automatically.

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:51.910 align:middle line:84%
There have been
stories where people

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:54.460 align:middle line:84%
have worked with a turquoise
ray, which is the prosperity

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:57.940 align:middle line:84%
energy, and an
unexpected check came in.

00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:00.400 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time
we say, well, you still

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:02.230 align:middle line:84%
got to follow the
laws of prosperity,

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:05.050 align:middle line:84%
you've still got to do the
things to manifest wealth.

00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:08.050 align:middle line:84%
But the consciousness--
it's amazing to think, let's

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:10.195 align:middle line:84%
say, with prosperity it's
first a consciousness.

00:44:10.195 --> 00:44:12.070 align:middle line:84%
It's not how much money
you have in the bank.

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:14.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where does
karma fit into this?

00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Well, karma is
the law of cause and effect.

00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:18.850 align:middle line:90%
So what you sow you reap.

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:21.220 align:middle line:84%
So this says that
every action has

00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:22.990 align:middle line:90%
an equal and opposite reaction.

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:24.744 align:middle line:90%
It's like the laws of physics.

00:44:24.744 --> 00:44:29.670 align:middle line:84%
So if I do something
that's very life enhancing,

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:32.350 align:middle line:84%
karmically that'll come
back to me as a blessing.

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:35.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not a reward
exactly, it's a law.

00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I hurt somebody, if I
do some destructive things, that

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:43.210 align:middle line:84%
comes back to me too and
what I have to do is fix it.

00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:45.070 align:middle line:90%
And there's disharmony there.

00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:47.740 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes we meet people in
our life and we wonder, well,

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:50.010 align:middle line:84%
why is this such a
difficult relationship?

00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:51.720 align:middle line:10%
And why can't I
get away from it?

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:53.430 align:middle line:10%
I seem to be like
stuck with this person.

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:56.100 align:middle line:10%
Well, maybe there's a
karmic relationship there.

00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:58.380 align:middle line:10%
Maybe you're paying
back something.

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:01.440 align:middle line:10%
And instead of seeing
them as the troublemaker,

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:02.910 align:middle line:10%
see them as the opportunity.

00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:05.160 align:middle line:84%
There's something you're
learning through all of that.

00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you do it with the
intent of being good and not

00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:12.645 align:middle line:84%
expecting anything in return,
it seems to work better.

00:45:12.645 --> 00:45:13.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:17.830 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- again, the divine
is not a rewards process.

00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:20.280 align:middle line:84%
So you should do it
exactly for what you said,

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:21.907 align:middle line:90%
because it's a good thing to do.

00:45:21.907 --> 00:45:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:24.360 align:middle line:90%
Dimitri, what's your website?

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MORAITIS: spiritualarts.org

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.625 align:middle line:84%
And people can email
you through that?

00:45:28.625 --> 00:45:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Yes,
yes, absolutely.

00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:32.530 align:middle line:84%
We do classes online,
in-person if you

00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:35.230 align:middle line:84%
happen to be in the
Southern California area.

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:39.145 align:middle line:84%
But we've been doing webinars
and web conferences since 2006.

00:45:39.145 --> 00:45:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:42.437 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Oh,
it's been amazing.

00:45:42.437 --> 00:45:44.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Great to
have you with us.

00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:45.112 align:middle line:90%
You do a wonderful job.

00:45:45.112 --> 00:45:46.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MORAITIS: Thank
you, and you too.

00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:47.535 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:45:47.535 --> 00:45:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've learned a
lot about the soul today.

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:53.740 align:middle line:10%
He's enlightened
me, he's helped me,

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:56.950 align:middle line:10%
and I can't wait to apply some
of these meditation techniques

00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:58.390 align:middle line:10%
that he's talked to us about.

00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:59.920 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
