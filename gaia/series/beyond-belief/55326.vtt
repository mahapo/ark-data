00:00:05.024 --> 00:00:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.780 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.668 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.668 --> 00:00:13.220 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.255 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:27.840 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>>From fish to birds and
every creature in between,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.790 align:middle line:84%
animals make such a big impact
on people and on the earth

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.050 align:middle line:90%
we live on.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Animals bring us joy, love, and
for some, a purpose to live.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Their faces and
expressions can make

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.960 align:middle line:90%
us feel a range of emotions.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And the happiness they bring
into our lives can comfort us.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.960 align:middle line:84%
The word animal comes
from the Latin word

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.740 align:middle line:90%
animalis, meaning having breath.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And for some of us, our animals
are a breath of fresh air.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.950 align:middle line:84%
Most would say that we
are very lucky to share

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.080 align:middle line:84%
our planet with
creatures called animals.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.330 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well, welcome
to an incredible portion

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.310 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.320 align:middle line:10%
We're going to talk about
animals in this program

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.490 align:middle line:10%
with an animal communicator,
Amelia Kinkade, noted author.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.160 align:middle line:84%
One of her books, "Straight
from the Horse's Mouth."

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.057 align:middle line:84%
What an exciting
career you have.

00:01:22.057 --> 00:01:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AMELIA KINKADE: Ah, thank you.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.280 align:middle line:90%
So do you.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
get involved in this?

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: I actually discovered
this completely by accident.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.285 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's why I can
now teach it all over the world.

00:01:33.285 --> 00:01:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
always love animals?

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure you did.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.406 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: I always
loved animals.

00:01:36.406 --> 00:01:38.910 align:middle line:10%
I was an actress and
a dancer in Hollywood.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.590 align:middle line:10%
And I had a very,
very cantankerous cat.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.270 align:middle line:10%
And I took this
loud mouthed kitten

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.510 align:middle line:10%
to go see an animal
communicator.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.470 align:middle line:10%
And this was in my early 20s.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.170 align:middle line:84%
She completely blew my
mind as he described

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.490 align:middle line:84%
the inside of my
condo and things

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.710 align:middle line:84%
that had been said to
him the day before.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.440 align:middle line:84%
She was offering
a workshop, which

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.355 align:middle line:84%
is what I now teach
everywhere around the world.

00:02:04.355 --> 00:02:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All over
the place, yeah.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: And I went
into that workshop

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.420 align:middle line:84%
thinking I'd be the last person
in the world that could do it.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.700 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't have an agenda.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.520 align:middle line:84%
I went in simply
because I loved my cat.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.230 align:middle line:90%
And it's a meditative process.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a type of prayer
where we connect

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.870 align:middle line:90%
to the universal consciousness.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.810 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if there is--
and this is in my second book,

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.320 align:middle line:90%
"The Language of Miracles."

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.390 align:middle line:84%
Captain Edgar Mitchell, the
Apollo astronaut, love him.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.250 align:middle line:90%
He mentored this book.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And he gave me the
new terminology

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.975 align:middle line:90%
of the zero-point energy field.

00:02:42.975 --> 00:02:43.600 align:middle line:90%
And we're now--

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was the one, huh?

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: He's the one.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.960 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about
the quantum hologram.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: And in
the last meeting

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.660 align:middle line:84%
where he had the world's
most brilliant scientists, he

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.410 align:middle line:84%
actually said at
the IONS conference,

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.420 align:middle line:84%
there's a woman in this audience
who is proof that the quantum

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.510 align:middle line:84%
hologram is the latest
model of physics.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.047 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a woman here
who can telepath with tigers.

00:03:15.047 --> 00:03:16.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you stood up.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.160 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: If you could
imagine, I burst into tears.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.743 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:03:18.743 --> 00:03:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, what
are you going to do?

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:21.130 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What an accolade,
coming from somebody

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:23.710 align:middle line:90%
like that, too.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Oh, my goodness.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.010 align:middle line:84%
This is somebody who redesigned
the space station for fun

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.180 align:middle line:90%
in his spare time.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.740 align:middle line:84%
But he's giving us a new
way to look at the world.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And that new way is that all
living beings and inanimate

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.400 align:middle line:84%
objects-- which makes
it even crazier--

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.850 align:middle line:84%
are emanating tiny particles
of information called quanta.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, our scientists have
known this for a long time.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And that we know the
universe is in flux.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.150 align:middle line:84%
So we're dancing with
other living beings.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.050 align:middle line:84%
You're exchanging quanta with
the chair you're sitting in.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.990 align:middle line:84%
You're exchanging quanta
with other human beings.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.970 align:middle line:84%
You're exchanging
quanta with your dog.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:03.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.970 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: The new idea is
that the smallest particles

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.850 align:middle line:84%
of information
coming off every atom

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.050 align:middle line:84%
carry with it a replica
of the sender, the history

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.760 align:middle line:84%
of that animal, their medical
history, their emotions,

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.660 align:middle line:90%
their thoughts.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They tell
you everything.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.400 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Everything is
carried in the energy.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And once we learn how to
form this bridge-- which

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.930 align:middle line:84%
is what I teach, this
bridge between your heart

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.760 align:middle line:84%
and their heart-- what
Captain Mitchell says

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.450 align:middle line:90%
is that it's real.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.700 align:middle line:90%
It's called establishing phase.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
two waves to meet

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.560 align:middle line:90%
and they become twice as big.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.770 align:middle line:84%
So now there's an
avenue where you

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.580 align:middle line:84%
can communicate with
other living beings.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
level of animal, Amelia,

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.200 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't work?

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, can you do it
to the hamster level?

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Do you do it to
the turtle level?

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Or does it have to be a
mammal on a higher plane?

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Well,
every living being

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.640 align:middle line:90%
is a conscious sentient being.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.850 align:middle line:84%
Every living being
thinks in pictures.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A little ant,
for example, right?

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: A little ant
could be so much more

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.260 align:middle line:90%
intelligent than a human being.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.347 align:middle line:90%
We have no idea.

00:05:16.347 --> 00:05:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree with you.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: We have no idea.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have crumbs
under your couch.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.489 align:middle line:84%
One ant sends out
some sort of signal.

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they're all there.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.852 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: The next
thing you know,

00:05:24.852 --> 00:05:26.860 align:middle line:84%
you have 10,000
ants in your house.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.370 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how do they do that?

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.540 align:middle line:84%
They obviously can
communicate with each other.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.123 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
know how to find it.

00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:33.330 align:middle line:90%
And they know how to leave.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.038 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: They're
talking to each other.

00:05:35.038 --> 00:05:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So really
every living being

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.710 align:middle line:90%
has this ability to connect.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.000 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: We're talking about
a universal consciousness, where

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk
to the spirit of god

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.932 align:middle line:90%
within every living being.

00:05:46.932 --> 00:05:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether we call that
the zero-point energy

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.455 align:middle line:84%
field, we call that universal
intelligence, we call it god,

00:05:52.455 --> 00:05:55.680 align:middle line:84%
the zero-point energy field
is a new name for god.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's an ocean of
holographic records

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.410 align:middle line:84%
that houses within it the
history of every living being

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.340 align:middle line:84%
and makes the connection
possible through means

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.040 align:middle line:90%
of a quantum process.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And that quantum process
is unconditional love.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they sense
that Amelia, from you?

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.070 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Yes.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.760 align:middle line:84%
I lead safaris in Africa
where the leopards

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.390 align:middle line:90%
wait for the truck.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's unheard of.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:21.420 align:middle line:90%
Unheard of.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: And the
leopards say, come back

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.010 align:middle line:84%
when the other
tourists are gone.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.262 align:middle line:90%
I have something to show you.

00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:28.470 align:middle line:90%
This just happened in August.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.011 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They enjoy
this, don't they?

00:06:30.011 --> 00:06:32.320 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: And she hops
down from the tree.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.230 align:middle line:90%
She does this.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.790 align:middle line:90%
And she brings two cubs to me.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.109 align:middle line:84%
And then she starts going
[IMITATES LEOPARD] Now,

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:42.150 align:middle line:90%
we're all alone with her.

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:43.420 align:middle line:90%
All the other trucks are gone.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:48.350 align:middle line:84%
We've come back to take a
meeting with a wild leopard.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.969 align:middle line:90%
She calls her mate.

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:52.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it shows up?

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: And I have
two leopard babies

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.680 align:middle line:84%
and an entire
leopard family that

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.080 align:middle line:90%
are taking a meeting with me.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
comfortable with you.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.583 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: And the great white
sharks do that in Africa.

00:07:02.583 --> 00:07:05.812 align:middle line:84%
And the whales do it now
off the coast of California.

00:07:05.812 --> 00:07:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
it that they feel?

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:08.880 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how do they do this?

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.600 align:middle line:90%
How do you do this?

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: They feel the light.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what we're going through
now with our technology is

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.520 align:middle line:84%
almost a Renaissance,
which we very much need.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.250 align:middle line:90%
So we now have a world wide web.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.680 align:middle line:90%
We know how to get online.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.090 align:middle line:84%
This is a different-- this
is a spiritual Renaissance.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.350 align:middle line:84%
I teach people how to
get online with nature,

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:33.780 align:middle line:90%
with other living beings.

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would
guess dolphins must

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.980 align:middle line:84%
have an incredible
rapport with you.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.480 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: They do.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what we are talking
about here is a type of sonar.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.500 align:middle line:84%
So a dolphin's going to send out
a wave that disturbs the water.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.430 align:middle line:84%
It's going to locate an
object and bounce off,

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.930 align:middle line:84%
forming a feedback
loop, and coming back

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:52.870 align:middle line:90%
with the information.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.021 align:middle line:90%
How far away is that?

00:07:54.021 --> 00:07:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The size of it.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.300 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: How-- the size of it.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.050 align:middle line:90%
What's inside of it?

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:58.966 align:middle line:84%
That's how they can tell
if a woman's pregnant

00:07:58.966 --> 00:08:00.950 align:middle line:84%
or if a man has
metal in his body.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.010 align:middle line:84%
So what we're
learning how to do now

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:07.100 align:middle line:84%
is developed this sonar
so that we can reach out

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.590 align:middle line:84%
in consciousness, we
can reach out with love,

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:14.570 align:middle line:84%
locate another living being,
resonate on their frequency,

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.120 align:middle line:90%
and come back with information.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.250 align:middle line:84%
We can find out, what
are they feeling?

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:20.310 align:middle line:90%
What are they thinking?

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:22.250 align:middle line:90%
Are they in pain?

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And the more we practice, the
clearer the information can be.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.555 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you get happy
animals and sad animals?

00:08:30.555 --> 00:08:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Oh, god,
yes, of course.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What makes
one animal-- and I'm

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.380 align:middle line:84%
talking about a
house animal here.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.380 align:middle line:84%
What would make a house animal
happy and another one unhappy,

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:42.530 align:middle line:90%
the way they're treated?

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:43.988 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: The way
they're treated.

00:08:43.988 --> 00:08:46.880 align:middle line:84%
The way that we don't really
understand the animals

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.360 align:middle line:90%
that we think that we know.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Dogs-- I mean, I work with
lions and elephants and snakes

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:58.000 align:middle line:84%
and penguins and sharks
and tigers and everything

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:58.610 align:middle line:90%
under the sun.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, have you had
an animal basically tell you,

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:01.710 align:middle line:90%
get me out of here?

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:02.410 align:middle line:90%
Help me.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.770 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Yes, sure they do.

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:07.711 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes those are little
puppies that people bring home,

00:09:07.711 --> 00:09:09.710 align:middle line:84%
thinking that they're
going to make this-- well,

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:11.790 align:middle line:84%
they're not thinking they're
going to make the dog happy.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.820 align:middle line:84%
They're bringing the dog
home to make them happy.

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.069 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For themselves, yeah.

00:09:15.069 --> 00:09:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And dogs
are pack animals.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.450 align:middle line:84%
They have to be kept in
parties of two or more.

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:21.260 align:middle line:90%
Even cats live in colonies.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.430 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the time, our
animals are lonely.

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:25.800 align:middle line:90%
They're bored.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.070 align:middle line:84%
They need a lot more
play and stimulation.

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:29.528 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah,
that's a good point.

00:09:29.528 --> 00:09:30.720 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: They need a job.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And they know that
they're taking care of us.

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:34.870 align:middle line:90%
We're not taking care of them.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.179 align:middle line:90%
Our animals look after us.

00:09:36.179 --> 00:09:38.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You brought us
some pictures of animals.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.844 align:middle line:84%
I want to take a look
at some of these.

00:09:39.844 --> 00:09:41.840 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about these camels.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.723 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: I was--

00:09:42.723 --> 00:09:43.848 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And where is this?

00:09:43.848 --> 00:09:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: I was called to
this wonderful camel ranch.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:48.560 align:middle line:90%
This is in Southern California.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.210 align:middle line:84%
I just taught my level
one this last year.

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:55.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm teaching my Language
of Miracles program.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And I was brought in for
my first camel patient.

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And I had this
incredibly sick camel.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And the woman said, I don't
know what's wrong with him.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.230 align:middle line:90%
We brought the vet in.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.380 align:middle line:90%
We can't do anything.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:08.700 align:middle line:90%
It looks like he's dying.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.710 align:middle line:90%
What is going on here?

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.030 align:middle line:90%
And I met with a camel.

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And he just desperately
wanted a girlfriend.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And I said, where
do you want to go?

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.130 align:middle line:90%
He gave me a word oasis, oasis.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, come to find out,
there was another camel ranch

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.690 align:middle line:90%
that had all these females.

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:25.340 align:middle line:90%
And it was called Oasis.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:25.900 align:middle line:90%
And they--

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did he
know about this place?

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:31.090 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: They get very sick
when they're going into rut.

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:32.440 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know that.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.680 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes they can
actually almost die.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: And it's
a mating ritual.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:41.790 align:middle line:84%
The male camels starve
themselves before they mate.

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:45.680 align:middle line:84%
He knew about it because
animals are already online.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:49.390 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Your dog knows
what's going on in your life.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're not separated
by time and space are they?

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.990 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: They know who
you're talking to on the phone.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.156 align:middle line:84%
They know if you're having
a problem with your boss.

00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:58.790 align:middle line:84%
They know what you're supposed
to be doing with your life.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.440 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, he's supposed
to be an author and speaker

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.274 align:middle line:84%
and writer and he's
working in a day job

00:11:04.274 --> 00:11:05.440 align:middle line:90%
that he doesn't really like.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.170 align:middle line:84%
They know everything
about us, because they

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.080 align:middle line:90%
are reading the records.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So do you
bring him to this place.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Yes, we
got him relocated.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:17.590 align:middle line:84%
He got to go where he
wanted to go and have

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:19.174 align:middle line:84%
the girlfriend that
he wanted to have.

00:11:19.174 --> 00:11:20.173 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he's happy.

00:11:20.173 --> 00:11:21.785 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: And his
problems went away.

00:11:21.785 --> 00:11:22.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Isn't that amazing?

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:23.520 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Yeah.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
thank you, the animal?

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Yeah, they thank you.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:27.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In their
own little way?

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.935 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: We don't have
the picture of that,

00:11:28.935 --> 00:11:32.072 align:middle line:84%
but he thanked me with
a very big sloppy kiss.

00:11:32.072 --> 00:11:34.370 align:middle line:84%
You got to go to my
website to see that one.

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.010 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And give
out your website

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:37.551 align:middle line:10%
while we're talking
about it, Amelia.

00:11:37.551 --> 00:11:39.635 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: It's
www.ameliakinkade.com.

00:11:39.635 --> 00:11:40.395 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:11:40.395 --> 00:11:41.790 align:middle line:10%
Let's go to our next picture.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:43.540 align:middle line:10%
This is a little dog.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:44.870 align:middle line:10%
Tell me about this pooch.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:48.280 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: Oh, she is a
fabulous little, little dog.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:53.780 align:middle line:10%
This one was brought to me
because she had some separation

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.540 align:middle line:10%
anxiety and a lot of sadness.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.290 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Look how happy
you are with this.

00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:59.420 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Yeah,
yeah, I love her.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And come to find out, she
had lost some puppies.

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And I actually told the
mom, what I want you to do

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.700 align:middle line:84%
is get her some
little toys that look

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:13.210 align:middle line:90%
like the four puppies that died.

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And the mother said, oh, no,
she doesn't play with toys.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.211 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no, just--

00:12:17.211 --> 00:12:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Trust me.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.840 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: --trust me and do it.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.676 align:middle line:84%
And the dog collected
the four little toys,

00:12:22.676 --> 00:12:24.550 align:middle line:84%
put them in her bed,
and would sleep on them.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.383 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like they were
here little puppies.

00:12:26.383 --> 00:12:29.640 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: And even though
the human couldn't give her

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.020 align:middle line:84%
anything that could
replace her loss, she said,

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.910 align:middle line:84%
the look in that dog's eyes
when she handed her the puppies

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:38.110 align:middle line:90%
after she had just--

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is remarkable.

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: --had
her last puppy die.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.873 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think it's
remarkable the way you

00:12:41.873 --> 00:12:45.055 align:middle line:84%
sense it and you
pick up on that.

00:12:45.055 --> 00:12:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Well, everybody
has that ability to learn how

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:49.900 align:middle line:90%
to be--

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.437 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The lady didn't.

00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:52.020 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: No.

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.385 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She was the owner.

00:12:53.385 --> 00:12:56.890 align:middle line:10%
She probably was with the
little pooch for how long?

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:58.040 align:middle line:10%
Several years?

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.300 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: A lot of years.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.030 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You come
in just like that.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:06.104 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: Well, I come in to
find out what are they feeling?

00:13:06.104 --> 00:13:07.020 align:middle line:90%
What are they feeling?

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.061 align:middle line:90%
And then troubleshoot it.

00:13:08.061 --> 00:13:09.275 align:middle line:90%
What do they need?

00:13:09.275 --> 00:13:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you see
an instantaneous

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:16.730 align:middle line:84%
change with the animal once
you correct their issue,

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:19.460 align:middle line:84%
like this one wanted
little puppies around it?

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:20.990 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Yes.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:24.630 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they just
need to be heard.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:27.650 align:middle line:84%
When they have one human being--
the tigers will come up to me

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:29.100 align:middle line:90%
and say, why can you hear me?

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:29.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:32.130 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: I thought
all humans were deaf.

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:33.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're in shock.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: They're in shock.

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And once they have
a therapist to talk

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.030 align:middle line:84%
about-- it happens with
show horses all the time.

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:42.497 align:middle line:84%
I work with the
Olympic show team.

00:13:42.497 --> 00:13:43.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.765 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: And sometimes
they just need to be heard.

00:13:45.765 --> 00:13:46.890 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's remarkable.

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:49.240 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: One conversation,
and the next day,

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.630 align:middle line:10%
the horse is back to winning
everything under the sun.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I should have
had you around when

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.109 align:middle line:84%
I had a race horse
back in Michigan.

00:13:55.109 --> 00:13:55.900 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: You did?

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.765 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god, yeah, back
in Michigan and in Illinois.

00:13:58.765 --> 00:13:59.890 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Oh, my goodness.

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:01.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Some won.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.380 align:middle line:90%
Some didn't.

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:04.280 align:middle line:84%
But I could've had
you talking to them.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.946 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Well, let me tell you
a little bit about race horses.

00:14:06.946 --> 00:14:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you a little bit
about this Olympic winner here.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.570 align:middle line:84%
Horses are not
competitive by nature.

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And I've had people come in
and say, what's wrong with him,

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:17.600 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.590 align:middle line:90%
This horse is in Germany.

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:23.134 align:middle line:84%
He'd seen-- they were
flying in vets every day.

00:14:23.134 --> 00:14:24.800 align:middle line:84%
He's owned by the
richest man in France.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.870 align:middle line:84%
He's jumped by
Luciana Denise, who's

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:31.050 align:middle line:84%
now one of the absolute
top jockeys in the world.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:34.050 align:middle line:90%
A horse will throw the game.

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:37.310 align:middle line:84%
I've had race horses say, a
little philly was brought in.

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:38.330 align:middle line:90%
She'd never won before.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:39.460 align:middle line:90%
She was so scared.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.482 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to let her win.

00:14:41.482 --> 00:14:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
think it's the jockey.

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: And the
people think, there's

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:48.230 align:middle line:90%
something wrong with my horse.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And I've said to these
horses, don't you

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.690 align:middle line:84%
know you're going
to get in trouble.

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:54.450 align:middle line:90%
And he says, it's worth it.

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:56.090 align:middle line:90%
It's worth it to me.

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:59.537 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, this Olympic
show horse, when I said,

00:14:59.537 --> 00:15:00.870 align:middle line:90%
what on earth is wrong with you?

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:03.078 align:middle line:84%
Seven weeks before the
Olympics, he stops performing.

00:15:03.078 --> 00:15:04.290 align:middle line:90%
So we're in Germany.

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.095 align:middle line:84%
He's going to be
flown to London.

00:15:06.095 --> 00:15:07.330 align:middle line:90%
I said, what's happening?

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:12.450 align:middle line:84%
He said, it's my best
friend's turn to win.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:13.862 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:15:13.862 --> 00:15:14.820 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Here he is.

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:15.903 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is this him here?

00:15:15.903 --> 00:15:17.320 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Here he is.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.310 align:middle line:84%
This is Winning
Mood, who's probably

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:22.610 align:middle line:84%
one of my favorite living
beings on this planet.

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:26.469 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I
want a girlfriend.

00:15:26.469 --> 00:15:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what he wanted.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: I want a girlfriend.

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't
allowed to have--

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.850 align:middle line:84%
they're not allowed
to have lives.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Horses are extremely
social beings.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:39.520 align:middle line:90%
They're herd animals.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And come to find
out, a female had

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:44.310 align:middle line:84%
been introduced to the horse
across from him in the barn.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:47.810 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't even allowed
to touch noses with her.

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And he told me that he had
gotten a parasite in Qatar.

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:56.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, this even took
me by surprise.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.110 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh boy.

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.790 align:middle line:84%
If I'm wrong, I'm going
to make a fool myself.

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:02.330 align:middle line:84%
I said Luciana, he
gives me the name Qatar.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:05.110 align:middle line:84%
he said he got a
parasite in Qatar.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:08.520 align:middle line:84%
She said she took the
three show horses to Qatar.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.480 align:middle line:90%
They all got incredibly sick.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.770 align:middle line:84%
They came back with
something mysterious.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:20.320 align:middle line:84%
It was the only one of
those games-- at that show,

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.700 align:middle line:84%
they were not allowed
to bring their own food.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:29.210 align:middle line:84%
So she introduced
a female to him.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:32.030 align:middle line:84%
She took his best friend to
the Olympics and let Lennox

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.800 align:middle line:90%
go in his place.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.790 align:middle line:90%
It was Lennox's turn to shine.

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:37.990 align:middle line:90%
He had something to prove.

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And now not only
has Winning Mood

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:43.400 align:middle line:84%
gone back to winning
everything, the girl

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.770 align:middle line:90%
is now winning everything.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love it.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, talking
about horses, we've

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:58.120 align:middle line:84%
got a surprise coming up in just
a moment on "Beyond Belief."

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, welcome back
to "Beyond Belief."

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:03.990 align:middle line:84%
We're with Amelia Kinkade, the
animal communicator with Annie.

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:05.670 align:middle line:90%
Annie's the mustang.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.950 align:middle line:90%
Tina is the owner of Annie.

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And we've got Bill,
the handler back here.

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:13.140 align:middle line:90%
Amelia, gorgeous mustang.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:17.329 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: She's an
amazing, amazing being.

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Tina, when I ask her,
who's your best friend,

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:24.430 align:middle line:90%
she shows me a female collie.

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:27.012 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: I have
a bearded collie

00:17:27.012 --> 00:17:31.530 align:middle line:84%
who looks like a
smaller shaggy dog.

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: And this
collie rolls on her back,

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.670 align:middle line:90%
and they have this game.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:38.870 align:middle line:84%
The collie will run out in
front of her, roll on her back

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:41.850 align:middle line:84%
and say, Annie
roll on your back.

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:46.710 align:middle line:84%
But there is absolutely no
competition for that dog.

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:48.460 align:middle line:90%
She loves that dog.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:53.380 align:middle line:84%
When I ask her her favorite
person, she says Danny.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>>TINA: That's my
husband's name.

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:00.010 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: She also gives
me the name Carolyn.

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And she said Carolyn
needs to come see me.

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:05.200 align:middle line:90%
The horses want to see Carolyn.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.675 align:middle line:84%
We're worried about her, because
Carolyn needs to de-stress.

00:18:08.675 --> 00:18:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Do you know somebody
named Carolyn

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.960 align:middle line:84%
that's having kind
of a hard time?

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>>TINA: My son's
mother-in-law is Carolyn.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And they are in a process of
finishing up building a house

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.430 align:middle line:90%
and getting ready to move.

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:26.930 align:middle line:90%
So that's stressful.

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:29.210 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Well, she
wants her to come.

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Amelia,
when you do this--

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:34.170 align:middle line:84%
like you came up with a name
that nobody knew you would come

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:38.650 align:middle line:84%
up with, my gosh-- how does
the horse know all these names?

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Animals
think in pictures.

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:41.940 align:middle line:90%
They feel emotion.

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:43.870 align:middle line:84%
They have sensation
in their body.

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:48.220 align:middle line:84%
They are so much more
aware of human beings

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:52.220 align:middle line:84%
than we are of them that they
know what medical conditions

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:52.780 align:middle line:90%
we have.

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:55.470 align:middle line:84%
They know what emotional
problems we have.

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:59.772 align:middle line:84%
They know the names of our
family members and friends.

00:18:59.772 --> 00:19:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They pick it
all up, don't they?

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:02.688 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Of course they do.

00:19:02.688 --> 00:19:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Is she, is
Annie, generally happy?

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:07.970 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell that?

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: She is really
joyful, really grateful.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:16.210 align:middle line:84%
When I run a body scan on
her-- and what that means

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:19.370 align:middle line:84%
is I'm going to put my attention
in every inch of her body

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:22.830 align:middle line:84%
and see what she's feeling
and if she's in pain

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.840 align:middle line:84%
and also to go back in time
so that she can tell me

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:29.350 align:middle line:84%
about her medical
history-- what she shows

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:34.200 align:middle line:84%
me is that her two
front hooves were hurt.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.840 align:middle line:84%
When I tuned into
her and I said,

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.840 align:middle line:84%
how did you come to
be in this family,

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:42.200 align:middle line:90%
she said she was really sick.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And she shows me holding
these feet up and having

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:50.230 align:middle line:84%
them be just red hot
fiery, that they hurt.

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And she says that you, Bill,
healed her and brought her back

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.460 align:middle line:90%
to life.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.040 align:middle line:90%
>>TINA: She has thin soles.

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.741 align:middle line:84%
So she was very
sore in her front.

00:19:59.741 --> 00:20:01.990 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: She really could
barely put her weight down

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:03.630 align:middle line:90%
on her two front hooves.

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:05.060 align:middle line:90%
>>TINA: That's true.

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: And it was a
painful healing process.

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:11.600 align:middle line:90%
And now she's great.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>>TINA: We've really
worked on her.

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:16.500 align:middle line:90%
Bill's helped me a lot with her.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.200 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with a
really good shoer

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.420 align:middle line:90%
who has kept her feet trimmed.

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:26.369 align:middle line:84%
And we've also done
sore ointments.

00:20:26.369 --> 00:20:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If she
listened to the song,

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:30.831 align:middle line:84%
"Happy," she'd probably be
one of those happy horses now,

00:20:30.831 --> 00:20:31.330 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:35.040 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: She is a
happy, happy horse.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.930 align:middle line:84%
When I ask her what makes her
happiest in the entire world,

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:44.510 align:middle line:84%
she shows me a toddler, a little
boy who's about two years old.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And she loves it when
you put him on her back.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:49.700 align:middle line:90%
>>TINA: He comes up.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:54.010 align:middle line:90%
He's my sister's grandson.

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And he's been crazy about horses
even though his mom was never

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.890 align:middle line:90%
crazy about horses.

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:05.590 align:middle line:84%
He comes up and he
shows Annie and a mini

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:08.840 align:middle line:84%
that I have at home
as part of his family.

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And so in all his preschool
drawings, he draws them.

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:16.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm amazed at how
relaxed she is, standing--

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:21.500 align:middle line:84%
no?-- standing in the studio
with all these lights and all

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:22.660 align:middle line:90%
these people out here.

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.110 align:middle line:90%
And she's just calm.

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:26.010 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: This is what I teach.

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:28.310 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
mirror your energy.

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we're
working with a dog,

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:33.435 align:middle line:84%
if we're working with a lion,
if we're working with a horse,

00:21:33.435 --> 00:21:35.170 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter.

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:39.260 align:middle line:84%
The whole goal is to be
the source of their calm.

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:42.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, alpha means calm,
confident, and in charge.

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:45.085 align:middle line:84%
If I say to her,
I'm calm, confident,

00:21:45.085 --> 00:21:49.070 align:middle line:84%
and in charge, and
therefore, you are now calm,

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:50.690 align:middle line:90%
confident, and in charge.

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:52.530 align:middle line:90%
You can relax completely.

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:54.640 align:middle line:90%
You're here to be a star.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:58.780 align:middle line:84%
We only give commands
in the affirmative.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:00.990 align:middle line:90%
I tell her what I do want.

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:03.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we walked in,
and if somebody said, oh,

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.260 align:middle line:84%
she's a little scared,
she's-- no, no, no, no.

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:09.630 align:middle line:90%
I say, relax your body.

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:12.620 align:middle line:84%
You're here to be a star,
to be worshipped and adored

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:16.700 align:middle line:84%
and to help educate his
viewers about mustangs,

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.740 align:middle line:90%
the plight of mustangs.

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Her goal in life is
to educate children.

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:25.580 align:middle line:90%
She loves children.

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:28.110 align:middle line:84%
She wants people to
understand something

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:33.940 align:middle line:84%
more about wildness and
playfulness and not just

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:37.560 align:middle line:84%
that horses have the right
to keep their wildness,

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:41.610 align:middle line:84%
but that humans need to have
a little bit more wildness.

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:44.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I assume she
was never bred, right?

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>>TINA: They bred-- the
rancher that I got her from

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:50.124 align:middle line:90%
had bred her twice.

00:22:50.124 --> 00:22:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And she
gave a few foals.

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:52.748 align:middle line:90%
>>TINA: So she had two foals.

00:22:52.748 --> 00:22:53.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She did.

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.820 align:middle line:90%
Can you ask her if she misses?

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: There's a
lot of pain around it.

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:01.840 align:middle line:90%
Her daughter was taken from her.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.010 align:middle line:90%
And it was very traumatic.

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:04.051 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is traumatic.

00:23:04.051 --> 00:23:06.970 align:middle line:84%
So when she goes back to her
ranch and talks to her friends,

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:10.680 align:middle line:84%
she's going to tell them, I just
had this wonderful experience

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.480 align:middle line:84%
with this animal
communicator lady.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Well,
and this amazing man

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:18.750 align:middle line:90%
who has a wonderful show.

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And yes, she will go back
and brag to her friends.

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And they may be jealous that
they didn't get to come.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.890 align:middle line:10%
And what she really wants and
what she wants me to tell you,

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:33.420 align:middle line:10%
Tina, is that she wants
a book written about her.

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:38.320 align:middle line:10%
She wants a book about her
lineage and her history

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.950 align:middle line:10%
and what's happening
with wild mustangs.

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:43.480 align:middle line:10%
She wants the book
to be for children.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.510 align:middle line:84%
She feels that she's an
ambassador for human children.

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:48.034 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Through
the voice of her.

00:23:48.034 --> 00:23:49.825 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: And I even
see this illustrated.

00:23:49.825 --> 00:23:51.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a great book.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:55.150 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: And I also see
a way to follow her online.

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Tina
and Bill, thanks

00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:57.900 align:middle line:90%
for bringing Annie out here.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.250 align:middle line:90%
This was indeed a pleasure.

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:00.990 align:middle line:90%
And Amelia, you are precious.

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:01.865 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Thank you.

00:24:01.865 --> 00:24:04.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And maybe one day,
you can get into my mind.

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:05.267 align:middle line:90%
I'm an animal.

00:24:05.267 --> 00:24:05.850 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Oh.

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:06.475 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right?

00:24:06.475 --> 00:24:07.300 align:middle line:90%
You never know.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.038 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
