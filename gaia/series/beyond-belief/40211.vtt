a little bit

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:07.734 align:middle line:84%

>> Noory: Where does
it get the nutrients

00:01:10.704 --> 00:01:14.574 align:middle line:84%
and how many nutrients
does it need?

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:16.042 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Well, all
vertebrates, George,

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:18.712 align:middle line:84%
whether you're a humming bird,
a human being, or an elephant,

00:01:18.712 --> 00:01:21.714 align:middle line:84%
or a whale, we all need
90 essential nutrients,

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:22.916 align:middle line:90%
60 minerals, two-thirds

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:24.818 align:middle line:84%
of the 90 essential
nutrients are minerals.

00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:25.519 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Everyday?

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:26.253 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Everyday.

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:27.654 align:middle line:90%
Every meal.

00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:31.458 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you're not getting
the benefit of the food you eat.

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:33.927 align:middle line:84%
That old adage, you are
what you eat is absolutely,

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:35.629 align:middle line:90%
positively not true.

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:36.196 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Not true?

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:36.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: No.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.898 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Really?

00:01:37.898 --> 00:01:39.032 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: No, you
are what you absorb.

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: OK.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.536 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: OK, and you have
to have every piece in place.

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:46.506 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like driving a
car without two sparkplugs

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:48.808 align:middle line:84%
or driving a car without
your right front wheel.

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:50.777 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to work very
well even though they are

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:52.012 align:middle line:90%
simple things.

00:01:52.012 --> 00:01:53.780 align:middle line:84%
Same thing is true with
the 90 essential nutrients.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.248 align:middle line:90%
You must have them all.

00:01:55.248 --> 00:01:57.417 align:middle line:90%
Historically, you have

00:01:57.417 --> 00:02:01.054 align:middle line:84%
to appreciate the
nutritional minerals which make

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:03.857 align:middle line:84%
up two-thirds of the 90
essential nutrients do not occur

00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:05.992 align:middle line:84%
in a uniform blanket around
the crust of the earth.

00:02:05.992 --> 00:02:07.527 align:middle line:84%
They occur in veins,
like chocolate

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:09.029 align:middle line:90%
in chocolate ripple ice cream.

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:11.131 align:middle line:84%
And so there's some people,
by dumb luck, live in a place

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:13.333 align:middle line:84%
that might have 40 minerals,
60 minerals, 70 minerals.

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:14.434 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I see.

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:15.268 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: And some
people, by dumb luck,

00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:16.636 align:middle line:90%
live in place who have three.

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:18.038 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:02:18.038 --> 00:02:19.339 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Because plants only
need three to make good seeds

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.973 align:middle line:90%
for the next generation.

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.508 align:middle line:90%
We need 60.

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:23.643 align:middle line:84%
So if you're eating a pretty
good slice of organically grown,

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:25.078 align:middle line:84%
multigrain bread,
baked with love

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:27.914 align:middle line:90%
in the church, you're 57 short.

00:02:27.914 --> 00:02:30.183 align:middle line:84%
OK. And historically,
this was the way it was.

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:32.452 align:middle line:84%
There were people, there
were long-lived peoples here

00:02:32.452 --> 00:02:36.323 align:middle line:84%
and there, but it was
just by dumb luck.

00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:41.127 align:middle line:84%
And people who would put their
plant minerals, AKA wood ashes

00:02:41.127 --> 00:02:45.732 align:middle line:84%
into the gardens where they got
their minerals and then by trial

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:47.500 align:middle line:84%
and error people who eat
certain fruits and berries,

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.236 align:middle line:84%
they'd live longer because
they had antioxidants

00:02:49.236 --> 00:02:50.470 align:middle line:90%
to fend off free radicals.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.605 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Now, they
didn't know that.

00:02:51.605 --> 00:02:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: They didn't
know why, but they knew

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.543 align:middle line:84%
that there was-- and there were
the shamans and the wise women

00:02:56.543 --> 00:02:59.312 align:middle line:84%
and they would say well-- and
they would actually have wars

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:00.747 align:middle line:84%
over clay beds and
things like that

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:02.649 align:middle line:84%
because women would eat
this certain clay during

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:03.216 align:middle line:90%
their pregnancy--

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:04.317 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:03:04.317 --> 00:03:05.418 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: -- their
babies were born normal.

00:03:05.418 --> 00:03:07.020 align:middle line:84%
If they didn't have
access to their clay,

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.322 align:middle line:84%
the babies would either
die during pregnancy

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:11.925 align:middle line:84%
and have a miscarriage or
they would have a baby born

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:13.893 align:middle line:84%
with a cleft palate
or neural tube defect

00:03:13.893 --> 00:03:17.197 align:middle line:90%
or maybe born deaf, and so on.

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:21.601 align:middle line:84%
And so over time, people realize
these things and they began

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:23.336 align:middle line:90%
to put two and two together.

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:29.609 align:middle line:84%
And in the 1700s, it was kind
of a golden year for vitamins.

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.512 align:middle line:84%
I went back and I've read
so many of the papyruses,

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:36.349 align:middle line:84%
the translations, 4000
years ago, the Egyptians new

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.551 align:middle line:84%
that vitamin A would
control night blindness.

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:40.153 align:middle line:84%
Now they didn't know it
was called vitamin A,

00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:42.956 align:middle line:84%
but they would take liver
extracts, squeeze livers

00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:44.157 align:middle line:90%
and get the juice out of it

00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:46.526 align:middle line:84%
and make people drink
the liver juice

00:03:46.526 --> 00:03:48.427 align:middle line:84%
and they would put liver
juice in your eyes,

00:03:48.427 --> 00:03:49.929 align:middle line:84%
and night blindness
would go away and that's

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:51.064 align:middle line:90%
where we store vitamin A.

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:51.831 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Now, how do
they know this though?

00:03:51.831 --> 00:03:53.300 align:middle line:90%
Do they stumble across it?

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.701 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: They
stumble across it.

00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:57.871 align:middle line:84%
It's just some grandmother
did it and she's trying

00:03:57.871 --> 00:04:01.107 align:middle line:84%
to fix her husband's or her
daughter's night blindness

00:04:01.107 --> 00:04:03.643 align:middle line:84%
and she tried this
tea, it didn't work,

00:04:03.643 --> 00:04:04.844 align:middle line:90%
tried this, didn't work.

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:07.213 align:middle line:84%
And she has some liver
left over and put a chunk

00:04:07.213 --> 00:04:08.381 align:middle line:90%
of liver on the kid's eyes--

00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:09.082 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And it worked.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:10.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: It worked.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.918 align:middle line:84%
And they wrote it up
and then more did it

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:15.588 align:middle line:90%
and it became sort of routine.

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:19.192 align:middle line:84%
And so there's really very
few things that are new.

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:22.662 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that fascinate
me about that very question is

00:04:22.662 --> 00:04:29.436 align:middle line:84%
about 4000 years ago people
began to bury people, OK,

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:31.972 align:middle line:84%
and as opposed to just, well,
he died, just leave him there

00:04:31.972 --> 00:04:33.006 align:middle line:90%
for the coyotes to eat.

00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:34.374 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:04:34.374 --> 00:04:36.443 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: And the first thing
that the average peasant put

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:38.812 align:middle line:84%
in the grave for the
person who is going to go

00:04:38.812 --> 00:04:43.683 align:middle line:84%
to the afterlife was a clay
pot full of wood ashes.

00:04:43.683 --> 00:04:46.052 align:middle line:84%
Now people who were
pharaohs of course

00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:47.987 align:middle line:90%
and royalty got gold things.

00:04:47.987 --> 00:04:49.122 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: They got
the good stuff.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: They got the
good and food for a year

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.726 align:middle line:90%
in the afterlife and so on,

00:04:52.726 --> 00:04:55.795 align:middle line:84%
but the peasants--
this is very uniform.

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:58.164 align:middle line:84%
That they would put a clay
pot full of wood ashes

00:04:58.164 --> 00:04:59.466 align:middle line:84%
and they recognize
the importance

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:02.369 align:middle line:90%
of wood ashes as a condiment.

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:03.470 align:middle line:90%
Even before they had gardens,

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.738 align:middle line:84%
even before they
were doing official,

00:05:04.738 --> 00:05:08.174 align:middle line:84%
what we would call agriculture,
people who were inland

00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:10.343 align:middle line:84%
from the sea and didn't
have easy access to salt,

00:05:10.343 --> 00:05:13.880 align:middle line:84%
they would put wood ashes
on their meat as a condiment

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.784 align:middle line:84%
because they had cravings and
maybe the chunk of meat fell

00:05:17.784 --> 00:05:19.352 align:middle line:84%
in the fire and they'd brush
it off, 'cause they couldn't,

00:05:19.352 --> 00:05:21.788 align:middle line:84%
they'd eat it and they realize,
oh, this taste pretty good.

00:05:21.788 --> 00:05:23.156 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:24.491 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: And so then they
consciously started putting wood

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:28.328 align:middle line:84%
ashes on their meat and this
is how people learn by trial

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:31.231 align:middle line:84%
and error that people who
didn't do it right went away.

00:05:31.231 --> 00:05:34.200 align:middle line:90%
Their gene pool didn't live on.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.504 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: How long is
our expectancy today

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:39.906 align:middle line:90%
and what should it be?

00:05:39.906 --> 00:05:43.009 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Well, expectancy
today in America is somewhere

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.479 align:middle line:84%
around 75, 72 for
men, 78 for women.

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.815 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
black men, it's 62.

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:52.318 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the
longest-lived people in America,

00:05:52.318 --> 00:05:55.288 align:middle line:84%
the Seventh Day Adventist
in Loma Linda,

00:05:55.288 --> 00:05:57.557 align:middle line:84%
California lived to
85 on the average.

00:05:57.557 --> 00:05:59.092 align:middle line:90%
And the Mormons who live

00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:02.729 align:middle line:84%
in Cache Valley,
Utah live to be 87.

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:04.697 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Why the difference?

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:08.334 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: OK, well these
peoples avoid bad things very

00:06:08.334 --> 00:06:12.572 align:middle line:84%
carefully, very-- and
it's part of their holy--

00:06:12.572 --> 00:06:13.606 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Regimen.

00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:14.741 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Regimen.

00:06:14.741 --> 00:06:16.009 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, that's the word.

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:18.311 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like the
Orthodox Jewish people

00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:19.612 align:middle line:90%
who have their Kosher diets.

00:06:19.612 --> 00:06:23.216 align:middle line:84%
These peoples have-- I think
the Mormons have the words

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:24.551 align:middle line:90%
of wisdom which they follow.

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:27.787 align:middle line:84%
Get rid of all the bad stuff
and they tend to be farmers

00:06:27.787 --> 00:06:30.457 align:middle line:90%
and they all eat what they grow.

00:06:30.457 --> 00:06:33.293 align:middle line:84%
And by dumb luck, if you live in
a place that has the 60 minerals

00:06:33.293 --> 00:06:36.696 align:middle line:84%
in the soil and there's not a
lot of pollution in the ground,

00:06:36.696 --> 00:06:38.431 align:middle line:84%
they can live long,
healthy lives.

00:06:38.431 --> 00:06:41.901 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at the
people who live the longest--

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:44.704 align:middle line:84%
and actually I have another
book out called "Immortality"

00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:47.173 align:middle line:84%
where you looked at the
top 20 longevity cultures

00:06:47.173 --> 00:06:50.176 align:middle line:84%
and there are 25 common threads
which we can all do at home.

00:06:50.176 --> 00:06:52.212 align:middle line:84%
These are things
we can do at home.

00:06:52.212 --> 00:06:54.447 align:middle line:84%
There's a CD and one of
the fun CDs that goes along

00:06:54.447 --> 00:06:57.350 align:middle line:84%
with that book "Immortality"
is "What Kills Billionaires".

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.586 align:middle line:84%
Because you would think if
money had anything to do

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:00.854 align:middle line:84%
with living a long and
healthy life 'cause--

00:07:00.854 --> 00:07:02.155 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: They'd live forever.

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:03.523 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Yeah, they could
afford the most expensive

00:07:03.523 --> 00:07:06.593 align:middle line:84%
doctors and the most expensive
health plan, the best food,

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:09.162 align:middle line:84%
the best personal trainer,
the best of everything,

00:07:09.162 --> 00:07:10.330 align:middle line:84%
but yet the average
billionaire--

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.164 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It's not the case.

00:07:11.164 --> 00:07:12.799 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: -- lives to be 66.

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:13.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Why?

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.034 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Well,
that's because--

00:07:15.034 --> 00:07:16.002 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: What's he doing wrong?

00:07:16.002 --> 00:07:17.303 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Well,

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:20.840 align:middle line:84%
the billionaires do exactly
what the best doctors say,

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.342 align:middle line:84%
then wind up getting
killed by the doctors.

00:07:22.342 --> 00:07:25.778 align:middle line:84%
Look at Steve Jobs, very bright
guy in marketing and science.

00:07:25.778 --> 00:07:26.913 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:07:26.913 --> 00:07:29.482 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: And he was
an unsupplemented vegan.

00:07:29.482 --> 00:07:32.085 align:middle line:84%
He was a vegan who did
not take any supplements.

00:07:32.085 --> 00:07:33.853 align:middle line:84%
He had a 5-star vegan
chef who cooked very--

00:07:33.853 --> 00:07:35.588 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: He thought he was
getting it from the food.

00:07:35.588 --> 00:07:36.456 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Exactly.

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:38.391 align:middle line:90%
Misinformation, right.

00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:40.693 align:middle line:84%
And he wound up with
pancreatic cancer

00:07:40.693 --> 00:07:42.095 align:middle line:90%
from the trans fatty acids

00:07:42.095 --> 00:07:45.331 align:middle line:84%
and all these stir fried organic
vegetables and no supplements,

00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:50.236 align:middle line:84%
no antioxidants protect him
from these trans fatty acids

00:07:50.236 --> 00:07:51.871 align:middle line:84%
and he made his second
worse mistake.

00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:53.740 align:middle line:84%
He went to an experimental
cancer doctor

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.608 align:middle line:84%
with a high reputation and
that doctor killed him as sure

00:07:56.608 --> 00:07:58.244 align:middle line:90%
as they shot him in the head.

00:07:58.244 --> 00:08:00.613 align:middle line:84%
He should have gone to
Costa Rica where some

00:08:00.613 --> 00:08:03.583 align:middle line:84%
of the oldest people in
the western hemisphere live

00:08:03.583 --> 00:08:05.818 align:middle line:84%
and said great, great grandma,
feed me what you're eating.

00:08:05.818 --> 00:08:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So he thought he
was doing the right thing,

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.187 align:middle line:90%
but he wasn't.

00:08:08.187 --> 00:08:09.255 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: No, that
didn't count.

00:08:09.255 --> 00:08:12.158 align:middle line:84%
The theory didn't work,
cost him his life.

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:15.261 align:middle line:84%
Exercise can be a very negative
thing if you don't do it right.

00:08:15.261 --> 00:08:18.998 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Jim Fixx, the guy who
in the '60s was a professor

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:22.669 align:middle line:84%
of economics in was one
of the Ivy leagues schools

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:26.839 align:middle line:84%
in New England, 6 foot 4
guy, weighed 165, you know,

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:28.641 align:middle line:90%
classic long distance runner.

00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:29.943 align:middle line:90%
He dies at 51

00:08:29.943 --> 00:08:31.344 align:middle line:84%
with cardiomyopathy heart
attack while he is running.

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:32.277 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:08:32.277 --> 00:08:33.212 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Theory
didn't work him.

00:08:33.212 --> 00:08:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: That happens
a lot too.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.647 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Yeah.

00:08:35.647 --> 00:08:38.184 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. And I've done 1700
autopsies on kids under the age

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:40.353 align:middle line:84%
of 10 that died of that disease,
cardiomyopathy heart disease.

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:42.387 align:middle line:84%
It's a deficiency
of a single mineral

00:08:42.387 --> 00:08:45.558 align:middle line:84%
which is sweat out
when exercising.

00:08:45.558 --> 00:08:48.461 align:middle line:84%
And unless you're supplementing
with that mineral, if you sweat

00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:52.065 align:middle line:84%
from your trade or your labor
like being a roofer in August--

00:08:52.065 --> 00:08:53.466 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:08:53.466 --> 00:08:54.467 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: -- where you sweat
a lot or throwing bails of hay,

00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:55.735 align:middle line:84%
or working in a factory
with machines.

00:08:55.735 --> 00:08:56.803 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You've
got to replace it.

00:08:56.803 --> 00:08:57.704 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: You got
to replace them.

00:08:57.704 --> 00:08:58.838 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: What is that one?

00:08:58.838 --> 00:09:00.506 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Well, that
one is called selenium.

00:09:00.506 --> 00:09:01.741 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: OK.

00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:03.042 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Selenium
deficiency will cause you to die

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:04.978 align:middle line:84%
from a cardiomyopathy heart
attack, increase your risk

00:09:04.978 --> 00:09:08.681 align:middle line:84%
of cancer, cause you to have
cataracts, increase your risk

00:09:08.681 --> 00:09:11.651 align:middle line:84%
of things like MS,
multiple sclerosis,

00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:15.788 align:middle line:84%
Alzheimer's disease,
liver cirrhosis.

00:09:15.788 --> 00:09:18.491 align:middle line:84%
Many diseases are caused
by selenium deficiency.

00:09:18.491 --> 00:09:22.295 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Is a multiple
vitamin important?

00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:23.763 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Well, multiple
vitamins that you get

00:09:23.763 --> 00:09:27.066 align:middle line:84%
over the counter contain
32 to 35 nutrients,

00:09:27.066 --> 00:09:28.334 align:middle line:90%
about one-third of what we need.

00:09:28.334 --> 00:09:29.736 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: One-third,
better than nothing.

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:30.503 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Better than nothing.

00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:31.804 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:09:31.804 --> 00:09:33.239 align:middle line:84%
People who do take vitamins
and minerals live longer.

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:34.741 align:middle line:90%
You look at Art Linkletter.

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:36.242 align:middle line:84%
Art Linkletter took
vitamins and minerals

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:39.145 align:middle line:90%
since 1933 and he died at 97.

00:09:39.145 --> 00:09:40.013 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Bob Hope.

00:09:40.013 --> 00:09:40.713 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Bob Hope.

00:09:40.713 --> 00:09:41.848 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: George Burns.

00:09:41.848 --> 00:09:43.883 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: They both
lived to be 100 and 101.

00:09:43.883 --> 00:09:45.084 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:09:45.084 --> 00:09:46.419 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: And they took
vitamins and minerals.

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:47.654 align:middle line:84%
Medical doctors don't and their
average lifespan according

00:09:47.654 --> 00:09:48.588 align:middle line:90%
to their own survey that came

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:52.759 align:middle line:84%
out in 1999, George,
is well, 56.

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:54.661 align:middle line:84%
Average lifespan of a
medical doctor is 56.

00:09:54.661 --> 00:09:56.596 align:middle line:84%
Why would anybody believe
anything they had to say

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:57.930 align:middle line:84%
when it came to health
and longevity?

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.932 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I've been out to
dinner with you, Dr. Wallach,

00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:02.101 align:middle line:84%
and while we were
having our dinner,

00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:05.738 align:middle line:84%
you were eating a plateful
of pills and supplements.

00:10:05.738 --> 00:10:07.373 align:middle line:90%
How many do you take a day?

00:10:07.373 --> 00:10:10.143 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: I take about 75
twice a day plus all the liquids

00:10:10.143 --> 00:10:11.477 align:middle line:90%
that has 77 minerals

00:10:11.477 --> 00:10:13.312 align:middle line:84%
and including all 60
essential minerals.

00:10:13.312 --> 00:10:16.549 align:middle line:84%
And that's because you
cannot get it from your food.

00:10:16.549 --> 00:10:19.552 align:middle line:84%
And I have to do
extraordinary things.

00:10:19.552 --> 00:10:21.754 align:middle line:84%
I don't expect everybody
to do that.

00:10:21.754 --> 00:10:24.090 align:middle line:84%
But if I ever got diabetes,
I know I could reverse it

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.858 align:middle line:84%
but it's better that
I don't get diabetes.

00:10:25.858 --> 00:10:26.559 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:27.627 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: -- I'm 74.

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:28.428 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And maybe
you've prevented it

00:10:28.428 --> 00:10:29.696 align:middle line:90%
by doing what you're doing.

00:10:29.696 --> 00:10:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Oh, I know I
prevented it, George, I'm 74.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.864 align:middle line:90%
I have not been sick one day

00:10:32.864 --> 00:10:36.669 align:middle line:84%
since I was nine years
old, 66 years ago.

00:10:36.669 --> 00:10:39.772 align:middle line:84%
I've never been to a
doctor in that 66 years.

00:10:39.772 --> 00:10:42.709 align:middle line:84%
I've never been on
a prescription drug.

00:10:42.709 --> 00:10:46.145 align:middle line:84%
I do my own self testing
which you can do for three--

00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:48.114 align:middle line:84%
yes, three bucks
out of a pharmacy.

00:10:48.114 --> 00:10:50.216 align:middle line:84%
Just read the book "Let's
Play Doctor" to teach you how

00:10:50.216 --> 00:10:53.886 align:middle line:84%
to interpret everything
from glucose tolerance test,

00:10:53.886 --> 00:10:56.489 align:middle line:84%
blood test, urine test
for all of these diseases.

00:10:56.489 --> 00:11:00.093 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a manual from
the alternative standpoint.

00:11:00.093 --> 00:11:02.428 align:middle line:84%
And I urge everybody to do
these things themselves.

00:11:02.428 --> 00:11:07.934 align:middle line:84%
Do not go to a doctor for an
annual physical, do it yourself.

00:11:07.934 --> 00:11:11.337 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: But most insurance
policies require it now these

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:12.705 align:middle line:90%
days, right?

00:11:12.705 --> 00:11:15.074 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Well, an insurance
policy is a two-edged sword.

00:11:15.074 --> 00:11:17.944 align:middle line:84%
What I recommend is people
get a 10,000 dollar deductible

00:11:17.944 --> 00:11:19.712 align:middle line:90%
catastrophic insurance policy.

00:11:19.712 --> 00:11:22.982 align:middle line:84%
It'll cost him 100 bucks a
month for a family of five

00:11:22.982 --> 00:11:25.017 align:middle line:84%
and you're just worried
about cancer and--

00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:26.385 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:11:26.385 --> 00:11:27.086 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: -- terrible car
wrecks and fourth degree burn--

00:11:27.086 --> 00:11:27.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: The big stuff.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.222 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: -- the big stuff.

00:11:29.222 --> 00:11:31.557 align:middle line:84%
Everything else, if you take
the 90 essential nutrients

00:11:31.557 --> 00:11:33.392 align:middle line:84%
and you do your own
self examination

00:11:33.392 --> 00:11:37.330 align:middle line:84%
and you're very proactive
about that, almost obsessive,

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.399 align:middle line:84%
you had to be almost
obsessive about it,

00:11:39.399 --> 00:11:40.733 align:middle line:90%
you'll live well beyond 100.

00:11:40.733 --> 00:11:43.436 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not obsessive
about it, and you just sort

00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:48.174 align:middle line:84%
of treat it dismissively,
you won't live to be 100.

00:11:48.174 --> 00:11:50.143 align:middle line:84%
The odds are you're going to
die in your 40s, 50s, 60s.

00:11:50.143 --> 00:11:51.444 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, and
if you live to 100,

00:11:51.444 --> 00:11:53.679 align:middle line:84%
you want that to be a
pretty darn good life.

00:11:53.679 --> 00:11:56.415 align:middle line:84%
You want to have a
quality life there.

00:11:56.415 --> 00:11:59.852 align:middle line:84%
I mean who wants to be 100
years old, Dr. Wallach,

00:11:59.852 --> 00:12:01.420 align:middle line:90%
and hobble along and stuff?

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.588 align:middle line:84%
That's not what you're
talking about.

00:12:02.588 --> 00:12:03.956 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: No.

00:12:03.956 --> 00:12:05.725 align:middle line:84%
No, sir. Right now, the oldest
documented living person is

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:09.362 align:middle line:84%
Aymara Indian, a fellow of
the name of Carmelo Laura,

00:12:09.362 --> 00:12:14.567 align:middle line:84%
and from Bolivia, Lake
Titicaca, 13,000 foot elevation.

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.369 align:middle line:84%
He goes out every morning
and tends his sheep,

00:12:16.369 --> 00:12:20.273 align:middle line:84%
he's 123 years old, documented
by Guinness book of records.

00:12:20.273 --> 00:12:21.674 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And going strong.

00:12:21.674 --> 00:12:23.776 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: He tends
his sheep every morning

00:12:23.776 --> 00:12:25.111 align:middle line:90%
at 13,000 foot elevation.

00:12:25.111 --> 00:12:28.481 align:middle line:84%
No cane, no walker, no
wheelchair, no medications,

00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:29.749 align:middle line:90%
no doctors in his village,

00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:34.887 align:middle line:84%
he lives in a thatch roof
dirt floor, no utilities.

00:12:34.887 --> 00:12:37.957 align:middle line:84%
His fuel for heating
and cooking is wood.

00:12:37.957 --> 00:12:39.125 align:middle line:90%
So he's getting his minerals

00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:42.595 align:middle line:84%
through the wood ashes
being put in his garden.

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: In biblical days,

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:47.400 align:middle line:84%
they talked about Methuselah
living all those hundreds

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.201 align:middle line:90%
of years--

00:12:48.201 --> 00:12:49.168 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: 969...

00:12:49.168 --> 00:12:50.837 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Were those
really years?

00:12:50.837 --> 00:12:54.841 align:middle line:84%
They talked about it being solar
years but they were still years.

00:12:54.841 --> 00:12:57.443 align:middle line:84%
How could somebody
live that long?

00:12:57.443 --> 00:12:59.245 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Well in a
perfect diet, you can.

00:12:59.245 --> 00:13:02.682 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at the Garden
of Eden, we're just speaking

00:13:02.682 --> 00:13:06.385 align:middle line:84%
in biblical terms here now, when
you look at the Garden of Eden,

00:13:06.385 --> 00:13:08.521 align:middle line:84%
I mean if you're
biblically orientated,

00:13:08.521 --> 00:13:10.790 align:middle line:84%
the good Lord could have
chose to put Adam any place.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.759 align:middle line:84%
But why did he put Adam
in the Garden of Eden?

00:13:13.759 --> 00:13:15.428 align:middle line:84%
That's because four
rivers drained

00:13:15.428 --> 00:13:17.363 align:middle line:90%
into it from the mountains.

00:13:17.363 --> 00:13:18.798 align:middle line:90%
These rivers brought silt.

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:21.367 align:middle line:84%
The Tigris River, the
Euphrates River, the Pishon

00:13:21.367 --> 00:13:23.236 align:middle line:90%
and Dishon [phonetic] rivers.

00:13:23.236 --> 00:13:25.004 align:middle line:84%
Those rivers are
still there today.

00:13:25.004 --> 00:13:27.006 align:middle line:84%
The Garden of Eden
is still there today

00:13:27.006 --> 00:13:30.142 align:middle line:84%
and we know the mineral
content of that soil

00:13:30.142 --> 00:13:31.544 align:middle line:90%
because it's bringing--

00:13:31.544 --> 00:13:34.113 align:middle line:84%
the rivers are bringing all of
these minerals with the silt--

00:13:34.113 --> 00:13:35.248 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Sure.

00:13:35.248 --> 00:13:38.718 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: -- down to
refurbish that valley.

00:13:38.718 --> 00:13:39.919 align:middle line:90%
Now, the interesting thing

00:13:39.919 --> 00:13:42.955 align:middle line:84%
about it is two things
have been done since then.

00:13:42.955 --> 00:13:45.791 align:middle line:84%
Number one, we've
dammed up every river.

00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:47.059 align:middle line:90%
We've done two things, right?

00:13:47.059 --> 00:13:48.327 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:13:48.327 --> 00:13:49.629 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Number one,
we've prevented this flooding

00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:51.364 align:middle line:84%
in the soil and prevented
renewing the mineral content

00:13:51.364 --> 00:13:52.498 align:middle line:90%
of the soil.

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:55.101 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So by doing
that, what have we done?

00:13:55.101 --> 00:13:56.102 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: We've
shortened our lives.

00:13:56.102 --> 00:13:57.270 align:middle line:90%
We've gotten our self diseases

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:58.838 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't have
in the biblical days.

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:02.441 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, we've killed the ocean
'cause they've also cut off the

00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:05.344 align:middle line:84%
food supply of the ocean because
the rivers were the food supply,

00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:07.813 align:middle line:84%
the arteries that brought the
minerals to feed the algae

00:14:07.813 --> 00:14:11.851 align:middle line:84%
which fed-- the minnows which
fed the medium-sized fish

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:13.219 align:middle line:90%
which fed the big fish.

00:14:13.219 --> 00:14:14.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're not overfishing
the ocean,

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.156 align:middle line:84%
we've cut off the food supply of
the ocean which is even worse.

00:14:17.156 --> 00:14:21.661 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So we can
overcome these deficiencies

00:14:21.661 --> 00:14:23.562 align:middle line:90%
and take care of ourselves--

00:14:23.562 --> 00:14:24.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Absolutely?

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: No doubt.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:25.431 align:middle line:90%
No doubt.

00:14:25.431 --> 00:14:26.799 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: No doubt.

00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:28.834 align:middle line:84%
Again, the book, "Let's Play
Doctor" covers over 400 diseases

00:14:28.834 --> 00:14:31.704 align:middle line:84%
as kind of a Betty Crocker
cookbook for these diseases,

00:14:31.704 --> 00:14:35.374 align:middle line:84%
tells you how to diagnose them,
tells you how to monitor them,

00:14:35.374 --> 00:14:38.110 align:middle line:84%
and we can do a much
better job than doctors.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:41.514 align:middle line:84%
It is a sad commentary
for a medical system.

00:14:41.514 --> 00:14:43.416 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there's
no consequences to this

00:14:43.416 --> 00:14:44.784 align:middle line:84%
and so it just goes
on and on and on.

00:14:44.784 --> 00:14:47.219 align:middle line:84%
There's a recent article
just about two weeks ago

00:14:47.219 --> 00:14:50.122 align:middle line:84%
in the USA Today of the
third page and front section.

00:14:50.122 --> 00:14:52.725 align:middle line:84%
It's a big article, it was
like a third of the page

00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:56.128 align:middle line:84%
that says the Chinese peasants
are killing doctors in hospitals

00:14:56.128 --> 00:14:57.496 align:middle line:90%
who kill their relatives.

00:14:57.496 --> 00:14:58.297 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: What?

00:14:58.297 --> 00:14:59.498 align:middle line:90%
They're just attacking them?

00:14:59.498 --> 00:15:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Yes.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.034 align:middle line:84%
They go to the hospital
with their hoes and rakes

00:15:02.034 --> 00:15:03.803 align:middle line:84%
and their shovels and they
beat the doctors to death.

00:15:03.803 --> 00:15:04.737 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:06.372 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: That's
a little extreme.

00:15:06.372 --> 00:15:08.407 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Well, you
know, doctors are resigning

00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:10.609 align:middle line:84%
from the western hospitals
there and going back to farming

00:15:10.609 --> 00:15:14.046 align:middle line:84%
because it's too dangerous to be
a doctor in a hospital in China.

00:15:14.046 --> 00:15:16.148 align:middle line:90%
Well, I like the Chinese method.

00:15:16.148 --> 00:15:17.550 align:middle line:90%
There's consequences.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:19.919 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't expect people to
go and take things in their hand

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:21.420 align:middle line:90%
to go beat a doctor to death.

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.122 align:middle line:84%
That's not exactly
what I'm saying.

00:15:23.122 --> 00:15:25.091 align:middle line:84%
But the best way for us
to do that is to learn how

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:27.326 align:middle line:84%
to take care of ourselves so
we don't need their services.

00:15:27.326 --> 00:15:28.427 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:29.295 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: It's kind
of like you have all

00:15:29.295 --> 00:15:31.063 align:middle line:84%
of these various
car parts places

00:15:31.063 --> 00:15:33.299 align:middle line:84%
and you can do your
own car test, you know,

00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:35.134 align:middle line:84%
you look at the red warning
light in the dash or you look

00:15:35.134 --> 00:15:36.836 align:middle line:90%
at the dipstick for your oil,

00:15:36.836 --> 00:15:39.271 align:middle line:84%
you test the air
pressure of your tires.

00:15:39.271 --> 00:15:43.776 align:middle line:84%
And if a mechanic does
something bad to your car,

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:44.977 align:middle line:84%
you don't go back,
you tell everybody

00:15:44.977 --> 00:15:46.379 align:middle line:90%
about how bad that mechanic was.

00:15:46.379 --> 00:15:47.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Sure.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.781 align:middle line:84%
Well, then I've always
looked at a car,

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:51.283 align:middle line:84%
and it's funny you're
bringing up that analogy

00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:55.221 align:middle line:84%
that you don't want to bring
the car in when it's broken.

00:15:55.221 --> 00:15:59.091 align:middle line:84%
You want to do preventative
maintenance so it doesn't break.

00:15:59.091 --> 00:16:02.161 align:middle line:84%
And isn't the human
body the same way?

00:16:02.161 --> 00:16:03.262 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Exactly.

00:16:03.262 --> 00:16:04.497 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it takes
so many supplements

00:16:04.497 --> 00:16:07.867 align:middle line:84%
because when you look at
people like this Laura--

00:16:07.867 --> 00:16:13.039 align:middle line:84%
Carmelo Laura from Bolivia
who's 123 years old,

00:16:13.039 --> 00:16:15.307 align:middle line:84%
he's herding a sheep
flock every morning

00:16:15.307 --> 00:16:16.776 align:middle line:90%
in a 13,000 foot elevation--

00:16:16.776 --> 00:16:17.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Surely remarkable.

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:18.544 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Yeah,
very remarkable.

00:16:18.544 --> 00:16:20.346 align:middle line:90%
The whole village is like that.

00:16:20.346 --> 00:16:24.016 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at that you
say, "We can do the same thing."

00:16:24.016 --> 00:16:28.287 align:middle line:84%
However, he's not
getting the bad stuff.

00:16:28.287 --> 00:16:31.057 align:middle line:90%
His diet only has 900 calories.

00:16:31.057 --> 00:16:33.325 align:middle line:84%
And not because he knows the
art of calorie restriction

00:16:33.325 --> 00:16:36.162 align:middle line:84%
and longevity but
because by dumb luck--

00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:37.063 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: He's just--

00:16:37.063 --> 00:16:37.696 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: He's poor.

00:16:37.696 --> 00:16:38.197 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:16:38.197 --> 00:16:39.265 align:middle line:90%
He's poor.

00:16:39.265 --> 00:16:39.832 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: And he
can't afford to eat--

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:40.933 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:16:40.933 --> 00:16:41.934 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: -- more
than 900 calories a day.

00:16:41.934 --> 00:16:43.335 align:middle line:84%
And so when you look
at this, again,

00:16:43.335 --> 00:16:47.406 align:middle line:84%
the book "Immortality" covers
the top 25 things we need to do

00:16:47.406 --> 00:16:50.109 align:middle line:84%
to live the beyond 100 health
away and be very vigorous.

00:16:50.109 --> 00:16:52.812 align:middle line:84%
And most people think
I'm in my 50s.

00:16:52.812 --> 00:16:54.280 align:middle line:84%
They think I'm 20 years
younger than I am.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.214 align:middle line:84%
They say, "Well, how
did you do all that--

00:16:55.214 --> 00:16:56.048 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:16:56.048 --> 00:16:57.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: -- you're only 50."

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:00.453 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've been taking the 90
essential nutrients twice a day

00:17:00.453 --> 00:17:01.520 align:middle line:90%
since I was nine years old.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.656 align:middle line:90%
And I figured it out because--

00:17:03.656 --> 00:17:05.591 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Did you figured
it out at nine years old?

00:17:05.591 --> 00:17:06.558 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Yes, sir.

00:17:06.558 --> 00:17:09.728 align:middle line:84%
And when I was four,
I was diagnosed

00:17:09.728 --> 00:17:11.529 align:middle line:84%
with what would be called
today Tourette syndrome,

00:17:11.529 --> 00:17:12.163 align:middle line:90%
you know, I had the--

00:17:12.163 --> 00:17:12.832 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:17:12.832 --> 00:17:14.066 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:14.066 --> 00:17:15.167 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: The facial ticks
kind of thing and I'd--

00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:16.469 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Or you'd spout
off some profanity?

00:17:16.469 --> 00:17:17.236 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Exactly.

00:17:17.236 --> 00:17:18.003 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Did you do that?

00:17:18.003 --> 00:17:18.704 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: I don't know.

00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:19.971 align:middle line:90%
My mom didn't tell me.

00:17:19.971 --> 00:17:23.008 align:middle line:84%
But it got progressively
worse by the time I was nine.

00:17:23.008 --> 00:17:24.844 align:middle line:84%
All my friends knew I was
possessed because they get--

00:17:24.844 --> 00:17:26.211 align:middle line:84%
kind of pushed me around
a little bit and said--

00:17:26.211 --> 00:17:27.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right off.

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:29.548 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: And they said-- I'm
on the floor kicking around,

00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:31.350 align:middle line:90%
grimacing and they say, "See?

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:32.718 align:middle line:90%
We told you he's possessed."

00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:37.156 align:middle line:84%
My mom took-- takes me into
an eye doctor and she said

00:17:37.156 --> 00:17:40.359 align:middle line:84%
that my eyelashes were too long,
they're hitting my glasses,

00:17:40.359 --> 00:17:42.495 align:middle line:84%
curling back and
tickling my eyeballs.

00:17:42.495 --> 00:17:44.897 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a nine year old
kid and I'm not that dumb.

00:17:44.897 --> 00:17:46.732 align:middle line:84%
So I go to the library of
the school the next day

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:48.834 align:middle line:84%
and I find a nurse's
health book and I look

00:17:48.834 --> 00:17:50.202 align:middle line:90%
up eyelashes and eyelashes--

00:17:50.202 --> 00:17:51.337 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:17:51.337 --> 00:17:52.471 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: -- twitches,
couldn't find anything.

00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:53.773 align:middle line:84%
So I just start going
down through the index

00:17:53.773 --> 00:17:55.608 align:middle line:84%
and I hit cramps because I
was starting to play sports.

00:17:55.608 --> 00:17:56.776 align:middle line:90%
I know cramps.

00:17:56.776 --> 00:17:58.410 align:middle line:90%
They said calcium deficiency.

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:01.447 align:middle line:84%
So before the bus would pick
me up in the morning to go

00:18:01.447 --> 00:18:03.716 align:middle line:84%
to school, one of my chores
was to feed the bull calves

00:18:03.716 --> 00:18:05.718 align:middle line:84%
that we were going
to sell at auction.

00:18:05.718 --> 00:18:09.221 align:middle line:84%
And I would always read
the analysis labels,

00:18:09.221 --> 00:18:10.923 align:middle line:84%
it was said protein
and carbohydrates--

00:18:10.923 --> 00:18:11.991 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:18:11.991 --> 00:18:12.958 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: -- and
fats and so much fiber.

00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:15.294 align:middle line:84%
It also said by the
name calcium.

00:18:15.294 --> 00:18:16.562 align:middle line:84%
So I went home right
after school

00:18:16.562 --> 00:18:18.297 align:middle line:84%
and started eating
those pellets.

00:18:18.297 --> 00:18:19.632 align:middle line:90%
The next morning--

00:18:19.632 --> 00:18:20.933 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You ate the pellets
that went to the animals?

00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:23.235 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: They're
little alfalfa pellets.

00:18:23.235 --> 00:18:25.938 align:middle line:84%
The next morning, I threw the
cereal out to the chickens

00:18:25.938 --> 00:18:28.340 align:middle line:84%
and I put the pellets
in the cereal bowl--

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:29.341 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:18:29.341 --> 00:18:30.609 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: -- and
put milk with it.

00:18:30.609 --> 00:18:31.143 align:middle line:84%
My mom sort of said something
and my dad says, "No.

00:18:31.143 --> 00:18:32.011 align:middle line:90%
Let him go.

00:18:32.011 --> 00:18:32.845 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he's doing
something here."

00:18:32.845 --> 00:18:33.779 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:34.613 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: And in
three days time,

00:18:34.613 --> 00:18:35.381 align:middle line:90%
my Tourette syndrome went away.

00:18:35.381 --> 00:18:36.348 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Just like that?

00:18:36.348 --> 00:18:37.149 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Just like that.

00:18:37.149 --> 00:18:37.850 align:middle line:90%
In three days it went away.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:38.617 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Three days?

00:18:38.617 --> 00:18:39.718 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: In three days

00:18:39.718 --> 00:18:40.886 align:middle line:84%
from a progressively
catastrophic disease,

00:18:40.886 --> 00:18:43.923 align:middle line:84%
it was really debilitating
to perfectly normal

00:18:43.923 --> 00:18:47.092 align:middle line:84%
in three days just by taking
the 90 essential nutrients.

00:18:47.092 --> 00:18:48.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And you're a
little kid at the time.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:49.562 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: I was
nine years old.

00:18:49.562 --> 00:18:51.263 align:middle line:84%
Yes, sir. And by the
time I went to college,

00:18:51.263 --> 00:18:54.767 align:middle line:84%
I already been making my
own more complete feed.

00:18:54.767 --> 00:18:55.935 align:middle line:90%
I was mixing dog food and--

00:18:55.935 --> 00:18:57.236 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: So you enjoyed that?

00:18:57.236 --> 00:18:58.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Yes.

00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:59.772 align:middle line:84%
You know, as a kid when
you discover something--

00:18:59.772 --> 00:19:01.173 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:19:01.173 --> 00:19:02.374 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: -- like that, you're
just very proud and so forth.

00:19:02.374 --> 00:19:04.443 align:middle line:84%
And that's what got me
started with nutrition

00:19:04.443 --> 00:19:06.512 align:middle line:84%
and diseases was
when I was nine.

00:19:06.512 --> 00:19:09.348 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What about,
Joel, the water we drink?

00:19:09.348 --> 00:19:11.750 align:middle line:90%
Is it safe?

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:12.885 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: That
varies from location

00:19:12.885 --> 00:19:13.819 align:middle line:90%
to location, doesn't it?

00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:15.087 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That sure does.

00:19:15.087 --> 00:19:16.855 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Because a
pollution can last 100 years,

00:19:16.855 --> 00:19:18.924 align:middle line:84%
some pollutants last
a thousand years.

00:19:18.924 --> 00:19:21.193 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're doing
things organically,

00:19:21.193 --> 00:19:23.429 align:middle line:84%
you might not have pollution
for the last three years

00:19:23.429 --> 00:19:24.597 align:middle line:84%
but you still have
that stuff that's been

00:19:24.597 --> 00:19:25.731 align:middle line:84%
in there a thousand
years, right?

00:19:25.731 --> 00:19:28.534 align:middle line:84%
So-- and in fact that
first paper I wrote

00:19:28.534 --> 00:19:32.104 align:middle line:84%
for a scientific paper, I was
22 years old, I wrote a paper

00:19:32.104 --> 00:19:35.941 align:middle line:84%
on the mass die-off
from pollution.

00:19:35.941 --> 00:19:37.876 align:middle line:84%
And it was the first mass
die-off from pollution

00:19:37.876 --> 00:19:39.245 align:middle line:84%
that got written up
by the United States.

00:19:39.245 --> 00:19:40.579 align:middle line:84%
I was only 22 years
old when I wrote it.

00:19:40.579 --> 00:19:41.547 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:19:41.547 --> 00:19:43.048 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: It came
from fertilizer

00:19:43.048 --> 00:19:47.786 align:middle line:84%
around this farmer's farm and
he lost 500 sheep in one night.

00:19:47.786 --> 00:19:48.687 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Jeez.

00:19:48.687 --> 00:19:49.521 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: And--

00:19:49.521 --> 00:19:50.489 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And he didn't know it?

00:19:50.489 --> 00:19:51.624 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know what
was going on?

00:19:51.624 --> 00:19:52.725 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: No.

00:19:52.725 --> 00:19:53.659 align:middle line:84%
It had sort of been
going on for six months.

00:19:53.659 --> 00:19:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:55.561 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: 'Cause these
sheep were six months old,

00:19:55.561 --> 00:19:57.129 align:middle line:90%
ready to go to market.

00:19:57.129 --> 00:20:01.233 align:middle line:84%
And when I did the autopsy
on them, he brought in 50,

00:20:01.233 --> 00:20:03.302 align:middle line:84%
and I was a graduate
student in pathology

00:20:03.302 --> 00:20:05.571 align:middle line:84%
and a veterinary
student at the same time.

00:20:05.571 --> 00:20:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And all of the professors
were gone for the holidays.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.675 align:middle line:90%
They left the students in charge

00:20:09.675 --> 00:20:12.845 align:middle line:84%
of the services, so
I got the project.

00:20:12.845 --> 00:20:15.247 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I started
on the first autopsy,

00:20:15.247 --> 00:20:16.882 align:middle line:90%
I recognized the problem.

00:20:16.882 --> 00:20:19.018 align:middle line:84%
The blood that came out
of the first sheet looked

00:20:19.018 --> 00:20:21.754 align:middle line:84%
like chocolate milk instead
of blood, that's hemoglobin.

00:20:21.754 --> 00:20:24.623 align:middle line:84%
It's only caused by nitrate
poisoning so I knew what it was.

00:20:24.623 --> 00:20:26.558 align:middle line:84%
But why did 500 die
in one night.

00:20:26.558 --> 00:20:27.393 align:middle line:90%
That's not typical.

00:20:27.393 --> 00:20:28.727 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Something was wrong.

00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:30.162 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Yeah, there's
something else that contributed.

00:20:30.162 --> 00:20:32.164 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I finished the
autopsies on those 50 sheep,

00:20:32.164 --> 00:20:34.700 align:middle line:84%
they all had goiter,
which is set off

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.168 align:middle line:90%
by a chronic nitrate poisoning.

00:20:36.168 --> 00:20:37.403 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: OK.

00:20:37.403 --> 00:20:38.804 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: OK, you see this
in babies, they are born

00:20:38.804 --> 00:20:41.507 align:middle line:84%
with goiter on farms where they
have farm fertilizer running off

00:20:41.507 --> 00:20:43.509 align:middle line:84%
into their well and the pregnant
woman is drinking it during

00:20:43.509 --> 00:20:46.111 align:middle line:84%
pregnancy, baby born
with goiter.

00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:48.847 align:middle line:84%
And so I knew that that was a
piece-- well, that's typically--

00:20:48.847 --> 00:20:51.817 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to get 500
animals or 500 people die

00:20:51.817 --> 00:20:53.285 align:middle line:90%
in one night from goiter.

00:20:53.285 --> 00:20:55.721 align:middle line:84%
One might die now and six
years later another will die.

00:20:55.721 --> 00:20:56.555 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:20:56.555 --> 00:20:58.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: And so what was--

00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:59.925 align:middle line:84%
oh, I thought, oh,
you know, metabolism.

00:20:59.925 --> 00:21:01.293 align:middle line:90%
Thyroid controls metabolism.

00:21:01.293 --> 00:21:03.762 align:middle line:84%
Just so it happens that the
farmer had lost all his sheep,

00:21:03.762 --> 00:21:07.132 align:middle line:84%
his kids were on a 4-H
project studying the high/low

00:21:07.132 --> 00:21:10.102 align:middle line:84%
temperatures on their farm,
they were documenting it,

00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:12.504 align:middle line:84%
they had the high/low
thermometers.

00:21:12.504 --> 00:21:15.374 align:middle line:84%
And in Missouri where
this happened,

00:21:15.374 --> 00:21:17.209 align:middle line:90%
in Mexico, Missouri just--

00:21:17.209 --> 00:21:18.344 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Know it well--

00:21:18.344 --> 00:21:19.445 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Yeah, a few
minutes from Columbia

00:21:19.445 --> 00:21:23.282 align:middle line:84%
where I was studying
my veterinary medicine,

00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:26.852 align:middle line:84%
in December, it's not
unusual to have 40s and 50s,

00:21:26.852 --> 00:21:29.588 align:middle line:84%
but then that night
that they all died,

00:21:29.588 --> 00:21:31.690 align:middle line:84%
the temperature dropped
down to 19 and they all died

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:35.394 align:middle line:84%
of hypothermia, secondary
to chronic pollution.

00:21:35.394 --> 00:21:37.429 align:middle line:84%
They'd had gone to market, if
that temperature was stated

00:21:37.429 --> 00:21:40.399 align:middle line:84%
in the 40s or 50,
they'd had gone to market

00:21:40.399 --> 00:21:42.234 align:middle line:90%
and that's what had happened.

00:21:42.234 --> 00:21:44.837 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So, what did
they learn from this?

00:21:44.837 --> 00:21:46.939 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Well, that
paper went around the world,

00:21:46.939 --> 00:21:52.311 align:middle line:84%
so that actually-- 22 years
old, that put the Wallach name

00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:55.147 align:middle line:84%
out there because that
was the first mass die-off

00:21:55.147 --> 00:21:57.716 align:middle line:84%
from pollution that had
been recognized and written

00:21:57.716 --> 00:22:00.386 align:middle line:84%
up as a scientific
article in America.

00:22:00.386 --> 00:22:01.620 align:middle line:90%
Everybody had the theory

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:04.957 align:middle line:84%
but nobody had written
off a mass die-off.

00:22:04.957 --> 00:22:10.162 align:middle line:84%
And so, what we know is
that you have to be careful,

00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:14.066 align:middle line:84%
you have to analyze your well
water once every three months.

00:22:14.066 --> 00:22:17.036 align:middle line:84%
If somebody around you is
buying a new type of fertilizer,

00:22:17.036 --> 00:22:18.404 align:middle line:90%
I'd analyze it every month.

00:22:18.404 --> 00:22:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: But most people don't
have wells, so they're stuck

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.409 align:middle line:84%
with what comes in
from the city water.

00:22:23.409 --> 00:22:24.410 align:middle line:90%
How do you fix that?

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:25.811 align:middle line:90%
How do you prevent any problems?

00:22:25.811 --> 00:22:28.847 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Well, we do have
filters ourselves in our company

00:22:28.847 --> 00:22:32.151 align:middle line:84%
in Youngevity, and of
course we like carbon block

00:22:32.151 --> 00:22:34.086 align:middle line:84%
and reverse osmosis,
these kinds of things,

00:22:34.086 --> 00:22:35.654 align:middle line:90%
these are things you can do.

00:22:35.654 --> 00:22:38.390 align:middle line:84%
I also like people to keep
a gallon of chlorine bleach

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:43.495 align:middle line:84%
on hand so if there is a
disaster like this typhoon

00:22:43.495 --> 00:22:47.666 align:middle line:84%
that just went through the
Philippines, wildfires,

00:22:47.666 --> 00:22:53.472 align:middle line:84%
earthquakes, civil unrest, the
grid goes down for a month.

00:22:53.472 --> 00:22:54.173 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah, it could.

00:22:54.173 --> 00:22:55.307 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: It could.

00:22:55.307 --> 00:22:56.708 align:middle line:84%
And so you're going to
be drinking ditch water.

00:22:56.708 --> 00:22:59.578 align:middle line:84%
OK. And so what you need to do
is get some paper coffee filters

00:22:59.578 --> 00:23:01.513 align:middle line:84%
so you can get the big
stuff out, pour the water

00:23:01.513 --> 00:23:04.516 align:middle line:84%
through the coffee filters
and get the big pieces out,

00:23:04.516 --> 00:23:08.220 align:middle line:84%
and then you put 10
drops of chlorine bleach.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.054 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Per gallon.

00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:10.055 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Per gallon, yeah.

00:23:10.055 --> 00:23:12.291 align:middle line:84%
And leave it overnight
and it will--

00:23:12.291 --> 00:23:13.792 align:middle line:84%
this will kill the
bugs and dissipate.

00:23:13.792 --> 00:23:17.362 align:middle line:84%
Just like we used to do, we
take tap water that had chlorine

00:23:17.362 --> 00:23:19.231 align:middle line:84%
in it and we would
leave it out overnight

00:23:19.231 --> 00:23:21.400 align:middle line:84%
so it wouldn't kill the fish
that we put in the fish tank.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.435 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I used to have
a horse farm, Doc Wallach,

00:23:23.435 --> 00:23:26.705 align:middle line:84%
a long time ago and
we used to put a cup

00:23:26.705 --> 00:23:28.273 align:middle line:90%
of chlorine down the well.

00:23:28.273 --> 00:23:29.308 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Every
once in a while.

00:23:29.308 --> 00:23:31.243 align:middle line:84%
And would keep the
bacteria load down,

00:23:31.243 --> 00:23:33.545 align:middle line:84%
kind of like pasteurization
in the water.

00:23:33.545 --> 00:23:34.213 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:23:34.213 --> 00:23:35.314 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's smart.

00:23:35.314 --> 00:23:37.282 align:middle line:90%
What about fluoride in water?

00:23:37.282 --> 00:23:38.917 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Well, fluoride
is an essential nutrient.

00:23:38.917 --> 00:23:40.185 align:middle line:90%
The minimum daily requirement

00:23:40.185 --> 00:23:43.956 align:middle line:84%
for an adult person our
size is 1 milligram a day.

00:23:43.956 --> 00:23:46.592 align:middle line:84%
But the problem comes
in, the bell shape curve

00:23:46.592 --> 00:23:50.128 align:middle line:84%
for every nutrient for
water is a big flat surface.

00:23:50.128 --> 00:23:52.965 align:middle line:84%
Bell shape goes-- water
is very safe, and you have

00:23:52.965 --> 00:23:57.236 align:middle line:84%
to drink a gallon in 10 seconds
to die from water intoxication.

00:23:57.236 --> 00:24:00.138 align:middle line:84%
But some things, like
selenium, which are one

00:24:00.138 --> 00:24:03.475 align:middle line:84%
of my favorite trace metals, and
fluoride, have more of a spike

00:24:03.475 --> 00:24:04.877 align:middle line:90%
as a bell shape curve.

00:24:04.877 --> 00:24:06.845 align:middle line:84%
'Cause then it's not a
flat curve like water.

00:24:06.845 --> 00:24:09.548 align:middle line:84%
It goes up and comes down,
so the optimal amounts--

00:24:09.548 --> 00:24:10.182 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Abruptly.

00:24:10.182 --> 00:24:11.283 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Yeah.

00:24:11.283 --> 00:24:12.618 align:middle line:84%
The optimal amounts
are very narrow range.

00:24:12.618 --> 00:24:14.753 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're getting
fluoride in your drinking water,

00:24:14.753 --> 00:24:16.121 align:middle line:84%
you're getting fluoride
in your toothpaste,

00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:17.389 align:middle line:84%
you're getting fluoride
in your supplements,

00:24:17.389 --> 00:24:19.324 align:middle line:84%
you're getting fluoride
naturally and some

00:24:19.324 --> 00:24:21.927 align:middle line:84%
for this brought in from certain
places around the country,

00:24:21.927 --> 00:24:24.863 align:middle line:84%
you might get 6 or 8
or 10 milligrams a day

00:24:24.863 --> 00:24:26.265 align:middle line:84%
which is you're pushing
the envelope there.

00:24:26.265 --> 00:24:28.734 align:middle line:84%
You're going to start
getting problems.

00:24:28.734 --> 00:24:30.369 align:middle line:84%
You can get brittle
teeth and brittle bones.

00:24:30.369 --> 00:24:37.543 align:middle line:84%
It increases risk of bone
cancer in males and so,

00:24:37.543 --> 00:24:38.610 align:middle line:90%
you do have to watch it.

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:40.712 align:middle line:84%
And so just by being
aware of that,

00:24:40.712 --> 00:24:43.982 align:middle line:84%
you can avoid unnecessary
supplementation.

00:24:43.982 --> 00:24:46.151 align:middle line:84%
Just keep it down to 1--
1 or 2 milligrams per day.

00:24:46.151 --> 00:24:49.187 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So what's the best
program for an individual

00:24:49.187 --> 00:24:53.258 align:middle line:84%
who probably isn't taking care
of themselves and they just want

00:24:53.258 --> 00:24:57.729 align:middle line:84%
to start controlling their own
health destiny, what do they do?

00:24:57.729 --> 00:25:00.766 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: That's the
optimal question, George.

00:25:00.766 --> 00:25:02.568 align:middle line:84%
Basically, what people
should do is take the 90

00:25:02.568 --> 00:25:03.702 align:middle line:90%
essential nutrients.

00:25:03.702 --> 00:25:05.771 align:middle line:84%
As you pointed out
earlier, the car analogy,

00:25:05.771 --> 00:25:08.807 align:middle line:84%
you want to be proactive and
use preventive maintenance.

00:25:08.807 --> 00:25:10.876 align:middle line:84%
You don't put oil in your
after the engine burns up.

00:25:10.876 --> 00:25:12.010 align:middle line:84%
You put oil on your
car to prevent it.

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:12.678 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Before that.

00:25:12.678 --> 00:25:14.046 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's right.

00:25:14.046 --> 00:25:16.949 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: And so when you
take the 90 essential nutrients

00:25:16.949 --> 00:25:18.317 align:middle line:90%
appropriate for your body weight

00:25:18.317 --> 00:25:20.252 align:middle line:84%
and of course that's why we
have what we call the Healthy

00:25:20.252 --> 00:25:21.320 align:middle line:90%
Start Pak.

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:22.788 align:middle line:84%
It actually gives you
the optimal amount

00:25:22.788 --> 00:25:25.190 align:middle line:84%
of these 90 essential
nutrients for 100 pounds

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:26.792 align:middle line:90%
of human flesh per month.

00:25:26.792 --> 00:25:28.660 align:middle line:84%
So they give one of those
packs to a 50-pound kid,

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.162 align:middle line:90%
it's-- or 50 pound midget.

00:25:30.162 --> 00:25:30.662 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:25:30.662 --> 00:25:31.964 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:31.964 --> 00:25:34.366 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: It's a two-month
supply, 100 pound person,

00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:37.369 align:middle line:84%
a one month supply, 200-pound
person is a two-week supply.

00:25:37.369 --> 00:25:38.637 align:middle line:84%
You do it optimally
for body weight

00:25:38.637 --> 00:25:39.738 align:middle line:90%
which is what we do in animals.

00:25:39.738 --> 00:25:41.206 align:middle line:90%
That's my veterinary side.

00:25:41.206 --> 00:25:42.274 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:25:42.274 --> 00:25:43.041 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Doing it by
body weight.

00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:44.676 align:middle line:90%
They're much more accurate

00:25:44.676 --> 00:25:46.812 align:middle line:84%
and you'll prevent disease
like myself, I'm 74.

00:25:46.812 --> 00:25:49.181 align:middle line:84%
I haven't been to a
doctor in 66 years.

00:25:49.181 --> 00:25:50.749 align:middle line:90%
I haven't been sick in 66 years.

00:25:50.749 --> 00:25:52.551 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Shall we
knock on wood?

00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:53.885 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:53.885 --> 00:25:56.888 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: I have no health
problems and I fully expect

00:25:56.888 --> 00:25:59.625 align:middle line:84%
to live well beyond 100, you
know, boring airplane crashes

00:25:59.625 --> 00:26:00.525 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of stuff.

00:26:00.525 --> 00:26:01.627 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I understand.

00:26:01.627 --> 00:26:02.894 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: But from
degenerative diseases,

00:26:02.894 --> 00:26:05.964 align:middle line:84%
from heart attacks, it's
not going to happen.

00:26:05.964 --> 00:26:08.333 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the people
again who've lived long healthy

00:26:08.333 --> 00:26:12.604 align:middle line:84%
lives either by dumb luck like
these Aymara Indians in Bolivia

00:26:12.604 --> 00:26:15.841 align:middle line:84%
or the Costa Ricans in
the Nicoya Peninsula

00:26:15.841 --> 00:26:20.779 align:middle line:84%
on the Pacific side of
Central America, the Okinawans,

00:26:20.779 --> 00:26:23.749 align:middle line:84%
many of these cultures,
the Hunzas.

00:26:23.749 --> 00:26:25.484 align:middle line:84%
By dumb luck they're
getting these things.

00:26:25.484 --> 00:26:29.221 align:middle line:84%
So I spent 10 years putting
this book "Immortality" together

00:26:29.221 --> 00:26:32.424 align:middle line:84%
so that people have this
information in one cover.

00:26:32.424 --> 00:26:36.194 align:middle line:84%
If they employed the principles
in this book proactively,

00:26:36.194 --> 00:26:39.431 align:middle line:84%
you know, they are quite
as intensively as I am.

00:26:39.431 --> 00:26:41.867 align:middle line:84%
By just taking that Healthy
Start Pak, one per 100 pounds

00:26:41.867 --> 00:26:45.103 align:middle line:84%
of body weight per month, gives
you all 90 essential nutrients.

00:26:45.103 --> 00:26:47.673 align:middle line:84%
This can prevent 900
different diseases.

00:26:47.673 --> 00:26:49.341 align:middle line:84%
It will prevent all
birth defects.

00:26:49.341 --> 00:26:52.711 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Do you start to feel
better relatively quickly?

00:26:52.711 --> 00:26:54.813 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Usually in a few
days people will notice a big

00:26:54.813 --> 00:26:56.014 align:middle line:90%
energy increase.

00:26:56.014 --> 00:26:58.617 align:middle line:84%
If they don't, that means
you're not absorbing.

00:26:58.617 --> 00:27:00.419 align:middle line:84%
We want to put them
on a gluten-free diet.

00:27:00.419 --> 00:27:01.553 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: OK.

00:27:01.553 --> 00:27:02.654 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: Which will
repair their intestines

00:27:02.654 --> 00:27:03.955 align:middle line:84%
and they'll be able
to-- after a week

00:27:03.955 --> 00:27:06.024 align:middle line:90%
or so be able to absorb better.

00:27:06.024 --> 00:27:08.827 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, usually, if
there's no other issues

00:27:08.827 --> 00:27:11.797 align:middle line:84%
like irritable bowel syndrome,
inflammatory bowel disease,

00:27:11.797 --> 00:27:16.768 align:middle line:84%
celiac disease, diverticulitis,
Crohn's disease, eczema, asthma.

00:27:16.768 --> 00:27:19.071 align:middle line:84%
These things are
sort of indicators

00:27:19.071 --> 00:27:20.238 align:middle line:84%
or the red warning
light that you have.

00:27:20.238 --> 00:27:21.406 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: That something
else is bad.

00:27:21.406 --> 00:27:22.207 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Yes, sir.

00:27:22.207 --> 00:27:23.608 align:middle line:90%
You have gluten intolerance.

00:27:23.608 --> 00:27:26.745 align:middle line:84%
And again, you are not what you
eat, you are what you absorb.

00:27:26.745 --> 00:27:29.481 align:middle line:84%
And so these are all the
things you have to look at

00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:30.882 align:middle line:90%
and our goal should be--

00:27:30.882 --> 00:27:33.885 align:middle line:84%
you know, I love what you said
earlier that we're responsible

00:27:33.885 --> 00:27:35.687 align:middle line:90%
for generations that follow us.

00:27:35.687 --> 00:27:36.822 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: For sure.

00:27:36.822 --> 00:27:38.457 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: And we can
prevent birth defects

00:27:38.457 --> 00:27:41.059 align:middle line:84%
by making sure our youngsters
get all these 90 essential

00:27:41.059 --> 00:27:42.527 align:middle line:84%
nutrients before
they're old enough

00:27:42.527 --> 00:27:43.495 align:middle line:90%
to have their own children.

00:27:43.495 --> 00:27:45.564 align:middle line:84%
We can eliminate
every birth defect.

00:27:45.564 --> 00:27:46.965 align:middle line:90%
There's no single birth defect.

00:27:46.965 --> 00:27:50.302 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I don't think we are
teaching our young people how

00:27:50.302 --> 00:27:51.536 align:middle line:90%
to take care of themselves.

00:27:51.536 --> 00:27:54.806 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we're teaching
them how to supplement.

00:27:54.806 --> 00:27:56.274 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
a big problem.

00:27:56.274 --> 00:27:59.478 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: It is a big problem
because these cereals and juices

00:27:59.478 --> 00:28:01.880 align:middle line:84%
for breakfast are
not cultural diets.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.349 align:middle line:84%
OK. The cultural diets would
be eggs and sweet potatoes,

00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:08.220 align:middle line:84%
and cheese, and fish, and those
kind of stuff to be breakfast.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.622 align:middle line:90%
And our-- you go to a hotel

00:28:10.622 --> 00:28:16.428 align:middle line:84%
and a breakfast is
Danish and coffee.

00:28:16.428 --> 00:28:19.431 align:middle line:84%
You know, in Europe when you
get a continental breakfast it's

00:28:19.431 --> 00:28:24.269 align:middle line:84%
fish and cheese, and meats, and
fruit, and yogurt, and so forth.

00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:25.637 align:middle line:90%
It's much different.

00:28:25.637 --> 00:28:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And so, we have to do those
things plus supplement 'cause

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:31.777 align:middle line:84%
you can't bet your
child's future on what may

00:28:31.777 --> 00:28:32.811 align:middle line:90%
or may not be in the food.

00:28:32.811 --> 00:28:35.981 align:middle line:84%
Remember, food chemistry,
April 2012,

00:28:35.981 --> 00:28:38.550 align:middle line:84%
our babies are getting less than
20 percent what they're supposed

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:40.919 align:middle line:84%
to get in terms of vitamins
and minerals through--

00:28:40.919 --> 00:28:42.954 align:middle line:84%
baby foremost, less
than 20 percent.

00:28:42.954 --> 00:28:44.523 align:middle line:84%
I mean these are legendary
once that we're all--

00:28:44.523 --> 00:28:46.024 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And they grow that way

00:28:46.024 --> 00:28:48.727 align:middle line:84%
with those things
lacking in their diet.

00:28:48.727 --> 00:28:49.961 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: That's correct.

00:28:49.961 --> 00:28:52.964 align:middle line:84%
And all these-- our military
personnel coming back

00:28:52.964 --> 00:28:54.933 align:middle line:84%
and committing suicide
and having--

00:28:54.933 --> 00:28:57.068 align:middle line:90%
they said this is the feature

00:28:57.068 --> 00:29:02.541 align:middle line:84%
of this 10-year war is
posttraumatic stress syndrome

00:29:02.541 --> 00:29:05.477 align:middle line:84%
and suicide, that's because
they're all eating these meals

00:29:05.477 --> 00:29:06.478 align:middle line:90%
ready to eat.

00:29:06.478 --> 00:29:07.312 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:29:07.312 --> 00:29:08.413 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: No supplementation.

00:29:08.413 --> 00:29:10.115 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing but calories.

00:29:10.115 --> 00:29:11.216 align:middle line:90%
There's no supplementation.

00:29:11.216 --> 00:29:13.251 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: But everything
you said here today,

00:29:13.251 --> 00:29:15.954 align:middle line:90%
Joel, is common sense.

00:29:15.954 --> 00:29:16.922 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: Well, it is.

00:29:16.922 --> 00:29:18.056 align:middle line:84%
And grandma used
to know that stuff.

00:29:18.056 --> 00:29:19.925 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: It's not too
difficult to do this.

00:29:19.925 --> 00:29:20.759 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: No, sir.

00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:21.626 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Not rocket science.

00:29:21.626 --> 00:29:22.994 align:middle line:90%
>> Wallach: And you're looking

00:29:22.994 --> 00:29:29.367 align:middle line:84%
at 120 dollars a month per 100
pounds of body weight like,

00:29:29.367 --> 00:29:32.304 align:middle line:84%
you know, this gives
you everything,

00:29:32.304 --> 00:29:36.808 align:middle line:84%
plus 8000 ORAC points a day, the
antioxidant points protection

00:29:36.808 --> 00:29:40.579 align:middle line:84%
from free radicals that
might come to your defenses.

00:29:40.579 --> 00:29:44.149 align:middle line:84%
And are your kids not worth
their health and their longevity

00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:46.418 align:middle line:84%
and your grandkid's
health and longevity.

00:29:46.418 --> 00:29:49.221 align:middle line:90%
Are they not worth a buck a day?

00:29:49.221 --> 00:29:51.289 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- or three
bucks a day?

00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:52.557 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:29:52.557 --> 00:29:53.625 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: You know, when
they get up to 100 pounds

00:29:53.625 --> 00:29:54.960 align:middle line:84%
when they're a child, it's 50
cents a day.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.661 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Because so many
people wake up in the morning

00:29:56.661 --> 00:29:58.096 align:middle line:90%
and they just don't feel good.

00:29:58.096 --> 00:30:00.899 align:middle line:84%
They don't feel right and
that's all acceptable.

00:30:00.899 --> 00:30:01.867 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:30:01.867 --> 00:30:02.868 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: And they
can't function

00:30:02.868 --> 00:30:04.102 align:middle line:84%
and there's again
ADD, ADHD, autism.

00:30:04.102 --> 00:30:07.739 align:middle line:84%
These kids get muscle
dystrophy, cystic fibrosis.

00:30:07.739 --> 00:30:09.407 align:middle line:90%
They're born deaf.

00:30:09.407 --> 00:30:11.243 align:middle line:84%
They gradually lose
their hearing.

00:30:11.243 --> 00:30:16.147 align:middle line:84%
They get-- or start-- again,
they get Tourette syndrome.

00:30:16.147 --> 00:30:17.515 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:30:17.515 --> 00:30:19.384 align:middle line:84%
>> Wallach: They get every kind
of disease you can think of

00:30:19.384 --> 00:30:20.852 align:middle line:90%
and it's totally preventable.

00:30:20.852 --> 00:30:21.987 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Very good.

00:30:21.987 --> 00:30:23.555 align:middle line:84%
Doc Wallach, thanks for

00:30:23.555 --> 00:30:24.656 align:middle line:90%

website, of course,

00:30:26.024 --> 00:30:30.395 align:middle line:84%
criticalhealthnews.com, take
some time, go to it, study it.

00:30:30.395 --> 00:30:31.363 align:middle line:90%
Thanks again.

00:30:31.363 --> 00:30:32.497 align:middle line:84%
