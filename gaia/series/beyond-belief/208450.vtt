>>GEORGE NOORY: Tell me
about the title "Hacking

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:13.790 align:middle line:90%
the Afterlife."

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD MARTINI: Well,
we tend to lose fear when

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.560 align:middle line:90%
we realize that life goes on.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.990 align:middle line:84%
We tend to lose the
phobias that we've--

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: --had for, who
knows how many lifetimes?

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.147 align:middle line:90%
Imagine how shocking it was--

00:00:26.147 --> 00:00:27.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you found it?

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: --to find his name
as the gunner on Lady Belle.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.670 align:middle line:84%
The pilot of that
plane survived,

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.410 align:middle line:90%
went to a prisoner of war camp.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And he passed away just a couple
of years ago, I'm sorry to say.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't
make that stuff up.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: You
can't make that up.

00:00:46.583 --> 00:00:48.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Welcome to this
edition of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.300 align:middle line:10%
Richard Martini with us,
a best-selling author

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.770 align:middle line:10%
on books about the afterlife
or what he calls the flipside.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.930 align:middle line:90%
He has three films on Gaia--

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.510 align:middle line:84%
"Flipside-- A Journey
into the Afterlife,"

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.330 align:middle line:84%
"Talking to Bill Paxton--"
he was the actor--

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.170 align:middle line:90%
and "Hacking the Afterlife."

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.080 align:middle line:90%
So, welcome back, Mr. Martini.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: George, I'm
so glad to be here.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You are
always in demand.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.803 align:middle line:90%
It's good to see you, my friend.

00:01:11.803 --> 00:01:12.603 align:middle line:90%
How have you been?

00:01:12.603 --> 00:01:14.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: I've been
fantastic, really.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.610 align:middle line:84%
I had a hip replaced, but
other than that, I'm just fine.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At least you
weren't on the flipside.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.738 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: That's true.

00:01:20.738 --> 00:01:22.043 align:middle line:90%
Because you always wonder.

00:01:22.043 --> 00:01:24.210 align:middle line:84%
When they put you under,
are you going to come back?

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
going to come back?

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a weird feeling, isn't it?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Because it's
very hard to write books

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.820 align:middle line:90%
from the flipside.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.130 align:middle line:84%
But it is fun to reach
out to your friends

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.300 align:middle line:90%
and loved ones from there.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
they put you under?

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.010 align:middle line:90%
IV?

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.635 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Yeah, they
put you on an IV.

00:01:36.635 --> 00:01:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And the anesthesiologist
was talking to me.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.720 align:middle line:84%
So, Rich, in a few minutes,
you're going to feel--

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.150 align:middle line:84%
and then he was doing
that with his hand.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.960 align:middle line:90%
And I suddenly was gone.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And then next thing I knew, his
hand was doing this and going--

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.690 align:middle line:84%
so that was a
three-hour operation.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:52.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just like that?

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Just like that.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.230 align:middle line:84%
Were you in much pain
afterwards, healing wise?

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Healing wise,
you do go through stuff,

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.980 align:middle line:90%
but it's a lot different.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.860 align:middle line:90%
A hip is much easier than knee.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can I have you
run around our studio?

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Please don't.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "Hacking the
Afterlife" premiering on Gaia.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.110 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about this.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well,
it's interesting.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.060 align:middle line:10%
The first film that I had on
Gaia is called "Flipside."

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.550 align:middle line:10%
And it was based on the
research that I've been doing.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.980 align:middle line:10%
And it was nine years ago today
that I was first on "Coast

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:18.780 align:middle line:10%
to Coast."

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.170 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.040 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINI: So happy
anniversary to us.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.133 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Perfect.

00:02:22.133 --> 00:02:24.300 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINI: But as time went
on, people would ask me,

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.342 align:middle line:10%
what have you been doing?

00:02:25.342 --> 00:02:28.110 align:middle line:84%
So I continued to film
people under deep hypnosis.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.330 align:middle line:84%
I continued to film mediums
talking about the afterlife.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And I continued to film people
who, through meditation, could

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.670 align:middle line:84%
access near-death
experiences, vivid dreams,

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.478 align:middle line:84%
talking to their loved
ones with no hypnosis.

00:02:41.478 --> 00:02:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On the flipside.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: On the flipside, but
confirming who they were just

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.570 align:middle line:90%
by giving them new information.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.830 align:middle line:90%
And I've been filming that.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.410 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, I should try
to put something together.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.200 align:middle line:84%
So it really is an amalgamation
of the past 10 years

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.810 align:middle line:84%
of me filming people
doing this stuff

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.620 align:middle line:84%
and learning new things
about the afterlife.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.030 align:middle line:90%
It's mind bending.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.840 align:middle line:84%
One of my friends, Howard
Schultz, is not the coffee guy.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.420 align:middle line:84%
But he was the guy who
created "Extreme Makeover--"

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.650 align:middle line:84%
good, close friend who passed
away, subsequently after we

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.470 align:middle line:90%
filmed his past life regression.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And he used to show this past
life regression to everybody

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.700 align:middle line:90%
who would come into his office.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Because he remembered
a lifetime where

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.955 align:middle line:84%
he was a young girl taken out
of Denmark and put in Dachau.

00:03:26.955 --> 00:03:28.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He remembers this?

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: He remembered.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:29.703 align:middle line:90%
Well, under hypnosis.

00:03:29.703 --> 00:03:30.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Under hypnotherapy?

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:31.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Yeah.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.990 align:middle line:90%
And so Michael Newton's method.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Scott De Tamble was
the hypnotherapist.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.800 align:middle line:84%
But on camera,
live, he's recalling

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.090 align:middle line:90%
this lifetime in Dachau.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.190 align:middle line:84%
I was able to find
all the details

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.020 align:middle line:90%
and confirm what he was saying.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.940 align:middle line:84%
But it was fascinating
to hear him

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.580 align:middle line:84%
talk about the choice
of that lifetime

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.540 align:middle line:84%
and why he chose that
particular dark lifetime.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.990 align:middle line:84%
As he said, I had so many
lifetimes in the light.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.680 align:middle line:84%
I had forgotten how
dark it could be.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.720 align:middle line:90%
But he said it scorched my soul.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.320 align:middle line:90%
And so it was very unusual.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's on camera in the film
where the hypnotherapist says,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.530 align:middle line:84%
is there any way we can help
you with the memory of this,

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.940 align:middle line:90%
this scorched memory?

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And he said my
guides are walking me

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.260 align:middle line:90%
into the river of souls.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's washing away all of
my pain from that experience.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've never heard
of something like that.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm literally across
the room filming.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.600 align:middle line:84%
But what Howard
is saying and what

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.250 align:middle line:84%
others say in the film
is consistent with all

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.600 align:middle line:90%
of the other research I've done.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about the
title "Hacking the Afterlife."

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well,
it's not so much--

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it sounds
pretty violent.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.130 align:middle line:84%
But the idea of
hacking life tips,

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.060 align:middle line:84%
hacking things
around the kitchen,

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.620 align:middle line:84%
which is a modern
term for looking

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.210 align:middle line:90%
at something through new eyes.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.070 align:middle line:84%
So my thought was by calling
it that, by accessing--

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.710 align:middle line:84%
and what's the point of
accessing the afterlife?

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.980 align:middle line:84%
It's to learn how to
navigate the planet.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.570 align:middle line:84%
We tend to lose fear when we
realize that life goes on.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.990 align:middle line:84%
We tend to lose the
phobias that we've

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.040 align:middle line:84%
had for who knows how many
lifetimes when we access that.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you can--
well, for example, there's

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.340 align:middle line:84%
a woman with Parkinson's,
a professor from USC

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.450 align:middle line:90%
that was a friend of mine.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And she agreed to
appear on camera,

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.210 align:middle line:84%
very serious case of
Parkinson's, could barely

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.185 align:middle line:90%
sit still.

00:05:28.185 --> 00:05:31.085 align:middle line:84%
And on camera, you
see as she is--

00:05:31.085 --> 00:05:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Her
movements and stuff.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: They all
disappear under hypnosis.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.420 align:middle line:90%
And she starts speaking clearly.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: And
she starts talking

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.030 align:middle line:90%
about her life and her journey.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And she accesses why
she got Parkinson's.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.460 align:middle line:84%
She accesses how she could
be healed from Parkinson's.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And then as he talks her
back and counts her down

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.800 align:middle line:84%
from whatever that number is and
then when she gets back to 1,

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.330 align:middle line:90%
everything comes back.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's an unusual
exploration into the mind

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.135 align:middle line:90%
and to accessing consciousness.

00:06:03.135 --> 00:06:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.810 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.010 align:middle line:84%
You should do that
with Michael J. Fox.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well,
of course, when I

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.640 align:middle line:84%
filmed it, the first
thing I did was write

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.290 align:middle line:90%
a letter to his organization.

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.750 align:middle line:90%
It's very hard to hear from a--

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:15.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm a filmmaker.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.025 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: It's very hard
to hear from some guy--

00:06:19.025 --> 00:06:20.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who's a filmmaker.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: --who's a filmmaker.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:21.530 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:21.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not a medical--

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: --I've
written, directed--

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --practitioner.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.403 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: I mean, I've had nine
feature films and the Directors

00:06:26.403 --> 00:06:27.570 align:middle line:90%
Guild, et cetera, et cetera.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.470 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not a doctor,
and I'm not a scientist,

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.330 align:middle line:90%
but I am an observer.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.100 align:middle line:90%
And I am a documenter.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And so I can show him
on camera this happened.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:38.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The difference?

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Yes.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.350 align:middle line:90%
And my feeling--

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: --about that is
if I had that affliction,

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.145 align:middle line:84%
I would do a hypnosis
session every day.

00:06:47.145 --> 00:06:47.945 align:middle line:90%
Every morning--

00:06:47.945 --> 00:06:48.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Me, too.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: --I would
have somebody come over--

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Me, too.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.232 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: --and just say,
look, for the whole duration

00:06:52.232 --> 00:06:54.110 align:middle line:84%
of today's thing, you're
not going to shake.

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.537 align:middle line:84%
You're just going
to talk normally.

00:06:56.537 --> 00:06:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
take your time doing it.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know
why that works.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.210 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it's--

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.480 align:middle line:84%
it's not psychosomatic,
but it does work.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen it,
and it's on camera.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.592 align:middle line:90%
And that's why it's in the film.

00:07:08.592 --> 00:07:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a moment
in your film "Hacking

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:11.350 align:middle line:90%
the Afterlife."

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:16.010 align:middle line:84%
Josh Davidow describes feeling
his consciousness outside

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:17.810 align:middle line:90%
of his body.

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Here's my consciousness.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.570 align:middle line:10%
And I was just like, where am I?

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:22.370 align:middle line:10%
What's going on?

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.170 align:middle line:10%
What's the story?

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.670 align:middle line:10%
Because I was so used
to hearing that voice.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.418 align:middle line:10%
And then I look down.

00:07:27.418 --> 00:07:29.210 align:middle line:10%
And that was probably
the next thing I saw.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:33.380 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing I saw was the
landscape and the amazing scape

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.840 align:middle line:90%
of the top from that.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.030 align:middle line:84%
But then I looked
down and saw my body.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And what I immediately
remember thinking

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.420 align:middle line:84%
is seeing your dead
body and immediately

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.760 align:middle line:84%
going into the habituated
thought of going,

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.410 align:middle line:90%
Jesus, that's bad.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:51.410 align:middle line:10%
But the second I did that,
there was another part of me

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:53.010 align:middle line:10%
that went, hang on a minute.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:55.730 align:middle line:10%
That's not bad.

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.230 align:middle line:10%
It's not anything.

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:59.370 align:middle line:10%
It's just that's your body.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.020 align:middle line:10%
I'm still me.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.210 align:middle line:10%
And I hear my voice.

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.490 align:middle line:10%
And I'm cracking
wise in my head.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:06.320 align:middle line:10%
But I don't have that body.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.350 align:middle line:10%
What else don't I have?

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.810 align:middle line:10%
And then I started going
through this live checklist.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.700 align:middle line:10%
And I don't have guilt.
And I don't have shame.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:14.500 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.480 align:middle line:10%
>> And I don't have pain.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.940 align:middle line:10%
And I don't have history.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.400 align:middle line:10%
And I don't have
all of these things

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.480 align:middle line:10%
that I really owned
as a physical--

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.203 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Were you
there when he had that?

00:08:27.203 --> 00:08:28.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: I was there
when it happened,

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:30.490 align:middle line:90%
but I wasn't aware of it.

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Because we were both
walking around Mount

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Kailash with Robert
Thurman and a tour group.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until recently
that I was talking to Josh.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.289 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yeah, I had a
near-death experience when

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:43.659 align:middle line:84%
we were in Tibet and
on Mount Kailash.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, why don't
I film you talking about it?

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Knowing that I have
this odd technique where

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.640 align:middle line:84%
I ask people to access a
memory, a near-death event.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And I walk them
back into the event

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:58.630 align:middle line:90%
to see what they can remember.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, I had
never heard from him

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:02.650 align:middle line:90%
what his story was.

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And he tells it live on
camera where suddenly, he's

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.620 align:middle line:90%
gone the ground.

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And he's floating above, and
he's looking down at his body.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.180 align:middle line:90%
And he's becoming aware of all--

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of what's happening.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.125 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: --these things.

00:09:14.125 --> 00:09:14.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah--

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's pretty glee
about the thing, isn't he?

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:18.477 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, he's
a pretty glee guy.

00:09:18.477 --> 00:09:20.740 align:middle line:84%
He's an editor who went
to NYU Film School.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And he cut the film
"Flipside" for me.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.690 align:middle line:84%
But it's really
fascinating about Josh,

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:27.910 align:middle line:84%
is a little further
on in the film,

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:30.533 align:middle line:84%
I ask him, have you ever
had any other lifetimes

00:09:30.533 --> 00:09:31.450 align:middle line:90%
that you can remember?

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:33.430 align:middle line:90%
Again, he's not under hypnosis.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.730 align:middle line:84%
We're on Zoom,
clearly, just chatting.

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:39.520 align:middle line:90%
And he said yeah.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him to just
whatever pops into your mind.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And he suddenly said,
OK, I'm seeing myself

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.818 align:middle line:90%
in World War II in a bomber.

00:09:48.818 --> 00:09:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what's your
occupation in the bomber?

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.105 align:middle line:90%
And he said gunner.

00:09:52.105 --> 00:09:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And I said, and
what's your name?

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.680 align:middle line:90%
He said the guy's name.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And I said, and what's
the name of the plane?

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Because every plane that
flew in World War II not only

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.290 align:middle line:90%
has a name, but a manifest.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:03.940 align:middle line:90%
And somebody has recorded them.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.380 align:middle line:90%
So he says Lady Belle.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And I, of course, jaded
Hollywood guy, I go,

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.820 align:middle line:90%
you mean "Memphis Belle?"

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.580 align:middle line:84%
Thinking he must have seen the
movie, and he's putting this--

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:13.455 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In his head.

00:10:13.455 --> 00:10:16.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Because I can't
be less jaded than I am.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.280 align:middle line:84%
But, no, he said,
no, Lady Belle.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.080 align:middle line:90%
Lady Belle.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.340 align:middle line:90%
And so I looked it up.

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.797 align:middle line:84%
And imagine how
shocking it was--

00:10:23.797 --> 00:10:24.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you found it?

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: --to find his name
as the gunner on Lady Belle.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:29.950 align:middle line:90%
That was--

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:30.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Remarkable.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: --not the
plane he died in,

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.398 align:middle line:90%
but he flew in Lady Belle.

00:10:33.398 --> 00:10:34.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how many missions.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:37.480 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, he then
transfers to another plane.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And in that plane, he's
shot down over Germany.

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:43.420 align:middle line:84%
The pilot of that
plane survived,

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.160 align:middle line:90%
went to a prisoner of war camp.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.827 align:middle line:84%
And he passed away just a couple
of years ago, I'm sorry to say.

00:10:47.827 --> 00:10:49.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't
make that stuff up.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: You
can't make that up.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.390 align:middle line:90%
And it's live on camera.

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:59.650 align:middle line:84%
So some people try to parse
it or pretzel logic it

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:02.230 align:middle line:84%
to a point where they said,
well, this can't possibly be.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:03.940 align:middle line:90%
He must be reading his mind.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:08.320 align:middle line:84%
But Josh, literally on camera,
the glib guy that he is,

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.370 align:middle line:90%
suddenly recalls this event.

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out to be
absolutely accurate.

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:16.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about
Jennifer Shaffer.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: So I get an email
from her Facebook account.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.678 align:middle line:90%
Somebody wants to be my friend.

00:11:21.678 --> 00:11:23.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everybody
wants to be your friend.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Everybody.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.985 align:middle line:90%
And so you get those.

00:11:24.985 --> 00:11:27.320 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at her photograph.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.290 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh, what is this?

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:30.310 align:middle line:90%
But I said yes.

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And then she sent me--
she texted me a photograph

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.600 align:middle line:90%
of her saying, he said yes.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.920 align:middle line:90%
She's a medium.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.480 align:middle line:90%
She had been a stockbroker.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:41.380 align:middle line:84%
But she started becoming aware
of people's deaths, people

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:44.020 align:middle line:84%
around her, people who
would come to visit her.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.970 align:middle line:84%
She started working
with the Colorado

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Bureau of Investigation,
members of the Federal

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Bureau of Investigation
in missing person cases,

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.310 align:middle line:90%
so she does that nationwide.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:55.930 align:middle line:90%
She does that pro bono.

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere along the line,
people started seeing her.

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:04.240 align:middle line:84%
Because she's like having a
cell phone to the flipside.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And when she first
contacted me, I

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:09.520 align:middle line:84%
thought I don't know
what a psychic medium is.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.950 align:middle line:84%
But I realized that a
psychic predicts the future.

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:13.600 align:middle line:84%
A medium is like a
cell phone to the--

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Deals with
the other side.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Yeah.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did was
about six years ago,

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:20.320 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, why
don't we just see.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, I said, you do
missing person cases?

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.385 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe we can talk
about Amelia Earhart.

00:12:25.385 --> 00:12:26.260 align:middle line:90%
Because as you know--

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:27.088 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I remember that.

00:12:27.088 --> 00:12:27.888 align:middle line:90%
You were into her.

00:12:27.888 --> 00:12:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: --I had spent
decades researching her.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't even
tell her Amelia.

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:35.080 align:middle line:84%
I just said, I want to look for
the most famous missing person.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.280 align:middle line:84%
I spent three hours
in her office.

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.790 align:middle line:84%
She knew as much about
Amelia Earhart as I did.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And from that point forward,
I realized, oh, my gosh,

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:45.920 align:middle line:84%
a great medium is like a
cell phone to the other side.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:51.580 align:middle line:84%
So for six years, every week,
we get together and film an hour

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.820 align:middle line:84%
of me asking questions to
somebody on the other side.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.640 align:middle line:84%
Could be a friend of mine,
could be a friend of hers,

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.640 align:middle line:84%
could be somebody who passed
away in the news the week

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.490 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And then because of the COVID,
we decided to put that online.

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And so we've been doing
that for a year now.

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:10.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you do it through
a podcast as well, don't you?

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI:
hackingtheafterlife.com.

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's look.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Just to clarify for people
tuning in for the first time

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:22.480 align:middle line:10%
or the hundredth time, this is a
person that Jennifer and I have

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.950 align:middle line:10%
talked to before, that I
personally have talked to via

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:31.710 align:middle line:10%
other people before, who is not
somebody who incarnates and not

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:34.190 align:middle line:10%
somebody who has ever--

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:34.990 align:middle line:10%
let's ask him.

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:38.140 align:middle line:10%
Have you ever been
on the planet?

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:38.940 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.350 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.330 align:middle line:10%
And you also described yourself.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:43.860 align:middle line:10%
And this is a
self-description not

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.710 align:middle line:10%
coming from me and not from
Jennifer, but as somebody

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:48.950 align:middle line:10%
who was "the librarian."

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:51.315 align:middle line:10%


00:13:51.315 --> 00:13:53.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Can I share with you
what he's showing me?

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:53.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Please.

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:55.980 align:middle line:10%
He knows what I'm going
to ask, so go ahead.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.870 align:middle line:10%
>> So as you're talking,
he's showing me.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.210 align:middle line:10%
He's making me
feel coincidences.

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:03.330 align:middle line:10%
He's the one that knows every
meeting, everything that

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:07.550 align:middle line:10%
happens here and elsewhere.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:11.930 align:middle line:10%
And so it's like
everything crisscrosses.

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:12.740 align:middle line:10%
I can't explain it.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:13.940 align:middle line:10%
It's like the lights.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:17.090 align:middle line:10%
So us meeting each
other, everything

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:19.590 align:middle line:10%
making all these things happen.

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:23.240 align:middle line:10%
>> What seems like coincidence,
he's showing you as actual

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.780 align:middle line:10%
blueprints.

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Correct.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you say
she's a medium, Rich?

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Yeah.

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:30.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And a good one?

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.045 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: She's
a fantastic one.

00:14:32.045 --> 00:14:36.715 align:middle line:84%
And I've had many of my
friends go to see her.

00:14:36.715 --> 00:14:40.540 align:middle line:84%
All I can say is the proof
is in the pudding, which

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.960 align:middle line:84%
is I've had her talk to friends
of mine on the other side

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:47.800 align:middle line:84%
that I only know the answers
to the questions I'm asking.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And I've been able to use her
in this really unique way.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.360 align:middle line:84%
So for example, a
friend of mine's father

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.210 align:middle line:84%
was in hospice
care with dementia

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:57.850 align:middle line:90%
and maybe a month left to live.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:02.127 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to access his
higher self through Jennifer.

00:15:02.127 --> 00:15:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: While he's still alive?

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:04.877 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: While
he's still alive.

00:15:04.877 --> 00:15:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to ask him what
his experience was like.

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And in the course
of our conversation,

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.880 align:middle line:84%
first he proved
to me who he was.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Because he remembered
me as a kid.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.390 align:middle line:84%
He remembered all
the things I did.

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:17.530 align:middle line:90%
And he talked about them.

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who would know that?

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Nobody
would know that.

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:19.990 align:middle line:90%
He even talked about--

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Except, yeah.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: --the
toast that he used

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.900 align:middle line:90%
to feed his dog in the morning.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.013 align:middle line:90%
Only I know that.

00:15:24.013 --> 00:15:25.930 align:middle line:84%
But then I said, what's
it like for you, Jack?

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:26.730 align:middle line:90%
Jack Tracey.

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:28.130 align:middle line:90%
What's it like for you?

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, about 10%
of me is still in my body.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.430 align:middle line:90%
And 90% is already back home.

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:36.550 align:middle line:84%
He said it's like leaving a
foot in the pool, like your leg.

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:38.260 align:middle line:84%
You're dangling your
leg in the pool.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:42.100 align:middle line:84%
So that idea of using a
medium to access the higher

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:46.180 align:middle line:84%
self of someone
you love is a tool,

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:49.150 align:middle line:84%
rather than something
mysterious, or magical,

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.520 align:middle line:90%
or beyond our comprehension.

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.550 align:middle line:84%
You can literally--
a good medium

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:58.880 align:middle line:84%
can put you in touch with pretty
much anyone on the flipside.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dramatic.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: It's a game changer.

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And people contact
me constantly about,

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:08.560 align:middle line:84%
why don't you look up this
murder or look up that event?

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And Jennifer, like I said,
works with law enforcement.

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And most of her day is talking
to law enforcement people

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.080 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.028 align:middle line:90%
They've got a case.

00:16:16.028 --> 00:16:18.070 align:middle line:84%
They give her the outline
of what the issues are.

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They respect her?

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: They
totally respect her.

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And they ask her to come
up with details of what--

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.420 align:middle line:84%
so they can follow it up
and do the detective work.

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.230 align:middle line:90%
She's very good at that.

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:31.120 align:middle line:84%
But any great medium will
tell you they're interpreting.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.620 align:middle line:84%
They're seeing an
image, and they're

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.810 align:middle line:84%
trying to tell you what
they think it means.

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, for example, Jennifer
and I do these things

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.220 align:middle line:90%
where this podcast--

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.290 align:middle line:90%
she'll say so and so is here.

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And she'll say, he's showing
me a picture of this.

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say-- and at
first thought, you think,

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.500 align:middle line:90%
why are they--

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.470 align:middle line:84%
yesterday, Steve
Martin showed up.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:55.608 align:middle line:84%
And of course, he's
still on the planet.

00:16:55.608 --> 00:16:56.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's still here.

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Yeah.

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And so she says, why am
I seeing Steve Martin?

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:00.040 align:middle line:90%
And I said, wait a second.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Is this related to
my friend, Charles?

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And she said, yes,
that's correct.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.119 align:middle line:84%
My friend, Charles Grodin
passed away this past year.

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:09.849 align:middle line:90%
He was very close with Steve.

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And he had actually
taken me to Steve's house

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:12.609 align:middle line:90%
a number of times.

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:13.509 align:middle line:90%
And my--

00:17:13.509 --> 00:17:13.869 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, cool.

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: --girlfriend
and I spent the night

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:16.150 align:middle line:90%
at Steve's house.

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to talk
about Steve's new show.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:21.790 align:middle line:84%
So Charles' way of
introducing the topic

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.069 align:middle line:84%
was to show her an
image of Steve Martin.

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:26.920 align:middle line:84%
She brought him
to the forefront.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
talking about it.

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.295 align:middle line:84%
And I said, so what do
you think of his show?

00:17:30.295 --> 00:17:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to say,
look, Steve, I still exist.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.638 align:middle line:84%
You can hear me, but you're
trying to not hear me.

00:17:37.638 --> 00:17:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
tried to communicate

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.020 align:middle line:90%
with Robin Williams?

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Robin Williams
started showing up.

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And a very unusual
event happened.

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.190 align:middle line:84%
I was working on the book
"Hacking the Afterlife."

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Hey, I've used
that title before.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, there was a
chapter about Robin Williams.

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And it was my
experience with Robin

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:58.160 align:middle line:90%
where I had dinner with him.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And I knew Jonathan Winters,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:02.570 align:middle line:84%
So it was all about
me, me, me, me, me.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And when I got done with
the chapter, I thought,

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:05.370 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:08.080 align:middle line:84%
This is just too much about
me and not about Robin.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I took it
out of the book.

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And Jennifer and I were having
our once a week meeting.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And she said Robin
Williams is here.

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.150 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh, OK.

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:17.950 align:middle line:90%
How's he doing?

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:19.180 align:middle line:90%
What does he want to say?

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:23.690 align:middle line:84%
He wants you to put his
chapter back in the book.

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:25.820 align:middle line:84%
Jennifer could never
have known that.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:26.855 align:middle line:90%
I had not told anybody.

00:18:26.855 --> 00:18:27.110 align:middle line:90%
I had just--

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.445 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: --edited it out.

00:18:28.445 --> 00:18:29.720 align:middle line:90%
No one had seen it.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.550 align:middle line:90%
So I was like--

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:35.900 align:middle line:84%
and then when the book came out,
as a joke I contacted Jennifer.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I need a
quote from all the people

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:39.600 align:middle line:90%
that we talked to in the book.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.840 align:middle line:84%
What does Robin want me
to put on the cover as--

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love it.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: --a quote from him?

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:45.530 align:middle line:90%
And his answer was that.

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:48.840 align:middle line:90%
He said, love love.

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.340 align:middle line:90%
I said, what does that mean?

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:51.140 align:middle line:90%
She asked him.

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:54.170 align:middle line:90%
He said love what love is.

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:55.700 align:middle line:90%
Love while you're on the planet.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:57.260 align:middle line:90%
Love why you're on the planet.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Love who you are
with on the planet.

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.670 align:middle line:90%
Love love.

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And now, it's become
as much as I can.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.015 align:middle line:90%
I sign off my letters that way.

00:19:06.015 --> 00:19:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love that.

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:08.020 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:08.180 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:08.690 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:09.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: I love you.

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:11.308 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've dealt
with a lot of celebrities

00:19:11.308 --> 00:19:12.180 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.600 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about-- let me throw
some names your way and show--

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:14.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Sure.

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:15.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --me what it's like.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:16.438 align:middle line:90%
Elvis Presley?

00:19:16.438 --> 00:19:17.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Elvis Presley.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:21.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, listen, how crazy is that,
that somebody would tell you

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:23.810 align:middle line:84%
that Elvis Presley is
knocking on our class?

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:26.390 align:middle line:84%
But Elvis-- and so I
ask the same questions

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:27.788 align:middle line:90%
to whoever shows up.

00:19:27.788 --> 00:19:30.080 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm not interested
in the celebrity part of it.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.060 align:middle line:84%
No one is a celebrity
on the flipside.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:33.380 align:middle line:90%
There's no hierarchy.

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.710 align:middle line:84%
But when Elvis shows
up, I say, so what do

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:38.270 align:middle line:90%
you want to talk about, Elvis?

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:40.730 align:middle line:90%
And what his answer was--

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.730 align:middle line:84%
that when he passed
away, the first person

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:47.600 align:middle line:84%
who was there to greet him was
a child that he didn't have.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.230 align:middle line:90%
And he wanted to bring that up.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:53.030 align:middle line:84%
Because he said, I felt so
much love from that child.

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.360 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINI: And he said
my life-- people--

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.370 align:middle line:10%
I didn't have that kind
of unconditional love.

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:02.950 align:middle line:10%
I had a lot of adulation,
but I didn't experience it.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:04.200 align:middle line:90%
And I want to talk about that.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.100 align:middle line:84%
And I want people to know
that when they pass over,

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:10.820 align:middle line:84%
they may experience that, a
child that didn't come to term.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, he sang
that great song "I

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:15.115 align:middle line:84%
Believe" that had to do with
a child and everything else.

00:20:15.115 --> 00:20:16.532 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Oh, I
didn't know that.

00:20:16.532 --> 00:20:17.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Classic.

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: So when somebody
comes up, I try to avoid this.

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Because I work in show business,
and I know what that means.

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:27.650 align:middle line:84%
I know that everybody puts
their pants on the same way.

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to put the
makeup on and get to the set.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And seeing yourself 40 feet
high makes it seem different,

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:36.240 align:middle line:90%
but you're just who you are.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing when
you get to the flipside.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:42.710 align:middle line:84%
You are who you chose
to be as well as

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:44.337 align:middle line:84%
who you were in
previous lifetimes.

00:20:44.337 --> 00:20:45.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: So Elvis,
a fantastic musician.

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And he talked about
his relationship

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.900 align:middle line:84%
with Colonel Tom Parker as
well, which is fascinating.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Because he said in
a previous lifetime,

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:59.333 align:middle line:84%
the roles were switched where
he was the one who controls.

00:20:59.333 --> 00:21:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was the manager.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Yeah, he
was the manager who

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:02.638 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't let him do anything.

00:21:02.638 --> 00:21:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about the CNN
restaurateur Anthony Bourdain?

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well,
just after he passed,

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Jennifer and I were
having lunch together.

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.075 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He took
his life, right?

00:21:12.075 --> 00:21:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Yes, he did.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:16.010 align:middle line:90%
And so when he came forth--

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:17.705 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't invite him.

00:21:17.705 --> 00:21:18.830 align:middle line:90%
Let's just put it that way.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:20.205 align:middle line:84%
Jennifer and I
were having lunch.

00:21:20.205 --> 00:21:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And she went, Anthony
Bourdain is here.

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:24.120 align:middle line:90%
And I said, why?

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And I excoriated him
for checking out early.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And at some point in our
conversation, she said,

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.880 align:middle line:84%
he's throwing his hands up
like, why are you grilling me?

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.230 align:middle line:90%
But I wanted to know.

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Why did you throw away
such a wonderful journey?

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:41.100 align:middle line:90%
And you know what his reply was?

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.370 align:middle line:90%
I was badly misinformed.

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:46.162 align:middle line:84%
He said he thought
he could end it all.

00:21:46.162 --> 00:21:48.620 align:middle line:84%
He thought that once you did
yourself in, everything ended.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:49.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was it.

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:53.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: But that's a
line from "Casablanca."

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:54.890 align:middle line:90%
I came here for the waters.

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:56.390 align:middle line:84%
There are no waters
in "Casablanca."

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:57.830 align:middle line:90%
I was badly misinformed.

00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:59.240 align:middle line:90%
It's a funny line.

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And then, also, he's
such an erudite fellow.

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:07.162 align:middle line:84%
So when he shows up, he mocks
me for the questions that I ask.

00:22:07.162 --> 00:22:08.370 align:middle line:90%
So I'm asking him a question.

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:09.203 align:middle line:90%
And he said, really?

00:22:09.203 --> 00:22:10.145 align:middle line:90%
That's your question?

00:22:10.145 --> 00:22:11.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the
best you can do?

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:11.480 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: And sometimes
I'll say to him--

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:15.500 align:middle line:84%
if we're talking to
somebody else entirely--

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.360 align:middle line:84%
I think we were talking
to Frank Sinatra.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.680 align:middle line:90%
Again, celebrity name.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.760 align:middle line:84%
But of course, on
the flipside, not.

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
Anthony, you're here.

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:25.490 align:middle line:90%
What would you ask Frank?

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'd like to ask
him not a question for me

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:31.760 align:middle line:90%
and not a question for Jennifer.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.650 align:middle line:84%
But he said, I'd
like to ask him how

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:35.540 align:middle line:90%
he was able to handle the fame.

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:39.845 align:middle line:84%
What did he do to allay
the fears and the--

00:22:39.845 --> 00:22:40.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He loved it.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: --solitude?

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Anthony also had
taken many drugs,

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:45.950 align:middle line:90%
as you know, in his youth.

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:48.530 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes drug use--

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:50.720 align:middle line:84%
heroin, stuff like that--
can screw with the--

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.595 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, it can.

00:22:51.595 --> 00:22:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: --ability
to feel joy.

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And that is something
that people talk about

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:56.240 align:middle line:90%
on the flipside.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.870 align:middle line:84%
Or they constantly refer to
it-- feeling unconditional love

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:01.190 align:middle line:90%
and feeling joy.

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And so people here
on the planet--

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:07.320 align:middle line:84%
sometimes medications force
them into that feeling.

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's their
life does, whatever that is.

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:12.830 align:middle line:84%
But the point is-- and
this is so important.

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:13.820 align:middle line:90%
Because he said--

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.520 align:middle line:84%
I said, so how do you want to
tell people to stop doing that?

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.672 align:middle line:90%
He said meditation.

00:23:18.672 --> 00:23:19.880 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what do you mean?

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.050 align:middle line:90%
Did you meditate?

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:23.100 align:middle line:90%
He said, no, idiot.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.900 align:middle line:84%
If I did, I'd still
be on the planet.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:25.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He called you an idiot?

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Yes, he did.

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh,
this is hilarious,

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.080 align:middle line:90%
because it sounds like him.

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:35.068 align:middle line:84%
But his point is meditation
can cure depression.

00:23:35.068 --> 00:23:37.110 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the research
from Richard Davidson

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:38.790 align:middle line:84%
at the University
of Wisconsin, he

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:40.800 align:middle line:84%
showed that
meditation can change

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.110 align:middle line:84%
the shape of the amygdala,
which is the regulator--

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The regulator.

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: --of serotonin.

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:44.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: And it
can cure or alleviate

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:48.390 align:middle line:90%
symptoms of depression.

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:51.000 align:middle line:90%
Med means measure in Latin.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like you
have to get a robe,

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:56.490 align:middle line:84%
and you have to become a
monk or get into a yoga pose.

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:57.540 align:middle line:90%
Learn how to meditate.

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:00.480 align:middle line:84%
You can just do that simply
through the breath meditation.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.610 align:middle line:84%
But the point is
Anthony saying--

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:04.620 align:middle line:84%
and I've heard it
consistently from people

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:07.270 align:middle line:84%
who took their own
lives and asking them.

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:09.660 align:middle line:84%
So how do we tell
people not to do that?

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And they have all said some
version of learn to meditate.

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Meditation allows you
to get outside yourself

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:20.760 align:middle line:84%
and not care so
much about ending.

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The great
entertainer Prince.

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.630 align:middle line:90%
You dealt with him.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:28.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: And Prince showed up,
right after he had passed away.

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:29.790 align:middle line:90%
The Purple One.

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:32.640 align:middle line:90%
And, listen, part of one of my--

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:35.820 align:middle line:84%
weird part of my career has been
a music critic at "Variety."

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:36.780 align:middle line:90%
So I got to meet him.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:37.860 align:middle line:90%
I got to be backstage.

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And he was a certain
type of great--

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great talent.

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Unbelievable.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:43.360 align:middle line:90%
Just so talented.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.162 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Electrifying.

00:24:45.162 --> 00:24:46.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: And so
it was startling.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.170 align:middle line:84%
Because after he had
passed, he showed up.

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:51.390 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't that big of a fan.

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he
OD'd, if I remember.

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:53.690 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:55.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: And
here's how he put it.

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:58.950 align:middle line:84%
There's versions of how
people do themselves in.

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:00.420 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's through smoking.

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's through
excessive-- driving

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:03.780 align:middle line:90%
too fast when you're drinking.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:10.420 align:middle line:84%
In his case, he said, quote,
"Jumping off pianos killed me."

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.340 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what do you mean?

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I loved to
jump off pianos in my show.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.880 align:middle line:90%
That hurt my ankles.

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And that eventually
hurt my hips.

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And I had to take
pain medication

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:23.940 align:middle line:90%
to alleviate that pain.

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And that eventually got
him addicted to opioids.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what did
him in, not so much

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.850 align:middle line:90%
that he wanted to check out.

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:34.680 align:middle line:84%
But I did ask him
this question-- was

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.182 align:middle line:90%
this one of your exit ramps?

00:25:36.182 --> 00:25:37.890 align:middle line:84%
It's a question that
you can ask when you

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:38.750 align:middle line:90%
have conversations with people.

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:41.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: And people
do say that when you're

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:44.980 align:middle line:84%
planning your life, you may
have points where you're like,

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.920 align:middle line:90%
OK, I've done all I need to do.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.130 align:middle line:84%
It's time to go back and
plan for the next one.

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:52.470 align:middle line:84%
He talked about a
previous lifetime

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:55.500 align:middle line:84%
where he was not given a voice,
where everything he tried

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.780 align:middle line:84%
to do in his life to
his previous lifetime--

00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.740 align:middle line:84%
he wasn't able to
express himself.

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And so this was like a gift
for him to express himself.

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.720 align:middle line:84%
I've got a book I'm
working on now about music

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:07.710 align:middle line:90%
in the afterlife.

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And he's prominently
featured in it.

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:15.960 align:middle line:84%
Because he's somebody who talks
about modulating frequency

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.270 align:middle line:84%
or accessing people
on the other side

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:22.180 align:middle line:84%
by retuning your filters
around the frequencies

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:24.900 align:middle line:84%
so that you can
access loved ones.

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:26.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One of your favorites--

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.780 align:middle line:90%
Amelia Earhart.

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.010 align:middle line:90%
Where is she?

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:31.350 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Amelia showed up on
our podcast about a month ago.

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that
was so fascinating

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:42.810 align:middle line:84%
for me and for Jennifer is
that Jennifer started off

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:45.570 align:middle line:84%
the podcast by saying
there's someone here

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:48.330 align:middle line:90%
who says he's a movie producer.

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:50.652 align:middle line:84%
I might be able to know
him, but I had no idea.

00:26:50.652 --> 00:26:52.110 align:middle line:84%
I said, do you know
his first name?

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:53.490 align:middle line:90%
She's like, I can't get it.

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:54.797 align:middle line:90%
I don't know who this is.

00:26:54.797 --> 00:26:56.130 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, let's ask him.

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:57.180 align:middle line:90%
Who brought you here?

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.290 align:middle line:90%
He said Amelia Earhart.

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And I immediately went to my
vast trove of Amelia lore.

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:06.590 align:middle line:90%
And I said, wait a second.

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:08.420 align:middle line:90%
Is your first name Carl?

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:09.890 align:middle line:90%
And he said yes.

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:13.850 align:middle line:84%
Carl Laemmle who
passed away in 1939,

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:16.460 align:middle line:84%
who was responsible
for Universal Pictures,

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:20.060 align:middle line:84%
had gone to Amelia Earhart
and offered her a picture deal

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:21.330 align:middle line:90%
where she would play herself.

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:22.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:23.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: And he hired
her to write a screenplay.

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:24.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I didn't know that.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Nobody does.

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:28.073 align:middle line:84%
And she wrote a screenplay
with Mary Pickford.

00:27:28.073 --> 00:27:29.990 align:middle line:84%
Her husband talks about
it in one of the books

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:31.310 align:middle line:90%
he wrote after her passing--

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:32.315 align:middle line:90%
after her disappearance.

00:27:32.315 --> 00:27:32.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:33.858 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Disappearance.

00:27:33.858 --> 00:27:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: She didn't
pass until 1944.

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:40.310 align:middle line:84%
But the point of
the story is Amelia

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:42.713 align:middle line:90%
was there saying to Carl.

00:27:42.713 --> 00:27:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And Jennifer was
picking up on it.

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:47.748 align:middle line:84%
Amelia was like, I told
you they wouldn't get it.

00:27:47.748 --> 00:27:49.790 align:middle line:84%
I told you this would be
harder than you thought.

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:50.750 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't.

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:52.170 align:middle line:90%
Because we got it like that.

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And I asked Carl, so what
do you do over there?

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:56.720 align:middle line:90%
And he said, you have no idea.

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.420 align:middle line:84%
We create the most
amazing adventures.

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:01.370 align:middle line:84%
We have all these
fantastic things,

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:03.260 align:middle line:84%
because everything is
a mental construct.

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:04.460 align:middle line:90%
You can have movies.

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:07.370 align:middle line:84%
You can have anything that
you can possibly imagine.

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:10.940 align:middle line:84%
He said when we get bored
with doing that, that's

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:12.980 align:middle line:90%
when we decide to come back.

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when you said
she passed in 1944, how?

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:21.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: She died of
dysentery, according to Amelia.

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:23.390 align:middle line:84%
As you know, I've
been to Saipan.

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Her plane crashed.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well,
she didn't crash.

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:27.620 align:middle line:90%
In a nutshell--

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:27.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:29.535 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: --I've
been researching this

00:28:29.535 --> 00:28:31.400 align:middle line:90%
for, as you know, a long time.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.020 align:middle line:90%
She landed her plane.

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:35.480 align:middle line:84%
She was trying to
get to Holland.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.980 align:middle line:90%
She took a turn.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.913 align:middle line:84%
The plan B was to go
to Gardner Island.

00:28:39.913 --> 00:28:42.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She had somebody
with her, too, didn't she?

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: That's right.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.120 align:middle line:90%
Fred Noonan was her navigator.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.700 align:middle line:90%
She missed Gardner.

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:50.600 align:middle line:84%
Because she was 200 miles
northwest of Holland

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.750 align:middle line:84%
when she realized she
was running out of fuel.

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:54.140 align:middle line:90%
But she didn't run out of fuel.

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:55.790 align:middle line:90%
She landed the plane in Mili.

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Eyewitnesses who saw
her land the plane.

00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Pieces of the plane
found on Mili Atoll

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:05.000 align:middle line:84%
that have been verified
by an NTSB investigator.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.990 align:middle line:84%
She was picked up
by the Japanese.

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:10.320 align:middle line:84%
She was taken to the military
headquarters of Japan,

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.290 align:middle line:90%
which was in Saipan.

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:14.570 align:middle line:90%
And she was imprisoned there.

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:19.335 align:middle line:84%
Fred apparently was executed
for being a spy because they

00:29:19.335 --> 00:29:20.135 align:middle line:90%
were on a mission--

00:29:20.135 --> 00:29:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: --for Roosevelt--

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:21.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were.

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:21.530 align:middle line:90%
They were on a mission.

00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:23.988 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: --to find out whether
the Japanese were building

00:29:23.988 --> 00:29:26.480 align:middle line:90%
naval facilities and they were.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.710 align:middle line:90%
She was allowed to live.

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:29.480 align:middle line:90%
She lived for seven years.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.070 align:middle line:90%
I interviewed at least 15.

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:32.450 align:middle line:90%
There's over 200 islanders.

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:33.920 align:middle line:84%
But I've interviewed
15 islanders

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.345 align:middle line:84%
on camera, who either
their parents saw

00:29:36.345 --> 00:29:40.910 align:middle line:84%
her or they themselves saw her
while she was living there.

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And then I interviewed
a dozen GIs, US Marines.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.480 align:middle line:84%
They aren't prone to
making up stories.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.060 align:middle line:84%
They all said the same
story of finding her plane,

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:52.477 align:middle line:84%
finding her briefcase,
finding her passport--

00:29:52.477 --> 00:29:53.810 align:middle line:90%

destroying the plane.

Yes-- and finding her.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.380 align:middle line:90%
And so there were two GIs--

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:03.980 align:middle line:84%
a guy named Henson and Burks--
they dug her up in 1963.

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:05.870 align:middle line:84%
The way they told the
story of Fred Goerner

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:07.790 align:middle line:84%
was that they were
sent out in the jungle.

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And they said, what are we doing
out here, digging up bodies?

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And the CO said, did you
ever hear of Amelia Earhart?

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:15.710 align:middle line:90%
Don't ask any questions.

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's where
Jennifer Shaffer comes in.

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:22.400 align:middle line:84%
When she told me that she was
looking for missing persons,

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.480 align:middle line:90%
I interviewed her.

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And we got to the end of
the interview with Amelia.

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And she said, by the way,
the two GIs who dug me

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:32.568 align:middle line:90%
up-- they only found an arm.

00:30:32.568 --> 00:30:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Jennifer could never
have known that.

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:34.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:35.743 align:middle line:90%

00:30:35.743 --> 00:30:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Only you knew that.

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:38.452 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: But what's
interesting is,

00:30:38.452 --> 00:30:41.430 align:middle line:84%
George, when I had left
her office, the phone rang.

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:44.070 align:middle line:84%
It was the NTSB
investigator from Seattle,

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:48.210 align:middle line:84%
saying I just went over all
of these incredible details

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:49.260 align:middle line:90%
about her life.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And everything you've
told me is accurate.

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:55.660 align:middle line:84%
But when they dug up her
body, they only found her arm.

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:57.780 align:middle line:84%
This is literally 10
minutes after Amelia

00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:59.070 align:middle line:90%
had told me the same thing.

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And then six months
later, I found it

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:04.260 align:middle line:90%
in a UPI news report, 1977.

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has it
been verified since?

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, Henson and
Burks said in this UPI thing

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:11.940 align:middle line:84%
that they dug up a partial
rib cage and her arm.

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:16.230 align:middle line:84%
So I found the evidence of them
saying that's what they found.

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, what did they
do with her arm?

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:20.170 align:middle line:90%
They turned it over.

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:23.040 align:middle line:84%
Did it get destroyed in
the Battle of Okinawa?

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:23.910 align:middle line:90%
It's possible.

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Did it get sent to the CIA
headquarters and sits in a box?

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:28.110 align:middle line:90%
It's possible.

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:32.040 align:middle line:84%
The truth is Amelia's
body was moved

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.740 align:middle line:90%
by the nuns who buried her.

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And Jennifer showed me
where she was reburied.

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's where it gets mind
bending, because I had just

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:42.630 align:middle line:90%
come back from Saipan.

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:46.530 align:middle line:84%
She drew a map of Saipan-- a
place she's never heard of--

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:49.320 align:middle line:84%
and drew the
location I had been.

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And she said that's
where her bones are.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.120 align:middle line:84%
So I'm ready to go
back and dig her up.

went over to the table

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:30.210 align:middle line:10%
and very politely shook his
hand, signed an autograph,

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:31.570 align:middle line:10%
kissed a couple of the girls.

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:17.980 align:middle line:90%
and such a good friend.

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:21.593 align:middle line:84%
His comic idea was anyone
can do a talk show.

00:33:21.593 --> 00:33:23.010 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to

And Merv will just
act like he's a guest.

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And in this segment, Merv
does this thing of like,

I'm only used to sitting
next to superstars.

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I told the story
that I had prepared.

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:42.690 align:middle line:84%
Because I had seen Merv
at a local restaurant

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:43.660 align:middle line:90%
signing autographs.

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:44.770 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't say his name.

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And I said there was
this megastar who was

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:48.450 align:middle line:90%
super friendly and super nice.

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:50.160 align:middle line:90%
You know who that was, Merv?

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.630 align:middle line:90%
And he was like, no.

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:53.340 align:middle line:90%
And I said it was you.

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And then he remembered
that moment.

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:57.390 align:middle line:84%

turning the tables

00:33:57.390 --> 00:33:59.797 align:middle line:90%

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:05.360 align:middle line:84%
I was one of the

>>NOORY: Oh, you were?

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:07.612 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:07.612 --> 00:34:10.949 align:middle line:84%
And I saw James Van
Praagh on "Larry King."

00:34:10.949 --> 00:34:13.320 align:middle line:90%
And I said let's bring on James.

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.780 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if he could talk
to our mutual friend, Chuck's

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:18.250 align:middle line:84%
and my friend, Luana
Anders, who had passed away.

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:21.505 align:middle line:84%
And so he came on, and that
segment is in the movie.

00:34:21.505 --> 00:34:22.380 align:middle line:90%
We're live on camera.

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:23.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How'd he do?

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:26.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: And that's the
moment I realized that she still

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:27.360 align:middle line:90%
existed.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:30.179 align:middle line:84%
Because James Van
Praagh said there's

00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:32.040 align:middle line:84%
a photograph on
your refrigerator

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:34.090 align:middle line:84%
that's the essence
of your relationship.

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:36.330 align:middle line:84%
He also talked about my
martini glass collection.

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:39.510 align:middle line:84%
But he said that photograph
is what she's showing me.

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And, George, only
once in my life have I

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:44.909 align:middle line:84%
ever put up a photograph
and said aloud, oh,

00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:46.900 align:middle line:84%
look, the essence
of our relationship.

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:50.550 align:middle line:84%
It was me and her in Italy
eating cookies and laughing.

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:54.570 align:middle line:84%
When he said that, I knew beyond
a shadow of any doubt for me,

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:57.365 align:middle line:84%
not for anybody else
that she still existed.

00:34:57.365 --> 00:35:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's led us to
this moment today.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:03.150 align:middle line:84%
Then I talked to
Chuck two days ago.

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:06.540 align:middle line:84%
Again, my friend who's on the
flipside, who came through

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:10.290 align:middle line:84%
to Jennifer, who wanted to
converse with me, who wanted

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:13.845 align:middle line:84%
to tell me to lose a little
bit of weight, which is always

00:35:13.845 --> 00:35:15.720 align:middle line:84%
the thing that he should
be telling me to do,

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.980 align:middle line:90%
whatever thing.

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:18.780 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, part of our podcast.

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And I, of course,
still love the guy.

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:23.520 align:middle line:84%
But it allows us to
realize our loved

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.490 align:middle line:90%
ones haven't gone anywhere.

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:28.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Absolutely
on the flipside.

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.240 align:middle line:84%
What's next after
the "Flipside?"

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:34.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: After this,
I've got a book coming out.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:35.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be finishing up.

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:37.358 align:middle line:90%
And it's about musicians.

00:35:37.358 --> 00:35:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And I've just focused,
because the last one

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:40.380 align:middle line:84%
was about architecture,

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:41.963 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Musicians
who have passed on?

00:35:41.963 --> 00:35:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Musicians who passed
on, but also asking them,

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:46.620 align:middle line:90%
are they still creating music?

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:48.070 align:middle line:90%
And what's it like over there?

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And for example, Jimi Hendrix,
the greatest guitarist

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.950 align:middle line:90%
of all time--

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:55.860 align:middle line:84%
he shows up quite a
bit in our research.

00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:57.300 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not really sure why.

00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:00.450 align:middle line:84%
But where people will
say, I'll ask them.

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:02.670 align:middle line:84%
So who was there to greet
you when you crossed over?

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:05.040 align:middle line:90%
And they'll say Jimi Hendrix.

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.780 align:middle line:90%
And I'm thinking, why?

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
that he loves to play

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:14.035 align:middle line:84%
this role of somebody who helps
somebody onto the flipside.

00:36:14.035 --> 00:36:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Because
recognize him instantly.

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:17.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:17.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: They know who he is.

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:18.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of the world's
greatest guitarists.

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: And they're
like, this can't be a dream.

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:23.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm actually on stage with Jimi.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.920 align:middle line:90%
And that's their way of--

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:29.940 align:middle line:84%
anyway, so it's a lot of
different musicians combined.

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
get people convinced

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:34.500 align:middle line:90%
that there's an afterlife?

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: I think it's a
reflexive experience, which

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:41.520 align:middle line:84%
is if you haven't had
the experience skydiving,

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.930 align:middle line:84%
then you can talk about
it as much as you want.

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:46.020 align:middle line:84%
But unless you jump
out of a plane,

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:49.330 align:middle line:84%
that's when you know that
you've experienced it.

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:52.710 align:middle line:84%
When a loved one comes
to you, and shows you,

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:58.330 align:middle line:84%
or demonstrates to you that they
still exist, then you know it.

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:01.590 align:middle line:84%
But it's very hard to convince
somebody whose filters are

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:04.170 align:middle line:90%
very thick and up.

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:06.720 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, the human
brain has these filters.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.860 align:middle line:90%
We all have them.

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:09.220 align:middle line:90%
Some children don't.

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.850 align:middle line:84%
Some people just prior
to passing lose them.

00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:13.980 align:middle line:90%
Mediums don't seem to have them.

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:17.430 align:middle line:84%
But you can bypass them with
hypnotherapy, meditation,

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:18.780 align:middle line:90%
or mediumship.

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:21.190 align:middle line:90%
Anyone can do the same.

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:23.063 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
worth exploring.

00:37:23.063 --> 00:37:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're one of the
best when it comes to it.

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:27.945 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever been in a
contest to prove the afterlife?

00:37:27.945 --> 00:37:28.990 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:30.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: There is one.

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:33.020 align:middle line:84%
Some guy in Vegas put
up a million dollars.

00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:35.767 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be taking my private
jet home after the show.

00:37:35.767 --> 00:37:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it over?

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: No, it's over,
but I don't know who's won.

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:40.530 align:middle line:90%
But I got to tell you.

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did anybody win?

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Somebody
will, let's say.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:46.680 align:middle line:84%
But what I did was I
focused on Ian Stevenson.

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.570 align:middle line:84%
The professor at
University of Virginia

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:50.980 align:middle line:84%
left behind a
combination lock test.

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:51.780 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to reveal
what I learned on camera so

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:57.390 align:middle line:84%
that your viewers
can do it themselves.

00:37:57.390 --> 00:38:02.220 align:middle line:84%
My theory is that I can access
Ian Stevenson through Jennifer

00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:05.217 align:middle line:84%
Shaffer or any medium
without saying his last name,

00:38:05.217 --> 00:38:07.550 align:middle line:84%
without her knowing anything
about the combination lock.

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:08.592 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He just pops up.

00:38:08.592 --> 00:38:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: And I said,
I want to talk to Ian.

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And I want to ask him a
question about a puzzle.

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And there's a puzzle that
he's aware of that he

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:18.200 align:middle line:90%
knows the answer to.

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:19.200 align:middle line:90%
And I want him to show--

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:19.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And nobody else--

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:20.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: --it to you.

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:21.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --knows that answer.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.083 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: That's correct.

00:38:22.083 --> 00:38:24.645 align:middle line:84%
And so Jennifer said,
I'm seeing Einstein.

00:38:24.645 --> 00:38:25.860 align:middle line:90%
And I said OK.

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:27.870 align:middle line:90%
Is the name Einstein the answer?

00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:29.580 align:middle line:90%
Has to be six letters.

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:34.390 align:middle line:84%
She said, no, he's showing
me E equals MC squared.

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:35.190 align:middle line:90%
And I said--

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bingo.

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: --so E equals
mass times constant,

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.440 align:middle line:90%
times constant squared.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Times the
speed of light.

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:43.307 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: There's the six.

00:38:43.307 --> 00:38:45.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, the speed of light,
maybe that's what it is.

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:46.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what it is.

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:47.717 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: But those
are the six things.

00:38:47.717 --> 00:38:50.520 align:middle line:10%
But the answer is--

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.260 align:middle line:10%
and he said it's spelled out.

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:54.975 align:middle line:10%
It's that equation spelled out.

00:38:54.975 --> 00:38:57.270 align:middle line:10%
And so anybody-- like you
just said it differently

00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:58.650 align:middle line:10%
than I would have said it.

00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:01.400 align:middle line:10%
So whoever can
figure out what the--

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:04.380 align:middle line:10%
because it's on the
Wikipedia page, the method

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:06.900 align:middle line:10%
that he used for
the mathematics.

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:10.300 align:middle line:90%
So E is number 4 and et cetera.

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:11.500 align:middle line:90%
You can figure it out.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:13.230 align:middle line:84%
So anybody can learn
how to do this.

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:15.600 align:middle line:84%
I reached out to
the guys at UVA.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.780 align:middle line:84%
I had them try E
equals MC squared.

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:20.610 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work.

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:24.400 align:middle line:84%
But that didn't stop me from
talking to Ian, you see?

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: So if somebody else
can figure out what that means,

00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:30.690 align:middle line:90%
E equals MC squared spelled out.

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:31.860 align:middle line:90%
And maybe you're correct.

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:33.660 align:middle line:84%
Instead of saying
a constant, it's--

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:35.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mass equals--

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:36.902 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Mass
equals-- no, wait.

00:39:36.902 --> 00:39:37.702 align:middle line:90%
Energy.

00:39:37.702 --> 00:39:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: E is energy,
equals mass times

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:41.400 align:middle line:90%
the speed of light squared.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Speed
of light squared.

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:42.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Squared.

00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: I had said
constant, because it's MC.

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:46.200 align:middle line:90%
But you may be right.

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.810 align:middle line:84%
He might have-- it's
whatever Ian used.

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:51.360 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just saying get
a medium, find a medium,

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:52.230 align:middle line:90%
ask them the same.

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:55.810 align:middle line:90%
Ask Ian the same question.

00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And if you see a
visual of Einstein,

00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:00.900 align:middle line:84%
then you'll know he's
talking about the same thing.

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:02.500 align:middle line:90%
We can all do that.

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:03.870 align:middle line:90%
And I think we all should.

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Richard, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: George, thank
you so much for being here.

00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:09.722 align:middle line:84%
And I appreciate you,
appreciate your show.

00:40:09.722 --> 00:40:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I love the work you
do-- hacking the afterlife.

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:15.630 align:middle line:10%
One day, we may be hacking you.

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
