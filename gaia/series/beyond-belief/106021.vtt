00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:08.029 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And I
think many people today don't

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.237 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:09.237 --> 00:00:10.865 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:13.260 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.530 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.380 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:28.859 align:middle line:90%


00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.260 align:middle line:10%
As we talk this time
about something celestial.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.250 align:middle line:10%
It was the late
astronomer Carlos Ferrada,

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.290 align:middle line:10%
who talked about Planet
X, that was followed up

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.200 align:middle line:10%
by the late Zecharia
Sitchin, who wrote the "Earth

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.530 align:middle line:10%
Chronicles" series, talking
about this extra planet

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.130 align:middle line:10%
in our solar system and
now Marshall Masters.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Marshall has been a guest of
mine on "Coast to Coast AM,"

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.930 align:middle line:84%
and he's here now
on "Beyond Belief."

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.349 align:middle line:84%
Marshall, welcome
to the program.

00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL MASTERS: It's a
pleasure to be here, George.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.806 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm so used to
talking to you on the phone.

00:01:00.806 --> 00:01:02.150 align:middle line:90%
It's great to see you in person.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Yes, it is.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.260 align:middle line:90%
It's dynamic.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:04.885 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:01:04.885 --> 00:01:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little bit about
Ferrada, the astronomer.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.300 align:middle line:84%
How did he find a
so-called extra planet?

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.410 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: Well,
Ferrada actually-- this

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.220 align:middle line:10%
is in the Latino community, and
there they call it Hercolubus.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.030 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of different
names for Planet X. He predicted

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.430 align:middle line:10%
a massive earthquake
in Chile and was

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.080 align:middle line:10%
on literally within minutes
of the actual event.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.270 align:middle line:10%
This man was just
a brilliant fellow.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.140 align:middle line:10%
He was a great astronomer,
and he did the math.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.850 align:middle line:84%
He was looking at
celestial bodies,

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.650 align:middle line:84%
and he just said there is
a dark planet out there.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And he actually said
it had a dark star--

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: --and a planet.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now he was
basing this on what?

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.850 align:middle line:90%
Mechanics?

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:46.350 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.220 align:middle line:90%
Celestial mechanics?

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.110 align:middle line:90%
Just mathematics?

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.825 align:middle line:90%
What was he using?

00:01:50.825 --> 00:01:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: He had an Edgar Cayce
style of doing mathematics.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.975 align:middle line:90%
He could tap in--

00:01:55.975 --> 00:01:56.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Trance-like.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Yes.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And so it was very powerful, and
this man-- his work is spot on.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.110 align:middle line:84%
To me, I watch
the videos of him,

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.419 align:middle line:84%
and my heart goes out
to him because when

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.270 align:middle line:84%
he's talking about
what's coming,

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.790 align:middle line:90%
I see the pain in his face.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:14.850 align:middle line:90%
I know that pain.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.330 align:middle line:84%
Everyone on my team
sees it, and sometimes

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.400 align:middle line:84%
when we were analyzing and
writing about him in our book,

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.690 align:middle line:84%
"Being in it for the
Species," we cried.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.300 align:middle line:90%
We just felt his pain.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you have been
researching this how long now?

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.395 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Well, I started
in '99 with yowusa.com.

00:02:31.395 --> 00:02:35.470 align:middle line:84%
My first article
was in January 2001,

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.110 align:middle line:84%
and Brian Marsden of the
Smithsonian Astrophysics lab

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.690 align:middle line:84%
actually helped me
to write that article

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.550 align:middle line:84%
and just been doing
it ever since.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
absolutely convinced--

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.030 align:middle line:84%
absolutely convinced that
there is an extra planet

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.230 align:middle line:90%
in our solar system?

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Absolutely.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, we're
going to get into that.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.648 align:middle line:90%
We're going to talk about it.

00:02:57.648 --> 00:02:59.770 align:middle line:90%
Has it come around before?

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Absolutely.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.860 align:middle line:84%
We just finished
calculating the orbit.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.900 align:middle line:84%
Everybody talks
about 3,600 years.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.400 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right,
what have you found?

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.620 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: Well, when
Sitchin set that number--

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.960 align:middle line:10%
and he was the one who
set the number-- that was

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.440 align:middle line:10%
in lunar calendar, all right?

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.120 align:middle line:90%
We're in a solar calendar.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.920 align:middle line:84%
So in a solar calendar,
it's actually 3,548 years.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pretty close, though.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Well here's where
it really gets interesting.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.780 align:middle line:84%
If you look at what the Mayans
were doing with December 21,

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.310 align:middle line:84%
2012-- and here I gotta eat
crow, because before that,

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.650 align:middle line:84%
when I was right interviewing
with you before and I said,

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.040 align:middle line:90%
nah, there's no connection--

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No tie in.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:40.703 align:middle line:90%
Not going to happen.

00:03:40.703 --> 00:03:42.210 align:middle line:90%
You changed your mind, huh?

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Boy, have I.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.128 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: That's exactly what
the Mayans were looking for.

00:03:46.128 --> 00:03:48.130 align:middle line:90%
Think about before 2012.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.390 align:middle line:90%
What did we really have?

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.395 align:middle line:90%
Speculation.

00:03:50.395 --> 00:03:51.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Speculation.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: That was it.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.980 align:middle line:84%
What the Mayans were looking
for was a harbinger alignment.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.530 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.840 align:middle line:90%
Not some sort of biblical event.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.770 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to
tell their descendants,

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.000 align:middle line:84%
when you see this alignment, the
Planet X system is coming back,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.780 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to enter
into a catastrophic phase.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.600 align:middle line:84%
When we look at
the empirical data

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.440 align:middle line:84%
that we have been gathering,
and we do this daily.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.230 align:middle line:90%
My team is a wonderful team.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.060 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't do what I
do without them--

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:29.120 align:middle line:84%
and take December
21, 2012 as a marker,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.150 align:middle line:84%
you go forward of that, and what
you see-- and we were showing

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.360 align:middle line:90%
in our recent article on this.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.330 align:middle line:84%
Two data sets-- one is
meteors and the other one is

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.719 align:middle line:84%
earthquakes and with both
of them, if this is 2012--

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a
correlation here, isn't there?

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Yes.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.130 align:middle line:90%
Here's 2012, December 21.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.467 align:middle line:84%
Here is your trends and
then right after that--

00:04:53.467 --> 00:04:54.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Skyrockets.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Skyrockets.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of different trends.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, the reason why we're
looking at earthquakes

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.700 align:middle line:84%
and meteors is that earthquakes
really are in response

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.140 align:middle line:90%
to our sun brightening.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.730 align:middle line:84%
What's happening with
our sun right now?

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.305 align:middle line:90%
Ed Dames talks about something--

00:05:13.305 --> 00:05:14.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The remote viewer?

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: The remote viewer.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about something
called "the kill shot."

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:20.639 align:middle line:10%
He did a video--

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.430 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And he hasn't
backed down on that.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.513 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: Absolutely not.

00:05:23.513 --> 00:05:25.480 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: He has said
my dates are off,

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.440 align:middle line:10%
but he hasn't backed down on it.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Well when you're
projecting the future,

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.310 align:middle line:84%
it's like looking at it
through a garden hose.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: But he had
a video he did in 2004,

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.190 align:middle line:84%
and I had a copy of
that, and I've always

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.210 align:middle line:90%
kept it over the years.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.650 align:middle line:84%
I watched it in 2004 and didn't
give another thought to it.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.090 align:middle line:90%
I put it on a couple weeks ago.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.540 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god, George.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.230 align:middle line:84%
If you're talking about painting
in a broad brush, he nailed it.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.600 align:middle line:84%
What he talks about
with his kill shot

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.370 align:middle line:84%
is that this planet
is going to come

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.739 align:middle line:84%
between Earth and the sun--
the days of darkness prophesied

00:06:05.739 --> 00:06:06.280 align:middle line:90%
in the Bible.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.529 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this is a big
planet, Marshall, isn't it?

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:09.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Very big.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.270 align:middle line:90%
Several times--

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jupiter sized?

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: No, it's about four
to five times the size of Earth

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.280 align:middle line:84%
depending on who's
the estimate is.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.979 align:middle line:84%
Sitchin, I believe,
said four times.

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, still
pretty big size.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Yeah,
it makes a mark.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sitchin
got his information

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.466 align:middle line:84%
from investigating
Sumerian cuneiform, right?

00:06:29.466 --> 00:06:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Yes.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about
that a little bit,

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.543 align:middle line:84%
for people who aren't
familiar with Sitchin.

00:06:33.543 --> 00:06:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Well,
Zecharia Sitichin--

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.930 align:middle line:84%
The book I would tell
everyone to read first

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.041 align:middle line:90%
is "The Lost Book of Enki."

00:06:41.041 --> 00:06:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is one of
his later books, right?

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.045 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: That's right, but
it's an autobiography of Lord

00:06:46.045 --> 00:06:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Enki, who's the guy
that we as a species--

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.624 align:middle line:84%
we came from his loins,
and if you read--

00:06:52.624 --> 00:06:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Annunaki.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: The Annunaki,
and they were from Nibiru.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.836 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the planets
in the Planet X system.

00:06:58.836 --> 00:07:00.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, there's
a Planet X system?

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: We call
it a system now.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.950 align:middle line:84%
The system is we
have Nemesis, which

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:10.450 align:middle line:84%
is the companion to our
sun, and it's a brown dwarf.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:13.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, they used to be called
dark stars or black stars

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.570 align:middle line:84%
because they're very
difficult to see.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:18.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So when people say
that our sun is a binary star

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.899 align:middle line:90%
system, that's this other star.

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Nemesis.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's just burned.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.439 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: That's
right, and Nemesis

00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:31.240 align:middle line:84%
is what it was called
by guys like Carl Sagan.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.210 align:middle line:84%
There was a big-- I remember
when I was in high school

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:37.182 align:middle line:84%
as a kid-- wow,
that's going back.

00:07:37.182 --> 00:07:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they have
high schools then?

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Oh, yeah.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.080 align:middle line:90%
Underneath the olive branch.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not log
cabin schools, right?

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Yeah, that's right.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:46.690 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And I remember there
was a wonderful flowing

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:56.230 align:middle line:84%
debate about us being
in a binary system,

00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:02.840 align:middle line:84%
and the newspaper
coverage was brilliant.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:09.420 align:middle line:10%
What happened was in
early '90s, a gentleman

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.440 align:middle line:10%
by the name of Robert
Harrington-- he

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.510 align:middle line:10%
was an astronomer
for the US Naval

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.100 align:middle line:10%
Observatory in Washington.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.010 align:middle line:10%
He was the chief astronomer.

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:24.780 align:middle line:84%
He wrote a brilliant paper
on the location of Planet X.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.120 align:middle line:84%
Not only did he do
that, he backed it

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.830 align:middle line:84%
up by having a telescope,
specially constructed, sent

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:35.075 align:middle line:84%
to an observatory owned by
our government in New Zealand,

00:08:35.075 --> 00:08:37.199 align:middle line:84%
because at that time, it
was in the southern skies.

00:08:37.199 --> 00:08:38.782 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just to
look for this planet?

00:08:38.782 --> 00:08:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Yes.

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was
all of the image plates

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.510 align:middle line:84%
that came off that telescope
were sent to NASA disappeared.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:48.320 align:middle line:90%
Never seen again.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: And shortly
after that he died a very

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.440 align:middle line:84%
mysterious death, and
many of us in the field,

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.470 align:middle line:84%
including his wife, feel
that he was assassinated.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And what caused
that, I believe was

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:06.690 align:middle line:84%
that he gave Zecharia Sitchin
an interview on a television

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.970 align:middle line:84%
documentary, and he has a
picture of him pointing,

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:12.310 align:middle line:90%
this is the orbit of Planet X.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And did it echo
what you've been working on

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.272 align:middle line:84%
and what Sitchin
had been working on?

00:09:17.272 --> 00:09:18.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Harrington--

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So this is
an elliptical orbit?

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Yes, it's a long
period elliptical orbit.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.790 align:middle line:84%
It's inclined to-- here's the
plane of our solar system,

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:33.130 align:middle line:84%
and it's inclined, and it goes
up and down in 3,600 lunar--

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As opposed to around.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: That's right.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.150 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't go around like we do.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:39.800 align:middle line:84%
So it comes up and
down like a comet.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.730 align:middle line:84%
It's a comet like orbit, and
it's very long-- 3,600 lunar

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:48.240 align:middle line:90%
years or 3,548 solar years.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Still close.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Well, close enough
that when you backtrack it

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:58.210 align:middle line:84%
from December 21, 2012, it lands
you right on the exodus, which

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:00.880 align:middle line:90%
was the last flyby.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, so the last
flyby would be what year?

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.100 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: That is going back
to-- that's in the article.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.610 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes the numbers--
it's on the site.

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:14.280 align:middle line:90%
Just please check it out.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When will
this planet come back?

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: It's here.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.249 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
already in the area.

00:10:19.249 --> 00:10:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Oh, yes.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.289 align:middle line:90%
Right now it's in conjunction.

00:10:21.289 --> 00:10:23.410 align:middle line:90%
It is behind the sun.

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:24.240 align:middle line:90%
It's coming up.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:29.000 align:middle line:84%
It came up in the direction
towards the sun's, say,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.040 align:middle line:90%
7:30 position.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, when it comes
out from behind,

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:37.010 align:middle line:84%
it'll be around
the 1:30 position.

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will we be
able to see it then?

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Yeah and when we see
it, if you're not prepared--

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:44.960 align:middle line:84%
frankly, when we
do see it, people

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.205 align:middle line:84%
are going to be standing
out in the street.

00:10:46.205 --> 00:10:47.940 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be
pointing up at the sky.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You'll be able
to see it like that.

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:49.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Oh, yeah.

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:50.828 align:middle line:90%
You're going to see it.

00:10:50.828 --> 00:10:53.259 align:middle line:90%
It's a "Melancholia" scenario.

00:10:53.259 --> 00:10:55.300 align:middle line:84%
It's just going to keep
getting bigger and bigger

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.610 align:middle line:84%
because this thing is going to
come around from behind the sun

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:03.340 align:middle line:84%
and cross over our orbit
above us and ahead of us.

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And there's a gentleman, Bob
Dean, the government whistle

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:08.890 align:middle line:90%
blower.

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:09.723 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I know him.

00:11:09.723 --> 00:11:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: He's
one of my heroes.

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:12.730 align:middle line:90%
I just love this guy.

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:13.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good guy.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:18.350 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: And I think in
2008 on Project Camelot

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:19.910 align:middle line:10%
he made a prediction.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:23.880 align:middle line:10%
He said, according
to my sources,

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:28.020 align:middle line:10%
we are going to be on the same
side of the sun as the Planet X

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.790 align:middle line:10%
system when it goes
into its aphelion leg.

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.350 align:middle line:84%
That's when it's
going back south,

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:37.640 align:middle line:84%
and that is what it's
really going to be jamming.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And jamming
meaning doing things to us?

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Fast.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.340 align:middle line:84%
To the sun, to us--
first off, let me just

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.400 align:middle line:90%
explain the Planet X system.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Nemesis is the dark star,
and it hasn't been visible

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.790 align:middle line:84%
for a very long time
to the naked eye

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:58.310 align:middle line:84%
because it's shrouded
in iron oxide dust.

00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:59.580 align:middle line:90%
This is from its creation.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And where would that
be now, that binary star?

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: That binary
star is beyond the orbit

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.764 align:middle line:90%
of Jupiter behind our sun.

00:12:07.764 --> 00:12:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's
why we can't see it.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: We can't see it.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Now interestingly enough,
there are three planets

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:18.390 align:middle line:84%
that we talk about in our
book-- there could be more,

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:21.170 align:middle line:84%
but we're only talking
about the major bodies that

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:23.550 align:middle line:84%
are going to present
a problem for Earth

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.970 align:middle line:84%
and be involved in
the pole shift event.

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, these planets are--
the innermost one is Helion.

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Helion.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Helion is
gaseous bright planet

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:36.460 align:middle line:90%
that's uninhabited.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.689 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
traveling with Nibiru--

00:12:38.689 --> 00:12:39.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Nemesis.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --or whatever
we're going to call it.

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Well, Nibiru
is the third planet out.

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the one
where the Annunaki apparently

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:44.360 align:middle line:90%
came from?

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: That's right.

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:52.300 align:middle line:10%
There's Nemesis, the star,
Helion, Arboda, Nibiru.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.130 align:middle line:10%
Helion has a moon, which
we named Harrington

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:57.500 align:middle line:10%
in the name of this astronomer.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:02.700 align:middle line:10%
And we have a moon for Nibiru,
which we named Ferrada for--

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.697 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They only
have one moon each?

00:13:04.697 --> 00:13:06.530 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: That's right--
these two planets.

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.440 align:middle line:10%
Arboda does not have a moon.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.370 align:middle line:10%
Arboda is inhabited
by a slave species.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:13.370 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How do
you know all this?

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Well,
what we've been doing

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:17.520 align:middle line:84%
is over the years--
I started out

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.150 align:middle line:90%
doing this-- total geekazoid.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:21.850 align:middle line:90%
I was a Spock wannabe.

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:24.050 align:middle line:90%
Live long and prosper.

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:26.132 align:middle line:90%
Logic is tweeting bird.

00:13:26.132 --> 00:13:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The one is not
worth more than the many.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.383 align:middle line:90%
That kind of thing, right?

00:13:29.383 --> 00:13:31.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Yeah, that was me.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, this work
is transformative.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:40.150 align:middle line:84%
I was inspired when I learned
that Nobel Laureates said, when

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:41.860 align:middle line:84%
you run out of the
science, you've

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.300 align:middle line:84%
got to go somewhere
else for the answers.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And so we really developed
a channeling method

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:49.700 align:middle line:90%
that was science based.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.405 align:middle line:84%
It's team based
channeling, and so--

00:13:52.405 --> 00:13:53.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Makes sense.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: --what we
do is I started off

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.705 align:middle line:84%
working with the incredibly
talented psychics,

00:13:58.705 --> 00:14:00.980 align:middle line:84%
and these are usually
women in their '40s

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:05.240 align:middle line:84%
in very stable marriages with a
husband who is very supportive.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.440 align:middle line:90%
This is paramount.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You have to have that.

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Yes, and
then what happens

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.430 align:middle line:84%
they either work
with a set of guides,

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:19.320 align:middle line:84%
or they're just simply like
a switchboard operator.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.430 align:middle line:84%
They can pull in
anyone depending

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:25.700 align:middle line:84%
on what the question is,
and so we evolved from that.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.300 align:middle line:10%
"Being in it for the Species"--
the very first book I did

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.910 align:middle line:10%
channeling work on was
"2012 Wisdom of the Elohim,"

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:34.290 align:middle line:10%
and the commentary in the
book-- and I'll tell you now.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.960 align:middle line:84%
I've never said this publicly,
but I channeled the commentary

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.430 align:middle line:90%
in that book.

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:42.910 align:middle line:84%
The other readings were from
Rebecca Jernigan, a radio host

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:43.640 align:middle line:90%
and a psychic.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.290 align:middle line:90%
Very well known.

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And I did that basically as
an exploratory first step.

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:54.550 align:middle line:84%
It's like raise the flag, see
who salutes, see who shoots.

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And so that book
was well received.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.100 align:middle line:84%
It gave me confidence to
continue working and refining

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.330 align:middle line:90%
my skills.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:06.080 align:middle line:10%
So my current book, "Being
in it for the Species"

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.790 align:middle line:10%
is something where I worked
with a very famous psychic,

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:14.280 align:middle line:10%
and she-- Adrianna is
her name in the book,

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.920 align:middle line:10%
and we did the first
section of the book

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.097 align:middle line:10%
together with the
technical briefings.

00:15:20.097 --> 00:15:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it
important to be working

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.180 align:middle line:90%
with a psychic at this point?

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: It's important to
be working-- what Ed Dames will

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:30.930 align:middle line:84%
tell you is that our
intelligence agencies used

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.870 align:middle line:84%
both psychics and
remote viewers.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:37.130 align:middle line:84%
In the United States,
we lean heavier on RV,

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:40.230 align:middle line:84%
but in Russia they lean
heavier on psychics.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:44.920 align:middle line:84%
With psychics you have to find
the talented ones and the ones

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.240 align:middle line:84%
that are ready to do the
work, but boy, you can really

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.156 align:middle line:90%
get great information.

00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you mix what they
tell you with real science?

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Well,
what we actually

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:57.430 align:middle line:84%
do is we're using real science
to drive the conversation.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:01.750 align:middle line:84%
So for example when I'm
working with Adrianna,

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:05.520 align:middle line:84%
I had my lead researcher,
who's my science guy,

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.930 align:middle line:84%
and we're doing just a Skype
conversation, the three way,

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:10.400 align:middle line:90%
but he's muted.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
is he's continually

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:16.080 align:middle line:84%
feeding me questions
through instant message.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:20.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm the one having the
dialogue, and then that way we

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:23.110 align:middle line:84%
can set up cross
references, come back,

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:26.690 align:middle line:84%
ask the same question
two or three times.

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:28.820 align:middle line:84%
We always get
consistent results,

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:31.280 align:middle line:84%
and when we were doing
the book actually,

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.790 align:middle line:84%
we were jumping back
and forth in content

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:36.660 align:middle line:84%
where you're finding
something-- hold on a second.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:37.420 align:middle line:90%
Hold on a second.

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:38.711 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with this picture?

00:16:38.711 --> 00:16:39.211 align:middle line:90%


00:16:39.211 --> 00:16:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Let's go back,
and we would go back.

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And we did so much of that
jumping back and forth we

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.496 align:middle line:84%
totally lost track
of everything.

00:16:48.496 --> 00:16:50.370 align:middle line:84%
We were just gathering,
gathering, gathering,

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:51.705 align:middle line:90%
and we didn't know what we had.

00:16:51.705 --> 00:16:53.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Marshall,
of the three planets

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:58.130 align:middle line:84%
in the system that you claim
are coming around in here,

00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:59.260 align:middle line:90%
are they all inhabited?

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.235 align:middle line:84%
We know Nibiru was
inhabited by the Annunaki.

00:17:01.235 --> 00:17:01.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Two.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:04.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The other one you were
saying was like a slave labor?

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:05.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Arboda is a smaller--

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:06.396 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Arboda.

00:17:06.396 --> 00:17:08.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: It's the
smallest inhabited planet,

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.810 align:middle line:84%
and it's a slave
species, and the Annunaki

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:12.869 align:middle line:90%
have enslaved them.

00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the
other planet no?

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:16.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Helion
is uninhabitable.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:19.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Annunaki
still there on Nibiru?

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Very much so.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:25.798 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will we see more UFO
activity when they get close?

00:17:25.798 --> 00:17:26.589 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Oh yeah.

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:28.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or are
we doing that now?

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:29.689 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: No,
when they show up,

00:17:29.689 --> 00:17:31.480 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be like
"Independence Day,"--

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.527 align:middle line:84%
city ships hovering
over capitals.

00:17:33.527 --> 00:17:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The last
time they were here,

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:41.890 align:middle line:84%
3,600 years ago approximately,
what happened Earth-wise?

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:42.790 align:middle line:90%
Calamity-wise?

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Well, the last time
the orbit when they were here

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:49.010 align:middle line:84%
that was exodus, the
10 plagues of Exodus.

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And the Egyptians-- and
we know this from the book

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:54.700 align:middle line:84%
The Kolbrin Bible--
the Egyptians

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.590 align:middle line:84%
talk about that
last flyby, and I'm

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:00.730 align:middle line:84%
talking about-- it's like man
on the street interview quality

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:01.300 align:middle line:90%
stuff.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not airy fairy, you've
got to sort through it.

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.610 align:middle line:84%
What they tell us
about it is that it

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:12.460 align:middle line:84%
was such a fearful event,
men would become impotent,

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.660 align:middle line:84%
and women would
become infertile.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.652 align:middle line:84%
Now consider the age
of people at that time.

00:18:17.652 --> 00:18:19.110 align:middle line:84%
What you're really
talking about is

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:22.480 align:middle line:84%
something that would scare
the sex out of a teenager.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.635 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying
that to be jovial.

00:18:25.635 --> 00:18:26.260 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this
will happen again.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:28.185 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Yes.

00:18:28.185 --> 00:18:29.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Imminently?

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Yes, within
the next few years.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk
about the pole shift,

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.300 align:middle line:84%
and tell me what you
think Planet X will

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.407 align:middle line:90%
do when that shift happens.

00:18:39.407 --> 00:18:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: What's going to
happen with the pole shift is

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:46.730 align:middle line:84%
it's-- you have the Planet
X system coming over on top

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:51.710 align:middle line:84%
of us, and we're going to
have Nemesis out beyond us.

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:58.760 align:middle line:84%
What we're going to see is
that Nibiru in its orbit

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.140 align:middle line:84%
is going to pass between
Earth and the sun.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.560 align:middle line:10%
This causes the
days of darkness.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.199 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How long?

00:19:06.199 --> 00:19:07.490 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: At least three days.

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:08.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Three days
of total darkness.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:09.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Total.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:11.540 align:middle line:90%
It will be pitch black because--

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For the entire planet.

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: We're not
going to see the sun.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.620 align:middle line:84%
It is just going to
be frighteningly dark.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.453 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what will
happen to temperatures

00:19:18.453 --> 00:19:21.244 align:middle line:84%
if you can't see the sun, if
the sun's rays are blocked?

00:19:21.244 --> 00:19:23.035 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Well, what
we're going to have--

00:19:23.035 --> 00:19:26.936 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we going to plummet
into an ice age for three days?

00:19:26.936 --> 00:19:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: No, we're not,--
I think the big concern

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.990 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have-- and I
think I agree with Ed on his

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:36.150 align:middle line:84%
kill shot theory is that we are
going to get smashed with solar

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:37.990 align:middle line:90%
storms.

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:40.630 align:middle line:84%
This thing is--
first off it's not

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:44.016 align:middle line:84%
like when we see an
eclipse of the moon.

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when
you say solar storms,

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.364 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about x-flares
and things like that?

00:19:48.364 --> 00:19:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Even worse.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.750 align:middle line:90%
Solar sprites.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:53.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Solar sprites
can burn the planet.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Absolutely.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.180 align:middle line:10%
And so it's going
to-- we're going

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:02.280 align:middle line:10%
to have-- if you look
at the movie "Knowing"

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:06.664 align:middle line:10%
with Nicolas Cage, now that
is a very worst case scenario.

00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:08.580 align:middle line:10%
I don't think we're going
to have it that bad.

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:09.950 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The planet was cooked.

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:11.241 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: The planet's cooked.

00:20:11.241 --> 00:20:13.760 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Came back later
thousands of years later,

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.110 align:middle line:10%
but it was cooked.

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:16.152 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: It was cooked.

00:20:16.152 --> 00:20:18.235 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Look at that,
like what we're looking at.

00:20:18.235 --> 00:20:19.060 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: I know.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:19.890 align:middle line:10%
You look at that--

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:20.810 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Everything is gone.

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:22.650 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: Everything's
gone, and actually,

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:25.670 align:middle line:10%
when you look at
"Knowing," that in my mind

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:28.700 align:middle line:10%
is going to be the next
flyby of the Planet X system.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.950 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Has that
happened before?

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:32.250 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: Not that.

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:35.050 align:middle line:10%
What's happened
before-- the deluge

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:38.850 align:middle line:10%
was caused by one on
the previous flybys.

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:42.090 align:middle line:10%
It was the third one back, and--

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:43.590 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's a planet killer.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.830 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: Yeah,
it's a planet killer.

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.500 align:middle line:10%
We've got to get
off this planet.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.267 align:middle line:10%
Now, think about
what astronomers

00:20:49.267 --> 00:20:50.100 align:middle line:10%
are doing right now.

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.016 align:middle line:10%
What's the holy grail?

00:20:51.016 --> 00:20:53.455 align:middle line:10%
Remember it was big bang theory?

00:20:53.455 --> 00:20:55.330 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And now they've
backtracked on that.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:57.010 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: Yeah,
they've waffled away.

00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:00.240 align:middle line:10%
They've moonwalked
backwards from it.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:04.550 align:middle line:10%
The big thing right now is the
search for extra solar Earth,

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:09.010 align:middle line:10%
a new home, and
my feeling is what

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:11.180 align:middle line:10%
they're reporting to us
is a fraction of what

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.140 align:middle line:10%
they're collecting in data.

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:16.334 align:middle line:84%
And they understand
right now before the--

00:21:16.334 --> 00:21:18.250 align:middle line:84%
because when the flyby
happens, and this thing

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:20.986 align:middle line:84%
crosses through our
system, that's it.

00:21:20.986 --> 00:21:23.110 align:middle line:84%
We're going to lose all
our satellites, everything.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:24.230 align:middle line:90%
It's just going to hose it all.

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:25.442 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah
everything will be fried.

00:21:25.442 --> 00:21:27.233 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: So what
they're doing is they're

00:21:27.233 --> 00:21:29.160 align:middle line:10%
downloading information.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, I worked on a project
with Lockheed Martin

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:36.990 align:middle line:84%
on a KH-1 spy satellite that
was adapted for civilian use.

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:38.806 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
talk about this?

00:21:38.806 --> 00:21:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: They didn't
talk about that,

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:44.200 align:middle line:84%
but I've mentioned the point
because these satellites can

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.110 align:middle line:90%
download so much information.

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:50.850 align:middle line:84%
It can take months, if not
years, for supercomputers

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:53.110 align:middle line:90%
to chew through all of the data.

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:55.280 align:middle line:84%
So I think what
they're doing right now

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:59.680 align:middle line:84%
is that they've got a fleet
of spacecraft out there.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:02.860 align:middle line:84%
They are absolutely combing
the waterfront looking

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.059 align:middle line:84%
for potential new
Earths, and then

00:22:05.059 --> 00:22:07.100 align:middle line:84%
what they're going to be
doing during the flyby--

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:09.308 align:middle line:84%
because they're going to be
in deep underground bases

00:22:09.308 --> 00:22:11.900 align:middle line:84%
is they're going to be
processing that data

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:15.540 align:middle line:84%
and then selecting candidates
for launching probes.

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And once things settle
down, then we go to space.

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:21.880 align:middle line:90%
Now, I want to say one thing.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.060 align:middle line:84%
People go, is it
the end of life?

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.700 align:middle line:90%
Are we going to disappear?

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:28.350 align:middle line:84%
No, it's not the
end of humanity.

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This time around.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:30.646 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: This time around.

00:22:30.646 --> 00:22:32.910 align:middle line:90%
Next time around it's "Knowing."

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:33.419 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:22:33.419 --> 00:22:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
3,600 years from now.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: That's right.

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:40.560 align:middle line:90%
The planet's going to be hosed.

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.330 align:middle line:84%
That's what's
really pushing them.

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:47.590 align:middle line:84%
The elites understand we
got to get out of dodge.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:49.739 align:middle line:84%
We've got to go find
someplace else to live.

00:22:49.739 --> 00:22:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why aren't they
telling us about it, Marshall?

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:54.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Control issues.

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:55.660 align:middle line:90%
It's always about control.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:56.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would we panic?

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:57.750 align:middle line:90%
What would they say?

00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:59.780 align:middle line:84%
Pretend you're at
the United Nations

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:04.391 align:middle line:84%
and you're giving the speech to
the world, what would you say?

00:23:04.391 --> 00:23:05.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: I would say--

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:06.598 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No sugar coating it.

00:23:06.598 --> 00:23:08.130 align:middle line:84%
Just lay it right
out there for us.

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:10.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: I'd say
that we're going

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:14.510 align:middle line:84%
to see something-- well the
Georgia Guidestones tells us

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:17.980 align:middle line:84%
that to keep the population
under half a billion

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:22.630 align:middle line:84%
in harmony with nature--
doesn't say how we get there.

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:24.820 align:middle line:84%
How we get there
is what's coming.

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.910 align:middle line:84%
So you are looking
at a situation

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:30.630 align:middle line:84%
where one in seven on the
surface are going to survive.

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:34.750 align:middle line:84%
This is really going
to be catastrophic.

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:36.310 align:middle line:84%
The initial events
are going to be

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:40.180 align:middle line:84%
brutal all along the coastlines,
and so that's the reason

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.130 align:middle line:90%
why I've lived in Santa Cruz.

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:43.075 align:middle line:90%
I moved to Nevada.

00:23:43.075 --> 00:23:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was just up
there a few weeks ago.

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:45.700 align:middle line:90%
Love it out there.

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Oh, it's a gorgeous.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.650 align:middle line:90%
Gorgeous.

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:53.670 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, there's
that movie, "San Andreas,"

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:57.440 align:middle line:84%
that's coming out, and they
show this massive tsunami

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.000 align:middle line:90%
slamming into the coast.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.330 align:middle line:90%
That's really going to happen.

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:01.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
all tied together.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: All tied
together, and so we're

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:09.320 align:middle line:84%
going to have a
tremendous loss of life.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.580 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to want to
have people panic, but also

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:17.000 align:middle line:84%
to be honest, the fewer people
who survive, the better.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.820 align:middle line:90%
The reason why is--

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this a
cleansing of the planet?

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:25.160 align:middle line:84%
I hate to use that,
but is that what it is?

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Well,
in a sense it is,

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:31.050 align:middle line:84%
but I prefer the
word "unshackling."

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:32.750 align:middle line:90%
Humanity is a slave species.

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:35.360 align:middle line:90%


00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Less than 1% of the
world owns half of it.

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:40.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: True.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: This is going
to break the shackles.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:48.200 align:middle line:84%
Those who do survive this--
life is going to be brutal,

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.750 align:middle line:90%
but they're going to be free.

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Now for the elites,
the big thing

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:56.430 align:middle line:84%
is what happens after the
flyby and things start

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:57.870 align:middle line:90%
to settle down.

00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:01.610 align:middle line:84%
They are, A, it's a
given, we survive.

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:04.110 align:middle line:90%
B, it's a given, we rebuild.

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:07.920 align:middle line:84%
C, it's a given,
we go to the stars.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.570 align:middle line:84%
How we go to the stars
is the determining thing.

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:12.970 align:middle line:84%
It's the reason why there's
so many other races that

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:15.820 align:middle line:84%
are so interested in
what's happening with us.

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:20.080 align:middle line:84%
We're either going to go to
the stars like Annunaki storm

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.450 align:middle line:84%
troopers, and we're going
to-- the movie "Avatar,"

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:25.820 align:middle line:84%
excellent example of
that, or we're going

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:28.790 align:middle line:90%
to have a Star Trek future.

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Gene Roddenberry got
it right on the money.

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
he know this stuff?

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Well, according
to Phylis Schlemmer.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.216 align:middle line:84%
And a famous psychic he
was in a study with, and--

00:25:40.216 --> 00:25:42.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He must have been
a remote viewer himself.

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:45.261 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: He was tapped
into the Akashic record,

00:25:45.261 --> 00:25:47.260 align:middle line:84%
and that's where he was
getting all the stories.

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:49.360 align:middle line:84%
Although when she
told him at first,

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.620 align:middle line:84%
he was really annoyed
because it's Hollywood.

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.500 align:middle line:90%
You want to be original.

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:58.090 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I don't want to
plagiarize the book of life,

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:02.800 align:middle line:84%
but then again she said once
he figured, wow, this is cool.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.250 align:middle line:90%
I got a cornucopia here.

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:07.940 align:middle line:84%
It's the gift that keeps
on giving, and it did.

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:11.680 align:middle line:84%
While he was alive,
he just was so spot

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.890 align:middle line:84%
on in the vision that
he gave of the future,

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:16.810 align:middle line:84%
and that's the reason
why people love it,

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:18.860 align:middle line:90%
gravitated to the franchise.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And so that's really what other
races are looking at-- is are

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:29.250 align:middle line:84%
we going to go as a peaceful
spacefaring race welcome

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:30.280 align:middle line:90%
to wherever we go--

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or?

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: You don't
want to show up.

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When the
flyby occurs, how long

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:41.360 align:middle line:84%
will it take before it kind
of dissipates and leaves?

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: The bulk
of the really bad time

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:47.570 align:middle line:84%
is a period approximately
three years give or take.

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:48.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From now?

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:51.645 align:middle line:90%


00:26:51.645 --> 00:26:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Actually
the beginning

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:55.360 align:middle line:84%
of the tribulation that
we have in the book

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.110 align:middle line:84%
is called the Winter
of Ash, and that

00:26:57.110 --> 00:27:00.015 align:middle line:84%
looks to be on target for
fourth quarter of this year.

00:27:00.015 --> 00:27:05.722 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So from 2015, three
years, you think, to -18, -19.

00:27:05.722 --> 00:27:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Then
there's going to be

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:10.190 align:middle line:84%
a period of approximately
another seven years,

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:12.340 align:middle line:84%
and this is going
to be the settling.

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:17.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And at any point
will we know from government

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:20.780 align:middle line:84%
that this is happening, or
will it be obvious to the--

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:23.314 align:middle line:84%
as you said, you might
be able to see something?

00:27:23.314 --> 00:27:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: I don't think
governments are going

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:26.670 align:middle line:90%
to tell us anything about it.

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:30.830 align:middle line:84%
They've done a very good job
of lying about it up to now.

00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But will some amateur
astronomer say-- and call

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:37.370 align:middle line:84%
my show, "Coast to Coast,"
George, it's there.

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:38.370 align:middle line:90%
I see it.

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:40.040 align:middle line:90%
Here's a picture.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: When it comes
out from behind the sun,

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.542 align:middle line:84%
every caller is going
to be talking about it.

00:27:44.542 --> 00:27:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'll all
know it's there.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:46.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Yeah.

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:49.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then how can
government deny that it's there?

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Well,
they won't deny it.

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:54.520 align:middle line:84%
What they're probably going
to say is don't worry.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.665 align:middle line:84%
It'll just fly by, and
it'll be a speed bump.

00:27:56.665 --> 00:27:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wild things are
happening to the planet.

00:27:58.740 --> 00:27:59.810 align:middle line:90%
They'll be denying it.

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: They're going
to be denying it, and look,

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:04.480 align:middle line:84%
people cling to the
bliss of their ignorance

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.360 align:middle line:90%
like jealous lovers.

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.820 align:middle line:90%
So they want to be lied to.

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.079 align:middle line:90%
Please don't tell me it's so.

00:28:10.079 --> 00:28:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nobody wants
to know it's the end.

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:12.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: That's right.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a guy call me on
one of my open lines and said,

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:19.406 align:middle line:84%
can I tell you a sad
story, and I went, no.

00:28:19.406 --> 00:28:20.880 align:middle line:90%
Nobody wants to hear this.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.670 align:middle line:90%


00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: I don't
blame them, but what

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:29.970 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you is awareness--
and you come into awareness

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:33.830 align:middle line:84%
about this, and it's about as
engaging a process as somebody

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:36.670 align:middle line:84%
slapping you upside the
face with a dead salmon.

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we prepare
for this individually?

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:39.900 align:middle line:90%
Can we?

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Individually,
this is really

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:45.640 align:middle line:84%
about-- there's
two paths you can

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:49.500 align:middle line:84%
take with the prepping-- what I
call conventional or community.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.850 align:middle line:84%
I see the conventional
preppers out there.

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:55.530 align:middle line:84%
It's fear-based, heavy
emphasis on contraptions

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:57.200 align:middle line:90%
and confrontation.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.340 align:middle line:90%
They're not going to do well.

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:02.970 align:middle line:90%
Then there's community based.

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:06.290 align:middle line:84%
This is love based
paradigm, and it's really

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:10.340 align:middle line:84%
where the emphasis is not
about holding on to things.

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:12.540 align:middle line:84%
It's about holding
onto each other,

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:16.540 align:middle line:84%
and so the focus there is
on comfort and continuation

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:19.540 align:middle line:84%
as a community, pulling
through, service

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:22.950 align:middle line:90%
to others, a love-based model.

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:26.450 align:middle line:84%
That is what I'm working on
in formation of communities

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:29.485 align:middle line:84%
that I'm working on in
my projects right now.

00:29:29.485 --> 00:29:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And this to me is
the best way to go.

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:38.970 align:middle line:84%
If you are balanced about this,
you have mind, body, spirit.

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:41.830 align:middle line:90%
You're emotionally ready for it.

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:44.419 align:middle line:84%
The awareness process
is not about, oh my god,

00:29:44.419 --> 00:29:45.210 align:middle line:90%
we're going to die.

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:47.970 align:middle line:90%
Let's get guns.

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:50.740 align:middle line:10%
It's actually what I
call the "long goodbye."

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:55.630 align:middle line:10%
It's a period of mourning, and
you mourn the end of things

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:59.850 align:middle line:10%
as they are, but then
you can embrace the fact

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:02.630 align:middle line:10%
that there is going to
be an opportunity for us

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:04.850 align:middle line:10%
as a species to
break the shackles.

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If people want
to watch, and figure out

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:10.360 align:middle line:84%
what you're doing, and tracking
you, how do they find you?

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:14.770 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: yowusa.com
or marshallmasters.com.

00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:17.230 align:middle line:10%
And if you want to see what
I'm doing with my communities,

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:21.380 align:middle line:10%
I have what I call the Survival
Wellness Advocacy Guild,

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.860 align:middle line:10%
and then also started
a new project called

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.390 align:middle line:10%
Knowledge Mountain.

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
for the Guild,

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:32.040 align:middle line:84%
and what we want to do is--
once the tribulation is going,

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:36.725 align:middle line:84%
we want to start doing basically
cataclysm radio, if you will.

00:30:36.725 --> 00:30:38.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
the way to do it.

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.730 align:middle line:10%
Marshall, thanks for
being on this program.

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:42.267 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Thanks.

00:30:42.267 --> 00:30:43.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Planet X...

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.360 align:middle line:90%
Very soon.

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.210 align:middle line:84%
But we'll be ready,
because we'll

00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:48.690 align:middle line:84%
continue to give you the
information right here

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:49.810 align:middle line:90%
on "Beyond Belief."

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:51.790 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for watching.

00:30:51.790 --> 00:31:07.415 align:middle line:90%
