>>ISABEAU MAXWELL: My
experience with intuition

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.550 align:middle line:90%

all born with it.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.180 align:middle line:84%
We just don't have to use
it as much as we used to.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or don't know how to.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.763 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Or don't know how to.

00:00:21.763 --> 00:00:25.560 align:middle line:84%
Doors just all of a sudden open
to all of these possibilities

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.480 align:middle line:90%
that I had shut out.

Anything that happens to you
happens to your energetic body

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.380 align:middle line:84%
first before you even hear
it with your physical body.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.700 align:middle line:84%
We've decided to be
here in this human form,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.310 align:middle line:84%
so we can have experiences
that you can only

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.930 align:middle line:90%
have in a linear timeline.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.080 align:middle line:84%
When you defocus,
that's when you can sink

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.400 align:middle line:90%
into the intuitive information.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Because it doesn't
exist in the solid.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a game changer, and
it brings a level of beauty

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.260 align:middle line:84%
into your life that no

For the past 15 plus
years, Isabeau Maxwell

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.410 align:middle line:10%
has been helping people
connect to their authentic

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.450 align:middle line:10%
natural intuitive abilities.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.660 align:middle line:84%
Originally, a skeptic,
a series of events

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.690 align:middle line:84%
led Isabeau to opening
up her own intuition

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.970 align:middle line:84%
and revealing her
highest purpose--

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.710 align:middle line:90%
humanizing spirits.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.570 align:middle line:10%
Her book is called
"Cracking Open--

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.420 align:middle line:10%
Adventures of a
Reluctant Medium."

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Why are you called
a reluctant medium?

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Because
in the beginning,

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.870 align:middle line:90%
I was very reluctant.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:34.670 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.630 align:middle line:10%
>>MAXWELL: Absolutely.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What changed you?

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: I think, the way--

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.090 align:middle line:84%
I probably should
start by describing

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.400 align:middle line:90%
how I opened up intuitively.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Like you said, I was
a complete skeptic.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And my grandmother, who
I was very close to,

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.220 align:middle line:84%
passed away and, within hours,
showed up in my living room

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.630 align:middle line:90%
in spirit form.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, for me, that
wasn't the best day.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.020 align:middle line:84%
It was a very
frightening moment.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.288 align:middle line:84%
Because she was not completely
solid, but close to solid.

00:02:04.288 --> 00:02:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Clearly, you could see
an image of your grandmother.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: She might as well
have been standing there,

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.000 align:middle line:90%
maybe 30% transparent.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.350 align:middle line:90%
It was very impactful.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, it
even physically sent

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.328 align:middle line:84%
me back a little
bit into the wall.

00:02:19.328 --> 00:02:20.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you scared?

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Yes, I
was very scared.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And for that moment
I was scared,

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.550 align:middle line:84%
and I remember awkwardly
yelling, don't do that again--

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.040 align:middle line:90%
just a random shout.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.350 align:middle line:84%
Then when it was done,
I took a few breaths

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.350 align:middle line:84%
and thought, what
if that was her?

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.220 align:middle line:90%
It had to be her.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.540 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was so--

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it quick?

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: It was so quick.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.580 align:middle line:84%
She was there three
seconds maybe.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.170 align:middle line:84%
What was really
interesting to me

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.895 align:middle line:84%
is that she was
standing sideways.

00:02:46.895 --> 00:02:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And she turned, and
looked over her shoulder,

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.162 align:middle line:84%
and smiled, and
winked, and then left.

00:02:51.162 --> 00:02:52.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And then dissipated.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: And just gone,
like a blink and gone.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.150 align:middle line:84%
So honestly, the
reluctant part of me

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.980 align:middle line:84%
was I didn't want
that lifestyle.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.250 align:middle line:84%
I had lived 30-some
years already,

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.750 align:middle line:84%
believing that wasn't real,
and that was all just for show.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't think
that was my path.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.890 align:middle line:84%
But what I did want
was my grandmother.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:17.690 align:middle line:90%
So I--

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You missed her.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: I missed her.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.168 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Probably,
you still do, Isabeau.

00:03:21.168 --> 00:03:22.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: I do.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.972 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:03:22.972 --> 00:03:24.930 align:middle line:84%
I can communicate with
her, which is wonderful.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.990 align:middle line:90%
But I missed her dearly.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And I reached out to someone,
the strangest person I knew,

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.870 align:middle line:84%
which happened to be a Tai
Chi instructor at the time.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.790 align:middle line:90%
And he was a sweet, sweet man.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And he helped me
start to communicate

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.080 align:middle line:90%
with her through yes and no.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And at first, honestly, I
was doing it out of grief.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And then when the proof
started to come, I realized,

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.600 align:middle line:90%
this is-- this is not grief.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.530 align:middle line:90%
This is real.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you're not a
medium at that point, right?

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Correct.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:55.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Correct.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.370 align:middle line:84%
At that point, I was
communicating with her

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.550 align:middle line:84%
and received sensations
through yes and no,

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.500 align:middle line:90%
pendulum-work type things.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And I recall a day
that I said to her,

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm worried that I'm
making this up in my head

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.500 align:middle line:90%
to hold on to you.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And I really need your
help to give me proof.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.679 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But inside, you might
have been losing it a little

00:04:16.679 --> 00:04:16.880 align:middle line:90%
a bit.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.422 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: I thought
I was losing it.

00:04:18.422 --> 00:04:20.360 align:middle line:90%
I was raising two small boys.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.640 align:middle line:84%
I needed to be there
and be present.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And I remember saying
to my grandmother,

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.340 align:middle line:90%
I need you to help me.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.480 align:middle line:84%
Really, is this real,
or is this all grief?

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And a few days later,
she came to me again.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not fully into
mediumship at this point.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.832 align:middle line:84%
All I can do is feel
that rush that goes

00:04:41.832 --> 00:04:43.040 align:middle line:90%
through you, like goosebumps.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you a
believer at this point?

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: 50/50.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.115 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're on the fence.

00:04:47.115 --> 00:04:47.370 align:middle line:90%
You're on a fence.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: And I'm still not
talking to anyone about it

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.780 align:middle line:90%
or sharing it.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.790 align:middle line:90%
I was very much on the fence.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.070 align:middle line:90%
And that rush came through me.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.460 align:middle line:90%
I was driving.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.260 align:middle line:90%
I pulled over.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.640 align:middle line:90%
I got my pendulum out.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And I started doing yes-and-no
questions, which, by the way,

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.680 align:middle line:90%
it takes a long time--

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It does.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: --to get a message.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.680 align:middle line:90%
But I was devoted to this.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And after 20 minutes, I
got a very simple message,

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.300 align:middle line:84%
that my mom would have a
financial issue that she

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.310 align:middle line:90%
needed assistance with.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.930 align:middle line:90%
She would call me for help.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.240 align:middle line:84%
But then a friend
would help her instead.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.597 align:middle line:84%
And I said, this is a solid
enough message, that I can--

00:05:25.597 --> 00:05:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Track this.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: --track this.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And if it doesn't
happen, I can go

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.020 align:middle line:84%
reach out for some grief
counseling and help.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.590 align:middle line:84%
That afternoon, my
mom called and said,

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.360 align:middle line:84%
I need cash moved from
one bank to another.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just like that.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Like that-- and
I remember shaking a little

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.790 align:middle line:90%
because it was very surreal.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:46.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: And I
said, absolutely.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.730 align:middle line:84%
I drove to the first bank got
some cash, drove to this--

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, but then there
was that part of me

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.460 align:middle line:84%
that's like, my mom is
in the financial world.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.420 align:middle line:90%
She's a businesswoman.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.190 align:middle line:90%
This has happened before--

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It happens
all the time.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: --where
a bank has done--

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:01.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe, you made it up.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.218 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Yeah, right.

00:06:02.218 --> 00:06:04.410 align:middle line:84%
So maybe I'm
remembering something.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And I pulled into her
bank with the cash

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.690 align:middle line:84%
to deposit into the
business account.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And she called and
said, oh, hey, hey, hey.

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:13.470 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about it.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.567 align:middle line:84%
My friend, Lisa,
already handled it.

00:06:16.567 --> 00:06:18.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you already
did it, too, right?

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.233 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: No, I hadn't
walked into the bank

00:06:20.233 --> 00:06:21.370 align:middle line:90%
yet to deposit the cash.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Yeah.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.910 align:middle line:90%
So I was going to help her.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.350 align:middle line:90%
But a friend did.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And I sat in that parking lot
for a good hour, just weeping.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.980 align:middle line:90%
There was joy, there was--

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.830 align:middle line:84%
like doors just all
of a sudden open

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.980 align:middle line:84%
to all of these possibilities
that I had shut out.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, George,
I just thought

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.580 align:middle line:90%
I had my grandma by my side now.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.020 align:middle line:90%
And I was just so excited.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.760 align:middle line:90%
Because I never looked back.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.590 align:middle line:84%
My belief was solid
from that moment on.

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:48.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Walked right in.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.168 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Walked
right in-- that was it.

00:06:50.168 --> 00:06:52.120 align:middle line:90%
That it was just--

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.010 align:middle line:84%
there was too many,
what people like to say,

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.138 align:middle line:84%
coincidences for
that not to be real.

00:06:56.138 --> 00:06:58.555 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You see, and I believe
there are no coincidences.

00:06:58.555 --> 00:06:59.740 align:middle line:90%
Things happened for a reason.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.532 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Correct,
absolutely, absolutely.

00:07:01.532 --> 00:07:03.537 align:middle line:84%
I love calling them
synchronicities.

00:07:03.537 --> 00:07:04.870 align:middle line:90%
That's what I love calling them.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The late
Rosemary Ellen Guiley

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.970 align:middle line:84%
was an expert on
mediumship experiences

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.860 align:middle line:90%
and research on the afterlife.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:17.090 align:middle line:84%
I had a great opportunity to
talk with her a few years ago.

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Take us through the
moment of death.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:23.043 align:middle line:90%
What happens on this crossover?

00:07:23.043 --> 00:07:25.460 align:middle line:10%
>>ROSEMARY ELLEN GUILEY: I
believe that we go to a between

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.450 align:middle line:10%
place--

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:27.620 align:middle line:10%
a transitional place.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.220 align:middle line:10%
Because even when
death is not violent,

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.560 align:middle line:10%
like it happens in
sleep, or it's expected,

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:39.330 align:middle line:10%
like through a terminal illness,
we still need a time to adjust.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.250 align:middle line:10%
So we go to a place that's
very familiar to us.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.700 align:middle line:10%
And all the literature
that's been channeled

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.270 align:middle line:10%
through mediums and through
spirit communications,

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.090 align:middle line:10%
this seems to be something
very much like Earth,

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:54.550 align:middle line:10%
like a park-like setting.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.090 align:middle line:10%
In fact, it's often
called the Park.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.150 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Are we aware
that we're dead?

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:00.650 align:middle line:10%
>>GUILEY: In many cases, yes.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.320 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes when we have
violent transitions,

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.760 align:middle line:10%
unexpected through accidents--

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.718 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Car accidents.

00:08:05.718 --> 00:08:08.870 align:middle line:10%
>>GUILEY: Car accidents,
or natural disasters,

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.920 align:middle line:10%
or even an unexpected
criminal assault,

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.930 align:middle line:10%
we may not realize that
we're dead right away.

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:17.120 align:middle line:10%
So we meet people
from the other side.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.150 align:middle line:10%
And we're greeted by
family and friends,

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:23.360 align:middle line:10%
sometimes angels,
divine helpers.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.330 align:middle line:10%
And we're kind of
shown the ropes.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.970 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes people travel
through a tunnel of light.

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:31.820 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes they just find
themselves in the park.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.090 align:middle line:10%
Then we're allowed to
adjust to the afterlife.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:40.190 align:middle line:10%
I believe that it reflects
our thoughts and our feelings.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.789 align:middle line:10%
And initially, people may
want a place very much

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:46.370 align:middle line:10%
like what they left behind.

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:49.790 align:middle line:10%
What we're told by the
dead is that the afterlife

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:53.040 align:middle line:10%
transforms itself
instantly to our thoughts.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.970 align:middle line:10%
So we can have the
home we really wanted.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:09:00.200 align:middle line:10%
We can have the body that
we feel is ideal for us--

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:04.560 align:middle line:10%
the state of age where we
felt we were at our best.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.800 align:middle line:10%
And then I believe
that we evolve.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.900 align:middle line:10%
We get adjusted
to the afterlife,

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.230 align:middle line:10%
and we discover that there
are other states of being.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ironically,
Rosemary Ellen Guiley

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.010 align:middle line:90%
is now in the afterlife.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
people who claim

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.090 align:middle line:84%
that she has communicated with
them since she's passed on.

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: I wouldn't
doubt that at all, yeah.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So she knows that.

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:25.730 align:middle line:84%
What did you think of
what she had to say?

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:26.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Spot on.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.080 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly my
experience as well.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.710 align:middle line:84%
For me, I'm grateful that I was
able to meet my first spirit

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.983 align:middle line:84%
guide shortly after settling
in with my grandmother.

00:09:36.983 --> 00:09:38.150 align:middle line:90%
I met my first spirit guide.

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And for almost two years, I
would sit with him and learn.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.850 align:middle line:90%
And he would--

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.630 align:middle line:84%
I would just journal
everything that he taught me.

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And then I would go
out into the world

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.100 align:middle line:84%
and hear an amazing person
like this say exactly what I

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:53.900 align:middle line:90%
had learned, too.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.450 align:middle line:84%
So they eased me into it,
knowing that I was a skeptic

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:58.850 align:middle line:84%
and needed that
kind of extra layer.

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly how
I experience it as well.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:06.980 align:middle line:84%
For me, the transition in
death for an individual

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.570 align:middle line:90%
is like an escalator.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:09.950 align:middle line:90%
It's automatic.

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:11.390 align:middle line:90%
There's a pull.

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And the further along you
get in the transition,

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:18.950 align:middle line:84%
the more intensified that
unconditional love is.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And top of that, you really
go from a linear timeline

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.650 align:middle line:90%
to a non-linear timeline.

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's what she's
talking about-- the ability

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:30.710 align:middle line:84%
to create around you anything
and everything that you

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:32.300 align:middle line:90%
need in that moment.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
your SAGE method?

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:35.960 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.585 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: SAGE method
was interesting.

00:10:37.585 --> 00:10:40.730 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, I met with my guide
for a few years and learned.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:44.180 align:middle line:84%
He was the one that helped
me to hone my intuition.

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And after doing that,
I started to work

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:47.660 align:middle line:90%
as a professional medium.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.145 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what I
thought I should do.

00:10:49.145 --> 00:10:49.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:51.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: It was just
the next natural step.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And my guide came
to me and said,

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:56.090 align:middle line:84%
you need to take everything
that you and I did,

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.890 align:middle line:84%
and put it together, and
give it to other people.

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:02.090 align:middle line:84%
So that they can also hone
their intuition the way you did.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:03.590 align:middle line:90%
Because George if I can--

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:04.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You will.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:04.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: --anyone can.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:05.192 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You will.

00:11:05.192 --> 00:11:05.360 align:middle line:90%
You will.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Yeah, exactly.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.767 align:middle line:84%
Because I went from
nothing to full-on medium.

00:11:09.767 --> 00:11:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you glad
this happened to you--

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.400 align:middle line:90%
this experience?

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: I am so
grateful, so grateful.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.210 align:middle line:84%
Those first two or
three years, which

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:20.070 align:middle line:84%
is what the book
speaks of, were rough.

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:22.355 align:middle line:90%
They were--

00:11:22.355 --> 00:11:23.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Emotionally rough?

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Emotionally
rough-- my life really

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.040 align:middle line:90%
turned upside down.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.230 align:middle line:84%
I was fortunate enough that
all of the people around me

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.780 align:middle line:90%
loved me.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.363 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have any
struggles with that.

00:11:32.363 --> 00:11:35.000 align:middle line:84%
I think it was more
an internal change.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.240 align:middle line:84%
But now, I see things
in a different way.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.410 align:middle line:84%
There's-- you see things
through the lens of compassion.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:43.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:45.170 align:middle line:90%
What is energetic body practice?

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:46.600 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: That is, hands
down, my favorite tool to teach

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:51.620 align:middle line:90%
people-- my favorite practice.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.610 align:middle line:90%
That is a game changer.

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:56.840 align:middle line:84%
We are raised to be aware
of our physical body.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.830 align:middle line:90%
We clothe it.

00:11:57.830 --> 00:11:58.820 align:middle line:90%
We take care of it.

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.560 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of us
weren't raised to take

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.060 align:middle line:90%
care of our energetic body.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And our energetic body expands
outside of our physical body.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:05.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: So it holds our
physical body and cares for it.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.150 align:middle line:84%
What happens in
our day-to-day life

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.700 align:middle line:84%
is that anything
that happens to you

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.230 align:middle line:84%
happens to your
energetic body first.

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:20.460 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody yells
at you, for example,

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:23.720 align:middle line:84%
the anger energy is going
to hit your energetic body

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.730 align:middle line:84%
before you even hear it
with your physical body.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:28.430 align:middle line:84%
So we're walking
through this lifetime--

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:31.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it kind of a
buffer for the physical body?

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:35.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: It's more like--
your spirit's more like--

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:39.500 align:middle line:84%
it's what carries this human
body through the world.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And we'll have
times where we don't

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:43.220 align:middle line:90%
know why we're crabby or upset.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.933 align:middle line:84%
It's because perhaps
we went to a market

00:12:45.933 --> 00:12:48.350 align:middle line:84%
and walked through the market
and passed a bunch of people

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:49.550 align:middle line:90%
that were crabby and upset.

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
pick up on that.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: We pick up their
energy into our energetic body.

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Yep, and that's not for
us to carry or hold.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
ground yourself from that?

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:01.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: For me, it's GCP--

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:03.170 align:middle line:90%
ground, clear, protect.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:07.880 align:middle line:84%
That pattern establishes
care for your body

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.080 align:middle line:90%
and for your energetic body.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.340 align:middle line:90%
And it sets the intent.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And really, it's just
that intent and awareness

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.840 align:middle line:84%
of your energetic
body that allows

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.480 align:middle line:84%
you to keep it
clear of that, which

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:18.800 align:middle line:90%
is not supposed to be in there.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.360 align:middle line:90%
It makes life a lot easier.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.480 align:middle line:90%
And grounding is very typical.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.670 align:middle line:84%
Grounding-- anchor
to Mother Earth

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:29.780 align:middle line:84%
in some way that works best
for you, tree roots or cord

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:31.880 align:middle line:84%
shooting down into the
Earth, something like that.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.437 align:middle line:84%
Clear-- imagine water pouring
through your entire system--

00:13:34.437 --> 00:13:35.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: --and clearing out
what you don't need and then

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:38.680 align:middle line:90%
protect--

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.970 align:middle line:84%
not isolate but put
like a bubble around it.

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:43.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's more of a filter.

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Let in what's supposed
to be on my path

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:48.110 align:middle line:84%
and keep out what's
not supposed to be.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:50.150 align:middle line:84%
Moving forward
with that, you now

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:53.570 align:middle line:84%
have a clear channel
and a clear energy body

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:55.640 align:middle line:84%
and only what you're
supposed to be carrying.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.205 align:middle line:90%
It lightens a lot of your path.

00:13:58.205 --> 00:14:01.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gaia's Lisa Garr on
her program, Inspirations,

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:03.830 align:middle line:84%
have a chance to
talk with Sonja Grace

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:06.040 align:middle line:90%
about these kind of techniques.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SONJA GRACE: People
think of meditation.

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, they go
right into their third eye

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.250 align:middle line:84%
and think, oh,
yeah, that's where--

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:15.920 align:middle line:84%
I teach a completely
different form of meditation.

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Because I am a firm believer
that why we're here on Earth

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.730 align:middle line:84%
is to ground our
energy into the Earth,

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:26.120 align:middle line:84%
that the Earth is here
to give us energy.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And if we're spending all of
our time sending our energy out

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:33.470 align:middle line:84%
into other things,
that's actually

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:36.285 align:middle line:84%
how we're creating more
karma for ourselves.

00:14:36.285 --> 00:14:37.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: By
putting our energy out?

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:38.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes, yes.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.630 align:middle line:84%
So let's say,
you're watching TV,

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:43.880 align:middle line:84%
and there's some
disaster that happened.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling
just horrible.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And your energy from your third
or maybe even your second--

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.720 align:middle line:84%
lot of empaths will
understand what

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying-- will go
out to the television

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.550 align:middle line:90%
and go into the whole thing.

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And yes, you want
to support that.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.080 align:middle line:84%
But this is not the
way to support it.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.100 align:middle line:84%
Because now, you're hooking up
with those people, their fear,

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.590 align:middle line:84%
their anxiety, their
betrayal, everything.

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.040 align:middle line:90%
And you're creating more karma.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.970 align:middle line:84%
You're becoming a part
of the collective karma.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:15.020 align:middle line:84%
Where the energy should
go is into the ground.

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.900 align:middle line:84%
And I teach a
meditation that's in--

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:19.220 align:middle line:90%
become an Earth angel.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:23.420 align:middle line:84%
That is cones of energy
that send that energy down

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.440 align:middle line:90%
into the Earth.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.870 align:middle line:84%
So you're receiving
energy from the Earth.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:28.800 align:middle line:90%
You're sending energy down.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.140 align:middle line:90%
But you're not sending it out.

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, from here, if you want
to send love energy out,

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:36.560 align:middle line:90%
of course, you should.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.792 align:middle line:84%
That's-- we're here to love at
the deepest level of our being.

00:15:40.792 --> 00:15:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GARR: So the energy you're
sending down is the negativity

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:44.638 align:middle line:90%
and the fear and--

00:15:44.638 --> 00:15:46.055 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: No, it's
all your energy.

00:15:46.055 --> 00:15:49.190 align:middle line:84%
It is your energy
connecting to the Earth.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:50.460 align:middle line:90%
It's everything.

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GARR: So when you
watch that type of media,

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:56.060 align:middle line:84%
and you see it everywhere,
you can't avoid it.

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:56.870 align:middle line:90%
It's in the ethers.

00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:00.260 align:middle line:10%
You basically just
ground your own body.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Yes, you
ground your energy.

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GARR: And receive then
energy from the Earth--

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GARR: --who will
constantly give?

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:06.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Absolutely.

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.320 align:middle line:90%
She's so there for us.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.858 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my goodness.

00:16:10.858 --> 00:16:12.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isabeau, Sonja
looked comfortable,

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:14.030 align:middle line:90%
sitting in that chair, right?

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:14.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: She does.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Legs crossed, no shoes.

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:16.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Absolutely.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.697 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She was
enjoying herself.

00:16:17.697 --> 00:16:19.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Absolutely.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk about the
grounding she was mentioning.

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:25.417 align:middle line:90%
Why is that important?

00:16:25.417 --> 00:16:26.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: It's important.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:30.710 align:middle line:84%
We've decided to be
here in this human form.

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And Earth is literally here
to support our journey.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:38.690 align:middle line:90%
And, I mean, we walk on her.

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:41.780 align:middle line:84%
Every step we take, we
take on Mother Earth.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.473 align:middle line:84%
She's literally our
support structure

00:16:43.473 --> 00:16:44.390 align:middle line:90%
from beginning to end.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's the
Gaia theory, right?

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: It is, absolutely.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.580 align:middle line:90%
And she's so loving.

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And there's no
limitation to the amount

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.857 align:middle line:84%
of energy and the support
that she can give.

00:16:54.857 --> 00:16:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Also, another thing I
learned with grounding

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:58.970 align:middle line:84%
very early on-- because
I thought, wait a minute.

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:02.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to talk to spirits,
which are technically-- not

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:04.220 align:middle line:90%
technically, but up there.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:06.450 align:middle line:84%
Why would I want to
hold myself down here?

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:07.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:09.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: And a really
wise man said, it's

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:11.150 align:middle line:90%
like a telephone pole.

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:14.329 align:middle line:84%
The deeper you bury the pole,
the taller the pole can be

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:16.010 align:middle line:90%
and the more solid it will be.

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:17.030 align:middle line:90%
And it works.

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:18.890 align:middle line:90%
It works so well.

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:21.250 align:middle line:84%
I love what she was talking
about watching a disaster

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:24.460 align:middle line:84%
and that experience
of watching it

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:28.150 align:middle line:84%
brings that negativity
into your energetic body.

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And people work hard
to bring about what

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.820 align:middle line:84%
they want to manifest
what they want in life.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, you need to start with
what's in your energetic body.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Because whatever's in
your energetic body

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:41.235 align:middle line:90%
is attracting more of that.

00:17:41.235 --> 00:17:42.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:44.318 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: So the more you
fill it up with everything

00:17:44.318 --> 00:17:46.750 align:middle line:84%
you're passionate about,
the more that what you're

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:48.670 align:middle line:90%
passionate about, you'll get.

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:51.162 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there what
is called clutter?

00:17:51.162 --> 00:17:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Clutter, oh.

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.037 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:17:53.037 --> 00:17:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Clutter-- my
experience with intuition

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:59.140 align:middle line:84%
is that it's not necessarily
a gift for a chosen few,

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.700 align:middle line:90%
it's a natural sense.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:02.990 align:middle line:90%
We all have it.

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.790 align:middle line:90%
We all have it.

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:04.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're born with it.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.122 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: We're all
born with it, exactly.

00:18:06.122 --> 00:18:08.320 align:middle line:84%
We just don't have to use
it as much as we used to.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or don't know how to.

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Or don't know
how to, exactly, exactly.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And the little ones,
the two-year-olds,

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:15.880 align:middle line:84%
the three-year-olds,
they're so open.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.050 align:middle line:90%
They're so intuitive.

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And so many parents talk
about the experiences

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.850 align:middle line:84%
that they have
with their children

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:24.790 align:middle line:84%
being in tuned and
their intuition flowing.

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, as we grow,
we get clutter--

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.490 align:middle line:84%
every thought, every
stressful thought,

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:35.800 align:middle line:84%
every item that we own,
every task we have to do,

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:40.300 align:middle line:84%
everything that's gone unspoken
is one piece of clutter

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:43.750 align:middle line:84%
that clutters in the mind,
and then we ask our intuition

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:45.670 align:middle line:90%
to flow through that.

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:49.900 align:middle line:84%
So the journey of
opening your intuition

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:55.000 align:middle line:84%
is more a journey of inner
work, and healing, and along

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.580 align:middle line:84%
with awareness and
understanding of how it works.

00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:00.040 align:middle line:84%
Those two things come
together for people

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.212 align:middle line:84%
to be able to access
their unique intuition.

00:19:02.212 --> 00:19:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isabeau,
what happens when

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:07.000 align:middle line:84%
people have self-doubt
about what they're doing,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.510 align:middle line:90%
about who they are?

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:09.800 align:middle line:90%
How do you solve that?

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:10.930 align:middle line:90%
How do you fix that?

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: You asked
the former skeptic.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.590 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell-- I can
tell you exactly

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:15.280 align:middle line:90%
how to work with that done.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:15.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:16.060 align:middle line:90%
You've been there before.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:17.268 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: I have been there.

00:19:17.268 --> 00:19:19.450 align:middle line:90%
I was a very big skeptic.

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:23.260 align:middle line:90%
Doubt is a habit knowing that--

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:27.010 align:middle line:84%
it's a habit built off of all
of our previous experience.

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:29.590 align:middle line:10%
And we revert back
to that habit.

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:32.410 align:middle line:10%
So you can have an incredible
intuitive experience,

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:35.450 align:middle line:10%
one that's just, wow, I
can't believe that happened--

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:36.250 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: --and two days
later, start doubting it again.

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:42.550 align:middle line:84%
That's because for
so long in your life,

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:44.380 align:middle line:90%
that's your pattern to have it.

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And the number one tool that
I have found to help with that

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:50.770 align:middle line:90%
is called--

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:53.200 align:middle line:84%
I like to call it the
no-doubt notebook.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's a journal
that you use only

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:57.552 align:middle line:84%
for these incredible
experiences.

00:19:57.552 --> 00:19:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Like, I knew my friend
was going to call,

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.260 align:middle line:90%
and then the phone rang.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.332 align:middle line:84%
You would write that
in that journal.

00:20:02.332 --> 00:20:04.540 align:middle line:84%
I knew somebody came through,
and they were 5 foot 2.

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:05.110 align:middle line:90%
They were.

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:06.340 align:middle line:90%
You write that in that journal.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:07.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right, you were
just thinking of somebody.

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:08.290 align:middle line:90%
I just ran into them.

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:09.175 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: And I ran into them.

00:20:09.175 --> 00:20:10.510 align:middle line:90%
You write that in the journal.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:11.380 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
intuition, isn't it?

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: It's
intuition, absolutely.

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:15.587 align:middle line:84%
And so what you're
doing is you're

00:20:15.587 --> 00:20:18.250 align:middle line:84%
recording your really
big intuitive moments.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:20.980 align:middle line:84%
So when that habit
of doubt comes back,

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.780 align:middle line:84%
you can review
through that journal

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:27.220 align:middle line:84%
again to remind your brain,
really, no, this is real.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And in time, you won't
need the journal.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:31.000 align:middle line:90%
But it's a great tool.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would people
even have self-doubt

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:35.470 align:middle line:84%
if all these things
are happening to them?

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:37.630 align:middle line:90%
Why doubt it?

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:41.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: I really think it's
a matter of our brain patterns,

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.600 align:middle line:90%
how the synapses fire.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:47.680 align:middle line:84%
I even had that moment with my
grandmother with the pendulum.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And even then, a couple of
days after, I remember going,

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.170 align:middle line:90%
is this all really happening?

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:57.160 align:middle line:84%
What we're focused on is we're
focused on the non-solid.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And so we don't have that
tangible, that 1 plus 1

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.240 align:middle line:90%
equals 2.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And so when we're
focused on the non-solid,

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.420 align:middle line:84%
it's a little harder
for the human mind

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:10.760 align:middle line:90%
to really hold on to that.

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when you
talked about the pendulum

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:16.000 align:middle line:84%
with your grandmother, you would
ask your grandmother questions,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.530 align:middle line:84%
and then the pendulum
would do what?

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:18.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes and no?

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Yes and no,
until I got really excited

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:21.710 align:middle line:90%
about something.

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And then, I'd say, well, what do
you think about that, grandma?

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:24.550 align:middle line:90%
And it wouldn't move.

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's remarkable.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: And I go,
oh, yeah, yes or no.

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:27.670 align:middle line:84%
I have to go back
to yeses and nos.

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've used it on myself,
where yes is up and down.

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:32.890 align:middle line:90%
No is left and right.

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And you hold it in the middle,
and you mentally think stop,

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:36.580 align:middle line:90%
and it stops.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And then you ask
yourself a question.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.017 align:middle line:90%
And I've had yeses go like this.

00:21:41.017 --> 00:21:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Oh, big swings.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or nos like this--

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:46.063 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really huge
swinging modes.

00:21:46.063 --> 00:21:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Yeah, absolutely.

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:48.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's unbelievable.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:50.630 align:middle line:84%
It's like a lie
detector test, isn't it?

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: It is.

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:54.370 align:middle line:84%
I had a really amazing
student once come in.

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And I had given her the
task of using the pendulum.

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:59.080 align:middle line:84%
She had never
heard of it before.

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.880 align:middle line:84%
She came back to class
the next week and said,

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:03.310 align:middle line:90%
I think, I did it wrong.

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:04.828 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what did you do?

00:22:04.828 --> 00:22:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
I was holding it.

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:07.945 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't get it to swing.

00:22:07.945 --> 00:22:09.820 align:middle line:84%
Because she was working
so hard to make sure,

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.680 align:middle line:90%
she wasn't moving her hand.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.478 align:middle line:84%
And she said, so I
tied it to a bookshelf

00:22:13.478 --> 00:22:15.020 align:middle line:84%
and then I put my
hand underneath it.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And then it would
give me answers.

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.467 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:22:17.467 --> 00:22:19.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: And everyone
in the room went, hmm.

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:21.435 align:middle line:84%
Because she didn't,
I think, realized

00:22:21.435 --> 00:22:25.147 align:middle line:84%
that that was something that
most of us think is impossible.

00:22:25.147 --> 00:22:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I put my
elbow on the table--

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:27.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: I do.

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and hold it
just in my two fingers,

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:31.260 align:middle line:90%
and then off it goes.

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: And just hold
it, and try not to move it.

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk
about spiritual growth

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:37.350 align:middle line:90%
for a moment, Isabeau.

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:40.103 align:middle line:90%
What is agreed-upon reality?

00:22:40.103 --> 00:22:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: The
agreed-upon reality

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:45.000 align:middle line:90%
is the solid, as a solid.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.940 align:middle line:90%
It's the molecules really.

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.650 align:middle line:84%
The space in between is
what we're looking for.

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:54.810 align:middle line:84%
So one excellent tip that
I love giving people--

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:57.960 align:middle line:84%
I figured this one out myself
through working with my guide--

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:01.410 align:middle line:84%
is when you defocus,
that's when you can sink

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:02.730 align:middle line:90%
into the intuitive information.

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:06.930 align:middle line:84%
Because it doesn't
exist in the solid.

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:08.610 align:middle line:84%
You're not looking
for the solid.

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:10.840 align:middle line:84%
You're looking for
what's in between.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:14.850 align:middle line:84%
So defocusing your eyes
is a really great tool

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:17.460 align:middle line:84%
to start to get those
intuitive connections.

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:19.680 align:middle line:84%
People talk about
seeing something out

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.360 align:middle line:84%
of the corner of their eye, and
then they turn, and it's gone.

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It brushes
by really quick.

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Right.

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:25.830 align:middle line:90%
It's not gone.

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:27.390 align:middle line:90%
It's probably still there.

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:29.880 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is that
out of the corner

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.205 align:middle line:90%
of your eye, your defocus.

00:23:32.205 --> 00:23:33.330 align:middle line:90%
Your peripheral is defocus.

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is that
thing we saw rush by?

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.280 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.613 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: It could be a spirit.

00:23:37.613 --> 00:23:41.370 align:middle line:84%
It could be an intuitive
piece of information.

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As Heidi Hollis
would say, a shadow person?

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: It could
be a shadow person.

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:48.220 align:middle line:84%
It could be-- the
possibilities are endless.

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:50.160 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is
we turn, and we look,

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:55.140 align:middle line:84%
and our human eyes start
landing on the solid objects.

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Once you do that, then
you're no longer looking in

00:23:58.410 --> 00:23:59.340 align:middle line:90%
between the molecules.

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:00.673 align:middle line:90%
You're looking at the molecules.

00:24:00.673 --> 00:24:02.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isabeau, how
pre-programmed are we,

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:07.380 align:middle line:84%
where we have to just cleanse
ourself of this and start over?

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Well, coming in
when we're born, we're not.

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:11.790 align:middle line:90%
We're just beautifully--

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:12.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: When you're born.

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:14.057 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: When you're
born, you're not.

00:24:14.057 --> 00:24:15.990 align:middle line:84%
We're beautifully
exactly who we are.

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:17.460 align:middle line:90%
But we choose the family.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.920 align:middle line:84%
We choose a location
before we come down.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And we choose an overall task
of what we want to achieve.

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, that's
helping children,

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:32.050 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps that's mathematics,
or something like that.

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's through our childhood
and all of our experiences

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.870 align:middle line:90%
that the programming happens.

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, we have a
family member that

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:40.050 align:middle line:90%
says, oh, you're not artistic.

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:41.190 align:middle line:90%
You're not artistic.

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Once you say that enough,
that's that personal programming

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:46.710 align:middle line:84%
only to find out when you're
30 years old, you try to draw,

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:47.835 align:middle line:90%
and your brilliant artists.

00:24:47.835 --> 00:24:49.835 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what do
parents tell a little kid

00:24:49.835 --> 00:24:50.970 align:middle line:90%
who's got a cup of milk?

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:51.845 align:middle line:90%
Don't spill the milk.

00:24:51.845 --> 00:24:53.178 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Don't spill the milk.

00:24:53.178 --> 00:24:54.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what do they do?

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:55.800 align:middle line:90%
They spill the milk.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:56.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Exactly.

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've programmed
them to spill the milk.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.455 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Yes, all of those
money doesn't grow on trees.

00:25:00.455 --> 00:25:01.655 align:middle line:90%
Life is hard.

00:25:01.655 --> 00:25:03.030 align:middle line:84%
These are all of
the programming.

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:04.613 align:middle line:84%
And not everyone has
that programming.

00:25:04.613 --> 00:25:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Some are fortunate to be
in different environments.

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:12.802 align:middle line:84%
But, I believe, that these
moments that we have,

00:25:12.802 --> 00:25:14.760 align:middle line:84%
these interactions that
we have with our family

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:17.820 align:middle line:84%
members as we grow up, remember,
this is our soul group.

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.290 align:middle line:90%
These are our people.

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:22.060 align:middle line:90%
And they're doing their job.

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:25.080 align:middle line:84%
They're playing their role, and
they're playing it very well.

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:28.290 align:middle line:84%
I like to kind of negate
the positive-negative of it

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:30.670 align:middle line:84%
and say, these are the
challenges that you were given,

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:31.950 align:middle line:90%
so you can overcome them.

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:34.590 align:middle line:84%
It's in the act of
overcoming the challenge.

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:36.450 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
spiritual growth is.

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you use most of
these tools we've talked about,

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:43.680 align:middle line:90%
what does that allow you to do?

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:48.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: It allows you to
simplify your environment.

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:53.730 align:middle line:84%
It's the complicated environment
that shuts us down, shuts down

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:55.020 align:middle line:90%
the intuition.

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:59.670 align:middle line:84%
It holds us back from accessing
our spirit guides, our higher

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:04.220 align:middle line:84%
self, and just
knowledge, in general.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: By doing that, should
we also live for the moment?

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:10.245 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Absolutely.

00:26:10.245 --> 00:26:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
you get into what

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:13.180 align:middle line:90%
you call a linear timeline?

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:14.242 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:26:14.242 --> 00:26:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Linear
timeline-- I like

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.900 align:middle line:84%
to talk about linear
timeline as it's the Monday,

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday deal.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.330 align:middle line:84%
When we come down
here, we put ourselves

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:23.890 align:middle line:90%
into this linear timeline.

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:26.500 align:middle line:84%
So we can have experiences
that you can only

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.300 align:middle line:90%
have in a linear timeline.

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Whether that be surprise, or
fear, or worry, or excitement,

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.940 align:middle line:84%
these are things that happen to
us emotionally as experiences

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:39.490 align:middle line:90%
in a linear timeline.

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And to be in that
moment is to be

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:45.320 align:middle line:90%
excited to be in linear time.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.990 align:middle line:90%
And so looking at--

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:51.130 align:middle line:84%
like, for example, now, I
look at different emotions

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:53.330 align:middle line:90%
in a slightly different way.

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:54.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited but not anxious.

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:57.400 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm excited
that I can be excited.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.080 align:middle line:90%
I know I'm in linear time.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.600 align:middle line:84%
I have something
to look forward to.

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a different way of
looking at everything.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we all grow
by doing things like this?

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Absolutely,
absolutely, inner work,

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.070 align:middle line:90%
any inner work you can do.

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Any healing, or
therapy, or anything

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:20.260 align:middle line:84%
that you do to
better yourself is

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:22.428 align:middle line:84%
going to better your
spiritual path as well.

00:27:22.428 --> 00:27:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isabeau, one
of our great friends,

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Mitch Horowitz, famous
author, of course,

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:30.310 align:middle line:84%
was on Gaia's Great Minds to
discuss exactly what you've

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:32.000 align:middle line:90%
been talking about.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCHELL HOROWITZ: There are
so many interesting questions

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:38.157 align:middle line:84%
about what creates reality,
where we're on our knees,

00:27:38.157 --> 00:27:39.240 align:middle line:90%
looking through a keyhole.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And we may never get more
than a keyhole picture of it

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:44.490 align:middle line:90%
during this lifetime.

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:47.260 align:middle line:84%
But there are
fascinating questions,

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:50.880 align:middle line:84%
for example, about
whether events

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:57.210 align:middle line:84%
that we experience as linear
are really linear after all.

00:27:57.210 --> 00:28:00.870 align:middle line:84%
In quantum physics, there's a
theory called the many worlds

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:03.510 align:middle line:84%
theories, which
proposes that there

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:07.110 align:middle line:84%
are infinite numbers of
outcomes going on around us

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:08.530 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:12.900 align:middle line:84%
But we experience a limited
conception of reality

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.820 align:middle line:90%
through our sensory organs.

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And we experience these
things in a linear fashion.

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.930 align:middle line:84%
When in fact, they're
going on in this kind

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:26.220 align:middle line:84%
of infinite circuitous fashion
that can't be mapped out

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:29.610 align:middle line:90%
on a line chart.

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:32.880 align:middle line:84%
William James reasoned
in 1902 that the mystic

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.570 align:middle line:84%
is like a microscope, that when
the mystic looks at something

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:38.550 align:middle line:84%
as through a microscope,
you're seeing

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:41.200 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of things going on.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.870 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing
cellular structure.

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:44.070 align:middle line:90%
You're seeing molecules.

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:45.090 align:middle line:90%
You're seeing atoms.

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:47.560 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing space
between things.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:51.480 align:middle line:84%
But when you pan back,
as with the camera,

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.220 align:middle line:84%
you're getting less
and less detail.

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:57.660 align:middle line:84%
So the coarseness of
our sensory organs

00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.840 align:middle line:84%
might not be sufficient
to really take

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:03.070 align:middle line:90%
in everything that's going on.

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:05.940 align:middle line:84%
But the quantum
physicist, the person

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:11.370 align:middle line:84%
looking through a microscope,
the astronomer looking

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:13.860 align:middle line:84%
through a nuclear
telescope, might be seeing

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:15.090 align:middle line:90%
things that are going on.

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:19.290 align:middle line:84%
The mystic, who has a
heightened intuitive ability,

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:21.450 align:middle line:84%
might be seeing things
that are going on

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:24.970 align:middle line:84%
in ways that we don't take in
in our normal day-to-day lives.

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:28.800 align:middle line:84%
So my challenge and the thing
that I'm trying to work with

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:34.080 align:middle line:84%
is whether linear events, as we
experience them exist, at all.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:38.910 align:middle line:84%
Or whether in fact, by the
very nature of our thoughts,

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:41.700 align:middle line:84%
we're not manifesting
things necessarily.

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:44.400 align:middle line:84%
But we are selecting
things, which

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:48.150 align:middle line:84%
is why it's so important
for the individual

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:50.730 align:middle line:84%
to have some sense of
awareness of the thoughts

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:53.950 align:middle line:84%
that are going on in his or
her head, which are nonstop.

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:57.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we all have these
running dialogues occurring,

00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:01.000 align:middle line:84%
not only every waking moment
but in our sleep as well.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He is so spot
on, Isabeau, isn't he?

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Yes,
absolutely, 100%.

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:07.530 align:middle line:90%
We are always manifesting.

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the
key to understanding

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.480 align:middle line:84%
how important it is to work
with that energetic body.

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
we do is manifesting.

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:20.680 align:middle line:84%
I love how he said, our
thoughts are choosing things.

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.470 align:middle line:90%
And that's how it happens.

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And eventually in opening
up to your intuition,

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.250 align:middle line:84%
you start to live a
life of synchronicities.

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere you go, you get
these beautiful synchronicities.

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:33.235 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:30:33.235 --> 00:30:34.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You shake
your head sometimes.

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:35.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: You do.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
so many of them.

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:38.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: You think, wow,
this is just incredible.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are simply fun,
and they don't have messages.

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:45.055 align:middle line:84%
They're just simply
a fun synchronicity

00:30:45.055 --> 00:30:45.930 align:middle line:90%
that happened to you.

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:47.230 align:middle line:90%
But you brought that.

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And when you can
live this path, you

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:52.770 align:middle line:84%
can live a life of
synchronicities.

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:54.420 align:middle line:90%
And it brings an extra--

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't know,
sparkle to the road.

00:30:56.910 --> 00:30:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Without doing this,
some of the things Mitch

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:02.340 align:middle line:84%
has talked about and some of
the things you've talked about,

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:05.290 align:middle line:84%
are we incomplete
as human beings?

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:06.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Oh, absolutely not.

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:08.340 align:middle line:84%
The cool thing about
being a human being

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:11.800 align:middle line:84%
is that you're perfect exactly
how you are in this moment

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:12.600 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We always were.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Absolutely,
and, for example,

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:20.880 align:middle line:84%
hearing the suggestion of doing
inner work on a show like this,

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.010 align:middle line:84%
if you're watching
the show, you made

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:25.590 align:middle line:84%
the decision that was
probably the inner work you

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:26.670 align:middle line:90%
wanted to start.

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:28.890 align:middle line:84%
So then you watched
the show that

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:32.440 align:middle line:84%
gave you the hint that
sparked you to do it.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:37.140 align:middle line:84%
So we're always perfect in
every moment that we are.

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:39.420 align:middle line:84%
I love what he said
about linear time.

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:41.430 align:middle line:90%
Because it's so true.

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Very early on, my guide
who is teaching me

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:47.695 align:middle line:84%
so much said, you're
not here to learn.

00:31:47.695 --> 00:31:50.070 align:middle line:84%
You're not-- that would say
that your higher self doesn't

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.820 align:middle line:90%
know anything.

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:51.862 align:middle line:90%
You're not here to learn.

00:31:51.862 --> 00:31:53.280 align:middle line:90%
You're here to experience.

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And the higher self does
not exist in linear time.

00:31:57.430 --> 00:32:00.090 align:middle line:84%
So the higher self
sees everything

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:02.430 align:middle line:84%
that's happened to you from
beginning to-- everything

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:04.440 align:middle line:84%
that's happened to you
in this entire lifetime

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.330 align:middle line:90%
happens in that instant.

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And I love how he
expressed that.

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is it important for
us to tap into our intuition?

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:17.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: I think it gives us
a different way of approaching

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.390 align:middle line:90%
life--

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:22.080 align:middle line:84%
more of a driver's
seat, you could say,

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.620 align:middle line:90%
instead of being a passenger.

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:24.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: More of being--

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:29.190 align:middle line:90%
it sparks your confidence.

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:32.610 align:middle line:84%
It gives you moments that
you could never have,

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:34.380 align:middle line:84%
if you didn't open
up intuitively.

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:37.650 align:middle line:84%
Like he said, when you can
see, and feel, and hear

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:42.210 align:middle line:84%
things that are in between,
it's a game changer.

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And it brings a level
of beauty into your life

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:49.440 align:middle line:84%
that no one could have explained
to me before I opened up.

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.380 align:middle line:90%
And it's absolutely beautiful.

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is it so
important to understand

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.670 align:middle line:90%
the spirit world, Isabeau?

00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:59.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: The spirit
world, it's so beautiful.

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's this huge complicated,
amazing realm of beauty.

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's important
for us to talk about it

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.680 align:middle line:84%
and to open up more
conversations around it.

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:20.380 align:middle line:84%
I find that by no one's
fault, in particular, we've

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:22.480 align:middle line:84%
leaned a little bit
into dehumanizing

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:26.860 align:middle line:84%
spirits and a little bit
more into the ghost culture.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:27.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Now,
don't get me wrong.

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:28.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is huge.

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:29.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: It's huge.

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:30.300 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:34.015 align:middle line:84%
And I love a good scary
movie or ghost story.

00:33:34.015 --> 00:33:35.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ghost story, sure.

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: I was on a
paranormal team for a while.

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:38.440 align:middle line:90%
We did ghost hunts.

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:39.970 align:middle line:84%
I think, those all
are incredible.

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:41.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You did a
good job on that, too.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.142 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Thank you.

00:33:42.142 --> 00:33:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
into ghost hunting.

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Yes, I was avid ghost
hunter for a number of years.

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:51.760 align:middle line:84%
But when-- we now, and
society hear the word ghost,

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.830 align:middle line:84%
we don't necessarily
instantly connect that

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:58.280 align:middle line:84%
with a person, a soul,
somebody who's perhaps stuck

00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.080 align:middle line:90%
and needs help.

00:33:59.080 --> 00:33:59.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, we don't.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.430 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of removed
from being a person.

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:01.972 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: It's been
kind of removed.

00:34:01.972 --> 00:34:05.950 align:middle line:84%
So for me, my passion
is to just remind people

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:07.540 align:middle line:90%
that ghosts are people, too.

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:10.420 align:middle line:90%
And yes, please go ghost hunts.

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:14.540 align:middle line:84%
Because that's really
important work in this world.

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:17.980 align:middle line:84%
But when you're done, if you
could just, in whatever way

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:20.949 align:middle line:84%
that you do it, say a prayer,
send some light energy,

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:24.489 align:middle line:84%
lift them up a little to help
them in their transition.

00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:27.340 align:middle line:84%
As long as we're not
taking advantage of that--

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:30.219 align:middle line:84%
because we've disconnected so
much that these are people,

00:34:30.219 --> 00:34:32.889 align:middle line:84%
that's really why I think
it's important to keep

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:35.199 align:middle line:84%
an open conversation
about the spiritual world

00:34:35.199 --> 00:34:38.139 align:middle line:84%
and remind people, this is
someone's son, or daughter,

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:43.840 align:middle line:84%
or friend who's in spirit form
that we're calling a ghost.

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:47.409 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
amazed at how you've

00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:50.440 align:middle line:84%
changed since the moment
your grandmother died?

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Look at this metamorphosis
you've gone through.

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Absolutely.

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:58.130 align:middle line:84%
I've got to say,
I'm a little nicer.

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:00.145 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mean, you
weren't this nice before?

00:35:00.145 --> 00:35:04.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: [LAUGHS] Oh, no.

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:05.800 align:middle line:90%
I was more impatient.

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:10.150 align:middle line:90%
I was a lot more judgmental.

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:11.890 align:middle line:90%
Because that's all I knew.

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And now, with this
perspective, it

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.510 align:middle line:84%
comes the ability to
unconditionally love anyone.

00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:20.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:22.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Because you
understand why they're here

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:23.640 align:middle line:90%
and what they're doing.

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.720 align:middle line:90%
There's still pain.

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.520 align:middle line:90%
There's still ups and downs.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:32.010 align:middle line:84%
But I would safely say that
I am very different than what

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:33.630 align:middle line:90%
I was when I opened.

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Spiritualist
Cindy Dale had a chance

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:40.170 align:middle line:84%
to talk to Lisa Garr again
on the inspirations program

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:43.440 align:middle line:84%
about the spirit community
in what she learned.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CINDY DALE: That's Belize.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:49.590 align:middle line:84%
I went to Belize the
first time with a friend.

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:53.098 align:middle line:84%
And it was another one of
those very not planned.

00:35:53.098 --> 00:35:54.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GARR: Trips do a lot of this.

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, I like
doing it that way.

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:57.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
bring a group like.

00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:58.980 align:middle line:84%
That would be a little
crazy, all right?

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:02.220 align:middle line:84%
We ended up out in the
Cayo Mountain region.

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:07.140 align:middle line:84%
We were two of the first
people to go into a mountain.

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:10.290 align:middle line:84%
We had to climb up a mountain
and go into the mountain.

00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And there were these
ladders that the--

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.240 align:middle line:84%
yeah, the archeologists
had just put in.

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:18.150 align:middle line:84%
Because there was an
ancient ceremonial site

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:19.650 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
the mountain that

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:22.950 align:middle line:84%
was still preserved for
hundreds and hundreds of years.

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:26.440 align:middle line:84%
It was like the spirits were
still there of these people.

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:27.240 align:middle line:90%
But

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GARR: When you go into a place
like that, you really have it.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: You have
to be honorable.

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:31.560 align:middle line:90%
You can't touch things.

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:32.820 align:middle line:90%
You don't take things.

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:34.260 align:middle line:90%
You don't disturb.

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:39.030 align:middle line:84%
You ask if it's even OK for
you to tune into the place,

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:43.170 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with those
who might still be lingering.

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:44.550 align:middle line:90%
Like you have to get permission.

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GARR: That's responsible.

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:45.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It is.

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:45.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GARR: That's good.

00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So then we
led a group down there

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.910 align:middle line:84%
to enable them to have the
same experience as well.

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:53.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GARR: And what was it
that you experienced?

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I kept saying--

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:56.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm very visual and very
clairvoyant, especially,

00:36:56.770 --> 00:36:57.570 align:middle line:90%
the first time.

00:36:57.570 --> 00:37:00.430 align:middle line:84%
I kept seeing the
stories of the people.

00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:02.880 align:middle line:84%
I kept seeing them
when they were alive,

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.830 align:middle line:84%
and how they took care
of their children,

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:07.380 align:middle line:84%
and how they took
care of each other.

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:09.150 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't all great mystery.

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:10.470 align:middle line:90%
It was village.

00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:11.970 align:middle line:90%
It was community.

00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:12.930 align:middle line:90%
It was care.

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:14.010 align:middle line:90%
It was love.

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And that became the
theme of the group.

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Like, in what way are we
blocking that in our own lives?

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And in what way can we create
that amongst ourselves?

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isabeau, why is it
so important, and I like that,

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:29.240 align:middle line:90%
to deal with the spirit world?

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:31.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: The
spirit worlds really

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:34.940 align:middle line:84%
should function for the
highest good of all.

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And when somebody
passes, if they

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:41.560 align:middle line:84%
don't complete their
transition and cross over,

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:45.250 align:middle line:84%
then they can't, in turn,
watch out over their loved ones

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:47.960 align:middle line:84%
as they're still continuing
their journey here on Earth.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:48.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: And I feel it's
really important to help any

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:53.050 align:middle line:90%
spirit that is stuck--

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:55.060 align:middle line:84%
love what she said
about permission.

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:58.420 align:middle line:84%
I am very big into asking
permission for everything.

00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Even if you intuitively
read another person,

00:38:00.370 --> 00:38:01.810 align:middle line:90%
ask permission first.

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:04.480 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to do a
clearing, ask permission first.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From who?

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: From--

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who do you
ask permission from?

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: I'll ask permission
from a living person

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:12.080 align:middle line:84%
if I get intuitive
information on them.

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.030 align:middle line:84%
I'll ask permission
first if I can

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:15.570 align:middle line:90%
give the information to them.

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:16.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:17.592 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Absolutely.

00:38:17.592 --> 00:38:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if you were
doing a reading for me,

00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:21.360 align:middle line:90%
you would get my approval first?

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Yes.

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:23.035 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Makes sense.

00:38:23.035 --> 00:38:24.620 align:middle line:90%
Why do you need to do that?

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:27.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Because perhaps,
the moment between us

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:29.750 align:middle line:84%
wasn't necessarily about
getting the information.

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:31.520 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the moment
was simply you

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:34.660 align:middle line:84%
being asked if you're open
to intuitive information.

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:36.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what if I wasn't?

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Then that would
be the exact moment for you.

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And you would say, I'm
not comfortable with that.

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you back out?

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:42.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: And I
would say, absolutely.

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you sure, you
don't secretly still do it?

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: No, I don't
secretly still do it.

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:48.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's find out
about George's spirit.

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Let's find
out about George's.

00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:51.145 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's see
what's going on there.

00:38:51.145 --> 00:38:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: It's really
important to ask permission,

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:56.370 align:middle line:84%
because it's not my
place nor is it--

00:38:56.370 --> 00:38:59.510 align:middle line:84%
I think, anyone else's
to decide when someone

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:02.090 align:middle line:84%
is ready for
information, or when

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:04.250 align:middle line:90%
someone is ready to cross over.

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:07.907 align:middle line:84%
If you walk into
a situation, where

00:39:07.907 --> 00:39:09.740 align:middle line:84%
you run into a lot of
spirits that are still

00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:12.740 align:middle line:84%
in the in-between, it's
not my place to say,

00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:14.300 align:middle line:84%
whether they should
be there or not.

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:17.150 align:middle line:84%
It's my place to ask,
do they need help?

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the spirits
sad because they've

00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:23.390 align:middle line:90%
died and passed over?

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:24.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: It really varies.

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:28.460 align:middle line:84%
I've seen so many
different situations

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:31.080 align:middle line:90%
of spirits that are in between.

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.570 align:middle line:90%
I've seen confusion.

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:33.870 align:middle line:90%
I've seen panic.

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:35.030 align:middle line:90%
I've seen sadness.

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:36.230 align:middle line:90%
I've seen aggression.

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:37.160 align:middle line:90%
I've seen--

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:38.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Evil?

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:41.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Yeah, I've seen
the really hard stuff, too.

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.400 align:middle line:90%
And it all depends.

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:45.005 align:middle line:84%
You could have a
mom who doesn't want

00:39:45.005 --> 00:39:46.880 align:middle line:84%
to leave because her
kid's going to graduate.

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And she doesn't understand
that she can still be there

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:51.440 align:middle line:90%
for him when she crosses over.

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:54.260 align:middle line:84%
I have crossed over a woman,
who was in a car accident,

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:57.630 align:middle line:84%
went on a bad trip with
drugs, and was just terrified,

00:39:57.630 --> 00:40:00.330 align:middle line:84%
thinking she still
was on that trip.

00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:02.850 align:middle line:90%
So there's confusion.

00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:05.090 align:middle line:90%
It's all across the board.

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And for some individuals,
who caused emotional harm--

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:11.030 align:middle line:84%
physical and emotional
harm to other people

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:14.300 align:middle line:84%
when they were living,
sometimes when they pass,

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:17.360 align:middle line:84%
instead of completing their
transition process out

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:20.840 align:middle line:84%
of fear of what's going
to happen to them now,

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:22.460 align:middle line:90%
they'll hold still.

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:26.660 align:middle line:84%
They'll dig their heels into
that escalator, stop moving,

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:27.560 align:middle line:90%
and hold still.

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll turn around
and do what brings them comfort

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:32.750 align:middle line:90%
and what soothes them.

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what
you see in between

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:38.000 align:middle line:84%
is spirits trying to
soothe themselves,

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.430 align:middle line:84%
trying to find a way to
find solace where they're at

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:42.350 align:middle line:90%
but not move.

00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happens
to a spirit whose human

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:49.230 align:middle line:84%
body died quickly and
unexpectedly, like a car

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:50.070 align:middle line:90%
accident?

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:51.540 align:middle line:90%
You're driving along.

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:52.800 align:middle line:90%
You're having a good time.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.780 align:middle line:90%
You're listening to the radio.

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
you get hit by a car,

00:40:56.730 --> 00:40:58.410 align:middle line:90%
and you're dead instantly.

00:40:58.410 --> 00:40:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: Mm-hmm.

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:00.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happens to them?

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:02.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: A lot of confusion--

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:04.560 align:middle line:84%
and I can't speak
to, what happens

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:05.920 align:middle line:90%
to every single one of them.

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:09.270 align:middle line:84%
But what I can say is
we have three bodies.

00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:middle line:90%
We have our physical body.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:14.315 align:middle line:84%
We have our spiritual energetic
body, like we talked about.

00:41:14.315 --> 00:41:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And then, we have
the programming body,

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.580 align:middle line:90%
which is our human mind.

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:22.860 align:middle line:84%
When we die, we release
the physical body first,

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:24.990 align:middle line:84%
which leaves us with
that energetic body

00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:26.220 align:middle line:90%
and that programming body.

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:29.460 align:middle line:84%
So in essence, George,
we're the exact same person,

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:32.310 align:middle line:90%
we just now don't have a body.

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And for many, that's
a state of confusion.

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of course,
who wouldn't be?

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:38.465 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Yeah,
that's-- what do I do?

00:41:38.465 --> 00:41:40.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand
what's happening.

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:41.850 align:middle line:90%
And I run into that a lot.

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:43.770 align:middle line:90%
I run into that a lot--

00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:46.420 align:middle line:84%
take a trip to the
grocery store and run

00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:47.670 align:middle line:90%
into somebody that wanders in.

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:48.712 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, you're OK.

00:41:48.712 --> 00:41:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do spirits
come at you like crazy?

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: They do.

00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:53.820 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:56.400 align:middle line:90%
Because it's really my calling.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Intuitives, people that walk a
really strong spiritual path,

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:03.550 align:middle line:84%
they all have their own
calling in different areas.

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:04.770 align:middle line:90%
Some work with Mother Earth.

00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:06.400 align:middle line:90%
Some work with spirits.

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.520 align:middle line:84%
Some work with
people who are dying.

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And my calling really is
to help spirits cross over.

00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And once they
do, are they thankful?

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:17.058 align:middle line:90%
>>MAXWELL: I think so.

00:42:17.058 --> 00:42:19.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say it that way,
because most of the time,

00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:20.260 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:20.580 align:middle line:10%
I don't know--

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:21.718 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: One day you will.

00:42:21.718 --> 00:42:23.010 align:middle line:10%
>>MAXWELL: And one day, I will.

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:24.720 align:middle line:10%
I haven't crossed
over that line.

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:27.600 align:middle line:10%
Occasionally, someone will
come back and say, thank you.

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And it, still to this day,
warms my heart to tears really.

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:34.075 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful thing to see.

00:42:34.075 --> 00:42:36.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isabeau, thank you
for being on "Beyond Belief."

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MAXWELL: Thank
you for having me.

00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:39.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And for people who want
more information about you, how

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.010 align:middle line:90%
do they find you?

00:42:41.010 --> 00:42:43.830 align:middle line:10%
>>MAXWELL: They can find
me at thesagemethod.com.

00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:45.420 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Perfect.

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:49.560 align:middle line:10%
You've got a remarkable ability
to be able to communicate

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:51.270 align:middle line:10%
with those from the other side.

00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:54.390 align:middle line:10%
Because one day, we'll
all be there too.

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:55.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
