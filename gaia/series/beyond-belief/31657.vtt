00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:14.681 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; And I think many people
today don't know what

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:15.749 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
to believe anymore.

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.417 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; People are basically
going to keep on--

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:19.286 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
to tell what really happened.

00:00:19.286 --> 00:00:22.589 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:24.124 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:26.260 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
We weren't told the
entire story.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.898 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
[ Music ]

00:00:30.898 --> 00:00:34.401 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; And now the host of the
nationally syndicated Coast

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:37.938 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
to Coast AM and GAIAM TV
bring you Beyond Belief

00:00:37.938 --> 00:00:39.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
with George Noory.

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:42.442 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; George Noory: Well,
welcome to beyond belief.

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:44.611 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Now, I don't want
to seem morbid,

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:48.782 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
but one day none of
you will be here.

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:50.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
You're all going to die.

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:53.253 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
But if you believe
in the afterlife

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:56.290 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that existence continues
forever.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.228 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Our special guest on Beyond
Belief deals with the afterlife,

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:04.898 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Flipside is his work,
Richard Martini our guest.

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:08.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
Richard, [applause] how are you?

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:09.803 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Richard Martini: Intrigued.

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:13.073 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; George Noory: You know it's
kind of a sad feeling to know

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:16.176 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that all of us one day
are not going to be here.

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.211 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
Well, sort of.

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:19.012 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Richard Martini:
It's a matter

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:20.180 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
of perspective now isn't it?

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; George Noory: It sure is.

00:01:21.348 --> 00:01:22.783 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; Richard Martini:
Because if we do continue

00:01:22.783 --> 00:01:26.086 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
on then are we gone,
that's the question.

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:27.421 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; George Noory:
That's the question.

00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:28.755 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Richard Martini: So, it's
a little bit like a friend

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:32.960 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
of yours stepping off the
train that's going to Chicago.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.528 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
They're no longer on
the train with you,

00:01:34.528 --> 00:01:36.697 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
but you know they exist.

00:01:36.697 --> 00:01:40.434 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
You can't access them, but you
know they're still somewhere

00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:42.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
along the trail.

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:43.737 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
So, that's the good news.

00:01:43.737 --> 00:01:44.938 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; George Noory: The bad
news is we don't want

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:46.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
to leave anytime soon.

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:47.240 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Richard Martini:
Yea that's right.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.375 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
Well, we don't.

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:52.579 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And it's a shame when
our close loved ones go,

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.250 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
but you know sometimes it's
their time whether it was an

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.752 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
agreement they had or something.

00:01:58.752 --> 00:02:00.787 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I don't-- you know Roger
Ebert as you know--

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:01.922 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; George Noory: Sure, yea.

00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:02.956 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; Richard Martini:
Passed away recently.

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:03.957 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; George Noory: He
was one of the best.

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:04.925 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; Richard Martini:
One of the best.

00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:06.326 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
But, it's an unusual
story with Roger

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:09.629 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
because he passed away
about six years ago.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.101 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And he was in a hospital and
his wife Chaz whom I've met,

00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:16.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
wonderful, wonderful person.

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:20.440 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
She was there with him and
she heard him say to her

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.944 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
after he had passed,
I'm still here.

00:02:23.944 --> 00:02:25.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I still have things to do.

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:28.248 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; George Noory: Was she
told reviewing movies.

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:29.783 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Richard Martini: Well,
you need to tell the doctors

00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:32.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
to revive me so she did.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:33.420 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; GN: And he came back.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.388 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; RM: And he came back.

00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:35.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
But what's unusual about that is

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:38.592 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
when just before he passed
he wrote this wonderful essay

00:02:38.592 --> 00:02:40.460 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
about his love for her.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.596 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But, he pointed out in the
essay he still didn't believe

00:02:42.596 --> 00:02:45.265 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
in the afterlife or that
there was an afterlife.

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:49.636 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And here the most cherished
person on the planet,

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:52.606 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the love of his life
actually could prove it.

00:02:52.606 --> 00:02:53.640 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
&gt;&gt; GN: Right.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.542 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; RM: Because he
was clinically dead.

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:58.812 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
He spoke to her proving that
there is consciousness--

00:02:58.812 --> 00:02:59.479 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yea.

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:00.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; RM: After we die.

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:01.548 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; GN: They probably
saved him because of that.

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:02.482 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; RM: They did, absolutely

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:03.884 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
because she insisted
on the doctors.

00:03:03.884 --> 00:03:05.752 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And the doctor said, "Oh you
know I'm sorry but he's gone."

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:06.420 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yea, but he's emotional.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.120 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
You know he's gone.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.954 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; RM: Yea he's gone.

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:10.557 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
But, no she brought him back.

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:13.727 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So, you know the
point is listen a lot

00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:15.429 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
of people don't believe
in the afterlife.

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:16.563 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
They don't believe in research.

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:17.998 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
They don't believe
in a lot of things.

00:03:17.998 --> 00:03:20.567 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But, you know for those who've
had the personal experience

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:22.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
of doing it or being there--

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:23.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; GN: You believe in it though.

00:03:23.236 --> 00:03:23.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; RM: Yea you do.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
You just--

00:03:25.072 --> 00:03:26.239 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; GN: Have you ever had any
doubts because I did once?

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.541 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
I'll tell you about
that in a second.

00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:28.075 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:13%
But--

00:03:28.075 --> 00:03:29.209 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
&gt;&gt; RM: Well--

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.277 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; GN: Have you ever
doubted its existence?

00:03:30.277 --> 00:03:31.344 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; RM: Sure, of course.

00:03:31.344 --> 00:03:33.013 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I mean you know as
a little kid growing

00:03:33.013 --> 00:03:34.948 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
up I was always told you
know well this is what

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:36.283 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
really happens.

00:03:36.283 --> 00:03:39.686 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And then at some point you
start to examine the research.

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:41.254 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Okay, well everybody
says you know

00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:43.023 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
when we die there's
nothing beyond it.

00:03:43.023 --> 00:03:46.526 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
But, wait a second
Uncle Pete showed up

00:03:46.526 --> 00:03:49.096 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and saw Aunt Betty
so what was that?

00:03:49.096 --> 00:03:50.263 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; GN: What was that
all about, yea.

00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:51.698 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; RM: So, you kind
of put that aside.

00:03:51.698 --> 00:03:53.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
You go well it could
have been imagined.

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:55.869 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
But anyway, my point
is at some point as I--

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:58.205 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
it happened in my life,
at some point you get

00:03:58.205 --> 00:03:59.773 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
to where you would start

00:03:59.773 --> 00:04:02.375 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
to examine the research
in a more fully way.

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:06.379 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And then if you can examine
research that is replicable,

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:07.747 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
which is what science is.

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:11.284 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
You know science has to be--
you have to examine something

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:14.187 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and then it has to be replicated
in order for it to be science.

00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:15.222 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
And once you get to a place

00:04:15.222 --> 00:04:17.924 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
where you can replicate
things proving

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:21.228 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that people are still
existing beyond.

00:04:21.228 --> 00:04:22.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
But, what happened to you?

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.163 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; GN: Well, I had
a friend of mine.

00:04:23.163 --> 00:04:25.098 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
He died in a motorcycle
accident.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:28.335 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I have never doubted the
existence of the afterlife,

00:04:28.335 --> 00:04:31.738 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
but for one split moment I did.

00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:35.675 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I went to his funeral, hate
these things, but I did.

00:04:35.675 --> 00:04:39.846 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And I'm looking at him in
the casket and it hit me.

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:40.881 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
That was it.

00:04:40.881 --> 00:04:42.749 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
There's no more.

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:46.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
He's gone, over, done.

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:53.093 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
It was the coldest, darkest,
scariest feeling I've ever had,

00:04:53.093 --> 00:04:57.531 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
a feeling of total
incompleteness.

00:04:57.531 --> 00:05:00.767 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And as I looked at him
it started coming back

00:05:00.767 --> 00:05:02.769 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
to the old George
again that oh no, no,

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:05.405 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
wait a minute there
is an afterlife.

00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:08.408 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
He's moved onto another
plane of existence.

00:05:08.408 --> 00:05:13.013 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Its part of this universe, its
energy, whatever it might be

00:05:13.013 --> 00:05:16.216 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and it continues
and then I was fine.

00:05:16.216 --> 00:05:19.052 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But, for that split moment
it was the worst feeling I've

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:19.719 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
ever had.

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:21.154 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; RM: Interesting.

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:24.724 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Was there any kind of an example
or anything that came to mind

00:05:24.724 --> 00:05:27.561 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
with relating you know
to him afterwards?

00:05:27.561 --> 00:05:28.828 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; GN: No, nothing.

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:31.898 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I mean there have been no
signs that he's out there

00:05:31.898 --> 00:05:33.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
or anything like that.

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:37.537 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
But, it was just this
void I felt thinking

00:05:37.537 --> 00:05:41.408 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
about the possibility that
it just doesn't exist.

00:05:41.408 --> 00:05:43.777 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And I guess the bottom
line is when we do pass

00:05:43.777 --> 00:05:47.614 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
over we're either going to know
or we're not going to know.

00:05:47.614 --> 00:05:48.748 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; RM: Well yea, that's right.

00:05:48.748 --> 00:05:51.218 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; GN: And if we're not
going to know so what.

00:05:51.218 --> 00:05:52.552 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
&gt;&gt; RM: Right.

00:05:52.552 --> 00:05:55.722 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Well, you know that is true,
but I've heard so many cases

00:05:55.722 --> 00:05:57.857 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
of people because I've
been gathering this stuff

00:05:57.857 --> 00:05:58.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
as a documentary--

00:05:58.525 --> 00:05:59.125 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
&gt;&gt; GN: For years.

00:05:59.125 --> 00:05:59.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; RM: Filmmaker--

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:00.427 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yea.

00:06:00.427 --> 00:06:01.595 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; RM: For years now.

00:06:01.595 --> 00:06:02.729 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I've heard so many cases
where people have had

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:05.465 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that experience you know
of that loss, of course.

00:06:05.465 --> 00:06:08.101 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And you honor that loss
because it is a loss.

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:11.204 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
You're not going to be able to
see that person as they were,

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:13.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
embrace them as they were.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.177 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
However, frequently
and many times--

00:06:17.177 --> 00:06:18.878 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
well, let me give you
my own personal example.

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:21.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
My dad passed away in 2004

00:06:21.514 --> 00:06:24.718 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and the night he
passed I felt his hand

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:26.052 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
on my shoulder wake me up.

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:26.886 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; GN: The night he passed.

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:28.388 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; RM: The night he passed.

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:29.556 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yea.

00:06:29.556 --> 00:06:30.890 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; RM: And he had had
Alzheimer's and he hadn't,

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.927 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I hadn't heard him speak a
sentence in three or four years.

00:06:33.927 --> 00:06:36.096 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And he said very
clearly in my ear,

00:06:36.096 --> 00:06:39.065 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I'm experiencing
indescribable joy.

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:40.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
&gt;&gt; GN: Ah.

00:06:40.667 --> 00:06:43.737 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; RM: The next day I said to my
mom, you know did dad ever say,

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:45.372 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
I never heard him say
a phrase like that?

00:06:45.372 --> 00:06:48.008 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And she said, "Well, it was very
rare, but when he saw something

00:06:48.008 --> 00:06:51.111 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that was really beautiful he
would say it was indescribable."

00:06:51.111 --> 00:06:54.080 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
The next night he woke me again.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.517 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
This time I actually heard
him walking down the hallway

00:06:57.517 --> 00:06:59.252 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and I felt him come
into the room.

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:01.021 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
And so, I was wide awake.

00:07:01.021 --> 00:07:05.025 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Uh oh you know now I'm
going to experience this.

00:07:05.025 --> 00:07:08.461 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And I heard him say I need
you to write something down.

00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:10.130 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
And sort of just the way I am

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.499 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
with my family I had
an argument with him.

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:13.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; GN: Uh huh.

00:07:13.566 --> 00:07:15.135 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; RM: Dad come on I'm
sleeping, you know.

00:07:15.135 --> 00:07:16.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; GN: Just tell me alone.

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:17.337 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; RM: What is it?

00:07:17.337 --> 00:07:18.638 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
You know what is
the thing you need?

00:07:18.638 --> 00:07:20.040 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
I'll remember it.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.876 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And he said, "You need
to write this down."

00:07:22.876 --> 00:07:24.210 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
Okay, so I got up.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.314 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I turned the light on found a
piece of paper and a pencil.

00:07:27.314 --> 00:07:28.581 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I thought well that
will be the end of that

00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:30.684 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and then I turned off the
light and I heard his voice.

00:07:30.684 --> 00:07:33.219 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And he said, "Tell your
mother I'm here with"

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:34.988 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and he named all these
people I've never met.

00:07:34.988 --> 00:07:36.189 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; GN: That you didn't know.

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:38.758 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; RM: Never heard of,
that she knew, of course,

00:07:38.758 --> 00:07:40.994 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and then he had very
specific messages

00:07:40.994 --> 00:07:43.229 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
to each one of my brothers.

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:45.765 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And at the end of
that each message,

00:07:45.765 --> 00:07:47.534 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
which I didn't understand,
but they did--

00:07:47.534 --> 00:07:48.902 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; GN: They did, yea.

00:07:48.902 --> 00:07:52.072 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; RM: At the end I asked him,
so why are you telling me this?

00:07:52.072 --> 00:07:53.573 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
You know why not one
of my other brothers?

00:07:53.573 --> 00:07:54.908 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yea.

00:07:54.908 --> 00:07:57.577 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; RM: And very simply he said,
"Because you can hear me."

00:07:57.577 --> 00:07:59.045 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; GN: So, you had that ability?

00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:03.450 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; RM: Well, if you think of
consciousness as an FM receiver,

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:07.587 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
okay, as a human we certainly
pick up different things.

00:08:07.587 --> 00:08:09.389 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Everybody has a different
ability to--

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:10.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; GN: We sure do.

00:08:10.724 --> 00:08:13.193 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; RM: To experience emotions
and energies and feelings.

00:08:13.193 --> 00:08:17.464 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Everybody's different and some
people perhaps the frequency

00:08:17.464 --> 00:08:21.034 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
on your tuner is just a little
bit different and you more

00:08:21.034 --> 00:08:24.571 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
than anybody else on the planet
really have met quite a few

00:08:24.571 --> 00:08:26.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
really well tuned individuals.

00:08:26.072 --> 00:08:27.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; GN: Absolutely.

00:08:27.307 --> 00:08:30.343 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; RM: You know they hear,
they see, they sense.

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:32.812 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Some people will tell you it's
just a matter of learning it.

00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:34.481 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
Maybe it's not.

00:08:34.481 --> 00:08:38.051 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
But, the point is, is trying
to open yourself up to it

00:08:38.051 --> 00:08:43.056 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that it's a possibility that I
might be getting a communication

00:08:43.056 --> 00:08:45.024 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and it seems to be
more prevalent.

00:08:45.024 --> 00:08:46.393 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
Am I wrong?

00:08:46.393 --> 00:08:48.561 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I mean you more than anybody
else, you would experience this.

00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:49.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; GN: It's growing.

00:08:49.229 --> 00:08:49.896 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; RM: It seems to be--

00:08:49.896 --> 00:08:50.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; GN: It's growing.

00:08:50.497 --> 00:08:51.731 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
&gt;&gt; RM: Growing.

00:08:51.731 --> 00:08:53.032 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And I'm sure the audience
has experienced that too.

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:55.368 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
More people, maybe it's
because of the internet is

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:56.336 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
such an open place.

00:08:56.336 --> 00:08:57.170 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; GN: That could be too.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:58.238 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; RM: You know and we access--

00:08:58.238 --> 00:08:59.005 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; GN: Or networking too.

00:08:59.005 --> 00:09:00.373 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; RM: So many things.

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.208 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Yea, we can all see it our
little thing you know while

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:03.410 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
we're walking down the street.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.579 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Its all-- but I heard
somebody say the other day,

00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:09.883 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
my wife was actually
attending a class

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:11.985 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
where they were teaching
you how to be more in touch

00:09:11.985 --> 00:09:13.353 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
with your inner voice.

00:09:13.353 --> 00:09:14.721 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; GN: Uh huh.

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:16.890 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; RM: And they passed around a
photograph and it was a picture

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
of her boss who had passed away.

00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:23.029 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And the boss came through
very clearly, very descriptive

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:27.066 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
who he was, etc. etc. and the
medium, the practicing medium--

00:09:27.066 --> 00:09:28.401 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
&gt;&gt; GN: Sure.

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:29.536 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; RM: Trying to learn that
said, "So why are you coming

00:09:29.536 --> 00:09:31.471 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
through so clearly today?"

00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:34.340 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And he said, "Because
the veil is thinning."

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.575 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; GN: Uh huh.

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:37.076 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; RM: So, what does that mean?

00:09:37.076 --> 00:09:38.211 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
I don't know.

00:09:38.211 --> 00:09:41.381 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
You know are solar
flares affecting the veil?

00:09:41.381 --> 00:09:44.083 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Is our consciousness of
being able to communicate

00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:48.421 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
on such a grand scale
so instantly affecting

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
or is it an emergency?

00:09:50.857 --> 00:09:52.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
You know are, the nature

00:09:52.358 --> 00:09:55.829 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
of the planet being a healthy
place top return to let's say

00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:59.399 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
if you consider reincarnation
in this mix.

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:02.769 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
You know maybe it's important
that we have fresh water

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:03.903 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
and you know clean air.

00:10:03.903 --> 00:10:05.205 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
&gt;&gt; GN: Maybe they
know something--

00:10:05.205 --> 00:10:07.240 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; RM: Maybe they know
something that we need to know

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.075 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
and maybe that's
why the veil is.

00:10:09.075 --> 00:10:10.944 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
But, I think you know you
just want to honor it.

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:11.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
You don't want to fear it.

00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:13.413 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
You want to honor
it in some ways

00:10:13.413 --> 00:10:15.081 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
like okay what can
I learn from this?

00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:16.516 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; GN: Tell me about
your filmmaking Rich.

00:10:16.516 --> 00:10:17.417 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
We're going to show
a little clip

00:10:17.417 --> 00:10:18.551 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
in a second, but [inaudible]

00:10:18.551 --> 00:10:21.020 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; RM: Okay, well I'll
tell you I've been a

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
traditional filmmaker.

00:10:22.255 --> 00:10:24.791 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I have written and or
directed like eight features.

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:26.926 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I worked with Bridget
Fonda and Charles Grodin

00:10:26.926 --> 00:10:28.094 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
and different great actors.

00:10:28.094 --> 00:10:29.295 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yea.

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:30.630 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; RM: And then somewhere
along the line like all

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:34.467 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
of us you feel a desire to
continue documenting and seeing

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:36.936 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and filming stuff, so I
started making documentaries.

00:10:36.936 --> 00:10:38.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
I went to Tibet.

00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:41.207 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I made a documentary with
Robert Thurman, Uma's dad.

00:10:41.207 --> 00:10:42.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; GN: Uh huh.

00:10:42.442 --> 00:10:44.944 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; RM: And ultimately that
led to me to sort of say,

00:10:44.944 --> 00:10:48.314 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
well this isn't, I can just
follow my passion, you know.

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:49.282 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; GN: I like this.

00:10:49.282 --> 00:10:50.450 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; RM: Yea.

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:51.885 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
A painter doesn't always
pick up the paintbrush

00:10:51.885 --> 00:10:53.820 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
to pay the rent, right.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.255 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
&gt;&gt; GN: Exactly.

00:10:55.255 --> 00:10:56.456 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; RM: And sometimes you pick
it up because it inspires you.

00:10:56.456 --> 00:11:00.493 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So, you know the story I
had come across this work

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:03.463 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
of Michael Newton, the
great psychologist--

00:11:03.463 --> 00:11:04.497 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; GN: A journey of soul.

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:06.065 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; RM: And author
and hypnotherapist.

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:09.135 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And I went, wow this guy's
story is really interesting.

00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:11.471 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
I wonder if I can interview him

00:11:11.471 --> 00:11:13.740 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and I contacted their
organization.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.909 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
They said well he's
not-- he's retired.

00:11:15.909 --> 00:11:17.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; GN: Uh huh.

00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:18.778 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; RM: But, we're doing a
conference that he'll be at so

00:11:18.778 --> 00:11:20.680 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
if you want to come by you can.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
I thought great.

00:11:22.215 --> 00:11:25.718 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
But, I went and met him
and felt that I was--

00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:26.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
my heart was in the right place.

00:11:26.953 --> 00:11:27.787 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
&gt;&gt; GN: Right.

00:11:27.787 --> 00:11:28.521 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; RM: He said I'm going to--

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:29.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; GN: That's important.

00:11:29.255 --> 00:11:29.789 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; RM: That's important--

00:11:29.789 --> 00:11:31.024 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yea.

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:31.591 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; RM: Because he granted
me his last interview.

00:11:31.591 --> 00:11:32.692 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
&gt;&gt; GN: Right.

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:33.893 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; RM: He said-- you
know he's still around.

00:11:33.893 --> 00:11:34.928 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
You know he's still, he's
retired, but he said,

00:11:34.928 --> 00:11:36.095 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
"I'm not doing this anymore."

00:11:36.095 --> 00:11:37.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; GN: He's done, yea.

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:38.598 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; RM: So, I thought
that was interesting.

00:11:38.598 --> 00:11:39.399 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yea.

00:11:39.399 --> 00:11:40.633 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; RM: My last interview.

00:11:40.633 --> 00:11:42.101 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; GN: Now, let's take a
little glance at one of your--

00:11:42.101 --> 00:11:43.603 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; RM: Okay, great.

00:11:43.603 --> 00:11:44.437 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
&gt;&gt; GN: Works.

00:11:44.437 --> 00:11:45.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
&gt;&gt; RM: Terrific.

00:11:45.071 --> 00:11:46.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; GN: Here we go.

00:11:46.439 --> 00:11:48.141 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; It's a [inaudible] between
life regression is at least four

00:11:48.141 --> 00:11:50.476 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
and a half hours long.

00:11:50.476 --> 00:11:53.880 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And the reason it has to be
so long is because one needs

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.283 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to achieve a certain level
of trans-depth in order

00:11:57.283 --> 00:11:59.252 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
to access the super
conscious mind.

00:11:59.252 --> 00:12:01.988 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Now, the super conscious
mind is the mind

00:12:01.988 --> 00:12:03.590 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
that has the soul memories.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:04.958 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; He was getting a
little ahead of me.

00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.961 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
He was actually a little deeper
than I thought and he jumped

00:12:07.961 --> 00:12:10.763 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
into the past life as a
soldier in World War I

00:12:10.763 --> 00:12:12.899 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
and he was being bayoneted.

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:17.403 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
When it was all over he said
he was feeling better already

00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:19.038 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and he called me a few
days later and he said,

00:12:19.038 --> 00:12:20.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
"There's no more pain.

00:12:20.006 --> 00:12:21.908 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
My wife really wants
to thank you."

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:23.676 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Well, I wasn't satisfied
with that.

00:12:23.676 --> 00:12:27.547 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I didn't tell him this, but I
contacted the British War Office

00:12:27.547 --> 00:12:29.582 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
and the Imperial
Museum in London.

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:31.417 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Sure enough there
was such a person

00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:34.754 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and he existed and
he died in 1960.

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:38.725 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So, from that case I began
taking past life clients.

00:12:38.725 --> 00:12:42.261 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And so, I came kicking and
screaming into this movement.

00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:45.398 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; GN: Very good, very
good indeed, "Flipside."

00:12:45.398 --> 00:12:48.101 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; RM: "Flipside" yea and
that was Michael Newton.

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:48.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
You got a chance--

00:12:48.735 --> 00:12:49.936 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yea.

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:50.603 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; RM: To hear a little
bit of that last interview.

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:51.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; GN: Absolutely.

00:12:51.404 --> 00:12:52.105 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; RM: It's unusual stuff.

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:53.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; GN: Was he intuitive?

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:55.274 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
How did he pick up
these feelings?

00:12:55.274 --> 00:12:57.644 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; RM: Well, you know what's
wonderful about Newton's story

00:12:57.644 --> 00:13:00.947 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and I think it appeals to a
lot of people for this reason.

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:02.749 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
He was a complete skeptic.

00:13:02.749 --> 00:13:07.286 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
He was a practicing psychologist
in Los Angeles in the 1950's

00:13:07.286 --> 00:13:09.489 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and the Bridey Murphy
case happened.

00:13:09.489 --> 00:13:10.657 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; GN: Oh sure, huge case.

00:13:10.657 --> 00:13:11.991 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
&gt;&gt; RM: Huge case.

00:13:11.991 --> 00:13:13.993 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It was a woman who remembered
a past life in Ireland and,

00:13:13.993 --> 00:13:16.062 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
"Time" magazine,
they all covered it.

00:13:16.062 --> 00:13:17.897 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And so, psychologists
started getting calls

00:13:17.897 --> 00:13:20.566 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
from people saying hey I want
to do a past life regression.

00:13:20.566 --> 00:13:21.701 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yea.

00:13:21.701 --> 00:13:23.269 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; RM: And he said, "I
don't believe in it.

00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:24.504 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
I just don't.

00:13:24.504 --> 00:13:26.739 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
You know its not-- I don't
think it's worthwhile."

00:13:26.739 --> 00:13:28.408 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
So, then he had this client,

00:13:28.408 --> 00:13:30.877 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
which is the story he
was telling that came

00:13:30.877 --> 00:13:33.579 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
in with a psychosomatic
illness, a pain in his shoulder

00:13:33.579 --> 00:13:36.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
that no doctor could identify.

00:13:36.449 --> 00:13:38.284 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
And in the case of you know

00:13:38.284 --> 00:13:42.188 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
of examining it he gave him the
command let's go to the source

00:13:42.188 --> 00:13:47.193 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of your illness and he jumped
into this past life of a soldier

00:13:47.193 --> 00:13:49.395 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
in World War I who
was being bayoneted.

00:13:49.395 --> 00:13:50.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yep, right there.

00:13:50.563 --> 00:13:51.564 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; RM: Right there.

00:13:51.564 --> 00:13:53.032 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
But, Newton's reaction
was interesting.

00:13:53.032 --> 00:13:56.769 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
He didn't believe him, so he
started grilling this poor guy.

00:13:56.769 --> 00:13:58.705 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
What was your mother's
maiden name?

00:13:58.705 --> 00:13:59.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
What unit were you in?

00:13:59.439 --> 00:14:00.306 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yea.

00:14:00.306 --> 00:14:01.307 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; RM: Who was your roommate?

00:14:01.307 --> 00:14:02.275 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; GN: And he's writing
all this down.

00:14:02.275 --> 00:14:02.909 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; RM: He's writing
all this down.

00:14:02.909 --> 00:14:03.643 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yea.

00:14:03.643 --> 00:14:04.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; RM: And as Newton said,

00:14:04.877 --> 00:14:06.212 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
you know the poor guy's
lying there being in pain

00:14:06.212 --> 00:14:07.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
as he's being bayoneted.

00:14:07.747 --> 00:14:09.949 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And eventually he did
take him out of that,

00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:12.051 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
but when he was done
with the session that's

00:14:12.051 --> 00:14:15.054 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
when he sent the stuff off
to the British War Office

00:14:15.054 --> 00:14:18.191 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and they wrote back and
said yes, indeed that is--

00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:19.158 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; GN: This is what happened.

00:14:19.158 --> 00:14:20.359 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
&gt;&gt; RM: Right.

00:14:20.359 --> 00:14:22.929 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Now, parallel paths, Brian
Weiss, you know Brian.

00:14:22.929 --> 00:14:24.330 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; GN: Right, know him well.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.933 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; RM: And his journey into
past life regression was just

00:14:26.933 --> 00:14:28.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
like Newton's.

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:32.004 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
However, Newton's took a
different turn in the 1960's

00:14:32.004 --> 00:14:34.907 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
when a client came in
and I'm paraphrasing.

00:14:34.907 --> 00:14:37.744 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
But, when a client came in
and she was really lonely

00:14:37.744 --> 00:14:41.581 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and very depressed and
he asked her to take him

00:14:41.581 --> 00:14:43.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
to the source of her loneliness.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:47.120 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And she said, "Oh, I'm in
the life between lives.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.590 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I'm where we go after we die
and I'm with my soul group."

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:51.691 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; GN: Uh huh.

00:14:51.691 --> 00:14:53.726 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; RM: And I-- which
isn't like James Brown.

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:54.560 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
&gt;&gt; GN: Right.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.094 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; RM: But, you know her soul--

00:14:55.094 --> 00:14:56.462 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yea.

00:14:56.462 --> 00:14:58.765 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; RM: Group of people to her--
and that we had all agreed not

00:14:58.765 --> 00:15:01.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
to be together in this lifetime.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And I'm completely now happy

00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:06.272 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
because I realize I'll be
back together with my friends.

00:15:06.272 --> 00:15:10.476 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And as Newton put it, he said
you know the original case was

00:15:10.476 --> 00:15:14.013 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
like cold water in his face and
now this woman is claiming--

00:15:14.013 --> 00:15:16.315 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
he said, he took really good
notes and he studied them.

00:15:16.315 --> 00:15:17.416 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
&gt;&gt; GN: Sure.

00:15:17.416 --> 00:15:19.152 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; RM: And then he
really closed his practice

00:15:19.152 --> 00:15:23.389 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and for the next thirty years
he interviewed only clients

00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:25.758 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
who could take him
to that place,

00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:28.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
told no one of his research.

00:15:28.194 --> 00:15:31.063 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
He published his
first book in 1994.

00:15:31.063 --> 00:15:35.434 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Seven thousand people under deep
hypnosis from all walks of life,

00:15:35.434 --> 00:15:37.737 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
all religions saying
the same things.

00:15:37.737 --> 00:15:39.238 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; GN: Same thing.

00:15:39.238 --> 00:15:40.006 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; RM: So--

00:15:40.006 --> 00:15:40.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; GN: It's mind boggling.

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:41.774 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; RM: It's mind boggling.

00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:43.209 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
When I came across
it, you know listen,

00:15:43.209 --> 00:15:45.044 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
it's like any scientific thing.

00:15:45.044 --> 00:15:46.779 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
It's either true or it's not.

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:48.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
And I thought, well if--

00:15:48.347 --> 00:15:50.616 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
for me to prove that
it's true I would have

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:53.085 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
to take individuals
like yourself.

00:15:53.085 --> 00:15:54.253 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; GN: Uh huh.

00:15:54.253 --> 00:15:57.056 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; RM: Like myself let's
say and I'll film them

00:15:57.056 --> 00:15:59.192 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
so that people can see
for themselves whether

00:15:59.192 --> 00:16:01.727 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
or not someone's
interjecting questions--

00:16:01.727 --> 00:16:02.395 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
&gt;&gt; GN: Right.

00:16:02.395 --> 00:16:02.929 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; RM: Or leading--

00:16:02.929 --> 00:16:03.930 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
&gt;&gt; GN: Exactly.

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:04.730 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; RM: Or doing any
of that stuff.

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.933 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
And I took twenty skeptics.

00:16:06.933 --> 00:16:09.235 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I know last week you had a
person on that was saying

00:16:09.235 --> 00:16:11.304 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that one of the people you
can't hypnotize is a skeptic.

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:12.538 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; GN: Is a skeptic, yea.

00:16:12.538 --> 00:16:15.541 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; RM: But, in my experience
let's just say and I work

00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:16.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
with different hypnotherapists

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:19.378 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that I know you know
where their heart is.

00:16:19.378 --> 00:16:20.646 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I know why they're
doing this work.

00:16:20.646 --> 00:16:21.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; GN: Uh huh.

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:25.051 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; RM: And they all have the
same experience, identical.

00:16:25.051 --> 00:16:26.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; GN: That's mind boggling.

00:16:26.686 --> 00:16:27.854 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
It really is.

00:16:27.854 --> 00:16:28.554 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So, let's take some
questions for you alright?

00:16:28.554 --> 00:16:29.889 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
&gt;&gt; RM: Great.

00:16:29.889 --> 00:16:32.158 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; GN: Rich Martini questions
from you on the afterlife.

00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:34.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
Whose got one, anyone?

00:16:35.228 --> 00:16:36.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:11%
Yes?

00:16:36.429 --> 00:16:39.265 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; Have you ever had a
past life experience?

00:16:39.265 --> 00:16:40.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; GN: Have you ever
had one yourself?

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.535 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; RM: Well, that's
a great question.

00:16:42.535 --> 00:16:44.904 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And as a filmmaker
and a journalist I--

00:16:44.904 --> 00:16:48.441 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
my background is in journalism
and you know filmmaking.

00:16:48.441 --> 00:16:52.078 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So, when I went to start
filming these sessions with--

00:16:52.078 --> 00:16:55.114 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
at this conference that
Michael Newton was at they said

00:16:55.114 --> 00:16:58.251 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
that I would be allowed to
film actual sessions, so I did.

00:16:58.251 --> 00:16:59.919 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
I began filming them.

00:16:59.919 --> 00:17:01.454 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And after about four
or five days

00:17:01.454 --> 00:17:07.026 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
of mind blowing evidence they
said would you like to try one?

00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:10.296 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And I thought well that's the
line you cross as a journalist

00:17:10.296 --> 00:17:14.667 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
because once you cross that line
you're no longer completely.

00:17:14.667 --> 00:17:18.137 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
But, George Plimpton, the
great author, "Paper Tiger",

00:17:18.137 --> 00:17:19.672 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that's what he had
done his whole career.

00:17:19.672 --> 00:17:20.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
And I had met George

00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:22.875 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and I thought okay
this is chance for me.

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:25.845 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
How can I talk about it
unless I've tried it myself?

00:17:25.845 --> 00:17:29.148 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
So, I did and I've done two now.

00:17:29.148 --> 00:17:32.885 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And I've done two because
the first session was

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:36.722 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
so mind blowing about two years
later I thought you know it

00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:39.392 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
couldn't possibly
have been that real.

00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:41.727 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And so, I went back and did
another session and it sort

00:17:41.727 --> 00:17:43.562 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
of verified everything
that happened.

00:17:43.562 --> 00:17:48.701 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
In the first session I was
determined as a journalist not

00:17:48.701 --> 00:17:51.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
to be led by the hypnotherapist.

00:17:51.704 --> 00:17:53.940 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
You know that's the great
fear you know that you're

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
under hypnosis and they're going

00:17:56.008 --> 00:17:59.078 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
to say don't you see
yourself on the Titanic.

00:17:59.078 --> 00:17:59.745 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
You know, are you in--

00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:00.413 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; GN: Pushing you.

00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:01.080 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
&gt;&gt; RM: Egypt?

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; GN: That's right.

00:18:02.081 --> 00:18:02.915 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; RM: Are you anywhere
near Cleopatra?

00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:03.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; GN: Are you in that raft?

00:18:03.449 --> 00:18:04.450 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
&gt;&gt; RM: Exactly.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:05.885 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Well, that's what
you're afraid of.

00:18:05.885 --> 00:18:10.089 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But, so I was determined that no
matter what happened I would not

00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:12.525 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
say that I saw something
or heard something

00:18:12.525 --> 00:18:15.561 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
or sensed something unless
it was actually accurate.

00:18:15.561 --> 00:18:19.732 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And so, the hypnotherapist,
the process is they take you

00:18:19.732 --> 00:18:22.969 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
through your current life so you
remember things that, of course,

00:18:22.969 --> 00:18:26.305 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
you do remember, but you
remember them in a visceral way.

00:18:26.305 --> 00:18:28.975 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It's very interesting because
I remembered cutting my finger

00:18:28.975 --> 00:18:30.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
when I was eleven.

00:18:30.376 --> 00:18:31.711 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
I sliced this open.

00:18:31.711 --> 00:18:32.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
&gt;&gt; GN: Ouch.

00:18:32.878 --> 00:18:34.847 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; RM: And I could see
the blood and feel it.

00:18:34.847 --> 00:18:37.683 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And I was thinking, oh this is
funny and then I started talking

00:18:37.683 --> 00:18:40.987 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
in an emotional way like
a twelve year old would.

00:18:40.987 --> 00:18:43.522 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
You know, so I was aware of that
oh it's interesting I'm tapping

00:18:43.522 --> 00:18:44.724 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
into this person.

00:18:44.724 --> 00:18:46.892 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; GN: So, you are a
believer now beyond any shadow

00:18:46.892 --> 00:18:47.727 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
of a doubt?

00:18:47.727 --> 00:18:49.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; RM: Well I-- yes, absolutely.

00:18:49.862 --> 00:18:52.665 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So, I did find myself
when he's--

00:18:52.665 --> 00:18:55.167 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
they ask you could you go
to a previous existence

00:18:55.167 --> 00:18:57.536 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that has some significance
to this one.

00:18:57.536 --> 00:19:00.039 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And I kept saying I
don't see anything.

00:19:00.039 --> 00:19:01.240 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
I don't see anything.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.843 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And then he finally said,
"Well, just look down."

00:19:03.843 --> 00:19:07.513 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And I looked down and I saw
my feet in some water and--

00:19:07.513 --> 00:19:08.848 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; GN: Huh.

00:19:08.848 --> 00:19:12.284 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; RM: Then I saw myself in
buckskin and then I laughed

00:19:12.284 --> 00:19:15.287 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
because then I saw that
I was an American-Indian.

00:19:15.287 --> 00:19:16.489 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
And I laughed as a filmmaker.

00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:17.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yea, yea.

00:19:17.723 --> 00:19:20.326 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; RM: Oh, that's what
you're going to come up with.

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:24.230 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And so, then I said
that I was a Lakota,

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:27.500 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
a Shaman, a medicine man.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.403 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And I laughed at that too,
because I thought oh please,

00:19:30.403 --> 00:19:31.971 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
you know you saw,
"Dances with Wolves."

00:19:31.971 --> 00:19:33.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I mean that's why you're--

00:19:33.172 --> 00:19:34.807 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and then he asked
me what was my name

00:19:34.807 --> 00:19:36.475 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and I said it sounds
like Tatanka.

00:19:36.475 --> 00:19:38.177 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Now, Tatanka, I saw the movie.

00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:39.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
You know it means buffalo.

00:19:39.311 --> 00:19:40.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; GN: That's right.

00:19:40.146 --> 00:19:42.314 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; RM: But, I said it's Watanka.

00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:45.217 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And then he asked me to
go to my tribe and I said,

00:19:45.217 --> 00:19:47.386 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
"I don't want to do that."

00:19:47.386 --> 00:19:48.821 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
And then he said, "Why?"

00:19:48.821 --> 00:19:52.058 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And then I said, "Ah and then I
saw that everyone was murdered."

00:19:52.058 --> 00:19:54.860 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Everyone was dead and
I felt that emotion

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:57.396 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
of seeing a crowd of
your friends dead.

00:19:57.396 --> 00:19:59.365 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And I was thinking to
myself, if I'm making this

00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:00.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
up why am I feeling this

00:20:00.566 --> 00:20:02.701 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and then I went to
literally a tepee.

00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:04.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I felt the skin you know--

00:20:04.103 --> 00:20:04.837 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; GN: Uh huh.

00:20:04.837 --> 00:20:06.072 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; RM: Pulling it open.

00:20:06.072 --> 00:20:09.742 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And I saw this woman lying
on the ground and I said,

00:20:09.742 --> 00:20:15.281 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
"They've killed my wife
and they've taken my son."

00:20:15.281 --> 00:20:16.916 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
And you feel that emotion--

00:20:16.916 --> 00:20:17.450 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; GN: That's right,
you feel it.

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:18.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
&gt;&gt; RM: Of that--

00:20:18.784 --> 00:20:19.952 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; GN: And to know you went
through that and [inaudible]

00:20:19.952 --> 00:20:21.554 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; RM: Well or to imagine
you went through it.

00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:22.922 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
But, it's odd to feel--

00:20:22.922 --> 00:20:23.856 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yea.

00:20:23.856 --> 00:20:25.891 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; RM: That stress
of that emotion.

00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:27.226 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; GN: It's pretty
vivid you see.

00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:29.695 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; RM: So, I was consciously
going well this is weird.

00:20:29.695 --> 00:20:31.697 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
If you're making this up
why are you experiencing--

00:20:31.697 --> 00:20:33.699 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
so then he asked who
did this to your tribe?

00:20:33.699 --> 00:20:37.436 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And I said, "It was
the God damn Herrin."

00:20:37.436 --> 00:20:39.738 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And as I said it I thought
wait a minute, the Herrin,

00:20:39.738 --> 00:20:41.440 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
they're in Upstate New York.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.209 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
The Sioux are in Montana.

00:20:43.209 --> 00:20:47.079 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I'm like you're all over
the map so I let it go.

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:50.082 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And I'll tell you that about a
year later I was at a funeral

00:20:50.082 --> 00:20:51.417 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.

00:20:51.417 --> 00:20:53.252 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
One of my aunts passed
away and I was talking

00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:56.489 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
to my cousin, Hayes Callahan.

00:20:56.489 --> 00:21:01.460 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
I'm sorry Coin Callahan Jr. and
his brother Evase and he said

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.096 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that he was a Lakota-Sioux
historian.

00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:05.998 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It's something that I didn't
know about him at all.

00:21:05.998 --> 00:21:06.799 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; GN: So, there you go, yea.

00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:07.833 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; RM: And I said, "Well,

00:21:07.833 --> 00:21:09.235 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
let me tell you I had
this weird thing."

00:21:09.235 --> 00:21:11.470 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And he said, "Wait, before you
begin just tell me what were

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:12.404 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
you wearing?"

00:21:12.404 --> 00:21:13.772 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I said, "Well, I was
wearing buckskin."

00:21:13.772 --> 00:21:15.341 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
He said, "Well, did
you have any feathers?"

00:21:15.341 --> 00:21:16.509 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
I said, "Yea there were two."

00:21:16.509 --> 00:21:18.577 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
He said, "Were they
up or were they down?"

00:21:18.577 --> 00:21:19.912 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
I said, "They were down."

00:21:19.912 --> 00:21:22.081 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
He said, "Well, that means
you were a medicine man."

00:21:22.081 --> 00:21:23.249 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; GN: Interesting.

00:21:23.249 --> 00:21:24.350 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; RM: I said, "Well, then
why-- what was my name?

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:25.718 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
What did that mean?"

00:21:25.718 --> 00:21:27.219 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Watanka, and he said, "Well,

00:21:27.219 --> 00:21:29.388 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that's what they called
their medicine men

00:21:29.388 --> 00:21:31.590 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
because Wakan Tanka
means the Great Spirit."

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:32.391 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; GN: And you had to like it.

00:21:32.391 --> 00:21:33.192 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; RM: I had no idea.

00:21:33.192 --> 00:21:33.926 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
I couldn't even look it up.

00:21:33.926 --> 00:21:34.460 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yea.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:35.127 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
&gt;&gt; RM: I tried.

00:21:35.127 --> 00:21:36.195 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
And then I saw the--

00:21:36.195 --> 00:21:37.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; GN: You spelled it wrong.

00:21:37.563 --> 00:21:39.465 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; RM: I said, "Then what's
this about me saying the Herrin

00:21:39.465 --> 00:21:41.967 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and Sioux you know
were fighting?"

00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:43.402 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And he said, "You're
sitting in the spot

00:21:43.402 --> 00:21:44.937 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
where they fought
for sixty years."

00:21:44.937 --> 00:21:46.205 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; GN: Wow.

00:21:46.205 --> 00:21:48.107 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; RM: Those are details
I couldn't have gotten

00:21:48.107 --> 00:21:50.409 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
from cryptomnesia,
which is what science--

00:21:50.409 --> 00:21:50.943 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yea.

00:21:50.943 --> 00:21:51.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; RM: Calls--

00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:52.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; GN: There's no way.

00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:52.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; RM: Hypnotherapy.

00:21:52.945 --> 00:21:54.547 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
There was no way.

00:21:54.547 --> 00:21:57.550 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
So, for myself, yes
and most people

00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:00.953 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
who experience these things will
tell you, you know I saw my dad.

00:22:00.953 --> 00:22:02.121 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
I saw my mom.

00:22:02.121 --> 00:22:07.126 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I saw my son in this
experience and it felt real

00:22:07.126 --> 00:22:10.629 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
because they're talking to you
in a way that seems as much,

00:22:10.629 --> 00:22:12.431 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
as real as this moment is--

00:22:12.431 --> 00:22:13.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; GN: Right now, yep.

00:22:13.933 --> 00:22:14.567 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; RM: Now.

00:22:14.567 --> 00:22:15.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
It feels the same.

00:22:15.935 --> 00:22:19.572 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So, when you come back from
that experience you come away

00:22:19.572 --> 00:22:23.375 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
from it going I-- Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle--

00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:24.343 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; GN: Uh huh.

00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:25.244 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; RM: You know the
great author.

00:22:25.244 --> 00:22:26.278 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I saw some footage
of him talking

00:22:26.278 --> 00:22:27.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
about his own experiences.

00:22:27.746 --> 00:22:31.884 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And he said, "You know when
you know something you know it

00:22:31.884 --> 00:22:32.918 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
in your heart."

00:22:32.918 --> 00:22:33.852 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; GN: And its life
altering isn't it?

00:22:33.852 --> 00:22:35.087 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
&gt;&gt; RM: It is.

00:22:35.087 --> 00:22:36.422 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; GN: Let's take another
question for Rich Martini.

00:22:36.422 --> 00:22:38.757 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
Yes ma'am, way in the back.

00:22:38.757 --> 00:22:41.927 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; You mentioned that you
worked on a documentary

00:22:41.927 --> 00:22:44.296 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
with Robert Thurman about Tibet.

00:22:44.296 --> 00:22:49.235 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So, during that time did you
look into their perspectives,

00:22:49.235 --> 00:22:51.737 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
"The Tibetan Book of the
Dead" and their perspectives

00:22:51.737 --> 00:22:57.776 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
on the nature of mind
and the dying experience?

00:22:57.776 --> 00:23:00.779 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; RM: Absolutely and it's
very unusual you would ask

00:23:00.779 --> 00:23:03.949 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that question because when
my dear friend passed away

00:23:03.949 --> 00:23:10.089 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
in my arms back in 1996 she
came to visit me repeatedly

00:23:10.089 --> 00:23:13.993 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and then took me to the
place where she now is.

00:23:13.993 --> 00:23:16.695 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And it was a mind
blowing experience,

00:23:16.695 --> 00:23:19.565 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
but I knew she had been
a lifelong Buddhist.

00:23:19.565 --> 00:23:22.534 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So, I thought well maybe
Buddhism will be an avenue

00:23:22.534 --> 00:23:24.670 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
for me to find her.

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:26.572 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
And so, I just thought well--

00:23:26.572 --> 00:23:28.240 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and I happened to be
reading an article.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.577 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Of course nothing happens
coincidentally, but I happened

00:23:31.577 --> 00:23:33.579 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
to be reading an article
about Robert Thurman

00:23:33.579 --> 00:23:38.284 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and this great story of where
he had found his reincarnated

00:23:38.284 --> 00:23:41.787 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
teacher and the teacher was a
five year old kid on a tricycle

00:23:41.787 --> 00:23:43.422 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
who rode up to his
foot and said,

00:23:43.422 --> 00:23:46.925 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
"Thurman why did you
leave the monkhood?"

00:23:46.925 --> 00:23:50.396 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
And as a result of that article
I was on my way to New York

00:23:50.396 --> 00:23:54.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to work with our dear friend
Charles Grodin on his show

00:23:54.133 --> 00:23:56.435 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and I saw that Thurman
was teaching at Columbia.

00:23:56.435 --> 00:24:00.039 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So, I called him up and said you
know, "Can I audit your class?"

00:24:00.039 --> 00:24:02.107 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And he said, "Oh
it's very advanced.

00:24:02.107 --> 00:24:03.442 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
It's a philosophical class.

00:24:03.442 --> 00:24:05.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
It's for doctoral candidates."

00:24:05.311 --> 00:24:08.113 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
He said, "Well, do you know
who Hegel and Kant are?

00:24:08.113 --> 00:24:11.283 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And I said, "They
played for the 49'ers."

00:24:11.283 --> 00:24:13.719 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
He said, "Alright, you
can audit the class."

00:24:13.719 --> 00:24:15.854 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And so, I became great
friends with Robert.

00:24:15.854 --> 00:24:18.090 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And yes, "The Tibetan
Book of the Dead"

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:22.061 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
because they have studied
this so extensively.

00:24:22.061 --> 00:24:25.331 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And Robert's written
his own version of that.

00:24:25.331 --> 00:24:29.268 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
And ultimately I did get to go
to Tibet with him and I've been

00:24:29.268 --> 00:24:31.403 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to India with him and
I've been to these places

00:24:31.403 --> 00:24:34.606 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
where they really have a
connection with the afterlife.

00:24:34.606 --> 00:24:39.545 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
However, and this is the very
unusual nature of this research,

00:24:39.545 --> 00:24:41.714 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and I've talked to
Robert about it.

00:24:41.714 --> 00:24:45.918 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It's that in Tibetan and
Hindu and most philosophies

00:24:45.918 --> 00:24:48.787 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that embrace reincarnation,
they believe

00:24:48.787 --> 00:24:53.759 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that between lives we are
dictated by karma or actions

00:24:53.759 --> 00:24:55.928 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
in our previous life
as to who we're going

00:24:55.928 --> 00:24:57.429 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
to be in our next life.

00:24:57.429 --> 00:25:00.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
They have the concept of
lower births for people

00:25:00.366 --> 00:25:04.636 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
who have been naughty
or bad, let's say, evil.

00:25:04.636 --> 00:25:08.607 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
In this research it shows
a contrary position,

00:25:08.607 --> 00:25:13.045 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
which is between lives we
are fully conscious of all

00:25:13.045 --> 00:25:14.880 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
of our previous lives.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:20.252 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
That we see why we chose those
lives and why we chose this life

00:25:20.252 --> 00:25:23.355 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and how they're all
interconnected.

00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:26.825 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
That's a fundamentally
contrary position to what,

00:25:26.825 --> 00:25:28.560 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
"The Tibetan Book of
the Dead" teaches.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.497 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
However, the argument
I've had with Robert

00:25:31.497 --> 00:25:34.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and you don't ever want to
argue with Robert Thurman

00:25:34.199 --> 00:25:35.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
because he's a master.

00:25:35.267 --> 00:25:36.268 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; GN: You can't win.

00:25:36.268 --> 00:25:37.703 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; RM: You can't win.

00:25:37.703 --> 00:25:40.272 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
You know monks spend like
four hours a day debating.

00:25:40.272 --> 00:25:43.542 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
But, the point is
this, it's very simple.

00:25:43.542 --> 00:25:46.512 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It goes to the book "Flipside"
and what I've been doing.

00:25:46.512 --> 00:25:49.915 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
"The Tibetan Book of the
Dead" was written by one monk

00:25:49.915 --> 00:25:53.619 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
who had this experience of going
through the levels of death.

00:25:53.619 --> 00:25:57.689 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Completely accurate with what
hospice care workers say.

00:25:57.689 --> 00:25:58.690 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; GN: Same thing.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:00.125 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; RM: So, same thing,
very valuable.

00:26:00.125 --> 00:26:04.630 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
However, when he got to this
other place it didn't continue

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:06.098 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
on for him.

00:26:06.098 --> 00:26:10.235 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
Thousands of monks have written
treatises about that book,

00:26:10.235 --> 00:26:12.004 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
but only one monk
had the experience.

00:26:12.004 --> 00:26:13.505 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
My point is very simple.

00:26:13.505 --> 00:26:16.809 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
If you have two people
who go to the same,

00:26:16.809 --> 00:26:19.244 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
have the same near
death experience,

00:26:19.244 --> 00:26:22.147 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
two people have the same
afterlife experience then it's

00:26:22.147 --> 00:26:25.684 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
worth examining because then
you can see the differences.

00:26:25.684 --> 00:26:29.254 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
I'm talking about seven
thousand people over the course

00:26:29.254 --> 00:26:31.990 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
of thirty years having
the same journey.

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:34.860 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So, you know I don't want to
be in a position to debate

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:39.998 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
with the great philosophical
point that Robert Thurman can.

00:26:39.998 --> 00:26:43.068 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
But, it is to say that
yes, I have examined it.

00:26:43.068 --> 00:26:46.905 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I think Tibetan Buddhism is
probably the most peerless

00:26:46.905 --> 00:26:51.844 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
philosophy on the planet that I
have ever seen or been around.

00:26:51.844 --> 00:26:54.379 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And it's a wonderful way to
examine the nature of reality,

00:26:54.379 --> 00:26:56.215 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
no question about that.

00:26:56.215 --> 00:26:58.016 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
But, in the nature of unreality

00:26:58.016 --> 00:27:01.453 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
or the afterlife I've
found this other avenue

00:27:01.453 --> 00:27:04.356 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
that seems to make sense to me.

00:27:04.356 --> 00:27:05.357 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; GN: It works for you.

00:27:05.357 --> 00:27:06.358 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; RM: If that answers
your question.

00:27:06.358 --> 00:27:07.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; GN: That's works.

00:27:07.726 --> 00:27:10.462 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Let's take another look at one
of Rich's documentary clips.

00:27:10.462 --> 00:27:15.400 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; Take a moment just to
observe any of thoughts

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:19.204 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
that are running
through your mind.

00:27:19.204 --> 00:27:26.912 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
[ Music ]

00:27:26.912 --> 00:27:28.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; People are dying around me.

00:27:28.647 --> 00:27:30.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; People are dying.

00:27:31.717 --> 00:27:32.518 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:18%
&gt;&gt; Yea.

00:27:32.518 --> 00:27:33.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; And what are you doing?

00:27:35.387 --> 00:27:40.392 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; We're being rounded
up, this horrible place.

00:27:40.392 --> 00:27:42.361 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Who, who's rounded you up?

00:27:42.361 --> 00:27:43.061 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
&gt;&gt; Soldiers.

00:27:43.061 --> 00:27:44.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
&gt;&gt; Soldiers?

00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:47.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Soldiers, officials for the
government have rounded us up.

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:48.600 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
&gt;&gt; Officials.

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:49.935 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:18%
&gt;&gt; Yea.

00:27:49.935 --> 00:27:54.907 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Help me understand where
this is and what time it is?

00:27:54.907 --> 00:27:57.075 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; Somewhere in the 40's.

00:27:57.075 --> 00:27:57.743 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
&gt;&gt; The 40's.

00:27:57.743 --> 00:27:58.277 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:27:58.277 --> 00:28:01.380 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
&gt;&gt; Uh huh, yea.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:02.681 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; This is very disturbing.

00:28:02.681 --> 00:28:03.582 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; GN: Great clip Rich.

00:28:03.582 --> 00:28:05.017 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
Tell me about that.

00:28:05.017 --> 00:28:07.953 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; RM: Very unusually that was
the first session that I filmed.

00:28:07.953 --> 00:28:10.889 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
They had invited me to this
conference and this woman

00:28:10.889 --> 00:28:12.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
who was a hypnotherapist--

00:28:12.057 --> 00:28:13.191 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; GN: Uh huh.

00:28:13.191 --> 00:28:14.526 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; RM: So, she offered
to do a demonstration.

00:28:14.526 --> 00:28:16.395 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I talked to her afterwards,
interviewed her afterwards.

00:28:16.395 --> 00:28:19.131 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
She had never had
this past life memory.

00:28:19.131 --> 00:28:22.034 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And during the course and
the gentleman you saw there

00:28:22.034 --> 00:28:24.002 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
conducting the session
was the President

00:28:24.002 --> 00:28:25.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
of the Newton Institute.

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:28.874 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
A great hypnotherapist named
Paul Aurand in New York City.

00:28:28.874 --> 00:28:32.878 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And Paul walked her back
through a previous life then

00:28:32.878 --> 00:28:35.013 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that has some significance
on this lifetime.

00:28:35.013 --> 00:28:38.383 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And she remembered this
disturbing memory of being

00:28:38.383 --> 00:28:41.653 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
on her way to the gas
chamber in Auschwitz.

00:28:41.653 --> 00:28:44.723 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Now, she named her family
and the people that she loved

00:28:44.723 --> 00:28:46.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
and I was able to verify

00:28:46.091 --> 00:28:50.028 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that this person indeed did
exist and had been there.

00:28:50.028 --> 00:28:55.334 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But, more importantly she went
into the life between lives.

00:28:55.334 --> 00:28:58.704 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
In this clip later on,
a little bit later on

00:28:58.704 --> 00:29:01.406 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and there she is able to
address questions to--

00:29:01.406 --> 00:29:03.408 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
of a spiritual nature
to higher--

00:29:03.408 --> 00:29:04.209 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
&gt;&gt; GN: Sure.

00:29:04.209 --> 00:29:04.743 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
&gt;&gt; RM: Thinkers.

00:29:04.743 --> 00:29:05.877 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yea.

00:29:05.877 --> 00:29:07.245 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; RM: People call them
the Council of Elders

00:29:07.245 --> 00:29:09.114 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
or the wisdom makers
or whatever it is.

00:29:09.114 --> 00:29:14.286 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
But, at some point she was
asking why, why did I choose

00:29:14.286 --> 00:29:15.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
such a difficult lifetime?

00:29:15.854 --> 00:29:17.022 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; GN: Uh huh.

00:29:17.022 --> 00:29:20.726 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; RM: I lost everyone and
everything that I loved.

00:29:20.726 --> 00:29:23.895 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And then she said, "Oh
this is very unusual.

00:29:23.895 --> 00:29:26.531 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I know it's going to be
hard for me to explain it,

00:29:26.531 --> 00:29:30.335 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
but they're showing me
images that it was harder

00:29:30.335 --> 00:29:34.406 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to choose the role of a
perpetrator in this lifetime

00:29:34.406 --> 00:29:36.642 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
than that of a victim."

00:29:36.642 --> 00:29:41.580 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And I can tell you that my
brain froze at that moment.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:44.483 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I had never heard a more
politically incorrect sentence

00:29:44.483 --> 00:29:45.851 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
in my life.

00:29:45.851 --> 00:29:47.586 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And I really had to
look around the camera

00:29:47.586 --> 00:29:49.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
like did I just hear that?

00:29:49.588 --> 00:29:52.190 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
It was something-- it was
so beyond my perception,

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:56.495 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
anyway and as I've heard more
and more and as she said,

00:29:56.495 --> 00:30:00.065 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
"Every day in that
lifetime very difficult."

00:30:00.065 --> 00:30:02.834 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Not to say that terrible
things didn't happen.

00:30:02.834 --> 00:30:06.905 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
They did. But, every day
was lesson in courage.

00:30:06.905 --> 00:30:09.775 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
A lesson in loyalty, a
lesson in compassion,

00:30:09.775 --> 00:30:13.712 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
a lesson in love
heightened to a great degree.

00:30:13.712 --> 00:30:16.715 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
So, I heard Scott
De Tamble talking

00:30:16.715 --> 00:30:19.284 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to a group the other day,
something I had filmed

00:30:19.284 --> 00:30:21.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
and he's a hypnotherapist.

00:30:21.086 --> 00:30:25.424 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And he said to them,
"You're the courageous ones.

00:30:25.424 --> 00:30:27.926 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
You people chose this lifetime.

00:30:27.926 --> 00:30:31.530 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
You know how difficult
it's been for all of us.

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:33.432 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
You don't have to come.

00:30:33.432 --> 00:30:34.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
You have a choice.

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:35.967 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
We have free will."

00:30:35.967 --> 00:30:40.372 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
We can say I don't-- I'm
going to wait this one out.

00:30:40.372 --> 00:30:42.074 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
Let the team play without me.

00:30:42.074 --> 00:30:43.041 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; GN: That's right.

00:30:43.041 --> 00:30:43.809 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; RM: You know you
guys go ahead.

00:30:43.809 --> 00:30:44.543 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
You know I'm just going to--

00:30:44.543 --> 00:30:45.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; GN: But they take it.

00:30:45.143 --> 00:30:45.811 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; RM: [inaudible]

00:30:45.811 --> 00:30:47.145 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; GN: They take it.

00:30:47.145 --> 00:30:50.415 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; RM: But, the courageous
ones say yes I can handle this.

00:30:50.415 --> 00:30:52.384 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
I'm going to sign up
for a difficult life.

00:30:52.384 --> 00:30:53.719 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
In fact--

00:30:53.719 --> 00:30:56.088 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; GN: Do they know that though
signing up for that life?

00:30:56.088 --> 00:30:58.457 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; RM: That's what people
say under deep hypnosis.

00:30:58.457 --> 00:30:59.958 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
&gt;&gt; GN: Alright.

00:30:59.958 --> 00:31:02.828 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; RM: And that's the experience
they have which is that you find

00:31:02.828 --> 00:31:07.165 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that people who suffer the most,
let's talk about lesser birds

00:31:07.165 --> 00:31:09.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
as somebody might call them.

00:31:09.468 --> 00:31:13.572 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
But, in our-- and this research
shows that the courageous ones,

00:31:13.572 --> 00:31:17.576 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the older souls choose
the more difficult lives

00:31:17.576 --> 00:31:19.745 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
because they think
they can handle it.

00:31:19.745 --> 00:31:20.846 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
&gt;&gt; GN: Or fix it.

00:31:20.846 --> 00:31:21.913 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
&gt;&gt; RM: Or fix it.

00:31:21.913 --> 00:31:23.915 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
So, for example, I
had a Tibetan monk say

00:31:23.915 --> 00:31:27.619 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to me do you think I would
chose to be born in Africa

00:31:27.619 --> 00:31:32.390 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and an HIV child into poverty.

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:33.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
That would be my choice.

00:31:33.859 --> 00:31:37.729 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And I said, "Which one of
those concepts is negative?"

00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:38.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; GN: Uh huh.

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:40.632 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; RM: And then let's say
that you and I George,

00:31:40.632 --> 00:31:42.234 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
we're in our soul group meeting

00:31:42.234 --> 00:31:45.370 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and I say now look
this lifetime I--

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:47.739 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
you're only going to
live six months man.

00:31:47.739 --> 00:31:48.874 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
That's what I want you to do.

00:31:48.874 --> 00:31:50.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; GN: That's it, yea.

00:31:50.108 --> 00:31:52.043 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; RM: It's going to be hard,
but not so much for you.

00:31:52.043 --> 00:31:54.312 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It'll be hard on everyone
around you and they're all going

00:31:54.312 --> 00:31:55.981 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
to learn these lessons
in compassion

00:31:55.981 --> 00:31:57.883 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
and love and forgiveness.

00:31:57.883 --> 00:31:59.451 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
So, do you think you
could give me one

00:31:59.451 --> 00:32:01.920 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
out of the thousand we're
going to have together?

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:03.288 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
And you can say no--

00:32:03.288 --> 00:32:04.289 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; GN: I don't want to.

00:32:04.289 --> 00:32:05.390 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; RM: I don't want to.

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.459 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
But, you can also say
okay, if it's going

00:32:07.459 --> 00:32:10.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
to help people that I love, yea.

00:32:10.829 --> 00:32:14.733 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
That's, to me when you talk
about the Buddhist philosophy

00:32:14.733 --> 00:32:19.738 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
of enlightenment, which has to
do with wisdom and compassion.

00:32:19.738 --> 00:32:21.072 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
Those are the two wings--

00:32:21.072 --> 00:32:22.073 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
&gt;&gt; GN: Right.

00:32:22.073 --> 00:32:23.375 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; RM: Of enlightenment,
what they say

00:32:23.375 --> 00:32:27.879 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
when you examine somebody's
sacrificing their lifetime

00:32:27.879 --> 00:32:32.684 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
so you can learn a lesson, wow.

00:32:32.684 --> 00:32:34.119 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
How powerful is that?

00:32:34.119 --> 00:32:37.455 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; GN: Is, "The Egyptian Book
of the Dead" similar with,

00:32:37.455 --> 00:32:38.623 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
"The Tibetan Book of the Dead?"

00:32:38.623 --> 00:32:40.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; RM: Another great question.

00:32:40.258 --> 00:32:48.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
From my research the Egyptians
had their sleep temples, okay.

00:32:48.366 --> 00:32:52.304 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And so, they had it-- you know
we grow up with a paradigm

00:32:52.304 --> 00:32:54.072 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
of everything is
nature or nurture.

00:32:54.072 --> 00:32:55.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; GN: Uh huh.

00:32:55.273 --> 00:32:56.474 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; RM: It's either genetic
or it's sociological.

00:32:56.474 --> 00:32:57.309 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
That's what we're told.

00:32:57.309 --> 00:32:58.810 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
That's what doctors are told.

00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:01.213 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
That's what all of our
medication is based on.

00:33:01.213 --> 00:33:03.882 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Well, the Egyptians had
this third paradigm,

00:33:03.882 --> 00:33:06.484 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
which was something to do
with the spirit and they used

00:33:06.484 --> 00:33:09.221 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
to sleep temples
where people would--

00:33:09.221 --> 00:33:11.923 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
you would come in and somebody,
a priest would be there

00:33:11.923 --> 00:33:14.826 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and he'd help you sort of
examine things from this kind

00:33:14.826 --> 00:33:16.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
of metaphorical sense.

00:33:16.695 --> 00:33:18.096 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
What was you dream, etc. etc.

00:33:18.096 --> 00:33:19.531 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; GN: Guides basically
aren't they?

00:33:19.531 --> 00:33:20.398 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; RM: Guides.

00:33:20.398 --> 00:33:23.034 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
And so, that's a
way of examining

00:33:23.034 --> 00:33:26.037 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
that nature of existence.

00:33:26.037 --> 00:33:29.074 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
In terms of reporting there
are things a little bit more

00:33:29.074 --> 00:33:31.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
about the mystical nature of it.

00:33:31.409 --> 00:33:32.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Whereas, "The Tibetan Book

00:33:32.944 --> 00:33:36.181 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of the Dead" is really the
physical nature of you know

00:33:36.181 --> 00:33:37.616 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
as you go and if you--

00:33:37.616 --> 00:33:38.917 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; GN: Both equally
important, right?

00:33:38.917 --> 00:33:39.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; RM: Both equally important.

00:33:39.918 --> 00:33:42.120 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And I had the experience
just last fall

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.089 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
when my mom was passing away.

00:33:44.089 --> 00:33:47.392 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And my wife had sent me
this list of hospice notes,

00:33:47.392 --> 00:33:49.427 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
which was identical to, "The
Tibetan Book of the Dead"

00:33:49.427 --> 00:33:51.730 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
but instead of you know
a big volume it was

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:53.098 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
like this is going to happen.

00:33:53.098 --> 00:33:58.370 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So, when it happened and I was
holding my mom's hand I was able

00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:02.440 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
to understand it and
not panic you know

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
because oh, this is happening.

00:34:04.142 --> 00:34:06.912 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Like shouldn't I call the
doctor and get somebody in here.

00:34:06.912 --> 00:34:10.482 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Just calm down, this is the
journey that they're taking.

00:34:10.482 --> 00:34:13.551 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
You know it's easily the most
difficult thing we can do

00:34:13.551 --> 00:34:17.555 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
as human beings to experience
the death of a loved one.

00:34:17.555 --> 00:34:20.892 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
But, it's also the most
powerful life force

00:34:20.892 --> 00:34:24.362 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and nobling experience
other than perhaps birth--

00:34:24.362 --> 00:34:25.530 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
&gt;&gt; GN: Right.

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:26.831 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; RM: That we can
experience in our lifetime.

00:34:26.831 --> 00:34:29.501 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; GN: How many of you
are afraid of dying.

00:34:29.501 --> 00:34:33.405 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Not that you want to die,
but are you afraid of dying?

00:34:33.405 --> 00:34:34.205 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
Raise your hand if you're--

00:34:34.205 --> 00:34:35.240 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; RM: Wow.

00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:37.575 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; GN: That's pretty
bold isn't it?

00:34:37.575 --> 00:34:39.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; RM: The veil is thinning.

00:34:39.077 --> 00:34:40.412 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; GN: Maybe it is.

00:34:40.412 --> 00:34:43.748 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It is. I mean like I say, we
don't want to jump too soon.

00:34:43.748 --> 00:34:44.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
&gt;&gt; RM: No.

00:34:44.282 --> 00:34:45.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
That's true.

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:47.385 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And of course, listen,
every time I get on a plane,

00:34:47.385 --> 00:34:48.586 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
you know every time I
get in a train, you know

00:34:48.586 --> 00:34:50.522 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and I've got kids and
I've got responsibilities

00:34:50.522 --> 00:34:51.623 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
and all that stuff.

00:34:51.623 --> 00:34:53.525 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
You just-- look, none
of us want to check out.

00:34:53.525 --> 00:34:55.093 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
That's a given.

00:34:55.093 --> 00:34:57.295 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
And it's a lot of work.

00:34:57.295 --> 00:34:59.431 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It's a lot of work
to get to be George.

00:34:59.431 --> 00:35:01.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It's got-- a lot of work
has been involved to get

00:35:01.633 --> 00:35:05.203 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
to where you are and you don't
want to squander or waste that.

00:35:05.203 --> 00:35:06.404 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
I'll tell you an example.

00:35:06.404 --> 00:35:09.541 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
I was giving a talk
in Virginia Beach

00:35:09.541 --> 00:35:11.643 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
and I was talking about suicide.

00:35:11.643 --> 00:35:13.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
We-- just the topic came up.

00:35:13.545 --> 00:35:16.982 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And I was saying how you know
there's a myriad of reasons.

00:35:16.982 --> 00:35:20.418 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
We-- no one can tell you
exactly why something happened.

00:35:20.418 --> 00:35:21.553 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
&gt;&gt; GN: Right.

00:35:21.553 --> 00:35:22.988 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; RM: But, they can
give you perspectives.

00:35:22.988 --> 00:35:24.322 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
So, I was saying you know

00:35:24.322 --> 00:35:26.725 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
in the research sometimes
people say well

00:35:26.725 --> 00:35:28.560 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
in that previous lifetime
I committed suicide

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:31.329 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and when I got back
I was tearing my hair

00:35:31.329 --> 00:35:33.999 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
out because all I
had to do was wait.

00:35:33.999 --> 00:35:37.535 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
If I had only waited until
Wednesday when the tickets

00:35:37.535 --> 00:35:39.871 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to Rome were going to
appear and then we were--

00:35:39.871 --> 00:35:40.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; GN: Or the new job.

00:35:40.839 --> 00:35:41.506 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; RM: Or the new job.

00:35:41.506 --> 00:35:42.907 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; GN: Or whatever.

00:35:42.907 --> 00:35:45.410 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; RM: If I had just waited and
then your soul group says yes,

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:49.280 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
yes, you screwed up all
of our elaborate plans.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.082 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
However, we love you.

00:35:51.082 --> 00:35:54.085 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We love-- we have no-- we're
not going to judge you at all.

00:35:54.085 --> 00:35:55.186 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
&gt;&gt; GN: Right.

00:35:55.186 --> 00:35:56.521 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; RM: We love you
and we'll do it again.

00:35:56.521 --> 00:35:58.423 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So, after the talk a woman
came up to me and said, "Well,

00:35:58.423 --> 00:36:00.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I was a Wednesday person."

00:36:00.525 --> 00:36:01.459 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yea.

00:36:01.459 --> 00:36:02.527 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; RM: I said, "What
do you mean?"

00:36:02.527 --> 00:36:05.030 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
She said, "Well, I
was at my wits end,

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:06.531 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
at the end of my
rope and I had"--

00:36:06.531 --> 00:36:07.599 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; GN: Jumped too soon.

00:36:07.599 --> 00:36:09.434 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; RM: I had decided
that I would check out.

00:36:09.434 --> 00:36:10.769 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; GN: Uh huh.

00:36:10.769 --> 00:36:12.137 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; RM: And she had gone to a
hardware store to buy the stuff

00:36:12.137 --> 00:36:15.206 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that she had looked up online
that you're supposed to use.

00:36:15.206 --> 00:36:19.144 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And while she was in line she
heard these two boys talking

00:36:19.144 --> 00:36:22.180 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and they were from Uganda,
some of the Lost Boys,

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:24.349 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
you know part of that war.

00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:27.585 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And she started talking to
them and it suddenly dawned

00:36:27.585 --> 00:36:30.388 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
on her this was her reason
for being on the planet.

00:36:30.388 --> 00:36:34.259 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
She now lives in Uganda and
takes care of these families.

00:36:34.259 --> 00:36:38.163 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Her life changed because
she waited until Wednesday.

00:36:38.163 --> 00:36:39.330 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yea.

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; RM: So, it's a
way of saying look--

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:43.201 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; GN: Just a moment.

00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:44.903 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; RM: The afterlife might
be a wonderful place, okay,

00:36:44.903 --> 00:36:46.571 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
but you're here for a reason.

00:36:46.571 --> 00:36:48.073 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
Honor that.

00:36:48.073 --> 00:36:49.574 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
Honor the reason.

00:36:49.574 --> 00:36:50.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
I know it's difficult.

00:36:50.909 --> 00:36:53.745 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
We all go through really hard
things, but honor the fact

00:36:53.745 --> 00:36:56.414 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that you're-- you've had
the courage to come here.

00:36:56.414 --> 00:36:57.582 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
Give yourself a break.

00:36:57.582 --> 00:36:58.683 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
&gt;&gt; GN: Exactly.

00:36:58.683 --> 00:36:59.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; RM: You know on some level.

00:36:59.751 --> 00:37:01.052 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; GN: It's got to
be probably one

00:37:01.052 --> 00:37:03.388 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
of the most tormenting feelings.

00:37:03.388 --> 00:37:05.790 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
The-- I have a friend
who committed suicide,

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:10.795 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
very prominent, father left
him fifty million dollars

00:37:10.795 --> 00:37:13.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
and he had a great career.

00:37:13.064 --> 00:37:14.032 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; RM: Wow.

00:37:14.032 --> 00:37:16.234 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; GN: Nobody knows
what happened.

00:37:16.234 --> 00:37:17.402 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
Nobody knows.

00:37:17.402 --> 00:37:19.871 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; RM: Well, if I
might, I might add this.

00:37:19.871 --> 00:37:21.673 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
I've been researching
this as well.

00:37:21.673 --> 00:37:25.977 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And a lot of times and this is
you know not to go to off topic,

00:37:25.977 --> 00:37:29.247 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
but every massacre, you know
in Santa Monica where I'm

00:37:29.247 --> 00:37:30.582 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
from we just had a gun massacre.

00:37:30.582 --> 00:37:31.549 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; GN: You just had
a horrible shooting.

00:37:31.549 --> 00:37:32.417 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; RM: Yea.

00:37:32.417 --> 00:37:33.585 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
Every single massacre

00:37:33.585 --> 00:37:37.188 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
since Columbine has
involved SSRI drugs.

00:37:37.188 --> 00:37:38.223 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yes.

00:37:38.223 --> 00:37:39.190 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; RM: Those are
Serotonin Inhibitor drugs.

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:40.492 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
&gt;&gt; GN: I agree.

00:37:40.492 --> 00:37:41.192 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I've talked about that on
Coast to Coast as you know.

00:37:41.192 --> 00:37:41.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; RM: Okay as you know.

00:37:41.726 --> 00:37:42.527 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yea.

00:37:42.527 --> 00:37:45.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; RM: And what I found also

00:37:45.196 --> 00:37:48.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
because I remember
meeting a filmmaker's wife

00:37:48.166 --> 00:37:50.668 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and her husband had
suddenly committed suicide.

00:37:50.668 --> 00:37:52.270 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And she said, "There
was nothing."

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:54.072 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And I said, "You
know was he taking"--

00:37:54.072 --> 00:37:55.406 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; GN: Uh huh.

00:37:55.406 --> 00:37:56.107 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; RM: And she said, "You
know it's weird you would ask

00:37:56.107 --> 00:37:56.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:21%
me that.

00:37:56.908 --> 00:37:58.209 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
He was exhausted."

00:37:58.209 --> 00:38:01.613 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
See Serotonin when it
misfires, sometimes it misfires

00:38:01.613 --> 00:38:03.214 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
because we're not sleeping.

00:38:03.214 --> 00:38:05.550 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
So, and autism misfiring.

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:06.951 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So, that's why they're
trying to give [inaudible]

00:38:06.951 --> 00:38:08.386 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
&gt;&gt; GN: Right.

00:38:08.386 --> 00:38:11.589 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; RM: Alright, so he went in
and said, "I'm really tired."

00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:14.559 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And the doctor said, "Well,
here try this SSRI drug."

00:38:14.559 --> 00:38:17.362 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
And there's part
of the amygdala,

00:38:17.362 --> 00:38:19.697 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
which is where the
fight or flight exists.

00:38:19.697 --> 00:38:21.399 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yea, the reptilian
brain is there.

00:38:21.399 --> 00:38:24.002 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; RM: And it's-- there's
a trigger that keeps us

00:38:24.002 --> 00:38:25.737 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
when we're driving, when
we keep in our lane.

00:38:25.737 --> 00:38:28.139 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
We don't think, oh I think
I'll pull into traffic.

00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:30.141 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
But, when the trigger
either through--

00:38:30.141 --> 00:38:31.209 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
&gt;&gt; GN: Flips.

00:38:31.209 --> 00:38:32.710 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; RM: Depression or
through these drugs.

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:36.814 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
And apparently there's a test
you can take that shows whether

00:38:36.814 --> 00:38:38.416 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
or not this will happen to you.

00:38:38.416 --> 00:38:40.552 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And I can't-- I wish I could
tell you the name of the test,

00:38:40.552 --> 00:38:42.754 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
but this doctor told
me about it.

00:38:42.754 --> 00:38:44.255 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
But, he said, "That
fifteen percent

00:38:44.255 --> 00:38:48.259 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
of the people are naturally--
have this problem when that--

00:38:48.259 --> 00:38:49.694 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; GN: They're prone.

00:38:49.694 --> 00:38:52.764 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; RM: Switch goes off all they
can think about suddenly instead

00:38:52.764 --> 00:38:55.400 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of driving in their lane is
jumping off the St. Vincent

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:58.436 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
Thomas bridge as Tony Scott did.

00:38:58.436 --> 00:38:59.671 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yea.

00:38:59.671 --> 00:39:01.272 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; RM: He has started
taking one of these drugs.

00:39:01.272 --> 00:39:02.407 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
&gt;&gt; GN: Aw.

00:39:02.407 --> 00:39:03.908 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; RM: So, you know
thank God for the fact

00:39:03.908 --> 00:39:08.179 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that a toxicology report
was online after he passed

00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:10.848 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and I went through it
and found the drug.

00:39:10.848 --> 00:39:11.950 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; GN: There it was.

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:13.351 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; RM: And it's a black
box drug they call it--

00:39:13.351 --> 00:39:14.352 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yea.

00:39:14.352 --> 00:39:15.553 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; RM: Where there's
a warning on it.

00:39:15.553 --> 00:39:19.023 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So, my-- listen, SSRI drugs
help eighty five percent

00:39:19.023 --> 00:39:20.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
of the population.

00:39:20.358 --> 00:39:22.493 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
A lot of people take
it and they're fine.

00:39:22.493 --> 00:39:25.029 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
My point is only
do the research--

00:39:25.029 --> 00:39:25.997 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
&gt;&gt; GN: Right.

00:39:25.997 --> 00:39:27.065 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; RM: Find out if
you're allergic

00:39:27.065 --> 00:39:29.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
to this drug before you take it.

00:39:29.701 --> 00:39:31.369 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And why aren't the
drug company--

00:39:31.369 --> 00:39:32.170 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
we won't get into that.

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:32.870 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; GN: That's a long story.

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:33.838 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
&gt;&gt; RM: Right.

00:39:33.838 --> 00:39:34.472 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; GN: That's another
show Richie.

00:39:34.472 --> 00:39:35.707 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
&gt;&gt; RM: I'm sorry.

00:39:35.707 --> 00:39:36.641 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; GN: Let's take some
questions for Rich Martini.

00:39:36.641 --> 00:39:38.209 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
Yes sir, right here?

00:39:38.209 --> 00:39:39.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
We'll get you the mic.

00:39:39.077 --> 00:39:40.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
Hold on for a sec.

00:39:40.511 --> 00:39:43.014 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Some of the stuff you've been
talking about are some things

00:39:43.014 --> 00:39:45.850 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that I've had very
similar experiences about.

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:49.053 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I studied at Naropa Institute
and took some classes on,

00:39:49.053 --> 00:39:50.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
"The Tibetan Book of the Dead"

00:39:50.855 --> 00:39:53.157 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
from a woman named
Francesca Fremantle who is one

00:39:53.157 --> 00:39:56.761 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
of the first people to
translate the book to English.

00:39:56.761 --> 00:40:01.032 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And some years after that I
was studying with a shaman

00:40:01.032 --> 00:40:05.703 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and I was looking for a thing
of why I can't do anything right

00:40:05.703 --> 00:40:07.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
and I was being regressed.

00:40:07.205 --> 00:40:09.340 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
And he didn't bother to tell me

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:12.744 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that it could regress
me into a past life.

00:40:12.744 --> 00:40:14.679 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And I got regressed
into a past life

00:40:14.679 --> 00:40:16.714 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
where I was a Lakota Indian--

00:40:16.714 --> 00:40:18.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; GN: Part of the club.

00:40:18.049 --> 00:40:20.718 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; Before that I had always
thought Lakota was the most

00:40:20.718 --> 00:40:23.755 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
beautiful word in
the English language.

00:40:23.755 --> 00:40:28.192 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And I found out that I had
been a leader of a small band

00:40:28.192 --> 00:40:32.597 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of Indians and we we're trying
to escape from the U.S. Calvary.

00:40:32.597 --> 00:40:36.301 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And like you had said, we
were massacred and I saw it

00:40:36.301 --> 00:40:39.937 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
and I swear I got this
impression, my present lifetime

00:40:39.937 --> 00:40:41.539 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
of why I can't do
anything right,

00:40:41.539 --> 00:40:43.775 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
because I couldn't
protect this band.

00:40:43.775 --> 00:40:47.211 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
But, my question to you
is after this experience

00:40:47.211 --> 00:40:50.248 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
for probably a week after
that, the personality

00:40:50.248 --> 00:40:52.917 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of the Indian I was in
that past lifetime had bled

00:40:52.917 --> 00:40:55.119 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
through into this
lifetime and I was walking

00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:59.590 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
around like I was this
real studly guy and it took

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:01.125 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
about a week for
it to bleed off.

00:41:01.125 --> 00:41:03.728 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And I was wondering if you've
experienced that before

00:41:03.728 --> 00:41:06.097 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and heard about that
kind of thing?

00:41:06.097 --> 00:41:07.131 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; RM: Absolutely.

00:41:07.131 --> 00:41:10.635 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And may I say that
you are a studly guy.

00:41:10.635 --> 00:41:13.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
But, you know we carry on these,

00:41:13.071 --> 00:41:16.107 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
all this persona
that we've chosen.

00:41:16.107 --> 00:41:19.577 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And so, inside of you
is that Lakota warrior.

00:41:19.577 --> 00:41:21.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
He hasn't gone anywhere.

00:41:21.579 --> 00:41:22.914 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
He's still there.

00:41:22.914 --> 00:41:24.115 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
It's very interesting
you would say

00:41:24.115 --> 00:41:26.584 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that because I was giving
a public talk about this

00:41:26.584 --> 00:41:28.419 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and I mentioned that
massacre and a woman

00:41:28.419 --> 00:41:30.688 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
in the front row just
burst into tears.

00:41:30.688 --> 00:41:33.291 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And I happened to be doing
this session with or this talk

00:41:33.291 --> 00:41:36.260 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
with Scott De Tamble who
happened to be in the audience.

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:37.762 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
So, he came up and
I introduced him

00:41:37.762 --> 00:41:41.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and he took the moment
to say are you okay.

00:41:41.933 --> 00:41:44.035 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
Would you like to examine that?

00:41:44.035 --> 00:41:48.139 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And now, if you look up my
name, Martini, "Flipside"

00:41:48.139 --> 00:41:51.542 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and YouTube there's a
whole channel of my talks.

00:41:51.542 --> 00:41:53.444 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And in one of them he
brings this woman up

00:41:53.444 --> 00:41:57.448 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and does right there a live
demonstration of talking

00:41:57.448 --> 00:42:00.818 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
to this woman and examining
it and she quickly went

00:42:00.818 --> 00:42:02.487 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
into the lifetime of a Sioux.

00:42:02.487 --> 00:42:08.326 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And interesting enough she said,
"It's in West Virginia" okay.

00:42:08.326 --> 00:42:09.827 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
And I got a ton of emails--

00:42:09.827 --> 00:42:10.661 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; GN: She had great details.

00:42:10.661 --> 00:42:11.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; RM: A ton of people saying.

00:42:11.996 --> 00:42:13.164 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Well, you know kind of email
people saying well the Sioux

00:42:13.164 --> 00:42:14.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
were never in West Virginia.

00:42:14.232 --> 00:42:15.733 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
Well, actually they were.

00:42:15.733 --> 00:42:17.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; GN: They were, yea.

00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:19.437 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; RM: And so she witnessed
the same thing you did.

00:42:19.437 --> 00:42:23.074 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Her tribe being massacred
and her job was

00:42:23.074 --> 00:42:25.710 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to burn all the clothing,
something I didn't know.

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:29.414 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But, that was how she helped
them move onto the spirit world.

00:42:29.414 --> 00:42:32.884 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
But, let's go beyond that for
a second and the reason it came

00:42:32.884 --> 00:42:36.587 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
up is usually when people
have a past life regression,

00:42:36.587 --> 00:42:40.558 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
imagine the question is what
significance does this past life

00:42:40.558 --> 00:42:42.527 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
have on my current life?

00:42:42.527 --> 00:42:44.929 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
That's why it's coming up
from your subconscious.

00:42:44.929 --> 00:42:47.031 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Whether it's true
or not it's coming

00:42:47.031 --> 00:42:49.567 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
up because it wants
you to examine it.

00:42:49.567 --> 00:42:53.137 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And when you examine it what
is the nature of Lakota?

00:42:53.137 --> 00:42:54.272 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
What is the nature of Sioux

00:42:54.272 --> 00:42:56.908 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
or what is the nature
of Native Americans?

00:42:56.908 --> 00:43:01.612 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
They're-- as you know that
nature and the preservation

00:43:01.612 --> 00:43:04.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
of the planet was paramount.

00:43:04.615 --> 00:43:07.952 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
In one session that I
recorded the person said,

00:43:07.952 --> 00:43:11.656 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
you know it's amazing that these
cultures, the Native Americans

00:43:11.656 --> 00:43:15.059 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and the Aboriginals of Australia
who are as close as you can get

00:43:15.059 --> 00:43:19.564 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to the afterlife in their
cultures aren't studied more

00:43:19.564 --> 00:43:23.267 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
by people for whatever reason,
because of science I guess.

00:43:23.267 --> 00:43:26.704 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
But, in your case that
Lakota warrior came forth

00:43:26.704 --> 00:43:30.708 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
because he wants
you to examine him.

00:43:30.708 --> 00:43:34.412 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
What was the nature of his
existence, the sacredness

00:43:34.412 --> 00:43:37.682 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
of all objects, of trees?

00:43:37.682 --> 00:43:39.417 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
I did a session recently.

00:43:39.417 --> 00:43:43.054 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It was a filmmaker who
was a skeptic and we got

00:43:43.054 --> 00:43:47.792 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
to this question of she wanted
to ask who or what is God?

00:43:47.792 --> 00:43:50.428 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
That was her skeptical
question going into it,

00:43:50.428 --> 00:43:53.231 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
but then once she got to a
place she was there in sort

00:43:53.231 --> 00:43:55.967 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
of this library of souls and
talking to her spirit guide

00:43:55.967 --> 00:43:56.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
and that was the question.

00:43:56.801 --> 00:43:58.603 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
What or who is God?

00:43:58.603 --> 00:44:01.806 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And the spirit guide said,
"God is beyond the capacity

00:44:01.806 --> 00:44:03.374 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
of the human brain
to comprehend.

00:44:03.374 --> 00:44:06.043 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It's just not physically
possible."

00:44:06.043 --> 00:44:07.945 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
You know at first I thought
oh he's ducking the question.

00:44:07.945 --> 00:44:09.046 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; GN: No, he wasn't.

00:44:09.046 --> 00:44:10.281 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; RM: But, he was
literally saying it's

00:44:10.281 --> 00:44:12.383 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
like outside the
computer's capacity.

00:44:12.383 --> 00:44:16.654 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It's just beyond the physical
capacity to understand.

00:44:16.654 --> 00:44:19.223 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; GN: Explain like a
computer to a caveman.

00:44:19.223 --> 00:44:19.991 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
&gt;&gt; RM: Exactly.

00:44:19.991 --> 00:44:21.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; GN: You couldn't do it.

00:44:21.058 --> 00:44:22.193 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; RM: Exactly or you
know or air travel

00:44:22.193 --> 00:44:23.761 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
to a bushman in Africa.

00:44:23.761 --> 00:44:24.495 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yea.

00:44:24.495 --> 00:44:25.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; RM: It's like really.

00:44:25.496 --> 00:44:30.568 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
But, he said, "You
can experience God

00:44:30.568 --> 00:44:35.339 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
by opening your heart to
everyone and to all things."

00:44:35.339 --> 00:44:37.108 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I thought that was
very interesting

00:44:37.108 --> 00:44:39.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
that he added to all things.

00:44:39.176 --> 00:44:41.579 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The logical saying is open
your heart to everyone.

00:44:41.579 --> 00:44:45.216 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Okay, we've heard that
before, but to all things.

00:44:45.216 --> 00:44:49.620 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Well, that's the Native
American version of reality.

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:51.422 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
Trees are alive.

00:44:51.422 --> 00:44:55.126 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Everything is animated with
energy or the Great Spirit,

00:44:55.126 --> 00:44:58.963 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
which is what we're
talking about here, energy.

00:44:58.963 --> 00:45:01.566 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
The Great Spirit
is within all of us

00:45:01.566 --> 00:45:04.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
at the same time simultaneously.

00:45:04.435 --> 00:45:06.103 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Then it-- once you
start to acknowledge

00:45:06.103 --> 00:45:09.273 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that perhaps the Great
Spirit is within all of us

00:45:09.273 --> 00:45:14.211 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
and all things you stop judging
people for their behavior

00:45:14.211 --> 00:45:17.048 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
because you consider
maybe they're doing this

00:45:17.048 --> 00:45:19.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
because I asked them to.

00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:20.818 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Maybe they're doing
it because they need

00:45:20.818 --> 00:45:23.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
to do it to learn something.

00:45:23.421 --> 00:45:28.059 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And then you start to
consider like is water sacred?

00:45:28.059 --> 00:45:29.694 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
Is the air sacred?

00:45:29.694 --> 00:45:32.363 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And if it is why do we treat
it the way we treat it?

00:45:32.363 --> 00:45:37.501 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And I'm not saying everybody
has to stop their car you know

00:45:37.501 --> 00:45:38.769 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
and not go anywhere again.

00:45:38.769 --> 00:45:41.072 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I'm just saying you start
to see it as a perspective.

00:45:41.072 --> 00:45:44.041 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
You know you start
to examine the planet

00:45:44.041 --> 00:45:47.845 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
from this new perspective
of I chose to be here.

00:45:47.845 --> 00:45:49.614 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
I'm a warrior here.

00:45:49.614 --> 00:45:51.048 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
I'm still a warrior.

00:45:51.048 --> 00:45:56.087 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I'm always a warrior within, but
I also want to be able to share

00:45:56.087 --> 00:45:56.921 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
that with other people.

00:45:56.921 --> 00:45:58.689 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
Does that make sense?

00:45:58.689 --> 00:46:00.625 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; GN: Let's take another
question for Rich Martini.

00:46:00.625 --> 00:46:02.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
Yes sir, right up here in front?

00:46:02.693 --> 00:46:05.096 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; Yes, you referred
to the Native Americans

00:46:05.096 --> 00:46:07.932 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and you referred to all
things and all relations

00:46:07.932 --> 00:46:11.769 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
as in Homa Takahashi [Assumed
spelling] is the Great Spirit

00:46:11.769 --> 00:46:13.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
they talk about.

00:46:13.037 --> 00:46:15.673 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Have you had any regression
where there were any people

00:46:15.673 --> 00:46:19.410 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that refer to being something
else other than a human being,

00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:22.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
a spirit animal so to speak?

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:26.851 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; RM: Well, I'll tell you
in Newton's research he found

00:46:26.851 --> 00:46:29.720 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
through the thousands of
people that he interviewed

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:33.157 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
that every animal
has its own realm.

00:46:33.157 --> 00:46:36.394 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So, which is similar to what
the Native Americans believe,

00:46:36.394 --> 00:46:38.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
the buffalo had their own realm.

00:46:38.429 --> 00:46:43.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
But, in his research it was
that humans are only humans,

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.538 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that animals of the
earth can switch around.

00:46:47.538 --> 00:46:49.573 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Animals of the air
can switch around

00:46:49.573 --> 00:46:52.209 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
and animals of the sea, okay.

00:46:52.209 --> 00:46:54.779 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
That people by and
large don't come back

00:46:54.779 --> 00:46:56.080 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
as animals or their pets.

00:46:56.080 --> 00:47:00.084 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
However, within each
realm, let's say,

00:47:00.084 --> 00:47:02.620 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
you can have a particular
animal that might have had many,

00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:06.223 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
many lifetimes and understands
this process better than we do.

00:47:06.223 --> 00:47:08.726 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So, you know we've all
experienced animals that look

00:47:08.726 --> 00:47:12.663 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
at us and you go oh my, this
cat is talking to me, you know

00:47:12.663 --> 00:47:14.799 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
or is trying to tell
me something or teach--

00:47:14.799 --> 00:47:17.535 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
a dolphin who teach
people things.

00:47:17.535 --> 00:47:19.470 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It's not to say that
they're any lesser.

00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:21.205 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
They're just another
version of it.

00:47:21.205 --> 00:47:25.009 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
However, in this research
you'll find people say

00:47:25.009 --> 00:47:28.879 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that they normally
don't reincarnate here.

00:47:28.879 --> 00:47:30.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
That they normally incarnate--

00:47:30.247 --> 00:47:30.981 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; GN: They go elsewhere.

00:47:30.981 --> 00:47:31.515 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; RM: Somewhere else.

00:47:31.515 --> 00:47:32.750 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yea.

00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:34.719 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; RM: In my book, "Flipside"
there's a guy like that

00:47:34.719 --> 00:47:37.388 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
who claims that he normally
is on this other planet.

00:47:37.388 --> 00:47:38.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
He names it.

00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:41.726 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I was able to find you
know in the astronomy guide

00:47:41.726 --> 00:47:44.061 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
where he claimed this place was.

00:47:44.061 --> 00:47:46.063 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
But, he said you know
there he was like,

00:47:46.063 --> 00:47:50.234 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
more like an animal creature
and he described himself.

00:47:50.234 --> 00:47:52.236 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And the question the
hypnotherapist asked, you,

00:47:52.236 --> 00:47:56.006 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
know is your group of
people like smarter?

00:47:56.006 --> 00:48:00.077 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
He laughed and what
he said is this is--

00:48:00.077 --> 00:48:02.246 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I think it's controversial,
but he said,

00:48:02.246 --> 00:48:05.349 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
you know we love you humans.

00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:06.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
We love you.

00:48:06.951 --> 00:48:10.187 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
He said, pets is
not the right word.

00:48:10.187 --> 00:48:12.156 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
However, we consider
you and I was

00:48:12.156 --> 00:48:14.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
like pets is not the right word.

00:48:14.692 --> 00:48:18.295 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
But, what he was saying was
you know because if you want

00:48:18.295 --> 00:48:21.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to just picture it that
we're playing in a sandbox

00:48:21.899 --> 00:48:24.835 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and we're young kids
in a sandbox and we

00:48:24.835 --> 00:48:26.971 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
as the older souls are
back there observing

00:48:26.971 --> 00:48:28.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
as playing in sandbox.

00:48:28.472 --> 00:48:30.875 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Certainly you know you see
people fighting and going

00:48:30.875 --> 00:48:33.844 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
through their, you know-- and
they look at you with tears

00:48:33.844 --> 00:48:36.413 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
in their eyes and you
say you know its okay.

00:48:36.413 --> 00:48:37.715 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
You know just relax.

00:48:37.715 --> 00:48:38.816 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
You're learning something

00:48:38.816 --> 00:48:41.152 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
from this you know
fight that you're in.

00:48:41.152 --> 00:48:44.255 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
But, and you know that would be
like pets not the right word,

00:48:44.255 --> 00:48:46.023 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
but you know it's sort
of treating people

00:48:46.023 --> 00:48:48.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
with this benevolent attitude.

00:48:48.159 --> 00:48:53.264 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So, along those lines
people do and have reported

00:48:53.264 --> 00:48:56.567 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that sometimes they're
in some other planet

00:48:56.567 --> 00:49:01.172 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and they see themselves as a
different form that's not human,

00:49:01.172 --> 00:49:02.773 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
but is some other form.

00:49:02.773 --> 00:49:04.408 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
But, there's intelligence

00:49:04.408 --> 00:49:07.745 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
or sentience involved
within that persona.

00:49:07.745 --> 00:49:10.848 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And my feeling about this
is you know put that aside.

00:49:10.848 --> 00:49:12.850 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
You need to find two
people from that planet

00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:15.352 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
so you can examine what
are they talking about.

00:49:15.352 --> 00:49:18.189 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Listen, everybody has their
own personal experience.

00:49:18.189 --> 00:49:21.358 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
You have an example
of what sunset is.

00:49:21.358 --> 00:49:23.861 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
You know what the word
home means to you.

00:49:23.861 --> 00:49:24.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
It means something else to me.

00:49:24.995 --> 00:49:25.996 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; GN: And it's different
to somebody else.

00:49:25.996 --> 00:49:27.331 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; RM: It's different
to everybody.

00:49:27.331 --> 00:49:29.300 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And so, when you
experience these life--

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:33.304 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
these past life regressions
everybody has a different

00:49:33.304 --> 00:49:35.973 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
examination of what a
library is, for example.

00:49:35.973 --> 00:49:38.709 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
They'll call it a library, but
it's different for everybody.

00:49:38.709 --> 00:49:41.011 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
It's never the same structure.

00:49:41.011 --> 00:49:43.681 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So, we-- you know, you know
that it's a mental construct.

00:49:43.681 --> 00:49:45.883 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
I'll give you an example.

00:49:45.883 --> 00:49:49.486 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
At some point while I was doing
a session, my own session,

00:49:49.486 --> 00:49:51.388 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
I was there with my dad.

00:49:51.388 --> 00:49:54.225 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And the hypnotherapist
said, "So,

00:49:54.225 --> 00:49:56.827 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
if you could see your dad's
energetic color what would

00:49:56.827 --> 00:49:57.928 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
that be?"

00:49:57.928 --> 00:50:01.198 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And I-- as he asked me
that I saw him dissolve

00:50:01.198 --> 00:50:04.268 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
into this golden orange
light and he was just

00:50:04.268 --> 00:50:05.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
like a shimmering light.

00:50:05.369 --> 00:50:06.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; GN: Uh huh.

00:50:06.203 --> 00:50:07.404 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; RM: And then I described it.

00:50:07.404 --> 00:50:09.874 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And then when I was done
describing it he went back

00:50:09.874 --> 00:50:11.508 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:18%
to dad.

00:50:11.508 --> 00:50:14.912 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Later on I thought well,
it's not that he dissolved.

00:50:14.912 --> 00:50:16.914 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It's that I adjusted
my per-- my--

00:50:16.914 --> 00:50:18.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; GN: Perception.

00:50:18.282 --> 00:50:21.218 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; RM: My FM receiver slightly
so I could just see the shimmer

00:50:21.218 --> 00:50:23.854 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and then it went back to
where I could see the person.

00:50:23.854 --> 00:50:26.056 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; GN: Well, you know how they
say Richard that beauty is

00:50:26.056 --> 00:50:27.558 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
in eyes of the beholder?

00:50:27.558 --> 00:50:28.926 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; RM: Absolutely.

00:50:28.926 --> 00:50:30.527 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; GN: People look at somebody
differently than somebody else.

00:50:30.527 --> 00:50:31.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; RM: Absolutely.

00:50:31.462 --> 00:50:32.863 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; GN: And it really works.

00:50:32.863 --> 00:50:35.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Let's take one more audience
question, now way in the back.

00:50:35.733 --> 00:50:36.634 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; I'm just curious.

00:50:36.634 --> 00:50:38.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
In the stream of reincarnation

00:50:38.402 --> 00:50:41.272 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
where does a serial
killer fit in?

00:50:41.272 --> 00:50:44.975 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; RM: Well, in my experience it
really is based on the research.

00:50:44.975 --> 00:50:49.613 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So, when you talk about
negativity and people

00:50:49.613 --> 00:50:52.216 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that are negative, you
know the Hitler question.

00:50:52.216 --> 00:50:55.953 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
You know, where does Hitler
fit inside that paradigm,

00:50:55.953 --> 00:50:59.256 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
especially when people
claim in this realm

00:50:59.256 --> 00:51:02.226 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that there is no
judgment, that there is no--

00:51:02.226 --> 00:51:04.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
it's just forgiveness.

00:51:04.128 --> 00:51:08.098 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And when you claim that then it
goes against everything we know,

00:51:08.098 --> 00:51:11.268 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
against you know people,
the way their behavior is.

00:51:11.268 --> 00:51:12.603 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
And when you-- but when you talk

00:51:12.603 --> 00:51:15.506 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
about a serial killer all I can
do is point to the research.

00:51:15.506 --> 00:51:19.243 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
In Newton's case he
had spoken to people

00:51:19.243 --> 00:51:25.115 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
who had experienced some energy
from people that were part

00:51:25.115 --> 00:51:29.687 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
of that paradigm and
he said, "Those people"

00:51:29.687 --> 00:51:33.023 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
because the way the
process works-- that's--

00:51:33.023 --> 00:51:35.359 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
if I may just go
back for a second.

00:51:35.359 --> 00:51:38.062 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The process according
to spirit guides is

00:51:38.062 --> 00:51:41.565 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that energy is put together
not at the big bang,

00:51:41.565 --> 00:51:45.903 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
but at any point and
that becomes the soul.

00:51:45.903 --> 00:51:49.139 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And that that soul is then
nurtured and added to and sort

00:51:49.139 --> 00:51:52.042 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
of like, almost like different
energy pat-- like a painting.

00:51:52.042 --> 00:51:54.111 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The different colors are
added to it and added to it

00:51:54.111 --> 00:51:55.746 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and then they begin
their journey

00:51:55.746 --> 00:51:56.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
through each lifetime, okay.

00:51:56.947 --> 00:51:59.616 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And then as they go through
each lifetime they add

00:51:59.616 --> 00:52:00.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
more experience.

00:52:00.751 --> 00:52:01.986 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
They have-- everyone
has a spirit guide

00:52:01.986 --> 00:52:04.421 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and then eventually
they get to some place.

00:52:04.421 --> 00:52:07.624 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Now, let's imagine somebody
has gotten to a place

00:52:07.624 --> 00:52:11.228 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
where every time they show
up here they go I'm going

00:52:11.228 --> 00:52:13.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
to master this anger that I have

00:52:13.831 --> 00:52:15.499 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
so I'm going to choose
this guy--

00:52:15.499 --> 00:52:16.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; GN: Uh huh.

00:52:16.333 --> 00:52:17.401 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; RM: And I can get over this.

00:52:17.401 --> 00:52:18.702 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
And they get here
and they can't.

00:52:18.702 --> 00:52:19.670 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
They can't master it.

00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:20.771 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
They're terrible at it.

00:52:20.771 --> 00:52:21.905 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
They get enraged.

00:52:21.905 --> 00:52:23.007 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
They go out and they
kill a bunch of people.

00:52:23.007 --> 00:52:25.075 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Now, they go back to
the life between lives.

00:52:25.075 --> 00:52:28.078 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Everybody pulls them aside
and says now what did you do?

00:52:28.078 --> 00:52:32.249 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And as you hear in
near death research

00:52:32.249 --> 00:52:35.519 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and this research people
experience the negativity

00:52:35.519 --> 00:52:37.388 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that they've engendered
on other people.

00:52:37.388 --> 00:52:39.957 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
So, they go through
that experience of,

00:52:39.957 --> 00:52:41.458 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
a cleansing experience,

00:52:41.458 --> 00:52:44.128 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
but experiencing what
happened to other people.

00:52:44.128 --> 00:52:46.430 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So, that's a very difficult
thing for a person to go

00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:48.232 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
through as you can imagine.

00:52:48.232 --> 00:52:50.467 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
But however, let's pretend
that guy then comes back

00:52:50.467 --> 00:52:52.102 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
and continues to fail.

00:52:52.102 --> 00:52:57.541 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
In Newton's case he reported
that sometimes your Council

00:52:57.541 --> 00:53:02.279 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of Elders along with you decides
you know this is not working.

00:53:02.279 --> 00:53:04.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
We need to pull you apart.

00:53:04.481 --> 00:53:07.985 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
We need to pull your energy
apart and reconstruct it

00:53:07.985 --> 00:53:11.121 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
so we can adjust this behavior.

00:53:11.121 --> 00:53:13.690 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I know how weird that
sounds, but it follows

00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:15.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
with the logic of free will.

00:53:15.826 --> 00:53:18.662 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So, you may choose to say you
know what you're right I can't

00:53:18.662 --> 00:53:21.398 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
handle being on this
planet without being crazy.

00:53:21.398 --> 00:53:23.200 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; GN: Do you think a
serial killer, Rich,

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:25.235 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
comes back as a serial killer?

00:53:25.235 --> 00:53:26.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; RM: I don't know.

00:53:26.236 --> 00:53:27.738 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Let's just say based
on the research.

00:53:27.738 --> 00:53:31.075 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It's not fair for me to go
you know this is what happens.

00:53:31.075 --> 00:53:32.342 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I haven't personally
experienced any of that.

00:53:32.342 --> 00:53:33.911 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; GN: They're supposed
to perfect themselves

00:53:33.911 --> 00:53:35.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
and get better, right.

00:53:35.245 --> 00:53:37.247 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; RM: Well, what happens is
between lives you go back.

00:53:37.247 --> 00:53:38.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Now, let's give an example

00:53:38.916 --> 00:53:42.586 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
of somebody who's a serial
killer that's paid by the Army.

00:53:42.586 --> 00:53:43.720 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
&gt;&gt; GN: Okay.

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:45.556 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; RM: Okay, somebody
who's been given a rifle

00:53:45.556 --> 00:53:47.458 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
and they're a sniper.

00:53:47.458 --> 00:53:48.926 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
Now, they have been asked

00:53:48.926 --> 00:53:50.694 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
by their government
to go out and be a--

00:53:50.694 --> 00:53:51.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
&gt;&gt; GN: And kill.

00:53:51.528 --> 00:53:53.430 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; RM: Kill, okay, repeatedly.

00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:55.599 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
We don't think of it-- we
think of it differently

00:53:55.599 --> 00:53:58.435 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
because it's not like crazy
running around with a gun.

00:53:58.435 --> 00:54:01.238 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
But, no they're bumping
off people.

00:54:01.238 --> 00:54:04.975 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
There was a soldier that the
"L.A. Times" wrote about.

00:54:04.975 --> 00:54:06.610 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
Every time-- he was a sniper.

00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:08.946 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
He was called the Marlboro Man.

00:54:08.946 --> 00:54:12.216 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
But, every time he
killed somebody he said,

00:54:12.216 --> 00:54:15.853 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
"He saw their life
flash before his eyes."

00:54:15.853 --> 00:54:18.655 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
He had that odd experience
of seeing them grow up

00:54:18.655 --> 00:54:19.756 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
and all the way to the moment--

00:54:19.756 --> 00:54:20.724 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
&gt;&gt; GN: Instantly.

00:54:20.724 --> 00:54:21.258 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; RM: Where he pulled
the trigger.

00:54:21.258 --> 00:54:22.593 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yea.

00:54:22.593 --> 00:54:24.895 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; RM: Instantly, which needless
to say affected him deeply

00:54:24.895 --> 00:54:27.397 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and now you know he's in
a rehab and he's trying

00:54:27.397 --> 00:54:30.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
to recover from that experience.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:35.105 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But, he was, from a perspective
point of view, tasked and agreed

00:54:35.105 --> 00:54:37.941 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
to play this role of
a person who went out

00:54:37.941 --> 00:54:40.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
and ended lives, okay.

00:54:40.244 --> 00:54:44.414 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And at some point he realized
I can't do that anymore

00:54:44.414 --> 00:54:46.283 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
and put the gun down and said--

00:54:46.283 --> 00:54:47.417 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; GN: And that was it for him.

00:54:47.417 --> 00:54:48.252 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; RM: So, that was it for him.

00:54:48.252 --> 00:54:49.853 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
He learned that lesson.

00:54:49.853 --> 00:54:51.855 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
However he came to
it he came about it

00:54:51.855 --> 00:54:54.525 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
in a weird different way,
paid for by the government.

00:54:54.525 --> 00:54:55.259 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; GN: But, he got there.

00:54:55.259 --> 00:54:56.460 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; RM: But, he got there.

00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:58.562 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So, in the terms of
somebody who, like this kid

00:54:58.562 --> 00:55:01.265 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
in Santa Monica, who
obviously was enraged,

00:55:01.265 --> 00:55:03.300 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
perhaps SSRI drugs,
we don't know.

00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:05.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
He was under psychiatric care.

00:55:05.402 --> 00:55:07.304 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
He killed a lot of people.

00:55:07.304 --> 00:55:09.273 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
He fired thirteen
hundred rounds.

00:55:09.273 --> 00:55:10.274 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
&gt;&gt; GN: Yea.

00:55:10.274 --> 00:55:11.642 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; RM: But, he killed
five people.

00:55:11.642 --> 00:55:15.312 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Those five people, you know
you have to examine what--

00:55:15.312 --> 00:55:18.882 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and like I say, there's a myriad
of reasons why things happen.

00:55:18.882 --> 00:55:21.318 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
So, the answer to your question
is do serial killers keep

00:55:21.318 --> 00:55:22.219 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
coming back.

00:55:22.219 --> 00:55:23.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
It depends on each person.

00:55:23.921 --> 00:55:25.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
It depends on what they learn.

00:55:25.222 --> 00:55:27.391 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
It depends on what
their agreements were.

00:55:27.391 --> 00:55:28.992 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; GN: Let's take
another look at one

00:55:28.992 --> 00:55:30.928 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
of your documentary
clips here Rich.

00:55:30.928 --> 00:55:31.562 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; RM: Thanks.

00:55:31.562 --> 00:55:32.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; GN: Here we go.

00:55:32.863 --> 00:55:35.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; RM: The most famous
reincarnated soul who can read

00:55:35.699 --> 00:55:39.403 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and reflect on his previous
thirteen lifetimes lives

00:55:39.403 --> 00:55:41.905 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
in Dharamsala, India.

00:55:41.905 --> 00:55:44.908 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Hindus, Buddhists, Daoists,
American Native tribes,

00:55:44.908 --> 00:55:48.078 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
Aboriginal tribes of Australia,
the Celts and the Cathours

00:55:48.078 --> 00:55:49.780 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and twenty five percent
of Americans believe

00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:53.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
in some form of reincarnation.

00:55:53.917 --> 00:55:57.087 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
[chanting] Reincarnation as a
religious concept for Hindus

00:55:57.087 --> 00:55:59.923 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and Buddhists maintains
fundamental tenants

00:55:59.923 --> 00:56:05.596 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
about how it works.

00:56:05.596 --> 00:56:07.297 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
[band playing] The theory
is that between lives we are

00:56:07.297 --> 00:56:10.267 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%

Newton's research
is contrary to this.

According to his seven thousand

religions like Tibetans

00:56:33.056 --> 00:56:38.562 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and Buddhists more conscious
of this than another religion

00:56:38.562 --> 00:56:41.231 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
because you know I don't recall
the Catholic Church talking

about reincarnation?

the Cathours in there

that people, I think,

00:57:03.053 --> 00:57:06.256 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%

as a religion.

00:57:16.233 --> 00:57:17.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

&gt;&gt; RM: Yourself.

00:57:19.369 --> 00:57:22.506 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So, but they classify
themselves as a religion just

00:57:22.506 --> 00:57:24.007 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
because it makes it
easier for people

00:57:24.007 --> 00:57:26.376 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to understand you know
what they're talking about

dressed in a certain way.

think this research ennobles

across it, it was like wow.

upbringing as a Catholic.

holy men are saying.

00:57:54.571 --> 00:57:57.040 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%

was discovered a couple

about it.

00:58:11.555 --> 00:58:14.191 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%

there, Judas claims, of course,

00:58:14.191 --> 00:58:15.359 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
you know we don't know.

00:58:15.359 --> 00:58:17.394 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Can't grill him on
it, but Judas claims

00:58:17.394 --> 00:58:19.296 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
that Jesus came to
him and said--

00:58:19.296 --> 00:58:20.797 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%

this for me, right.

00:58:20.797 --> 00:58:22.632 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; RM: And he said
to Jesus, "I can't"--

00:58:22.632 --> 00:58:23.367 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%

00:58:25.635 --> 00:58:28.739 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%

truly love me then you will help

00:58:28.739 --> 00:58:30.040 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
me fulfill my destiny."

00:58:31.174 --> 00:58:33.310 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%

pretend for a moment

00:58:33.310 --> 00:58:36.012 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
that Jesus knew what
he was here to do.

00:58:36.012 --> 00:58:39.649 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
He needed someone to a fill
that destiny for him, you see.

The stones that are
in your path,

00:58:41.685 --> 00:58:44.254 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%

had to be in order for him

00:58:44.254 --> 00:58:46.556 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
to accomplish his mission here.

00:58:46.556 --> 00:58:48.725 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
What's his big message?

00:58:48.725 --> 00:58:51.862 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
Love your neighbor as yourself,

00:58:51.862 --> 00:58:54.998 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
because your neighbor
is of yourself.

00:58:57.734 --> 00:59:00.103 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and that's really
throughout all religions.

00:59:00.103 --> 00:59:01.571 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
You know as the Dali Lama says,

00:59:01.571 --> 00:59:05.609 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
"My religion is kindness,
a warm heart."

00:59:05.609 --> 00:59:08.412 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
When you talk about what
that idea, what is God,

00:59:08.412 --> 00:59:11.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
open your heart to everyone.

00:59:11.014 --> 00:59:13.350 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
There's no more better
way to open your heart

00:59:13.350 --> 00:59:14.885 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
to everyone then to
have a warm heart.

00:59:53.523 --> 00:59:56.059 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
to examine it so
we can understand.

00:59:56.059 --> 00:59:59.396 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And my motivation really is
the simplest of all things:

00:59:59.396 --> 01:00:03.400 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
If reincarnation exists
then it behooves us all

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:06.570 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
to examine what we're doing
to the water and to the air

01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:08.405 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
if only for selfish reasons--

01:00:08.405 --> 01:00:09.773 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%

01:00:09.773 --> 01:00:12.442 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%

to Rich the more I'm convinced

01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:31.461 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
