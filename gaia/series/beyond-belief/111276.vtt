00:00:05.214 --> 00:00:07.672 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[THEME MUSIC] And I think
many people today don't

00:00:07.672 --> 00:00:08.880 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.360 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.300 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.282 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.282 --> 00:00:27.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Hey, welcome
back to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.340 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.049 align:middle line:10%
In this edition, an old friend
of mine is with us, Jim Karol.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.991 align:middle line:90%
He's a mentalist.

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:34.240 align:middle line:90%
And let me tell you something.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.100 align:middle line:84%
He's been on "Coast to Coast"
with me a number of times,

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.520 align:middle line:84%
and he has done some
amazing things on the radio.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.770 align:middle line:84%
But wait until you see him on
"Beyond Belief," because we're

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.220 align:middle line:84%
going to be doing some
special types of things.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.140 align:middle line:90%
I want to call them tricks, Jim.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.780 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>JIM KAROL: Well, I just
call them extraordinary feats

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.090 align:middle line:90%
of the mind.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.350 align:middle line:90%
I start off with a trick.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.377 align:middle line:84%
I'm only going to do
one magic trick, then

00:00:57.377 --> 00:00:59.210 align:middle line:84%
from that point on,
everything else is going

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.766 align:middle line:84%
to be like a feat of the mind
based on your mental abilities,

00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.390 align:middle line:84%
your science, memory,
things like that.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where I'll
be saying, wow.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.526 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: I hope.

00:01:06.526 --> 00:01:07.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, wow.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.934 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're a mentalist,
but are you a magician, too?

00:01:10.934 --> 00:01:11.850 align:middle line:90%
What's the difference?

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.558 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: OK, I started
off as a magician.

00:01:13.558 --> 00:01:16.700 align:middle line:10%
Well, it started
off-- wow-- about 31.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.190 align:middle line:10%
At the age of 31, I worked in a
steel mill at Bethlehem Steel.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.089 align:middle line:84%
I lived in Allentown,
Pennsylvania.

00:01:22.089 --> 00:01:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My Navy buddies
used to work there, too.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.120 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Oh, my gosh.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.620 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And so what
happened, George, was

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.877 align:middle line:84%
I met this guy who
was a magician,

00:01:29.877 --> 00:01:31.460 align:middle line:84%
and I showed him a
couple card tricks.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.030 align:middle line:90%
He showed me.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And then he told me
he had a magic shop.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.710 align:middle line:84%
So I would start going to his
magic shop every Saturday,

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.880 align:middle line:84%
blowing probably 1/4 of my
paycheck there, all right?

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.910 align:middle line:90%
And thank God for that.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.024 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But steelworkers
did well then.

00:01:43.024 --> 00:01:44.190 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: We did really well.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.655 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In those days.

00:01:44.655 --> 00:01:45.410 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Right.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Then what had had happened
was I got married,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.750 align:middle line:84%
my wife was pregnant
with our second child,

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.256 align:middle line:84%
and I got laid off, like the
Billy Joel song "Living Here

00:01:55.256 --> 00:01:55.839 align:middle line:90%
in Allentown."

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:58.210 align:middle line:84%
I lost my job, didn't
know what to do.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.650 align:middle line:84%
So I took her Avon account,
and I went door to door.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.400 align:middle line:84%
Could you imagine me
knocking on the door?

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.650 align:middle line:90%
Hey, you wanna buy some Avon?

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.149 align:middle line:90%
Look at me.

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.457 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if the
women felt sorry for me

00:02:06.457 --> 00:02:07.790 align:middle line:90%
or if they liked my card tricks.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:08.840 align:middle line:10%
I would show card tricks.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.430 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Or they wanted
to get rid of you,

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.697 align:middle line:10%
so they bought fast
and then out you went.

00:02:11.697 --> 00:02:13.030 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: But it did really well.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.654 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened
was, they ended up

00:02:14.654 --> 00:02:18.670 align:middle line:84%
hiring me to do a show for
1,000 women doing card tricks.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.915 align:middle line:84%
And here I am,
3,500 shows later.

00:02:20.915 --> 00:02:21.915 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:02:21.915 --> 00:02:22.410 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: It's amazing. yeah.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.076 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
good in the beginning?

00:02:24.076 --> 00:02:26.402 align:middle line:84%
How long did it take you to
really get this stuff down?

00:02:26.402 --> 00:02:27.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: You know what?

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.660 align:middle line:84%
I was always shy all
my life and backwards,

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.200 align:middle line:84%
and the magic, the
card tricks, by seeing

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.769 align:middle line:84%
the emotion and the
expression on people's faces,

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.310 align:middle line:84%
I believe that that
actually built up

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.320 align:middle line:84%
my self-esteem, and confidence,
and everything else,

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.510 align:middle line:84%
which now that's
kind of what I do.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.040 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing how it all started.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And it got better and better
and better over the years.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.624 align:middle line:84%
And we can show you this now,
because it's a magic thing.

00:02:50.624 --> 00:02:52.290 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather get the
magic out of the way.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Could I show you
a magic thing now?

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, show
me a magic trick now.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.385 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: That way
it's out of the way.

00:02:55.385 --> 00:02:56.385 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I mean?

00:02:56.385 --> 00:02:58.765 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here, let's move this.

00:02:58.765 --> 00:03:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Like here
are the cards.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.144 align:middle line:84%
They're not magic
cards or any tricks.

00:03:02.144 --> 00:03:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're just cards.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.726 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Yeah,
they're just cards.

00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:07.866 align:middle line:84%
But what we're going to try
to do here is an experiment.

00:03:07.866 --> 00:03:08.740 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it this way.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.610 align:middle line:90%
I got a good idea.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.360 align:middle line:84%
George, if you were to remove
one card out of the deck right

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.230 align:middle line:84%
now-- it doesn't matter
what the card is.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.271 align:middle line:90%
Take one.

00:03:15.271 --> 00:03:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And hide it from you?

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Yeah,
don't let me see it.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.870 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Now, I'll turn around.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.100 align:middle line:90%
Show it to the camera.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.540 align:middle line:90%
Don't let me see the card.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm not gonna
tell you what it is.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.650 align:middle line:90%
You'll have to peek at it.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.566 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: I'm gonna take
the card back from you

00:03:26.566 --> 00:03:28.450 align:middle line:90%
like this, all right?

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Better still, we're gonna
rip it up in pieces, George.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.399 align:middle line:84%
I'm gonna try
something really cool.

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:34.440 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the first
magic tricks right here.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.850 align:middle line:84%
You can hold the pieces so
we don't forget the card.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.604 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm gonna
take these pieces,

00:03:38.604 --> 00:03:40.520 align:middle line:84%
and I'm gonna put them
down here by my pocket.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, he's
putting them in his pocket.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: And now I'm
going to take out this.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:45.659 align:middle line:90%
Now watch.

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to touch-- here,
take that banana with you

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.120 align:middle line:84%
other hand-- with
your other hand.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.480 align:middle line:90%
Now hold the two like this.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.900 align:middle line:90%
Now watch.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.231 align:middle line:84%
Come close to it like this,
and just make a beeping sound.

00:03:57.231 --> 00:03:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Me?

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.313 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Yeah.

00:03:58.313 --> 00:03:59.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Beep.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.001 align:middle line:90%
Beep.

00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:00.500 align:middle line:90%
Beep.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.070 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Now watch.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.640 align:middle line:90%
It's done.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.305 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's done?

00:04:03.305 --> 00:04:05.680 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Put your piece down
right there in front of you.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This piece?

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.833 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Yeah.

00:04:06.833 --> 00:04:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Peel the banana
that's been sitting.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.150 align:middle line:90%
Tommy got me the banana.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.850 align:middle line:90%
This is not my banana.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:11.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Peel the banana?

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.830 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Yeah, peel the banana.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I haven't
had breakfast yet.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.615 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: I have some
napkins here, too,

00:04:15.615 --> 00:04:17.890 align:middle line:84%
just in case it gets a
little messy, all right?

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.897 align:middle line:84%
And then just rip the
banana in half, George.

00:04:19.897 --> 00:04:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Now think about what
we're doing here.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You want me
to break it in half.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.530 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Yeah, rip it in half.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.670 align:middle line:90%
Tommy got me the banana.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.201 align:middle line:90%
We just picked any card.

00:04:26.201 --> 00:04:27.200 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And you can set that on
the napkin here, all right?

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Now take that other banana, and
now like take a bite out of it.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.320 align:middle line:90%
Or rip more.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.280 align:middle line:90%
Rip it in half again.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.660 align:middle line:90%
Watch.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.170 align:middle line:90%
You're gonna love this.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.660 align:middle line:84%
You're gonna rip
the banana in half.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've
gotta be kidding me.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: I'm serious.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.270 align:middle line:90%
Rip it one more time.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.570 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:40.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
touch the banana.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.550 align:middle line:90%
You'll think it's a trick.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.591 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I'm not
gonna bite it after you've

00:04:43.591 --> 00:04:45.280 align:middle line:90%
touched it, that's for sure.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.680 align:middle line:90%
All right, what am I--?

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.501 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Do you notice
anything inside there, George?

00:04:49.501 --> 00:04:50.000 align:middle line:90%
Nothing?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.810 align:middle line:90%
Nothing?

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.361 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:04:53.361 --> 00:04:53.860 align:middle line:90%
Look.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, come on.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.270 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Pull it out.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.190 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that amazing?

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.981 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:04:57.981 --> 00:04:59.300 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Now open it up.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.140 align:middle line:90%


00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.350 align:middle line:90%
And show the camera.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.970 align:middle line:84%
The card is actually
totally restored.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.085 align:middle line:90%
There's a piece missing.

00:05:09.085 --> 00:05:10.430 align:middle line:90%
It didn't totally restore.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.560 align:middle line:84%
You know why it didn't
totally restore, George?

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Because that one
piece you kept out.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.080 align:middle line:90%
Let's see if it matches.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.770 align:middle line:90%
It's a perfect match.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:19.686 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: See?

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.170 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
"beyond belief."

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: And that's what
I started with, George.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.720 align:middle line:90%
That was a magic trick.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I rip open a-- let
me wipe my hands here, Jimmy.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.460 align:middle line:90%
I rip open this banana.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.400 align:middle line:90%
I picked the 10 of clubs card.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.940 align:middle line:90%


00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.900 align:middle line:90%
The torn piece was in my hand.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:52.080 align:middle line:84%
I had the card with the
exact rip inside that banana.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.920 align:middle line:84%
There's no way that you
could have done that.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: It's a trick.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.330 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is, is a trick.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.704 align:middle line:84%
The stuff we're
going to show you

00:05:58.704 --> 00:06:01.210 align:middle line:90%
later are not tricks like that.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.230 align:middle line:84%
They're a little
more mental related.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.010 align:middle line:84%
That's why I call
myself a mentalist.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.231 align:middle line:90%
A mentalist basically--

00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a trick
what you just did.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: That was a magic trick
that I could teach you how

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.008 align:middle line:84%
to do, and with a
little practice--

00:06:11.008 --> 00:06:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You teach
me that, I'll be

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.789 align:middle line:90%
the king of any bar I go into.

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: I'm telling you.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.496 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you could make
that card basically

00:06:17.496 --> 00:06:18.902 align:middle line:90%
appear anywhere you want.

00:06:18.902 --> 00:06:20.360 align:middle line:84%
That's what's really
cool about it.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.220 align:middle line:84%
You could make that card
appear anywhere you want.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.928 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now here's
the question, though.

00:06:23.928 --> 00:06:26.590 align:middle line:84%
How did you get the
banana as a trick?

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.575 align:middle line:84%
How did you get the card, the
10 of clubs, in the banana?

00:06:29.575 --> 00:06:31.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Well, I
don't want to tell you

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.050 align:middle line:90%
that in front of everybody.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.110 align:middle line:90%
I said I'll teach you that.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.526 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And let
me say something.

00:06:34.526 --> 00:06:35.890 align:middle line:90%
This is my observation.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.110 align:middle line:84%
It was pretty gooey,
which tells me

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.760 align:middle line:90%
it had been in there some time.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.692 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Yeah.

00:06:41.692 --> 00:06:42.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that right?

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: No, because
Tommy got the bananas.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:44.980 align:middle line:90%
That's what's cool.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:45.390 align:middle line:90%
Ask Tommy.

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You didn't
come with bananas.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.250 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: No, I didn't
come with bananas.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You didn't
fly here with bananas.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: No, I didn't.

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.226 align:middle line:84%
By the time I flew-- I got
stuck in Chicago four hours.

00:06:52.226 --> 00:06:53.600 align:middle line:84%
That banana would
have been done.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.766 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You gotta teach me.

00:06:54.766 --> 00:06:55.740 align:middle line:90%
Was it slight of hand?

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.900 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: There's a little slight
of hand, a little bit of magic.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.290 align:middle line:90%
It's a cool thing to learn.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:00.700 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the first
things I've ever done--

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's the greatest
trick I've ever seen.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: I appreciate that.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:04.910 align:middle line:84%
Down at the steel
mill, I would make

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.590 align:middle line:84%
cards appear in everything,
I mean, cantaloupes.

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Like in my show, I have jumbo
cards, and they rip them up

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.485 align:middle line:84%
and it appears in a
cantaloupe or a watermelon.

00:07:12.485 --> 00:07:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it wasn't just
the card in the banana.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.584 align:middle line:84%
It was the fact that it
had the tear out of it.

00:07:17.584 --> 00:07:18.250 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: I know.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.501 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And I had that piece.

00:07:19.501 --> 00:07:22.125 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Well, that's what makes
it convincing at the end then,

00:07:22.125 --> 00:07:22.860 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.500 align:middle line:84%
But I call that
trick Card in Banana.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.750 align:middle line:90%
But that's how I started.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.310 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you
asked how we started.

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.070 align:middle line:84%
This is the thing I did
for women selling Avon.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.400 align:middle line:90%
And they were, oh, my God!

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.650 align:middle line:90%
And they'd buy Avon off of me.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:36.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But that's magic.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:37.460 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: That's a magic trick.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you're
also a mentalist.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.830 align:middle line:90%
So tell me what that is.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: OK, what
had happened was--

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:46.820 align:middle line:90%
I'd been doing this for a while.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And then what happened was about
the age of 49, right around I

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.470 align:middle line:84%
was about to turn 50, I started
getting these like chest pains.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:56.140 align:middle line:84%
So I'm traveling all
around the country

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.240 align:middle line:84%
performing, doing
these card tricks.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.140 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they nicknamed
me Psychic Madman

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.300 align:middle line:84%
at one time because there was
a lot of [INAUDIBLE] in 1990.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.755 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I remember calling
you that, Psychic Madman.

00:08:05.755 --> 00:08:06.588 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Yeah, yeah.

00:08:06.588 --> 00:08:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, back in '90, I
had a little dream,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.455 align:middle line:84%
and for some reason, I
dreamt, and all of a sudden

00:08:11.455 --> 00:08:12.830 align:middle line:84%
the phone is
ringing in my dream.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:13.805 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, hello?

00:08:13.805 --> 00:08:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And then the voice goes,
Jim, you were right.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.430 align:middle line:84%
The Pennsylvania daily
number was 2, 2, 2.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.080 align:middle line:84%
I woke up, I'm like,
you, that was--

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.327 align:middle line:84%
so I wrote it down on the side
of the bed, fell back asleep.

00:08:23.327 --> 00:08:25.410 align:middle line:84%
I woke up in the morning,
and I was rushing around

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.324 align:middle line:84%
because I had a show at
Villanova University.

00:08:27.324 --> 00:08:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And my wife was making the
bed, and she goes, what's this?

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.929 align:middle line:84%
And she showed me the note, and
it said 2, 2, 2, December 22,

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:34.740 align:middle line:90%
Pennsylvania Daily Number.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, wow.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.669 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden
the dream clicked.

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:40.110 align:middle line:84%
So I went to show, hey,
play 2, 2, 2 December 22.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:41.400 align:middle line:90%
It was in November.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And at 31 shows, I would hold
up this sign, play 2, 2, 2,

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.140 align:middle line:90%
play 2, 2, 2.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And on December 22, I had
a show, so before the show

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.020 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to go buy the
Daily Number for myself

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.020 align:middle line:90%
just in case it came up.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were
curious, right?

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there were like 75
or 100 people standing in line.

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:56.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh, my God.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:59.060 align:middle line:84%
So I went to buy my
cantaloupes for the trick

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.630 align:middle line:84%
that I just showed you, and
I didn't get the number,

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.100 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't
have time to wait.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.480 align:middle line:84%
So when I got home, I
looked at my voice mail.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.140 align:middle line:90%
And it's blinking, so I hit it.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And it goes, you have 67
messages in your mailbox.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my gosh.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Usually I
got six or seven.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And I started
playing them, and I

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.000 align:middle line:84%
swear, the third message
goes, Jim, you were right.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.610 align:middle line:84%
The Pennsylvania Daily
Number was 2, 2, 2.

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:22.536 align:middle line:84%
And it was the same
voice as in the dream.

00:09:22.536 --> 00:09:24.410 align:middle line:84%
It ended up being a
gentleman named Ken Hans.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.830 align:middle line:84%
He was a fire chief out
of the fire department

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:28.400 align:middle line:90%
that I did a holiday party for.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden I
checked all the messages,

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:30.590 align:middle line:90%
all these calls.

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.506 align:middle line:84%
We're getting calls from
all these newspapers.

00:09:32.506 --> 00:09:35.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I got the
Psychic Madman name.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And then I kept doing that
show as the Psychic Madman.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And then like getting back to
the other thing, when I hit 49,

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.640 align:middle line:90%
I had these pains, right?

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.348 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
having a heart problem?

00:09:43.348 --> 00:09:45.230 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: I go to the
doctor, and he said, you

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:48.869 align:middle line:84%
have cardiomyopathy
and an enlarged heart.

00:09:48.869 --> 00:09:50.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, well, an
enlarged heart, at least

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:51.340 align:middle line:90%
I have a big heart.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:51.770 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:52.270 align:middle line:90%
He goes, no.

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Secretariat did, too.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: So I go,
what's cardiomyopathy?

00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:59.240 align:middle line:84%
He goes, you have the
heartbeat of a 90-year-old man.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.406 align:middle line:90%
I go, well, that's not good.

00:10:00.406 --> 00:10:01.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my God.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: So I went home.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.712 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, I'll just like--

00:10:03.712 --> 00:10:05.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were
depressed, right?

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:06.086 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: A little bit.

00:10:06.086 --> 00:10:07.367 align:middle line:90%
I got four kids.

00:10:07.367 --> 00:10:08.575 align:middle line:90%
The guy goes, enjoy the ride.

00:10:08.575 --> 00:10:09.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it hereditary?

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:10.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: No.

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Anyone in
your family have that?

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:13.831 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: It was from eating
junk food like I did.

00:10:13.831 --> 00:10:15.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're
talking to a guy that

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.560 align:middle line:84%
used to eat 40 Yocco's
hot dogs a week.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how many
Philadelphia cheesesteaks

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:22.260 align:middle line:90%
from living close to Philly.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.470 align:middle line:84%
So I knocked all of
that out of the diet.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And what had happened
was I started

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.400 align:middle line:90%
doing this exercise bike.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.030 align:middle line:84%
So I would take these
cards like this on my bike.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.490 align:middle line:90%
This is a true story.

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And here, we'll mix
them up a little more.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.990 align:middle line:90%
Here, cut the deck.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:39.610 align:middle line:84%
This is really cool, very
important for this story.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:40.580 align:middle line:90%
Now watch.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.967 align:middle line:84%
Now as you look through the
cards, look at the colors.

00:10:42.967 --> 00:10:44.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hold them
right up here, Jim.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:45.383 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Right here?

00:10:45.383 --> 00:10:48.400 align:middle line:84%
Look at the colors as they go
by, like we've got red cards,

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.250 align:middle line:90%
black, all the different colors.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.370 align:middle line:84%
I was doing this
on my bike where

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:56.150 align:middle line:84%
I would try to memorize
these colors really fast as I

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:57.630 align:middle line:90%
went through them like that.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:58.590 align:middle line:90%
Like watch, I'm done.

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Believe it or not, I just
memorized all 52 colors.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.310 align:middle line:90%
We shuffled the cards.

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:01.851 align:middle line:90%
You cut them.

00:11:01.851 --> 00:11:03.240 align:middle line:90%
It this camera on?

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.267 align:middle line:90%
Is that a black card?

00:11:04.267 --> 00:11:04.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Now, you might
say, well, you looked at it.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:07.160 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah, I did.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.368 align:middle line:90%
Let's do something different.

00:11:08.368 --> 00:11:09.415 align:middle line:90%
The next card is red.

00:11:09.415 --> 00:11:10.980 align:middle line:90%
Next card is red.

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.397 align:middle line:90%
Next card is black.

00:11:12.397 --> 00:11:13.480 align:middle line:90%
Let's do something harder.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:18.830 align:middle line:84%
3 of spade, 10 of heart,
10 of club, jack, a heart.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Then I believe it's
an ace of spade.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:21.950 align:middle line:90%
A 2 of diamond, a 4 of club.

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:23.707 align:middle line:84%
You get the idea,
the king of diamonds.

00:11:23.707 --> 00:11:24.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:25.540 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: King of spade, right?

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:26.270 align:middle line:90%
King of diamond?

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:31.174 align:middle line:84%
Now, 2 of hearts, 9 of
diamond, jack and 7 of spades

00:11:31.174 --> 00:11:33.465 align:middle line:84%
and the queen of hearts, a
7 of diamond, an 8 of heart,

00:11:33.465 --> 00:11:34.756 align:middle line:90%
and now you know it's for real.

00:11:34.756 --> 00:11:36.131 align:middle line:84%
See, you never
knew on the radio.

00:11:36.131 --> 00:11:38.255 align:middle line:84%
Then a jack of club, a king
of heart, a 6 of queen,

00:11:38.255 --> 00:11:40.880 align:middle line:84%
and a spade, an 8 of club, an
ace of diamond, a 5 of heart.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:41.910 align:middle line:90%
You get the idea.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.700 align:middle line:84%
This is what I did
every day on the bike.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.970 align:middle line:84%
I would practice memorizing
these cards really fast.

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:46.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You trained yourself.

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: And I trained my brain.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Then I got to a point,
after doing this,

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.060 align:middle line:84%
that I wanted to
do other things.

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:56.882 align:middle line:84%
So I made up flash cards and
put countries and capitals.

00:11:56.882 --> 00:11:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And I would memorize
the countries,

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.715 align:middle line:84%
like Uruguay, Montevideo;
Paraguay, Asuncion, Azerbaijan,

00:12:00.715 --> 00:12:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Baku; Uzbekistan, Tashkent;
Qatar, Doha; Bolivia, La Paz.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:04.756 align:middle line:84%
I learned all the
countries and capitals

00:12:04.756 --> 00:12:06.190 align:middle line:90%
from these flash cards.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Then I put movies on
there, celebrities,

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.360 align:middle line:90%
and I started memorizing Oscars.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.226 align:middle line:84%
Then I got into
sports, all the Super

00:12:12.226 --> 00:12:13.475 align:middle line:90%
Bowls, all the Hall of Famers.

00:12:13.475 --> 00:12:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your brain
must be like that.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:16.565 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever had an MRI?

00:12:16.565 --> 00:12:17.880 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Yeah, I actually did.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.240 align:middle line:84%
I had it done down in Florida
at the Florida Hospital.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And my frontal lobe, parietal
lobe, the temporal lobes,

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:27.600 align:middle line:84%
and occipital lobes, the
cortex is four times thicker

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.997 align:middle line:84%
than average from doing
all this brain exercise.

00:12:29.997 --> 00:12:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You increased it.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.000 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Yeah, so this is real.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.220 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.450 align:middle line:84%
So I started off with magic,
and I got into the memory

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:41.820 align:middle line:84%
because of working this bike and
learning all this information.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.630 align:middle line:84%
I was nailing down 100
digits of pi a day, George.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:49.600 align:middle line:84%
You know pi,
3.14152653589793238462643383279.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.670 align:middle line:90%
You can copy this down.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.300 align:middle line:90%
I never miss a digit.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.197 align:middle line:90%
So I'm like, OK--

00:12:53.197 --> 00:12:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're like
a human computer.

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Yeah, like Google.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.680 align:middle line:84%
I start tapping into this
energy from doing this.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And it got to this-- I
call it a mental matrix.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.070 align:middle line:90%
Now, so the story continues.

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:05.180 align:middle line:90%
So now I'm 60.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm turning 60.

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:08.585 align:middle line:90%
My life insurance runs out.

00:13:08.585 --> 00:13:10.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh, darn.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:11.830 align:middle line:84%
So I went to renew
my life insurance,

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.022 align:middle line:90%
and they turned me down.

00:13:13.022 --> 00:13:13.980 align:middle line:90%
I go, what do you mean?

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:14.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Because of the prior.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.230 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Because of the
condition, the heart condition.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.830 align:middle line:84%
I said, I don't have that
heart condition anymore.

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:20.705 align:middle line:84%
What are you talking
about you don't have it?

00:13:20.705 --> 00:13:24.280 align:middle line:84%
I said, look, I want to go
in and get another echo.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.346 align:middle line:90%
All right, so I go in.

00:13:26.346 --> 00:13:27.220 align:middle line:90%
This is a true story.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.600 align:middle line:90%
I go in to get the echo.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.176 align:middle line:84%
It's the same guy that gave
me the echo 10 years before.

00:13:31.176 --> 00:13:31.800 align:middle line:90%
He looks at me.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.310 align:middle line:90%
He goes, what the heck?

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:35.490 align:middle line:84%
He goes, you look younger
than you did 10 years ago.

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:36.640 align:middle line:90%
What have you been doing?

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.473 align:middle line:84%
I told him the whole
story, riding the bike,

00:13:38.473 --> 00:13:40.490 align:middle line:84%
doing all this memory,
force-feeding my brain,

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:42.600 align:middle line:90%
tapping into this energy.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.821 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden the guy
looks at me, like-- I go,

00:13:44.821 --> 00:13:45.570 align:middle line:90%
what's the matter?

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:47.699 align:middle line:84%
He goes, I don't see
any cardiomyopathy.

00:13:47.699 --> 00:13:48.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's gone.

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:49.073 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Yeah.

00:13:49.073 --> 00:13:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, but what's
even more amazing, he goes,

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.920 align:middle line:84%
this is the first time
I've ever seen a reversal

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:53.980 align:middle line:90%
of an enlarged heart.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.915 align:middle line:84%
He goes, whatever you're
doing, keep doing it.

00:13:55.915 --> 00:13:57.170 align:middle line:90%
It's working.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:01.320 align:middle line:84%
So that really motivated me and
inspired me to go even further.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.640 align:middle line:84%
So then instead of just putting
an hour a day into this and 25,

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.504 align:middle line:84%
30 miles on the bike, I
took it to an extreme.

00:14:07.504 --> 00:14:09.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm down in my basement
lifting weights.

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this was
your career, too, right?

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:11.720 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Yeah, exactly.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.240 align:middle line:84%
So I would take
this memory stuff

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.520 align:middle line:90%
and incorporate it in my show.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And gradually it evolved
into this Psychic Madman

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.110 align:middle line:84%
and took it out to
a point now where

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:23.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm with all the top doctors.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And I go to hospitals
and talk about it.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.400 align:middle line:90%
Now studying the brain, George.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.650 align:middle line:84%
But like here, here's
is the one thing,

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:31.027 align:middle line:84%
like when you take
all the cards.

00:14:31.027 --> 00:14:33.610 align:middle line:84%
We'll show the camera over here,
because a lot of these things

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.580 align:middle line:84%
are so amazing
sometimes that people

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:38.071 align:middle line:84%
think it's got to be all
the same card or-- here.

00:14:38.071 --> 00:14:39.946 align:middle line:84%
Like if you were to take
one of the cards out

00:14:39.946 --> 00:14:44.970 align:middle line:84%
of the deck, anyone you
want-- and that's what's cool.

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:46.000 align:middle line:90%
You're taking any card.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000 align:middle line:90%
We're shuffling them up.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.472 align:middle line:90%
No two are alike.

00:14:48.472 --> 00:14:49.180 align:middle line:90%
Look at the card.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.160 align:middle line:90%
Show it to one of your cameras.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:52.720 align:middle line:90%
We got it?

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: (WHISPERING)
Don't tell him what it is.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Now put it anywhere
you want in the deck-- anywhere

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:58.170 align:middle line:90%
you want.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And once again,
mix them up, even.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, I'll just
do just like that.

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Now that's pretty
fair, you've got to admit.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:04.503 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:15:04.503 --> 00:15:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Now I'm gonna
show you a miracle.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.470 align:middle line:90%
Watch.

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:12.120 align:middle line:90%
That's my size 15 shoe.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're Big Foot.

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.129 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: [LAUGHING] That's good.

00:15:15.129 --> 00:15:16.670 align:middle line:84%
All right, now what
we're going to do

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:18.879 align:middle line:84%
is pick up your cards
right now, George.

00:15:18.879 --> 00:15:19.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The whole thing?

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Yeah.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:20.859 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:15:20.859 --> 00:15:23.260 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Now kind of like
flick them at the shoe,

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.347 align:middle line:84%
like throw the whole
deck and hit me right

00:15:25.347 --> 00:15:26.430 align:middle line:90%
in the bottom of the foot.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You want them to
just go all over the place?

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.128 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Yeah, yeah,
we'll clean them up later.

00:15:30.128 --> 00:15:31.259 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here we go, folks.

00:15:31.259 --> 00:15:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: OK, did you feel that?

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:32.980 align:middle line:90%
There, I got it.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:33.480 align:middle line:90%
Here it is.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.890 align:middle line:90%
I got it right there.

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.850 align:middle line:90%
Now watch-- nothing in my hands.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:38.875 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
what the card was,

00:15:38.875 --> 00:15:41.960 align:middle line:90%
but there is a card in there.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:42.669 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: May I?

00:15:42.669 --> 00:15:43.710 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: You pull it out.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.640 align:middle line:90%
It's a little warm.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.350 align:middle line:90%
Is that the card?

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:46.440 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.055 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's the card.

00:15:47.055 --> 00:15:47.830 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Are you serious?

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:48.996 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 5 of hearts, folks.

00:15:48.996 --> 00:15:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: But this is the kind of
stuff that I got into, George.

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, let me
ask you a question.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:58.260 align:middle line:84%
If I were to look at all these
cards, would I find another 5

00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:58.760 align:middle line:90%
of hearts?

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: If you would,
that would be amazing,

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:01.760 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
only 5 of hearts we go.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:02.750 align:middle line:84%
They're all
scattered down there.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:03.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We'll clean them.

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:04.360 align:middle line:84%
We'll get them later
after the show.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.695 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: But anyway,
that's basically--

00:16:05.695 --> 00:16:06.694 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:16:06.694 --> 00:16:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: That's basically
what it evolved into.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:10.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I can't believe
I touched the inside

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:11.200 align:middle line:90%
of your shoe, though.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:11.570 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: I know.

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:12.470 align:middle line:90%
Well, see, that's what happens.

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:13.845 align:middle line:84%
You're in the heat
of the moment.

00:16:13.845 --> 00:16:15.059 align:middle line:90%
I get you so-- pa!

00:16:15.059 --> 00:16:16.350 align:middle line:90%
That's what magic is all about.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:18.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That is
absolutely incredible.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Jim's also great at memory
with like zip codes.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.340 align:middle line:90%
Watch this.

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.304 align:middle line:90%
48125.

00:16:26.304 --> 00:16:28.470 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: That puts you
outside of Detroit, Michigan.

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:28.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:29.860 align:middle line:90%
That's my mother's zip code.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:30.526 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Really?

00:16:30.526 --> 00:16:31.940 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:33.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 91403.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:38.130 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: 91403.

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:41.190 align:middle line:90%
91403.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:42.697 align:middle line:90%
That's Sherman Oaks.

00:16:42.697 --> 00:16:43.530 align:middle line:90%
That's out that way.

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:45.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right, exactly.

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:46.615 align:middle line:90%
75219.

00:16:46.615 --> 00:16:48.860 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: 75219.

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:52.830 align:middle line:84%
That puts you down by
Dallas, Texas, yeah, yeah.

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:54.204 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 89117.

00:16:54.204 --> 00:16:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: 89117 is
Las Vegas, Nevada.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.005 align:middle line:84%
And when we did
this on the radio--

00:17:00.005 --> 00:17:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:04.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, I got to tell you, when
you did this on the radio,

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:08.890 align:middle line:84%
part of me said, Jim Karol's
sitting in front of a computer,

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:11.260 align:middle line:84%
and as I spit these
zip codes out,

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.670 align:middle line:90%
he enters them really fast.

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:14.740 align:middle line:90%
And it just comes up.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.125 align:middle line:90%
How would I know, right?

00:17:16.125 --> 00:17:17.250 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Yeah, that's true.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:19.079 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I had you
in the studio once.

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Yeah, that
was a lot of fun.

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:21.451 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
I said, well, there

00:17:21.451 --> 00:17:23.650 align:middle line:90%
may be something to this guy.

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:25.050 align:middle line:90%
Now that I'm seeing these--

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:26.841 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Well, zip
codes are another thing.

00:17:26.841 --> 00:17:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Zip codes to me,
numbers-- like I

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.120 align:middle line:84%
said, the most important
thing is, George,

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.179 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't do any of this
before the age of 49.

00:17:34.179 --> 00:17:35.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what's amazing.

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Yeah, when
I was in high school,

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.660 align:middle line:84%
I barely made it
out of high school.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.180 align:middle line:84%
I barely made it
out of high school.

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:42.590 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I flunked
chemistry, all right?

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:44.920 align:middle line:84%
Then I went to a
community college.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And I was a criminal
justice major.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't do
well there, either.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:53.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like I'm this
gifted guy with this brain.

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:56.304 align:middle line:84%
I trained my own brain at
the age of 49 to do all this.

00:17:56.304 --> 00:17:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can other
people do this?

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: I believe anyone can
do this if you have passion.

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:03.930 align:middle line:84%
You have to have the passion,
desire to want to do this.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:04.430 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:05.290 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's crazy.

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:10.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I go back and forth to
Walter Reed a lot right now,

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:12.555 align:middle line:84%
and I help a lot of our
veterans of wars with PTSD.

00:18:12.555 --> 00:18:13.471 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:18:13.471 --> 00:18:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: And I help
them with the memory

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:17.050 align:middle line:90%
and teach them magic.

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:18.950 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the one
gentleman-- I don't

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:20.860 align:middle line:84%
want to mention his
name or anything,

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:24.716 align:middle line:84%
but he's been really getting
really good at magic.

00:18:24.716 --> 00:18:25.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He loves it.

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:26.464 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: He loves it.

00:18:26.464 --> 00:18:28.190 align:middle line:90%
He definitely loves it.

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't be
surprised to see him

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.220 align:middle line:84%
on a national TV show pretty
soon doing this stuff.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:34.470 align:middle line:90%
So this is really inspiring.

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:36.690 align:middle line:90%
Magic is a great tool.

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:38.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you
have another trick,

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:41.560 align:middle line:90%
which is pretty darn dangerous.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:42.712 align:middle line:90%
It's a bear trap trick.

00:18:42.712 --> 00:18:43.295 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Yeah.

00:18:43.295 --> 00:18:45.500 align:middle line:90%
Should we really pull that out?

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.420 align:middle line:90%
Let's start with this one first.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.990 align:middle line:90%
Let's show them.

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:50.350 align:middle line:90%
Is the progression.

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:51.747 align:middle line:90%
See, I started with this.

00:18:51.747 --> 00:18:52.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ouch!

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Yeah, this is
only a fox trap, OK?

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.185 align:middle line:90%
You have to walk before you run.

00:18:56.185 --> 00:18:57.560 align:middle line:84%
You don't get into
the big stuff.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:58.900 align:middle line:90%
Like hold your finger like that.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:18:59.650 align:middle line:90%
Hold your finger--

00:18:59.650 --> 00:18:59.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No!

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: No, no-- yeah,
I'll take it right off.

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:02.380 align:middle line:90%
Just to feel the pressure.

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, you're
gonna take my finger off.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: No, no, I
would never hurt you.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:05.950 align:middle line:90%
You're a friend.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:07.500 align:middle line:84%
Just to feel the
pressure, watch.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And just verify that's
definitely real pressure.

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:10.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ow. ow, ow, ow.

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:11.570 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: So you know now.

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ow, ow!

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Because
on the radio, you

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:14.250 align:middle line:90%
would never know that's real.

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:14.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ow!

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:15.341 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Now watch.

00:19:15.341 --> 00:19:16.320 align:middle line:90%
It's a real trap.

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:16.960 align:middle line:90%
Now watch.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.690 align:middle line:84%
Now this one I
could set up here.

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:21.210 align:middle line:84%
OK, because this
is real little, OK?

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:24.290 align:middle line:84%
But there, this is how I
started, George, all right?

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And then I would take
objects like pencils.

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:28.630 align:middle line:90%
Here, here's a pencil here.

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:31.945 align:middle line:84%
See, and you go like this just
to show that the trap is real.

00:19:31.945 --> 00:19:32.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jesus.

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:33.819 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: It's definitely real.

00:19:33.819 --> 00:19:36.500 align:middle line:84%
The power on these things.
[SUCKING IN] OK, wow.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:37.800 align:middle line:90%
Now OK, George, are you ready?

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.180 align:middle line:84%
That's why they call
me the Psychic Madman.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That could
have hit me in the eye.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: I would stick my
fingers in here show after show

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.320 align:middle line:90%
after show, but you know what?

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.070 align:middle line:90%
It got boring.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:49.380 align:middle line:90%
Then moved on to this.

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:50.999 align:middle line:90%
This is not a little fox trap.

00:19:50.999 --> 00:19:52.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What the heck is this?

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: This is an Alaskan
wolf trap or a small bear trap.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you want to walk
around, we could do this.

00:19:57.970 --> 00:19:59.240 align:middle line:90%
Watch.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.390 align:middle line:84%
We'll set the trap
right here on the floor,

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:04.450 align:middle line:84%
because I can't just
open this like this.

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:05.700 align:middle line:90%
Like try to open that, George.

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.019 align:middle line:90%
Try to open that blade.

00:20:07.019 --> 00:20:08.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's hard.

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:09.490 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: That takes
lots of pressure.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:11.720 align:middle line:84%
So what I usually do is-- here,
we'll put it right down here

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.070 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:12.950 align:middle line:90%
And you can help me.

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Just step on the two
ends of the trap.

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:16.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I weight 182.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.505 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: OK, now
push down real hard.

00:20:18.505 --> 00:20:21.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm gonna open--
[GRUNTS] OK, now get off.

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:21.790 align:middle line:90%
I go it.

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:22.120 align:middle line:90%
I got it.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:22.380 align:middle line:90%
Get off.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:23.088 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Get off?

00:20:23.088 --> 00:20:24.200 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Yeah, I got it.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.470 align:middle line:84%
See, it takes a lot of
pressure to set this.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:30.064 align:middle line:90%
If I go like this-- here, stop.

00:20:30.064 --> 00:20:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Now look, we're gonna bring
it up here on the table.

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:33.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Be careful.

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:34.190 align:middle line:90%
That's like a mousetrap.

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Yeah, this
is a big mousetrap.

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:39.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is the ultimate
in what I do, all right?

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know if the
camera angle can catch this,

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:43.190 align:middle line:90%
but we now have the trap set.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:44.260 align:middle line:90%
Let me take my ring off.

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
you going to do?

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:47.926 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: I'm gonna stick
my hand in that trap.

00:20:47.926 --> 00:20:49.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, come on, Jim.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:51.470 align:middle line:84%
I want to ask you
a question first.

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:56.380 align:middle line:84%
If for some horrible reason
you're stuck in this,

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.980 align:middle line:84%
is there anything I
can do to help you?

00:20:58.980 --> 00:20:59.990 align:middle line:90%
I can't open it.

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Well, you're gonna have
to help me get out of it again.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.220 align:middle line:84%
We're gonna have to walk
around when I do just

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:04.870 align:middle line:90%
by stepping on the ends again.

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:05.890 align:middle line:90%
That's if I succeed.

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I'm gonna do,
I'm gonna try something.

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Since this is your show
and you're a special guy--

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Soon to be given
to you, because I don't

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:14.890 align:middle line:90%
know if I want to see this.

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Now look, most
of the time I do this,

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:20.680 align:middle line:84%
I let it catch me up here
on the meat of the hand.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.069 align:middle line:84%
I'm gonna let it catch
me on my fingers.

00:21:23.069 --> 00:21:24.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It will take them off.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.320 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: No, I
don't think it will.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:25.630 align:middle line:90%
Watch.

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:26.296 align:middle line:90%
We're gonna try.

00:21:26.296 --> 00:21:27.839 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't think it will.

00:21:27.839 --> 00:21:28.630 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Now watch.

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:30.880 align:middle line:84%
I could put this cup in there,
and it will shatter the cup.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let me move this cup.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:32.488 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Yeah, OK, now watch.

00:21:32.488 --> 00:21:35.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, they're real fingers,
right, George, nothing fake?

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're real
fingers, no bananas.

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.450 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: In fact, here--
give me your hand.

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:37.949 align:middle line:90%
Watch.

00:21:37.949 --> 00:21:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, no, no, no.

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:42.143 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: All right, just in
case, now watch. here we go.

00:21:42.143 --> 00:21:42.670 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:43.900 align:middle line:90%
What's your lucky number?

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:44.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Four.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: On four, here we go.

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:53.267 align:middle line:84%
One, two, three-- and I'm gonna
let it catch me on the fingers,

00:21:53.267 --> 00:21:55.100 align:middle line:84%
George, not up here on
the meat of the hand.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
gonna snap on you?

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:57.271 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: It's gonna snap.

00:21:57.271 --> 00:21:58.190 align:middle line:90%
Could I stand up?

00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:59.694 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So I shouldn't freak.

00:21:59.694 --> 00:22:00.610 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: I don't know.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:02.599 align:middle line:84%
Let's come a little
closer to you here.

00:22:02.599 --> 00:22:03.390 align:middle line:90%
We'll go like this.

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:05.299 align:middle line:84%
The pencil went like
that, so that's where

00:22:05.299 --> 00:22:06.590 align:middle line:90%
the fingers would go if I miss.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:07.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, good.

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: All right now,
George, what I want you to do

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:11.549 align:middle line:84%
is put your hand here as a
background, as a backdrop.

00:22:11.549 --> 00:22:12.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: OK, and when I do
this, if I miss and you feel

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:16.920 align:middle line:90%
something-- OK, here we go.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:17.600 align:middle line:90%
Now watch.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.360 align:middle line:90%
Look at his eyes.

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.110 align:middle line:84%
Zoom in on those--
that's amazing.

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:20.717 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:22:20.717 --> 00:22:21.800 align:middle line:90%
Your lucky number is four.

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:22.100 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:22.849 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, sir.

00:22:22.849 --> 00:22:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: One, two,
three-- [SNAP]

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.825 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah.

00:22:29.825 --> 00:22:31.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Now look,
as you notice,

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.390 align:middle line:84%
it catches you right
on the fingers, too.

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:33.680 align:middle line:90%
Now try to open those blades.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:34.890 align:middle line:90%
Pull those blades open.

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:35.940 align:middle line:90%
Are they on there tight?

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:36.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: This is the real--
the only way you would--

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:38.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you in pain?

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:40.210 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: No, there's
no pain at all.

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:42.270 align:middle line:84%
I block the pain off
completely, George.

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:44.120 align:middle line:84%
This is what your
mind is capable of.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we
get you out of this?

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:45.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Well, you're
gonna walk around here

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:48.360 align:middle line:84%
because you gotta step on the
ends just like we did before.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.240 align:middle line:90%
Now, step on the ends.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've got to
release this for you.

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:53.060 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Step on it like that.

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And we'll notice--
just pull it like that.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:55.440 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Pain is all in
your mind, George.

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.948 align:middle line:90%

love to be baffled.

They love to be mystified.

And most people
don't want to know

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:41.770 align:middle line:84%
how it's done, because
in magic, everything's

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:46.780 align:middle line:84%
an illusion, where in mentalism,
there's that hidden realm of,

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:47.950 align:middle line:90%
is it real?

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:49.037 align:middle line:90%
Is not a trick?

00:23:49.037 --> 00:23:50.120 align:middle line:90%
See, and that's what I do.

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm crossing over that
line now by getting

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.360 align:middle line:84%
is he would give up
his fee if he could not

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.940 align:middle line:90%
find out who was holding it.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And what he would
do is wander around

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:37.400 align:middle line:84%
the entire stage of
audience and guess

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:41.430 align:middle line:84%
what person had that envelope
with his money in it.

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And if he was wrong, he let
the proprietors keep the money,

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:48.530 align:middle line:90%
keep the check.

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:50.710 align:middle line:84%
He got it right
most of the time.

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:51.750 align:middle line:90%
Was that mentalism?

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:53.370 align:middle line:90%
Or was there a trick here?

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Kreskin was probably,
my gosh, one of the best

00:24:56.770 --> 00:25:00.950 align:middle line:84%
if not the best
mentalist of my life.

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:02.910 align:middle line:90%
I've seen him numerous times.

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:04.080 align:middle line:90%
And he's still performing.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:04.621 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:25:04.621 --> 00:25:07.607 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there wasn't another
guy there, he had an earpiece?

00:25:07.607 --> 00:25:08.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: No, no, no.

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I just walked to row
number four, go to the left.

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:13.630 align:middle line:84%
There's a guy named
Jim Karol there.

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:15.410 align:middle line:84%
You see with the
sunglasses on his head?

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:17.680 align:middle line:84%
He's the one who's
got your money.

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.780 align:middle line:90%
They don't do that?

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:20.959 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: I'm sure
maybe somebody might.

00:25:20.959 --> 00:25:22.250 align:middle line:90%
Magicians could possibly do it.

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:24.630 align:middle line:84%
But Kreskin never--
Kreskin was the best.

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:25.470 align:middle line:90%
He was the best.

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And are a lot of
great mentalists today

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:30.580 align:middle line:84%
that from time to time I don't
even know what they're doing.

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And I take a lot of pride in
knowing how everything is done.

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:35.490 align:middle line:84%
You can't show me trick
that I've never seen.

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:37.420 align:middle line:90%
Nothing's new, all right?

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.400 align:middle line:84%
But there are some guys
that are really good,

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.566 align:middle line:90%
and Kreskin was one of them.

00:25:40.566 --> 00:25:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, how do
you read 500 people

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.302 align:middle line:84%
to know that that guy
has got your money?

00:25:45.302 --> 00:25:47.010 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: It's amazing
you're saying that,

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:51.170 align:middle line:84%
because that's basically
what I got into now.

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Some people call it emotional
intelligence, the ability

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:58.740 align:middle line:84%
to read nonverbal clues
that people throw off.

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And you can use it for
therapeutic reasons

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:03.254 align:middle line:84%
as well, like helping
to read stress on people

00:26:03.254 --> 00:26:05.170 align:middle line:84%
and how to handle it and
everything like that.

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:10.580 align:middle line:84%
I take it to the entertainment
aspect by reading people.

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm assuming maybe
that's what Kreskin did.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.500 align:middle line:84%
He walked around
and he read people,

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.220 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, different actions.

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:18.310 align:middle line:84%
We can show you some
experiments with that.

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if
you're on a date, you

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.510 align:middle line:84%
could read your
date's face to see

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:24.030 align:middle line:90%
how things are going, right?

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Believe it or not,
you could, just by the way

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.810 align:middle line:84%
they sit, like if
you cross your legs,

00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:30.390 align:middle line:90%
if you're facing towards you.

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:31.440 align:middle line:90%
I like to read the eyes.

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.380 align:middle line:90%
That's why I wear these glasses.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.540 align:middle line:84%
People say, what do you have
these sunglasses everywhere

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:35.170 align:middle line:90%
you go?

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:36.900 align:middle line:90%
They're prescription, George.

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:40.240 align:middle line:84%
These are very powerful
prescription sunglasses.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Like right now, I
can see your pupils.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Am I trying to look
at you or you're looking at me?

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:45.380 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: I'm looking right
into your pupils right now.

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:46.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what do you see?

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:47.400 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Well, here's the deal.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.139 align:middle line:84%
Like say we were
playing poker right now.

00:26:49.139 --> 00:26:49.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Is that why these
guys wear glasses?

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:55.135 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: The guys wear glasses,
in my opinion, most of them

00:26:55.135 --> 00:26:57.190 align:middle line:84%
wear them to protect
you from doing what I'm

00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:59.110 align:middle line:90%
about to show you right now.

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:02.411 align:middle line:84%
In other words, like say I
dealt you two cards right now

00:27:02.411 --> 00:27:02.910 align:middle line:90%
in poker.

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's do it.

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:04.504 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Let's do it.

00:27:04.504 --> 00:27:06.530 align:middle line:90%
OK, here, watch.

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:09.290 align:middle line:84%
I won't need the cards
for this specific thing.

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:09.890 align:middle line:90%
Now watch.

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:12.380 align:middle line:84%
Once again, we'll mix up
the cards a little bit.

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:14.140 align:middle line:84%
You don't like
shuffling, but cut them.

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:16.966 align:middle line:90%


00:27:16.966 --> 00:27:18.090 align:middle line:90%
Which camera should I show?

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:19.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right there.

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: And the cards are
shuffled up, all right?

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, George, you're going to
pick a card out of the deck.

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:30.540 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is say no
whenever I ask you a question.

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:32.290 align:middle line:84%
Because first I'm going
to start by trying

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:34.660 align:middle line:90%
to read a verbal clue from you.

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll get
into the nonverbal.

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Like take one of the
cards, anyone you want.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:39.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just one, OK.

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:41.120 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: And look at it.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, no matter what I ask
you, say no, all right?

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And once again, we'll
show no two are alike.

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:47.705 align:middle line:90%
It's not a trick deck.

00:27:47.705 --> 00:27:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, even
if I'm lying say no?

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Always say
no to everything

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask you
from this point one.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.070 align:middle line:84%
You know what the
card is, right?

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Good, see?

00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:57.330 align:middle line:90%
See that?

00:27:57.330 --> 00:28:00.534 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you look at the face,
your face, your eyes crinkle,

00:28:00.534 --> 00:28:01.200 align:middle line:90%
your difference.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:01.700 align:middle line:90%
Now watch.

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:02.480 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.900 align:middle line:84%
George, is your
name George Noory?

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: See, now I got
the read of what you

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:10.160 align:middle line:90%
look like when you tell a lie.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, I would say
right now, George, it

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:18.150 align:middle line:84%
is impossible for me to
not do this correctly.

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:18.760 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.705 align:middle line:84%
If I had Kreskin's paycheck
right now, and I would mess up,

00:28:21.705 --> 00:28:22.910 align:middle line:90%
I would give it to you.

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:23.410 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:24.535 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're gonna do.

00:28:24.535 --> 00:28:26.380 align:middle line:90%
Is that card a club?

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.704 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:28:28.704 --> 00:28:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Is that card
a diamond, George?

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:32.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:34.751 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Is that card a heart?

00:28:34.751 --> 00:28:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:36.240 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Now you see?

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Did you feel yourself
go-- you like--

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:38.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I paused for a minute.

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:39.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Yeah, yeah.

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.381 align:middle line:90%
So it's definitely-- OK.

00:28:40.381 --> 00:28:41.130 align:middle line:90%
So we definitely--

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because I
wanted to say yes.

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:42.773 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Yeah.

00:28:42.773 --> 00:28:48.370 align:middle line:84%
So now, OK, so it's
a heart, right?

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:49.440 align:middle line:90%
OK, so I was right.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.036 align:middle line:90%
Now watch.

00:28:50.036 --> 00:28:51.160 align:middle line:90%
Here, take a different one.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.030 align:middle line:90%
We'll go one step further.

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that neat the way
you caught yourself even?

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.865 align:middle line:84%
Any one, and now
look at it again.

00:28:55.865 --> 00:28:57.240 align:middle line:84%
Don't show it to
the cameras yet.

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.250 align:middle line:90%
Just remember that card.

00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:00.620 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Is this card a club?

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:01.692 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:29:01.692 --> 00:29:02.650 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Is it a heart?

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:03.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:04.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: You rushed
this time, and you

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:07.066 align:middle line:84%
tilted your head to the side,
so I would say it's a heart.

00:29:07.066 --> 00:29:10.440 align:middle line:90%
But let's go further than that.

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.779 align:middle line:90%
Is it a numbered card?

00:29:12.779 --> 00:29:13.570 align:middle line:90%
You have to say no.

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:15.680 align:middle line:84%
Just by the confusion
means it's a number.

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:16.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I'm confused.

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:17.430 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by numbered?

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Number,
like 2 or is it a--?

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:19.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:20.340 align:middle line:90%
Is it a 2?

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:20.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:21.350 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: 3?

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:22.460 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: 4?

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:23.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:24.260 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: 5?

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:28.434 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Now, just by
the way you went, no,

00:29:28.434 --> 00:29:30.600 align:middle line:84%
and then you started blinking,
I would say you lied.

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.760 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, I would
say that's a 5 of heart.

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:33.885 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a 5 of heart.

00:29:33.885 --> 00:29:34.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Yeah.

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's do one more, Jim.

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:35.330 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: All right.

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:36.600 align:middle line:90%
I knew you'd love this one.

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's cause
I'm learning this.

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: It's all reading
the eyes and the faces

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.370 align:middle line:90%
and reading the verbal clues.

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm trying
to be a good liar.

00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Now look at it.

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:44.043 align:middle line:90%
Lie your best.

00:29:44.043 --> 00:29:45.250 align:middle line:90%
Try your best to lie.

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:48.440 align:middle line:84%
No matter what I
ask, you say no.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.330 align:middle line:90%
Is that a club?

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:50.452 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:29:50.452 --> 00:29:51.660 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Is it a heart?

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:53.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.290 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Is it a spade?

00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:54.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:57.189 align:middle line:90%


00:29:57.189 --> 00:29:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Did you
hear your voice like

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:00.427 align:middle line:84%
go-- like a little
crack in your voice?

00:30:00.427 --> 00:30:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I was going
to change it as I went.

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: All right, so
I know it's a spade,

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:05.700 align:middle line:84%
but this time really
try to fight this.

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:06.930 align:middle line:90%
Is it a 10?

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:08.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:09.840 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Is it jack?

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.760 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Is it higher?

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:14.070 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: It's higher.

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:15.930 align:middle line:84%
That means it's either a
king, a queen, or an ace.

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:16.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm gonna get this.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.670 align:middle line:90%
Is it an ace?

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:19.724 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHING] No.

00:30:19.724 --> 00:30:20.640 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Is it a king?

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:23.130 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Now, a king, you
have a lot of movement

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:24.240 align:middle line:84%
and you relaxed
because you thought

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.440 align:middle line:90%
I missed the ace previously.

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.420 align:middle line:84%
So I'd say it's
an ace of spades.

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ace of spades.

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:29.560 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: This is it.

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm taking
you to Vegas.

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:32.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm gonna bankroll you.

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:33.770 align:middle line:90%
And we're gonna win millions.

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: I'll tell you what.

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:35.210 align:middle line:90%
This is so much fun.

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:36.620 align:middle line:90%
I have such a blast with this.

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:36.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One more.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:37.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: One more?

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.080 align:middle line:90%
All right, here.

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:38.540 align:middle line:90%
Take one.

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't want to take
up the whole show on this,

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.210 align:middle line:90%
because you've got more to do.

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:42.810 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Yeah, but
this is so cool.

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:44.290 align:middle line:90%
It's really a challenge.

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:45.690 align:middle line:90%
And look, you can see.

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:46.940 align:middle line:90%
I'll spread the cards out.

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:47.898 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You know what?

00:30:47.898 --> 00:30:49.650 align:middle line:84%
What if I don't
look at the card?

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Oh.

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:52.456 align:middle line:90%
Now you might have me.

00:30:52.456 --> 00:30:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's do it again.

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:55.300 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Oh, but then how am I
going to know if you're lying

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:55.540 align:middle line:90%
or not?

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:56.416 align:middle line:90%
You have to know it.

00:30:56.416 --> 00:30:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's do it again.

00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:00.449 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Oh, now you're going
into the supernatural realm

00:31:00.449 --> 00:31:00.990 align:middle line:90%
of mentalism.

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now I want to get you.

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:03.475 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: All right,
let's try it.

00:31:03.475 --> 00:31:04.660 align:middle line:90%
Take one, any one you want.

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.620 align:middle line:84%
So now, therefore, you won't
be able to lie this time,

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:08.380 align:middle line:90%
all right?

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:09.630 align:middle line:90%
So I can't say, is it a club?

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:10.130 align:middle line:90%
Is it--?

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:11.930 align:middle line:90%
So I'll ask you like this.

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:14.780 align:middle line:84%
If you were to guess
right now, would you

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:18.000 align:middle line:90%
say that card is red or black?

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened to no?

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Because you don't know
what it is, so I can't ask.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.530 align:middle line:90%
You what would you guess?

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:23.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You want me to guess?

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Yeah.

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:24.750 align:middle line:84%
Without looking at
the card, would you

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:25.790 align:middle line:90%
say it's red or black?

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:26.873 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'd say it's red.

00:31:26.873 --> 00:31:27.692 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: OK.

00:31:27.692 --> 00:31:29.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm just trying to show the
impossibility of what I'm

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:31.066 align:middle line:90%
doing, because it's not red.

00:31:31.066 --> 00:31:32.487 align:middle line:90%
It's black.

00:31:32.487 --> 00:31:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
telling me it's black.

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.960 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Oh, without a doubt.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:35.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm telling
you it's red.

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Even guessing the color
is hard, is what I'm saying.

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.635 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're trying to
trick me to look at it,

00:31:38.635 --> 00:31:39.610 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not going to.

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: [LAUGHS] All right.

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.790 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm saying it's black.

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, would you say
it's a club or a spade?

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I still think it's red.

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:53.400 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: No, I say it's-- ace.

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.140 align:middle line:90%
Put your hand on the card.

00:31:55.140 --> 00:32:00.787 align:middle line:84%
Ace, king-- was the camera on
George when I just did this?

00:32:00.787 --> 00:32:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of course
the camera's on me.

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:03.950 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: You blinked on king.

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't even
know what the card is.

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.323 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: I doesn't matter.

00:32:06.323 --> 00:32:08.161 align:middle line:90%
This just like unconscious.

00:32:08.161 --> 00:32:09.660 align:middle line:84%
I would say it's
the king of spades.

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.618 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're saying
it's the king of spades?

00:32:11.618 --> 00:32:13.160 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: I guarantee it is.

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:15.805 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's the
king of spades.

00:32:15.805 --> 00:32:16.519 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Yes.

00:32:16.519 --> 00:32:18.310 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
emotional intelligence is.

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:19.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You tricked me.

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:20.590 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: That's my version of--

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You put this
in my hand somehow.

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:22.550 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: No!

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Here, look, we don't want to
waste a lot of time on this,

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:25.860 align:middle line:90%
but one more time, look.

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:28.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying, here, George,
take a card like that.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.164 align:middle line:90%
Take a card, any card.

00:32:30.164 --> 00:32:31.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I didn't
even look at the card.

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:32.954 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: It doesn't matter.

00:32:32.954 --> 00:32:34.760 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if
you want to look at it

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.680 align:middle line:90%
or you don't want to look at it.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't
want to look at it.

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:37.411 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: All right.

00:32:37.411 --> 00:32:40.260 align:middle line:90%


00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:43.040 align:middle line:90%
Put your hand like that.

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, I wish the camera was
zoomed in on your eyes.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:53.020 align:middle line:84%
Watch-- club, heart,
diamond, spade.

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:54.025 align:middle line:90%
All right, now watch.

00:32:54.025 --> 00:32:55.140 align:middle line:90%
Look at me.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:58.350 align:middle line:90%
2, 3, 4.

00:32:58.350 --> 00:32:59.882 align:middle line:90%
Now see on 4 you went like that.

00:32:59.882 --> 00:33:01.840 align:middle line:84%
You're knowing the card
without me telling you.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:02.714 align:middle line:90%
It's a four of heart.

00:33:02.714 --> 00:33:03.550 align:middle line:90%
Check it out.

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:04.390 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Did you feel yourself
go like that?

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.820 align:middle line:84%
You went-- did you
feel your eyes go?

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.170 align:middle line:90%
If not, look at the tape later.

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:10.450 align:middle line:90%
Your eyes actually went up.

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:11.575 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, I know that.

00:33:11.575 --> 00:33:13.575 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: But let's get
into something different.

00:33:13.575 --> 00:33:14.650 align:middle line:90%
All right, what else?

00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:16.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez, that's amazing.

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:16.770 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: This is like nothing.

00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:17.350 align:middle line:90%
This is like kiddie stuff.

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:18.849 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
magic or mentalism?

00:33:18.849 --> 00:33:21.610 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: This takes mentalism
to a different level, all right?

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
little magic in there?

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:23.529 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:33:23.529 --> 00:33:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: No, in
that there isn't.

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:28.900 align:middle line:84%
This is mentalism and the
new thing that I'm doing.

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:29.970 align:middle line:90%
It's really--

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:31.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well done.

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:32.740 align:middle line:90%
Jim, I gotta tell you.

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:37.734 align:middle line:84%
You should be on "The
Tonight Show" every month.

00:33:37.734 --> 00:33:38.900 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: I'm gonna try that.

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:39.780 align:middle line:90%
Hey, watch this.

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:41.150 align:middle line:90%
Take it to a step further.

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:44.250 align:middle line:84%
We use another object
they use in casinos.

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:44.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dice.

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:45.980 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: They use cards.

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:47.420 align:middle line:84%
That's good for
poker, blackjack.

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you tell me
that you're going to teach me

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:49.920 align:middle line:90%
how to roll sevens?

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:50.940 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: We'll do
something different.

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:52.606 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
roll the dice, George.

00:33:52.606 --> 00:33:55.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm gonna turn my head like
this and look over here.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.770 align:middle line:84%
You place the die on your
table in front of you,

00:33:58.770 --> 00:33:59.619 align:middle line:90%
any number you want.

00:33:59.619 --> 00:34:01.910 align:middle line:84%
Remember the number, face
up, and cover it with the cup

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:02.910 align:middle line:90%
so I can't see it.

00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:04.610 align:middle line:90%
Let me know when it's covered.

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And these young ladies here
will know I have my eyes closed.

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:08.630 align:middle line:90%
Is it covered?

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:10.079 align:middle line:90%
Let me know if it's covered.

00:34:10.079 --> 00:34:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yup.

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:16.429 align:middle line:90%


00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:18.870 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Is it a 6?

00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:19.379 align:middle line:90%
Say no.

00:34:19.379 --> 00:34:19.739 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:19.999 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: A 5?

00:34:19.999 --> 00:34:20.739 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:21.280 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: A 4?

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:21.889 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Nice.

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:23.790 align:middle line:84%
Do you hear the
difference in the tone?

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:24.350 align:middle line:90%
4.

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:24.960 align:middle line:90%
Did you hear that?

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:25.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It sounded
the same to me.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: No, you
went, no, no, no.

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:28.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm gonna lunge at you.

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: It's a
4, guaranteed-- 4.

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:30.776 align:middle line:90%
So now do it one more time.

00:34:30.776 --> 00:34:31.900 align:middle line:90%
Now he's getting mad at me.

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:32.470 align:middle line:90%
Flip the tin.

00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:33.210 align:middle line:90%
I'll hide.

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:34.084 align:middle line:90%
Flip any number-- go.

00:34:34.084 --> 00:34:37.022 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'll get
my boys in Chicago.

00:34:37.022 --> 00:34:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Let me know when
it's covered, George.

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:40.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Covered.

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Is a 1?

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:43.419 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:34:43.419 --> 00:34:44.210 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Is it a 2?

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:44.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:45.210 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: 3?

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:45.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:46.210 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: 4?

00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:46.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:47.210 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: 5?

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:47.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:48.210 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: 6?

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:49.627 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:34:49.627 --> 00:34:50.126 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: 6?

00:34:50.126 --> 00:34:50.584 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:34:50.584 --> 00:34:51.083 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: 5?

00:34:51.083 --> 00:34:51.958 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:34:51.958 --> 00:34:53.692 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: 5.

00:34:53.692 --> 00:34:54.192 align:middle line:90%
5.

00:34:54.192 --> 00:34:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now how
did you know that?

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:56.776 align:middle line:90%
I didn't change my voice.

00:34:56.776 --> 00:34:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: It doesn't matter.

00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:58.650 align:middle line:90%
This is what I do.

00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:01.372 align:middle line:84%
I'm reading your clues,
nonverbal and verbal.

00:35:01.372 --> 00:35:02.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let me try it.

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:02.600 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: All right, go ahead.

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:03.310 align:middle line:90%
Do it again.

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:03.960 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you wanna try it?

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:04.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You said you were.

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:05.900 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Turn around.

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.649 align:middle line:90%
Go.

00:35:08.649 --> 00:35:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it a 1?

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:09.910 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: No.

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:10.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 2?

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:10.789 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: No.

00:35:10.789 --> 00:35:11.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 3?

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:11.640 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: No.

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 4?

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:12.580 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: No.

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 5?

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: No.

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:13.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 6?

00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.460 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: No.

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 1?

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:15.430 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: No.

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:16.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 2?

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:16.740 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: No.

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:17.525 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a 2.

00:35:17.525 --> 00:35:17.810 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Right.

00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:18.310 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:19.019 align:middle line:90%
You got it, man!

00:35:19.019 --> 00:35:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: See?

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:20.726 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Isn't that amazing?

00:35:20.726 --> 00:35:22.340 align:middle line:84%
This is what we do,
I'm telling you.

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:24.260 align:middle line:84%
You just hang out with me,
you're gonna learn this stuff.

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:25.210 align:middle line:90%
When you go to your--

00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did I guess it, or
did you plant a 2 in there?

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:27.585 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: I don't know.

00:35:27.585 --> 00:35:28.574 align:middle line:90%
You tell me. [LAUGHING]

00:35:28.574 --> 00:35:29.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm not sure.

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: This is cool,
George, isn't it?

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:34.430 align:middle line:84%
Now how would I possibly be
able to control your mind

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:35.600 align:middle line:90%
to know it's a 2?

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:36.959 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You probably couldn't.

00:35:36.959 --> 00:35:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: See?

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:37.810 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm very free-willed.

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Isn't this
cool stuff, though?

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:40.793 align:middle line:90%
This is really cool.

00:35:40.793 --> 00:35:42.412 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
call this emotional--

00:35:42.412 --> 00:35:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: I take it-- this is
beyond emotional intelligence,

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:45.911 align:middle line:90%
what I'm showing you now.

00:35:45.911 --> 00:35:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Emotional intelligence
is more of a cycle.

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:51.820 align:middle line:84%
It's more of a psychology to
help people and everything else

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:53.580 align:middle line:84%
to handle stress
and everything else.

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:54.660 align:middle line:90%
This is beyond that.

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:57.400 align:middle line:84%
I use emotional
intelligence as a tool

00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:58.922 align:middle line:84%
to get to where
I'm at right now.

00:35:58.922 --> 00:36:00.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
you tapping into?

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Are you tapping into this
cosmic force that's out there?

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:04.397 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:36:04.397 --> 00:36:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: A lot of stuff
I'm doing is gut feelings.

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of people say,
yeah, he's just a magician.

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:11.600 align:middle line:90%
He's pulling a trick on George.

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:12.995 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:36:12.995 --> 00:36:13.865 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:36:13.865 --> 00:36:17.740 align:middle line:84%
How could it be a magic
trick to know 80,000 zip

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:22.350 align:middle line:90%
codes or 70,000 digits of pi?

00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:24.630 align:middle line:84%
Some of the stuff
started off as magic,

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:27.857 align:middle line:84%
but now it's evolved
into this weird thing.

00:36:27.857 --> 00:36:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And let me tell you
something, George,

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.797 align:middle line:84%
when I get down in my
basement and I lift weights,

00:36:31.797 --> 00:36:33.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm lifting weights
right now like a maniac,

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:35.100 align:middle line:90%
like I'm 25 again.

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm going down there-- I started
bending the spikes again,

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:40.660 align:middle line:84%
like remember Mighty Atom I
used to-- I'm bending them now.

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:41.550 align:middle line:90%
This is crazy.

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:42.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm 62 years old.

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:43.536 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All with mentalism.

00:36:43.536 --> 00:36:44.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Yes.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:49.450 align:middle line:84%
It's all with this realm that
I got into of the brain, OK?

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:51.680 align:middle line:84%
Like now I'm studying the
brain, like the amygdala,

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:53.020 align:middle line:84%
the hippocampus,
and all this stuff.

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:54.978 align:middle line:84%
I know all your lobes
and all this other stuff.

00:36:54.978 --> 00:36:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to obtain as
much knowledge as possible

00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:00.710 align:middle line:84%
to try to figure
out what I'm doing.

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:02.584 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, how much
of this is the brain?

00:37:02.584 --> 00:37:05.627 align:middle line:84%
How much of this is tapping
into something that's out there?

00:37:05.627 --> 00:37:06.710 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Here's my theory.

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:08.970 align:middle line:90%
This is just my theory, OK?

00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:10.570 align:middle line:90%
Think about this a second.

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:12.510 align:middle line:90%
We have the universe.

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:15.850 align:middle line:84%
We have billions and billions
and billions of stars.

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:17.030 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:20.750 align:middle line:84%
In our brains are billions
and billions and billions

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:21.640 align:middle line:90%
of neurons.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.300 align:middle line:90%
To me, it's the same.

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:26.300 align:middle line:84%
Our neurons are like
the stars in our brain.

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:28.500 align:middle line:84%
You have dark holes
in the universe.

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:32.480 align:middle line:84%
In our brain we have dark holes,
like we have this substantia

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:34.730 align:middle line:84%
nigra region in
your basal ganglia,

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:37.570 align:middle line:84%
and that's where
Parkinson's disease forms.

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:39.780 align:middle line:84%
I think they're a
tool of the same,

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:42.845 align:middle line:84%
and we're just beginning to
learn about both of them,

00:37:42.845 --> 00:37:43.440 align:middle line:90%
all right?

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'm into this
brain so big right now,

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:48.880 align:middle line:84%
and that's where I'm taking
all these memory abilities.

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.780 align:middle line:84%
This is the serious
part of Jim Karol now.

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:52.320 align:middle line:90%
It's not the magical part.

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm really studying this.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's really amazing.

00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And I use these experiments
and demonstrations

00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:00.260 align:middle line:84%
to catch the attention
and create awareness,

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:02.450 align:middle line:84%
get the people interested
in studying the brain

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:04.040 align:middle line:84%
and improving
their brain health.

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we all have
this ability that you have?

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:08.090 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Everybody.

00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:09.870 align:middle line:90%
Let me tell you a story.

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:14.130 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest components
of high emotional intelligence

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:16.650 align:middle line:90%
is self-esteem and confidence.

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Without that, you're never
going to obtain this.

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.460 align:middle line:84%
When I was young and when
I went to high school,

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:24.041 align:middle line:84%
I was bullied and picked on
and beat up all the time.

00:38:24.041 --> 00:38:25.040 align:middle line:90%
And look, I'm a big guy.

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.245 align:middle line:90%
So I was a target.

00:38:26.245 --> 00:38:28.120 align:middle line:84%
All these guys wanted
to pick on the big guy,

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.070 align:middle line:84%
because it makes you
look tougher, right?

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:32.040 align:middle line:84%
This continued all the
way through high school

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.540 align:middle line:90%
and everything else, all right?

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:36.127 align:middle line:84%
And then when I started
working at the steel mill

00:38:36.127 --> 00:38:38.210 align:middle line:84%
and met that magician and
learned some card tricks

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:40.775 align:middle line:84%
and seen the reaction of
people, it's like, wow!

00:38:40.775 --> 00:38:41.861 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You loved it.

00:38:41.861 --> 00:38:43.110 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: I loved the reaction.

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:44.767 align:middle line:84%
And I began to be
able to look people

00:38:44.767 --> 00:38:46.600 align:middle line:84%
in the eye, which is
another important thing

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:47.860 align:middle line:84%
of emotional intelligence,
because if you don't look

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:49.490 align:middle line:84%
in their eyes, you're not
going to be able to read them,

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:49.990 align:middle line:90%
all right?

00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:53.840 align:middle line:84%
So magic was my tool
to where I'm at now.

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:55.520 align:middle line:90%
And anybody can do this.

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.890 align:middle line:84%
If I could do it as a steel
worker who barely made it

00:38:57.890 --> 00:39:00.190 align:middle line:84%
through high school and
flunked out of college,

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:01.660 align:middle line:90%
I think anybody can do this.

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:02.493 align:middle line:90%
It's really bizarre.

00:39:02.493 --> 00:39:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My executive
producer is back

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:06.430 align:middle line:90%
in the studio control room.

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And he's just asked me if he
tells me a card in my ear,

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:12.870 align:middle line:90%
would you be able to guess that?

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:13.910 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: I could try.

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:14.462 align:middle line:90%
Now watch.

00:39:14.462 --> 00:39:15.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is tough.

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:16.753 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: We'll put the die away.

00:39:16.753 --> 00:39:18.904 align:middle line:90%
Now think about it.

00:39:18.904 --> 00:39:20.320 align:middle line:84%
Is this Tommy we're
talking about?

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.705 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah,
yeah, Tommy's back

00:39:21.705 --> 00:39:23.240 align:middle line:84%
there, hasn't given
me the card yet.

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:24.994 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Tell him
to forget that card.

00:39:24.994 --> 00:39:25.910 align:middle line:90%
Tell him to forget it.

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:26.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Now, tell him to
just imagine he has the card.

00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:31.185 align:middle line:84%
We're gonna try to play
with his imagination.

00:39:31.185 --> 00:39:32.934 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 52 cards,
he's shuffling them up.

00:39:32.934 --> 00:39:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: And he's within
30 feet of here, right?

00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:36.850 align:middle line:90%
Could he hear me when I talk?

00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's listening
to you right now.

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Tommy, shuffle
those cards in your brain.

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:40.345 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:39:40.345 --> 00:39:41.070 align:middle line:90%
He's shuffling them right now.

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:42.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: This is gonna
blow Tommy away now.

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:42.620 align:middle line:90%
Watch.

00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Tommy, remove one of your
imaginary cards-- better still,

00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:48.020 align:middle line:84%
George, while we're
doing this, here.

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:49.150 align:middle line:90%
Just hold on to this.

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:50.090 align:middle line:90%
Hold on to that.

00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:54.660 align:middle line:84%
All right, now we have all kind
of decks of cards on us here

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:57.540 align:middle line:84%
and stuff like that just to make
sure we have a bunch of decks.

00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:58.540 align:middle line:90%
OK, we have three decks.

00:39:58.540 --> 00:39:59.623 align:middle line:90%
We can just keep that one.

00:39:59.623 --> 00:40:00.470 align:middle line:90%
We don't need these.

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:03.172 align:middle line:84%
Now Tommy, do the
same thing we did.

00:40:03.172 --> 00:40:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Make believe you have
this deck of cards,

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:08.584 align:middle line:84%
and remove one card
from that deck.

00:40:08.584 --> 00:40:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's done it.

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:11.250 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Are you done?

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:14.901 align:middle line:84%
Now put it back in your
imaginary deck upside down,

00:40:14.901 --> 00:40:15.400 align:middle line:90%
Tommy.

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.860 align:middle line:90%
Just put it back in upside down.

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:17.657 align:middle line:90%
Is it done?

00:40:17.657 --> 00:40:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK, he's done it.

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:20.210 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Now, George,
you're holding these cards

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:21.080 align:middle line:90%
all the while.

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.080 align:middle line:90%
Look.

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.020 align:middle line:90%
This is a real deck of cards.

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Which camera should I use
once again, right there?

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:27.275 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right there.

00:40:27.275 --> 00:40:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: OK, now,
George, Tommy, what

00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:32.394 align:middle line:84%
was that imaginary
card you placed upside

00:40:32.394 --> 00:40:33.560 align:middle line:90%
down in your imaginary deck?

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:37.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, tell
me in my ear, Tom.

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:37.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:38.410 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: What is it?

00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:39.542 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: King of clubs.

00:40:39.542 --> 00:40:40.500 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: King of clubs?

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:41.420 align:middle line:90%
You're not gonna believe this.

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:42.250 align:middle line:90%
Take the Joker out.

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:45.810 align:middle line:84%
This is a real deck of cards,
so I'm gonna fan them like this.

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, out of all the
cards Tommy named,

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.270 align:middle line:84%
he said the king
of clubs, right?

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:53.840 align:middle line:84%
Tommy, I'm going to give
you one last chance.

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.620 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:58.390 align:middle line:84%
Name an odd number
right now, Tommy.

00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:00.050 align:middle line:90%
Go.

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:01.319 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 7.

00:41:01.319 --> 00:41:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Now, you want to
keep with clubs, Tommy,

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:06.430 align:middle line:84%
or you want to go hears,
diamonds, or spades?

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:07.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's staying.

00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:08.320 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Staying with clubs?

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:08.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Staying with clubs.

00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: You're not going
to believe this, George.

00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:10.800 align:middle line:90%
Look.

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:14.240 align:middle line:84%
One and only one card
in this deck-- I'm

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.940 align:middle line:90%
doing it in slow motion, Tommy.

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.640 align:middle line:84%
Out of all the
cards you could have

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.280 align:middle line:90%
named-- look at this, Tommy.

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:20.910 align:middle line:90%
Do you see any upside down?

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:21.950 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:23.200 align:middle line:90%
George, pull it out.

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:26.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here we are.

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:27.280 align:middle line:90%
7 of clubs.

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.536 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Isn't that amazing?

00:41:28.536 --> 00:41:29.910 align:middle line:84%
But this is what
you could learn.

00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:31.410 align:middle line:90%
That I could teach you.

00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:35.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Tom, I
know you like a brother.

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.771 align:middle line:84%
There's no way you and
Jim played this out.

00:41:37.771 --> 00:41:40.145 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: And he's changed his
mind, even, a couple times.

00:41:40.145 --> 00:41:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:43.700 align:middle line:84%
I want to see one
more from you, Jimmy.

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:45.155 align:middle line:90%
It's called some kind of spike?

00:41:45.155 --> 00:41:46.030 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Oh, my gosh.

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:47.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What the heck is this?

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:48.260 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: We'll clear this off.

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:49.630 align:middle line:90%
That is a little dangerous.

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:51.322 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to you a
story, all right?

00:41:51.322 --> 00:41:52.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm gonna get this spike out.

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then I'll
tell you one of mine.

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Oh, my God.

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:55.509 align:middle line:90%
You got a story about a spike?

00:41:55.509 --> 00:41:56.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I sure do, too.

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:58.948 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: We'll get some more
Styrofoam cups out here.

00:41:58.948 --> 00:41:59.617 align:middle line:90%
We'll use two.

00:41:59.617 --> 00:42:00.950 align:middle line:90%
Make sure they're empty, George.

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:02.660 align:middle line:90%
Check them out, all right?

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:04.300 align:middle line:90%
And we'll use these two blocks.

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:05.911 align:middle line:90%
Take my glasses off the table.

00:42:05.911 --> 00:42:07.410 align:middle line:84%
We'll move this out
of the way here.

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:09.120 align:middle line:90%
We don't want any distractions.

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:13.240 align:middle line:90%
And here is the spike.

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is like the
top of a railroad spike.

00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:22.654 align:middle line:84%
You can feel how
pointy, very sharp.

00:42:22.654 --> 00:42:23.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's sharp.

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: All right, now,
what's going to happen

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:26.840 align:middle line:84%
is you're going to
put it in-- and we'll

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:29.780 align:middle line:84%
use this camera when you do
it-- one of these things.

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to cover like that.

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.570 align:middle line:90%
And I'm gonna know where it is.

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to teach
you how to do this, all right?

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:41.469 align:middle line:84%
Now, before I do it,
here's the story.

00:42:41.469 --> 00:42:42.510 align:middle line:90%
Tell me your story first.

00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, mine, when
I was a television producer

00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:49.360 align:middle line:84%
back in Detroit,
1978, 1979, we had

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:53.717 align:middle line:84%
paper spikes, where you
would put your papers on when

00:42:53.717 --> 00:42:54.300 align:middle line:90%
you were done.

00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:55.760 align:middle line:84%
You would just
put it down there,

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.890 align:middle line:84%
and the spike would
come through there.

00:42:57.890 --> 00:43:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And you'd have all
your papers there.

00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:05.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, I had a whole pack,
and I missed the spike,

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:09.180 align:middle line:84%
and it went right through my
hand, right through here, right

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:11.530 align:middle line:90%
through there, sticking out.

00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was just like that,
and I didn't even know it,

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:16.030 align:middle line:90%
because I didn't feel any pain.

00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:17.405 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Yeah,
you don't feel it.

00:43:17.405 --> 00:43:21.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And my director-- he's
screaming, George, look, look!

00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And I look, and
I go, oh, my God!

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:25.570 align:middle line:84%
I got this spike sticking
right out of my hand.

00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:30.840 align:middle line:84%
I lift it up and pulled
it out just like that.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:34.152 align:middle line:84%
So when you told me about this
spike trick or whatever it is--

00:43:34.152 --> 00:43:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Well, let me
tell you something.

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:39.490 align:middle line:84%
I was doing this very
sharp spike-- and look

00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:41.880 align:middle line:84%
at how thick it
is-- at a college.

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.890 align:middle line:84%
1,000 times I've done
this in my career

00:43:44.890 --> 00:43:47.030 align:middle line:90%
and I haven't had a problem.

00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.970 align:middle line:90%
It was an early show.

00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:49.090 align:middle line:90%
I come to the school.

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:51.450 align:middle line:84%
I got up at 5:30 in the
morning to drive there.

00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:52.720 align:middle line:90%
So I was half asleep.

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.652 align:middle line:84%
It was an early morning
show, like 11 o'clock.

00:43:55.652 --> 00:43:56.860 align:middle line:90%
I have this set up like this.

00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:58.818 align:middle line:84%
That's why I only use
two now instead of three.

00:43:58.818 --> 00:44:00.760 align:middle line:90%
I had three of them set up.

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:03.910 align:middle line:84%
I smashed the cups,
actually, at that show.

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:07.119 align:middle line:84%
And I hit the spike, and
the front row was like--

00:44:07.119 --> 00:44:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It went right through?

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Well, listen.

00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:09.803 align:middle line:90%
I looked down.

00:44:09.803 --> 00:44:11.160 align:middle line:90%
I didn't feel it, like you said.

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:11.909 align:middle line:90%
You don't feel it.

00:44:11.909 --> 00:44:12.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I know.

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:14.570 align:middle line:84%
But this sucker is
so big, you know?

00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:15.990 align:middle line:84%
I look down at the
top of my hand,

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:19.030 align:middle line:84%
and I just seen a
little red dot of blood.

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.970 align:middle line:90%
So the spike didn't--

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It didn't do
all the way through.

00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: The point
started coming through,

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:23.680 align:middle line:84%
and when I turned my hand
up, the whole big thickness

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:24.530 align:middle line:90%
was sticking out.

00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:25.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh!

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: And as you can see,
this is where it happened.

00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:27.970 align:middle line:90%
She sewed it up really good.

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:31.010 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I haven't
done this for years.

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:32.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What went wrong?

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:34.010 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Lack of focus.

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:36.180 align:middle line:10%
The key to emotional
intelligence is focus.

00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:36.910 align:middle line:10%
Trust me.

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:37.860 align:middle line:10%
You have to focus.

00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:40.510 align:middle line:10%
Like a lot of people say,
hey, we have a memory problem.

00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:42.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
I parked my car.

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Is not because you
have a memory problem.

00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:45.430 align:middle line:84%
You didn't think when you
were parking your car.

00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:46.340 align:middle line:84%
Do you know what
I'm trying to say?

00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:47.320 align:middle line:84%
When you get out
of the car, you're

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:48.550 align:middle line:84%
on your cell phone,
blah, blah, blah.

00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:49.030 align:middle line:90%
You go in the mall.

00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.530 align:middle line:90%
You shop.

00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And you come out,
where's my car?

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:52.430 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my memory is poor.

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:53.471 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not your memory.

00:44:53.471 --> 00:44:54.550 align:middle line:90%
It's your focus.

00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:56.487 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't focus here.

00:44:56.487 --> 00:44:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And if I don't focus here now,
we could have the same problem.

00:44:59.070 --> 00:44:59.470 align:middle line:90%
Here.

00:44:59.470 --> 00:45:00.640 align:middle line:90%
Here are two cups, all right?

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:01.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:03.050 align:middle line:84%
So you've got basically
a 50-50 chance here.

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: A 50-50 chance.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.240 align:middle line:84%
So I'm gonna turn
my back once again.

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.430 align:middle line:90%
Take this spike.

00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:09.280 align:middle line:84%
You're gonna put it
in one of these holes.

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:10.490 align:middle line:90%
We'll put these down for now.

00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:12.070 align:middle line:90%
And then cover both of them.

00:45:12.070 --> 00:45:13.880 align:middle line:84%
You can switch the
cups if you want.

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:16.860 align:middle line:84%
Let me know when
it's covered, though.

00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:17.500 align:middle line:90%
Is it covered?

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:18.208 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not yet.

00:45:18.208 --> 00:45:20.652 align:middle line:90%


00:45:20.652 --> 00:45:22.860 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: All right, and
there's no mirrors back here.

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:23.952 align:middle line:90%
I can't see where it is.

00:45:23.952 --> 00:45:25.910 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely under
one of those cups, right?

00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:26.701 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:45:26.701 --> 00:45:27.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: OK.

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:28.160 align:middle line:90%
Now watch.

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.402 align:middle line:90%
Do you know where the cup is?

00:45:30.402 --> 00:45:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, you're
playing off me.

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Yeah.

00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:34.512 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I know where it is.

00:45:34.512 --> 00:45:35.720 align:middle line:90%
If I'm wrong, you're screwed.

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:36.303 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Yeah.

00:45:36.303 --> 00:45:37.604 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it's that one!

00:45:37.604 --> 00:45:38.104 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh!

00:45:38.104 --> 00:45:39.570 align:middle line:90%
I was right, George!

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:40.380 align:middle line:90%
We are lucky!

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Did you see that facial
expression he had?

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:43.570 align:middle line:90%
That was amazing.

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:44.200 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:48.125 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, but this is
what-- I trusted in you.

00:45:48.125 --> 00:45:49.637 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So it's all about me.

00:45:49.637 --> 00:45:51.220 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Yeah, it
was about you there.

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And we're gonna do the
same thing right now.

00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:53.221 align:middle line:90%
You're gonna do it.

00:45:53.221 --> 00:45:54.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, no, no.

00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: No, no, you have to do
this to end this show, George.

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:56.890 align:middle line:90%
Please trust me.

00:45:56.890 --> 00:45:57.494 align:middle line:90%
Trust me.

00:45:57.494 --> 00:45:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, no.

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:00.010 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: George,
you'll be all right.

00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:02.030 align:middle line:84%
We're gonna use that
camera coming at you.

00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:02.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right, all right.

00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:04.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm not gonna slam
my hand like yours.

00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:04.660 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: No, no.

00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:04.910 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:05.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm gonna put it.

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:07.240 align:middle line:84%
You have to slam
your hand, George.

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No!

00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: George, you have to.

00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No!

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:09.570 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Close your eyes.

00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:10.470 align:middle line:90%
Make sure those eyes are closed.

00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's have Ellie do it.

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:12.453 align:middle line:90%
I'm not gonna do it.

00:46:12.453 --> 00:46:13.160 align:middle line:90%
How about Jay?

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:14.240 align:middle line:90%
Get Jay in here.

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:14.820 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: All right, ready?

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:16.302 align:middle line:84%
I'm gonna put it
under one of them.

00:46:16.302 --> 00:46:17.490 align:middle line:90%
No, no, don't look yet!

00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:18.030 align:middle line:90%
Don't look!

00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:19.680 align:middle line:84%
We don't want you to see
which one it's under.

00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:22.140 align:middle line:84%
All right, all right, turn
around, George, turn around.

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:23.890 align:middle line:90%
Now look at me in the eyes.

00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:24.970 align:middle line:90%
Trust me.

00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:26.280 align:middle line:90%
You're confident.

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:29.760 align:middle line:84%
Hold your hand up
above one of the cups.

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:30.930 align:middle line:90%
Trust me, George.

00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:32.550 align:middle line:90%
Hold your hand up.

00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:36.181 align:middle line:84%
Hold it up real high, and slam
it down as hard as you can!

00:46:36.181 --> 00:46:36.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah!

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:37.140 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Ah!

00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:37.360 align:middle line:90%
He did it!

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:38.040 align:middle line:90%
Unbelievable!

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:39.610 align:middle line:90%
Is that amazing, George?

00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:41.200 align:middle line:90%
Pick it up and you'll see.

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:41.759 align:middle line:90%
Ah, come on.

00:46:41.759 --> 00:46:43.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm not gonna hurt you, George.

00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:44.090 align:middle line:90%
Here it is under here.

00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:45.430 align:middle line:90%
All right, but that was a rush.

00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:46.426 align:middle line:90%
You got a rush there.

00:46:46.426 --> 00:46:47.800 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
show's all about.

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:48.758 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You set me up.

00:46:48.758 --> 00:46:49.800 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: All right, man.

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:53.970 align:middle line:90%
Now let me ask you the question.

00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:57.322 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't you try
me with the spike?

00:46:57.322 --> 00:46:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Why would I do that?

00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:00.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because I might
have made a mistake?

00:47:00.110 --> 00:47:00.950 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Well, let's it.

00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:01.260 align:middle line:90%
Here.

00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No!

00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:02.160 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, no.

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:02.600 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: No, here.

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:03.308 align:middle line:90%
We'll do it here.

00:47:03.308 --> 00:47:03.882 align:middle line:90%
We'll see.

00:47:03.882 --> 00:47:05.340 align:middle line:84%
Let's see what
would have happened.

00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
have happened?

00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:07.160 align:middle line:90%
I won't do it.

00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:07.740 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: We won't do
anything dangerous.

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:08.490 align:middle line:90%
No, no, you're gonna do it.

00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I'll pick
the one I was going to.

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: No, you're
gonna do it, but we're

00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:11.840 align:middle line:84%
gonna put something under
that won't hurt you.

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:12.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are you gonna do?

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:13.721 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: Let's see.

00:47:13.721 --> 00:47:18.160 align:middle line:84%
We'll put a playing card inside
one of the things like this.

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:20.160 align:middle line:84%
All right, turn around
and close your eyes.

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:22.700 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: All right, don't peek.

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm not peeking.

00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:25.258 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: All right,
now turn back around.

00:47:25.258 --> 00:47:27.841 align:middle line:84%
Now visualize-- now, that
playing card is a spike.

00:47:27.841 --> 00:47:28.840 align:middle line:90%
Smash one of those cups!

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Because you're really
not gonna get hurt.

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:32.343 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wanna smash the
one that won't hurt me.

00:47:32.343 --> 00:47:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: Yeah, smash it--
real hard, You gotta-- oh!

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:35.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it.

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:36.610 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: You see why I don't--

00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It would have
been through the spike.

00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:39.820 align:middle line:84%
>>KAROL: That's exactly
why I don't do it that way,

00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:40.695 align:middle line:90%
just in case, George.

00:47:40.695 --> 00:47:41.404 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:47:41.404 --> 00:47:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:44.675 align:middle line:84%
Jim, if people want to track
you, what's your website?

00:47:44.675 --> 00:47:45.550 align:middle line:90%
How do they find you?

00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:49.820 align:middle line:10%
>>KAROL: Just my name, Jim
Karol, K-A-R-O-L, jimkarol.com.

00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:52.162 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You are
absolutely amazing.

00:47:52.162 --> 00:47:54.620 align:middle line:10%
>>KAROL: And I'm starting a
foundation, too, Brain Wellness

00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:55.120 align:middle line:10%
Foundation.

00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:55.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:56.390 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: To help people.

00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:57.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Whatever we can do
for you, you let me know.

00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:58.610 align:middle line:90%
>>KAROL: You're awesome.

00:47:58.610 --> 00:47:59.110 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:01.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:03.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, had this
been a real spike,

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:05.550 align:middle line:84%
it would have been
through my hand.

00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:08.300 align:middle line:10%
I think I'll leave the
mentalism to Jim Karol.

00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:12.520 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
