00:00:19.882 --> 00:00:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome to this
edition of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.680 align:middle line:10%
You know, I've had a lot
of guests on this program

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.320 align:middle line:10%
and a lot of guests
on our radio show.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And there's one guy that
stands out all the time

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.080 align:middle line:84%
as one of the
preeminent investigators

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.670 align:middle line:90%
in the world of the paranormal.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.110 align:middle line:84%
His name is Joshua P. Warren,
and we've got him right now

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.980 align:middle line:90%
on "Beyond Belief."

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.570 align:middle line:90%
Josh, good to have you here.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSHUA P. WARREN:
Always a great pleasure

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:43.550 align:middle line:90%
to be with you, George.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.350 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I will always
remember you, your legacy,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.370 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of my life.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about a
little bit later on--

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.920 align:middle line:84%
Robert the haunted dog scared
the living daylights out

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.030 align:middle line:84%
of everybody who listened to you
that night on "Coast to Coast."

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.900 align:middle line:90%
Unbelievable.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.610 align:middle line:84%
But you do a lot of
different things.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.250 align:middle line:84%
I would call you a
paranormal researcher,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.630 align:middle line:84%
but you cover ghosts,
UFOs, wishing machines.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.430 align:middle line:90%
You do it all.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.330 align:middle line:90%
What's your favorite subject?

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.020 align:middle line:10%
>>WARREN: I think my
favorite is still ghosts,

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.840 align:middle line:10%
because ghosts was
really what I started

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.730 align:middle line:10%
studying when I was young.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.250 align:middle line:10%
And I found that if you stick
with ghosts long enough,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.510 align:middle line:10%
eventually they connect to UFOs.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, UFOs
connect to cryptids,

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.820 align:middle line:84%
and that it all connects
to psychic phenomena.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes a really
big interesting circle

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.530 align:middle line:90%
of strange phenomena.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.770 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me of that great
quote by Charles Fort.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.800 align:middle line:84%
You can measure a circle
beginning anywhere,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.660 align:middle line:84%
so I'm fortunate
now that I've seen

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.720 align:middle line:84%
the many different
facets of this field we

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.610 align:middle line:90%
call the paranormal.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You also
spend a lot of time

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.790 align:middle line:84%
now going between North
Carolina and Puerto Rico.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.860 align:middle line:84%
How come you're in
Puerto Rico all the time?

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.642 align:middle line:10%
>>WARREN: Well, you
know, my hometown

00:01:59.642 --> 00:02:01.100 align:middle line:10%
is Asheville, North
Carolina, where

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.460 align:middle line:10%
I have my museum and my
laboratory and ghost tours,

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.539 align:middle line:10%
but the Bermuda Triangle
has always fascinated me,

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.620 align:middle line:10%
because the Bermuda Triangle
captures the essence of what

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.760 align:middle line:10%
we were just talking about.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.050 align:middle line:84%
It captures that idea that the
paranormal is a phantasmagoria

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.120 align:middle line:90%
of many strange things.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And what you find is
that in some places,

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.760 align:middle line:84%
like Asheville, you have
miniature Bermuda triangles,

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.730 align:middle line:84%
but there's no substitute
for going to the real Bermuda

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:29.630 align:middle line:90%
Triangle.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And I own the Bermuda Triangle
Research Center in Puerto Rico.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what
does that center do?

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.250 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: We study all
the anomalous activity

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.070 align:middle line:84%
in the triangle, but
especially the middle

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.100 align:middle line:84%
of the triangle, which is
why I'm in Puerto Rico.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And we especially are fascinated
by many of the UFOs that

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.230 align:middle line:90%
have been documented there.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And what we're
finding, George, is

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.170 align:middle line:84%
that some of the
UFOs in Puerto Rico

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.070 align:middle line:84%
are not like the traditional
structured flying saucers

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.040 align:middle line:90%
that we're all used to.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: They
look very bizarre.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.690 align:middle line:84%
Some of these things
have irregular shapes.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.100 align:middle line:84%
They almost seem to
be shapeshifting.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hmm.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: They interact--

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they biological?

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: You know,
I think, George,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.890 align:middle line:84%
that these may actually indeed
be biological UFOs, what

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.560 align:middle line:90%
I call OUFOs, or organic UFOs.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if they're
creatures in their own right?

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Some of these
things have indeed

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.270 align:middle line:84%
been reported as similar
to big flying jellyfish.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that doesn't
seem so implausible,

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.590 align:middle line:84%
because it may be that these
were the original earthlings,

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.520 align:middle line:84%
and that we are the aliens that
have sort of appeared later on.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And we're still trying to figure
out the human origin story.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.620 align:middle line:84%
But these may be creatures that
are more advanced, more highly

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.500 align:middle line:84%
evolved, and they might
almost be a combination

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.710 align:middle line:84%
of what we usually consider
organic and inorganic meshed

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:59.510 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.593 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:04:00.593 --> 00:04:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, draw us a mental map
of the Bermuda Triangle.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.832 align:middle line:90%
Where we talking here?

00:04:04.832 --> 00:04:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well,
generally speaking,

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.670 align:middle line:84%
the triangle is the patch of
ocean between Miami and Puerto

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.800 align:middle line:90%
Rico and the island of Bermuda.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people just think
of the triangle as a place

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.850 align:middle line:84%
where ships and boats and
people mysteriously disappear.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.810 align:middle line:90%
And yes, that does happen.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.640 align:middle line:84%
But even more than
that, we have the UFOs.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.830 align:middle line:84%
We have the USOs,
which are the ones that

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.290 align:middle line:84%
actually go into the ocean
and disappear into the water.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Those fascinate me.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.560 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Yeah,
those are amazing.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.790 align:middle line:84%
We have got cryptids,
like the chupacabra,

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.280 align:middle line:90%
which came from Puerto Rico.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.580 align:middle line:84%
You have some of the
creepiest ghost stories.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.660 align:middle line:84%
For example, Old San Juan is
the oldest city in US territory,

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.450 align:middle line:84%
with plenty of pirate ghosts
and dungeons and tales

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:51.610 align:middle line:90%
along those lines.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.680 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of activity that
happens in that entire patch

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.480 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And I've also
noticed that there is

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.810 align:middle line:84%
a very low gravitational field
on that part of the planet.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And I am working on trying to
see what the connection may

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.470 align:middle line:84%
be between gravity and our
paranormal experiences.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us the history
of the Bermuda Triangle.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.190 align:middle line:90%
How did we know about it?

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.402 align:middle line:90%
Was it Charles Berlitz?

00:05:18.402 --> 00:05:21.210 align:middle line:10%
>>WARREN: Well, Charles
Berlitz popularized

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.000 align:middle line:10%
the idea of the Bermuda
Triangle that we now

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.570 align:middle line:10%
have in his famous book
that came out in the 1970s,

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:33.570 align:middle line:10%
but stories about
the area being active

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.622 align:middle line:10%
go back hundreds and
hundreds of years.

00:05:35.622 --> 00:05:36.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean, when Columbus--

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Real stories.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:38.610 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Oh, yeah.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.950 align:middle line:10%
When Columbus was sailing
to the New World in 1492,

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.980 align:middle line:10%
he recorded in his
official logbooks

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.350 align:middle line:10%
all kinds of weird activity
in that part of the ocean.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.410 align:middle line:84%
He would see lights on
the horizon and lights

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.720 align:middle line:84%
that would rise up into the sky
and go in and out of the water.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.140 align:middle line:84%
He, on a number of occasions,
talked about his compass

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.700 align:middle line:90%
going haywire.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.270 align:middle line:84%
That caused some
navigation issues.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And so we have a
long, long tradition

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.750 align:middle line:84%
of people experiencing
weird stuff.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it's been
around a long time--

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:08.170 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Absolutely.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --in terms
of knowledge up.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Yeah,
and of course, you

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.770 align:middle line:84%
could go even back
thousands of years

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:19.050 align:middle line:84%
and look at some of the strange
creatures and UFO type activity

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:24.300 align:middle line:84%
reported by the Mayans,
which were very, very close

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.630 align:middle line:84%
to that part of
the ocean as well,

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.930 align:middle line:84%
and even some of the indigenous
peoples around Florida

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.115 align:middle line:84%
talking about seeing what
we would call UFOs today.

00:06:34.115 --> 00:06:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've
sometimes wondered,

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.840 align:middle line:84%
because Atlantis may have been
out there, that when it sank,

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.130 align:middle line:84%
it took with it some kind
of crystal or something

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.560 align:middle line:90%
that has an effect out there.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well,
there is no doubt

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.790 align:middle line:84%
that Atlantis may have been
a real place in that area.

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: For example, right in
the triangle, near Puerto Rico,

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.010 align:middle line:84%
we have what's called
the Puerto Rico trench.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.530 align:middle line:84%
It's the deepest spot
in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.970 align:middle line:90%
It's almost 30,000 feet deep.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.130 align:middle line:90%
So if you were to take Mt.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.282 align:middle line:84%
Everest and set it
down in this trench--

00:07:11.282 --> 00:07:12.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You wouldn't see it.

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:13.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well,
just a little tip.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:13.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just the tip.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Just a little
tip would be sticking up.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.200 align:middle line:84%
We have scarcely explored
what's down in that trench.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny to me because
you hear people say this,

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:28.120 align:middle line:84%
but it's true, we do know

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.570 align:middle line:84%
- This is actual
Homeland Security footage

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:49.680 align:middle line:84%
shot at the Aguadilla
Airport around 9:20 PM

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.450 align:middle line:90%
on April 25, 2013.

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:57.180 align:middle line:84%
An infrared thermal
camera spotted

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:01.200 align:middle line:84%
this object flying
over 120 miles per hour

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.910 align:middle line:90%
around the airport.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:06.300 align:middle line:84%
It had no squawking
transponder and did not

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.730 align:middle line:90%
communicate with the tower.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.880 align:middle line:84%
All aircraft were
immediately grounded.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.930 align:middle line:84%
The object has no wings or
rotor and a weird, almost

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:18.240 align:middle line:90%
shapeshifting appearance.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.030 align:middle line:84%
It suddenly dips into
the Atlantic Ocean,

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:23.910 align:middle line:84%
where you can still
see it speeding just

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:28.800 align:middle line:84%
below the surface of the
water at 95 miles per hour.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.490 align:middle line:84%
It continues to dip in and
out of the water a few times

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:38.789 align:middle line:84%
until finally emerging, now
joined by a second object.

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Thermal imaging proves this
is not an optical illusion.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:47.190 align:middle line:84%
Then the two objects
dip one last time

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:50.370 align:middle line:84%
into the Atlantic
Ocean, though the camera

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:53.280 align:middle line:90%
continues to search for them.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.070 align:middle line:84%
They are close to the
deepest spot in the Atlantic

00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:01.470 align:middle line:84%
Ocean, the Puerto Rico trench,
almost 30,000 feet deep,

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.340 align:middle line:84%
nearly equal to
the height of Mt.

That footage has been

of the most important

>>WARREN: There's no

00:09:38.595 --> 00:09:41.370 align:middle line:84%
They had to ground all

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:42.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They did?

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:42.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Absolutely.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.501 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just because

00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:46.120 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Because
of that object.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is
significant, because look

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.840 align:middle line:84%
at how dismissive
this object was of all

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.514 align:middle line:90%

>>WARREN: Nobody
could do anything.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And so the big question--
what is this thing?

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, because it has a
shapeshifting appearance,

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:06.090 align:middle line:84%
because that it morphs
so easily from air

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.229 align:middle line:90%
into water and back out--

00:10:08.229 --> 00:10:09.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And keeps going.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:09.530 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Absolutely.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:10.405 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Keeps going.

00:10:10.405 --> 00:10:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: 95 MPH under
the surface of the water,

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.040 align:middle line:84%
then emerges with
the second one--

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.940 align:middle line:84%
I must tell you--
this is subjective--

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:19.770 align:middle line:84%
but it almost seems like there's
a playfulness between the two

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.980 align:middle line:84%
objects when they come out and
they go back down together.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, I wondered,
is this a machine

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:29.350 align:middle line:84%
with a little guy sitting
inside the steering wheel?

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:31.320 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get that impression.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And so it was as
I started looking

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:37.470 align:middle line:84%
at other reports of similar
craft in Puerto Rico, things

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:41.220 align:middle line:84%
that locals and residents
have been capturing for years,

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.590 align:middle line:84%
and hearing their
stories, that's

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:46.290 align:middle line:84%
when I began to realize
these things are

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.122 align:middle line:84%
sensitive to human
consciousness.

00:10:49.122 --> 00:10:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I didn't
get a perspective

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.230 align:middle line:90%
of the size of this thing.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:53.550 align:middle line:90%
How big do you think it was?

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.258 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: The scientists
estimate that it

00:10:55.258 --> 00:10:57.330 align:middle line:90%
was about six feet in diameter.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:58.340 align:middle line:90%
So it was not gigantic.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not big.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:03.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: But it certainly has
no wings, no propeller, no jet

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:04.740 align:middle line:90%
propulsion.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.060 align:middle line:84%
There is no conventional
means of propulsion.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.570 align:middle line:84%
It couldn't be a drone
or something like that.

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And it seems very likely
that if this is a machine,

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:20.970 align:middle line:84%
it's a kind of machine that
may also be advanced enough

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:21.960 align:middle line:90%
to be conscious.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:24.550 align:middle line:90%
It thinks for itself.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you had a specialized
computer AI system,

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.489 align:middle line:90%
it would do that.

00:11:29.489 --> 00:11:30.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: That's a great point.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.930 align:middle line:84%
An AI system might be,
for us, indiscernible

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:35.726 align:middle line:90%
from that kind of technology.

00:11:35.726 --> 00:11:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And when we think of
this word organic,

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:41.220 align:middle line:84%
often we think of humans,
because we're very egocentric.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.800 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
realize humans are

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.310 align:middle line:84%
made of iron and copper and
zinc and magnesium, sulphur.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same thing that was.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: So it's
how you arrange

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:54.390 align:middle line:84%
these things that determines
what you ultimately get.

00:11:54.390 --> 00:12:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And so by calling these
possibly OUFOs or organic UFOs,

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:03.750 align:middle line:84%
we may be opening the
door here to a broader

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:06.150 align:middle line:84%
conversation on what
we are sometimes

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:07.729 align:middle line:90%
dealing with in this field.

00:12:07.729 --> 00:12:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
coined that phrase?

I mean, did it hit the papers?

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:18.320 align:middle line:90%
Was it on television?

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.857 align:middle line:90%
Did it hit the media?

00:12:19.857 --> 00:12:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: One of the
most interesting things

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:25.080 align:middle line:84%
about this for me was that
because I stay in Puerto Rico

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:29.550 align:middle line:84%
part time, I was down there
when this was captured.

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, Puerto Rico
has a lot of people.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:32.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: But it's
still just an island,

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.700 align:middle line:90%
and word travels quickly.

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:39.115 align:middle line:84%
And everybody knows everybody
one way or another, it seems.

00:12:39.115 --> 00:12:40.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure, sure.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: There
was such a buzz all

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.220 align:middle line:90%
over the island the next day.

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.390 align:middle line:84%
The gossip was, hey,
my brother-in-law works

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:50.870 align:middle line:84%
at the Homeland Security
and guess what they saw.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And everybody was scrambling
to try to get this footage.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed like that it
was never going to emerge.

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually,
it was leaked.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.829 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How soon did
the video pop out?

00:13:02.829 --> 00:13:04.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: I would say it came--

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.980 align:middle line:84%
well, it came to my attention
probably about six or seven

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.140 align:middle line:90%
months after the incident.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:09.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Months.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: So it took it a
while to get to the internet.

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:11.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a while.

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.180 align:middle line:90%
That's a while.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.471 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: But you have to
realize, I mean, to this day,

00:13:14.471 --> 00:13:16.260 align:middle line:90%
no one knows who leaked it.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is a serious
matter, because it's

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.260 align:middle line:84%
one thing to say, well, this
is something for the wacky UFO

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:23.100 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.207 align:middle line:90%
This is airport security.

00:13:24.207 --> 00:13:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is a breach.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: That's exactly right.

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is a breach.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Since this occurred,
have you learned anything

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:32.700 align:middle line:90%
more about this?

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:33.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Yes, I have.

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:36.470 align:middle line:84%
I started talking to a
lot of the residents who

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:39.030 align:middle line:84%
were capturing some
of the best footage

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:42.150 align:middle line:84%
of these strange
objects, often traveling

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.910 align:middle line:90%
at a very high rate of speed.

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And what I found was
that some of these people

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:52.620 align:middle line:84%
told me that they could summon
them, that they could literally

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.120 align:middle line:90%
go out and meditate.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.001 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let their mind,
consciousness, do its thing.

00:13:58.001 --> 00:14:00.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: That's right,
that they would send out

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.160 align:middle line:84%
a telepathic signal
that would attract

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.710 align:middle line:90%
these almost on command.

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:08.490 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to test
this out myself.

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And of course, George, you
and I even worked together--

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.396 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have
done this before.

00:14:12.396 --> 00:14:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: --on an experiment.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.370 align:middle line:84%
You recorded a message
inviting visitors to appear.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:18.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think
we invited them.

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, we got
one of these things that

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:25.770 align:middle line:84%
appeared on our own camera,
came down, created the squealing

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:28.860 align:middle line:84%
noise, and then shot
back up into the sky.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Explain
what that message was

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:32.400 align:middle line:90%
and how you sent it.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Ultimately, it was
a very friendly open message

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.640 align:middle line:84%
to any visitors
who want to come.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.190 align:middle line:84%
It was on the
anniversary of the Wow!

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:42.630 align:middle line:90%
Signal.

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.630 align:middle line:90%
So this was August of 2014.

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And what we did was take that
message that you prerecorded,

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.090 align:middle line:84%
distributed it to
ham radio operators

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:57.540 align:middle line:84%
all around Puerto Rico who
knew exactly what frequencies

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:01.470 align:middle line:84%
they should broadcast in order
to break out into outer space,

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:04.740 align:middle line:84%
to break out of the
Earth's ionosphere.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:08.040 align:middle line:84%
In addition to that, we also
made this message available

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.849 align:middle line:84%
freely on the
internet, so we really

00:15:09.849 --> 00:15:11.640 align:middle line:84%
don't know how many
people around the world

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.190 align:middle line:84%
may have been participating
in their own way.

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:15.930 align:middle line:90%
So we were broadcasting it.

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:18.810 align:middle line:84%
We were using wishing
machines and radionics

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:20.280 align:middle line:90%
to set coordinates.

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And we had people just sending
out their mental invitations.

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to attract
these things, which takes me

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.390 align:middle line:84%
back to this idea
that maybe this is

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:33.030 align:middle line:84%
something that is partly
organic, because it

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.910 align:middle line:90%
is sensitive--

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:34.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: --to the human mind.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had mentioned-- and
we just saw the video of this

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:43.500 align:middle line:84%
object going into the
water and out again--

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.290 align:middle line:84%
this happens a lot
in Puerto Rico.

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:47.090 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:50.270 align:middle line:84%
- I met a man named
Luis Aymat who took

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:54.440 align:middle line:90%
this photo in 2012 near Lajas.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:57.320 align:middle line:84%
The cows were spooked
on his uncle's farm,

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:02.270 align:middle line:84%
and his photo revealed this
anomaly overhead, unseen by him

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:05.640 align:middle line:90%
when the photo was taken.

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And then I met this
man, Daniel Matos Velez,

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:13.880 align:middle line:84%
a lifeguard who has
captured many strange things

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.790 align:middle line:90%
off the coast of Boqueron.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:20.450 align:middle line:84%
This particular object is
first partially submerged

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:25.220 align:middle line:84%
in the water, and then
suddenly, it's in the sky.

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Daniel explained these things
moved so quickly you cannot

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:32.720 align:middle line:84%
usually see them
with the naked eye,

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:36.920 align:middle line:84%
only upon review of
photos or video footage.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And he shared some
remarkable insight with me.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.580 align:middle line:10%
Daniel said he is a direct
descendant of the Taino

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:45.380 align:middle line:10%
Indians.

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:46.750 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
significance of that?

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:53.230 align:middle line:10%
>>WARREN: Well, I found that the
Tainos, the indigenous Puerto

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:56.530 align:middle line:10%
Ricans, the ones who met
Columbus when he arrived

00:16:56.530 --> 00:17:03.550 align:middle line:10%
in 1493, they had these deities
they called zemis, which they

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:05.740 align:middle line:10%
represented in these
sculptures that

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:10.180 align:middle line:10%
look very much like these weird,
dark, roughly saucer shaped

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:13.210 align:middle line:10%
objects that we see in
much of this footage.

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:15.849 align:middle line:10%
They call them
lesser gods, and they

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:20.300 align:middle line:10%
believe they came from the
sky, and they held them

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.160 align:middle line:10%
in the highest regard.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And the more I researched
the Taino culture,

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:27.140 align:middle line:84%
the more I realized
that the ancient Puerto

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.780 align:middle line:84%
Ricans seemed to be just
as aware of these things

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.700 align:middle line:90%
as we are today.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.670 align:middle line:84%
But what really blew my mind was
when Daniel Matos Velez, said,

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:37.730 align:middle line:84%
Josh, I'm going
to share something

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:40.194 align:middle line:84%
with you because you seem
like a good-hearted person.

00:17:40.194 --> 00:17:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I love it
when locals say that.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Isn't that nice?

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And so here I am on the edge of
my seat, like I am right now.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.003 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell me, tell me.

00:17:47.003 --> 00:17:52.840 align:middle line:10%
>>WARREN: And he said, there
is an ancient Taino symbol that

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:56.920 align:middle line:10%
has been passed down
from father to son,

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.920 align:middle line:10%
father to son for generations.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:04.420 align:middle line:84%
It's never been made public,
and we use this symbol

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:07.810 align:middle line:84%
in order to meditate and
attract these things.

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I am going to
give this symbol to you,

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:13.510 align:middle line:84%
but you have to promise
that you will never

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.130 align:middle line:90%
reveal it to anyone else.

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:17.050 align:middle line:90%
And he drew a symbol.

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:19.750 align:middle line:84%
He said it didn't matter
if this is in stone.

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:22.210 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't matter if
it's a piece of paper.

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:25.690 align:middle line:84%
What matters is the
pattern of the symbol.

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:28.300 align:middle line:84%
He gave that to me,
and he said, whenever

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.210 align:middle line:84%
you're about to go out and
attract these things, just

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:34.510 align:middle line:84%
stare at the symbol for a few
minutes and meditate on it.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And every time I have done
that, I have had success getting

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.450 align:middle line:90%
something anomalous to appear.

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would
the symbol do that?

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, I became
really curious at that point

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.420 align:middle line:90%
about this same issue.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.710 align:middle line:84%
What is the significance
of a symbol?

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And then it reminded
me of my studies

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.710 align:middle line:84%
that I've done with Robert
the doll, for example.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:57.610 align:middle line:84%
It reminded me of my
studies regarding sigils.

00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:58.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Sigils are magical
symbols that have been used

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.350 align:middle line:84%

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:04.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: --by

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everybody.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Witches, warlocks,
sorcerers of all kinds.

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:14.770 align:middle line:10%
And they use it
as the final stamp

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:19.510 align:middle line:10%
at the end of a ritual
or some magical practice.

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:23.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's usually an
abstract-looking thing.

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And it is supposed to exemplify
the form of the energy that

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.890 align:middle line:90%
was put into that intention.

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:38.060 align:middle line:84%
It defies and
transcends language.

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:43.147 align:middle line:84%
This is almost like a little
antenna for that ritual.

00:19:43.147 --> 00:19:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And so if you come into
contact with that antenna,

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:48.380 align:middle line:84%
it exposes you to that
energy, and you become

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:51.200 align:middle line:90%
a part of the magic intention.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did other
cultures use symbols,

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:57.740 align:middle line:84%
like the Hindus
and the Buddhists?

00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Every

ever been on this planet

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:09.012 align:middle line:84%
use some kind of
symbol, otherwise

00:20:09.012 --> 00:20:11.220 align:middle line:84%
we don't know about it, I
guess, because they weren't

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.380 align:middle line:90%
leaving any traces behind.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:19.860 align:middle line:84%
But yes, the idea of
taking some type of thought

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.730 align:middle line:84%
and representing it
as a symbol seems

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:28.590 align:middle line:84%
to be a staple of
humanity itself.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:31.950 align:middle line:84%
You don't see animals
doing that so much.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:36.780 align:middle line:84%
It's possible some apes might
border on that sometimes,

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:41.520 align:middle line:84%
but that's a uniquely human
thing to try to take a thought

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.810 align:middle line:90%
and represent it that way.

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:44.143 align:middle line:90%
And you know it's funny, George.

00:20:44.143 --> 00:20:48.990 align:middle line:84%
I was just speaking recently,
I guess just today, about this.

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, that we text
each other, our texts

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:54.780 align:middle line:84%
get shorter and
shorter and shorter.

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And we're leaving out
unnecessary consonants

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:58.370 align:middle line:90%
and vowels.

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:00.326 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're doing
initials for things.

00:21:00.326 --> 00:21:01.950 align:middle line:84%

>>WARREN: We are
essentially reverting back

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:11.830 align:middle line:84%
to symbols, symbols in
Egyptian hieroglyphics,

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:14.820 align:middle line:84%
where one character
represents a lot

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:20.610 align:middle line:84%
of different thoughts or at
least one significant thought

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:21.910 align:middle line:90%
form.

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a
very practical thing,

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:27.600 align:middle line:84%
and it's almost like we're
coming full circle here,

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:31.050 align:middle line:84%
as we are learning to use
symbols all over again.

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:36.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think somebody
manifested that object?

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: I think it's
certainly possible.

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.630 align:middle line:84%
It may be that these things
that I call OUFOs kind of

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:47.280 align:middle line:84%
have a mind of their
own, but they take notice

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.350 align:middle line:84%
if somebody wants
to attract them.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.240 align:middle line:10%
It reminds me of
that great quote

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.626 align:middle line:10%
from the movie "The
Mothman Prophecies."

because he can't understand why
these mothman type creatures

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:05.239 align:middle line:10%
are being attracted to him.

00:22:05.239 --> 00:22:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he has
these flashbacks.

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:07.580 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Yeah.

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:10.200 align:middle line:84%
So he goes to an expert,
and the expert says,

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:13.650 align:middle line:84%
well, you notice them, and they
notice that you notice them.

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:14.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:16.943 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: And so I think these
things are all around us.

00:22:16.943 --> 00:22:19.850 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes when you
pay attention to them,

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:20.710 align:middle line:90%
they realize that.

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They sure do.

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:26.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, this ability to manifest
things through these symbols

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:29.580 align:middle line:84%
is quite extraordinary,
isn't it?

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, it is,
because it tells us

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:37.330 align:middle line:84%
a lot about the construction
of reality itself,

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:42.940 align:middle line:84%
that relationship between
mind and matter and energy.

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And it also makes us
think, perhaps in a way,

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:51.920 align:middle line:84%
there's something almost
telekinetic going on here.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.560 align:middle line:90%
Maybe the mind can create--

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:54.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.470 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: --even more
than we believe it can.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:23:00.832 align:middle line:84%
And we just need focus,
and these symbols,

00:23:00.832 --> 00:23:02.290 align:middle line:84%
even though they're
abstract, allow

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:05.410 align:middle line:84%
the mind to focus in
some particular way

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:08.650 align:middle line:84%
to send out a particular
wavelength that will

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:11.290 align:middle line:90%
trigger something in reality.

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have
to concentrate in order

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.410 align:middle line:84%
to manifest when you
have these symbols,

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:18.700 align:middle line:84%
or do you just put it
down and let it happen?

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:22.690 align:middle line:90%


00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: In his
experience, Daniel

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:28.990 align:middle line:84%
said he would just sort of
relax and look at the symbol.

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And then he would
take his cell phone,

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:37.390 align:middle line:84%
point it out, say, over
the water, close his eyes,

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:40.270 align:middle line:84%
mentally think of
inviting whatever's

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:44.740 align:middle line:84%
out there, and then just
slowly scan from right to left

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:46.110 align:middle line:90%
and then left to right.

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And then he would
watch his footage,

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:48.330 align:middle line:90%
and he would have something.

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:49.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:50.190 align:middle line:90%
Remarkable.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:53.525 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: So he portrayed
it as a very relaxed thing.

00:23:53.525 --> 00:23:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I've
treated it as well.

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:57.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was this first
video-- was there any sound

00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:59.500 align:middle line:90%
associated with it?

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:00.850 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: With his first video?

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:03.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The one we saw
from Homeland Security.

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: No.

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:05.740 align:middle line:84%
If there was, that has
never been released.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So the object
was silent, we think.

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, the footage
didn't have any audio.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But sound
does have an effect

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.010 align:middle line:90%
on some of these symbols.

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:13.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Oh, yeah.

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:15.074 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Take a look.

00:24:15.074 --> 00:24:15.874 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:24:15.874 --> 00:24:19.360 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:35.794 align:middle line:90%


00:24:35.794 --> 00:24:36.830 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:39.922 align:middle line:84%
That looks like we are looking
at a jet engine, didn't it?

00:24:39.922 --> 00:24:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Very much so.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:41.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What was that?

00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:44.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, because
of my interest in sigils,

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:47.600 align:middle line:84%
I started looking into
different ways of creating them.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:50.323 align:middle line:10%
>>WARREN: And that led me to
develop a field of research

00:24:50.323 --> 00:24:52.700 align:middle line:10%
I called para-cymatics.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:57.750 align:middle line:10%
Essentially, what we do
is take different tones.

00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:00.890 align:middle line:10%
We play them through
an audio speaker,

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:02.690 align:middle line:10%
and then we have a
container of water

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:05.150 align:middle line:10%
on top of that audio speaker.

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:09.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, the tones can be
modified so that there

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:10.910 align:middle line:90%
is a message in the tone.

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:11.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:15.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: And different messages
create different patterns.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.210 align:middle line:84%
We never know what's
going to pop up.

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:19.370 align:middle line:90%
That's up to mother nature.

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And so for example, the first
time I experimented with this,

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:27.140 align:middle line:84%
I sat down in front of a
microphone, and I said,

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:30.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying to attract a ghost.

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:34.670 align:middle line:90%
And then I played that tone.

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:38.280 align:middle line:84%
I viewed the pattern in
the water using infrared,

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.020 align:middle line:90%
ultraviolet, and laser light.

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:41.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It picks
up the tones, right?

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:42.625 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Absolutely.

00:25:42.625 --> 00:25:46.730 align:middle line:84%
It takes that tone, that
nonphysical vibration,

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:50.000 align:middle line:84%
and turns it into
a physical pattern.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.770 align:middle line:90%
I took a picture of that.

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:53.930 align:middle line:90%
So now I have a little symbol.

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:56.410 align:middle line:90%
My wife went to bed.

00:25:56.410 --> 00:26:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And unbeknownst to
her, I put this sigil

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.505 align:middle line:84%
on the outside of
the bedroom door.

00:26:02.505 --> 00:26:04.497 align:middle line:84%
Now, she's usually a
very sound sleeper.

00:26:04.497 --> 00:26:05.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're evil doing that.

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: I've been
told this, yeah.

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.550 align:middle line:84%
So that night, I was
staying up watching a movie.

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:13.950 align:middle line:84%
About 4:30, my wife comes
downstairs and said,

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:15.400 align:middle line:90%
did you come into the bedroom?

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.200 align:middle line:90%
I said, no.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:16.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, oh.

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:19.225 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: And she said, well,
this house must be haunted,

00:26:19.225 --> 00:26:21.830 align:middle line:84%
because something
keeps shoving me.

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:24.530 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, yes, it worked.

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:26.390 align:middle line:90%
I was ecstatic.

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:27.735 align:middle line:90%
She was not.

00:26:27.735 --> 00:26:29.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you tell
her what you did?

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Oh, yeah.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:30.892 align:middle line:90%
I told her what I did.

00:26:30.892 --> 00:26:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She wasn't
too happy about that.

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: For me, it
was a Eureka moment.

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You did
experiment on your wife.

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:36.890 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: I did.

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:37.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.630 align:middle line:90%
It's not the first time.

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:43.430 align:middle line:84%
But she has gotten a promise
I'll never do that again.

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:46.430 align:middle line:84%
But I was so inspired
I started making

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:50.720 align:middle line:84%
other sigils for different
purposes, different things--

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:51.890 align:middle line:90%
more psychic ability.

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:53.560 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Incredible dreaming.

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.439 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you keep
the symbol the same?

00:26:55.439 --> 00:26:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: No, it changes
every single time.

00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:58.604 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But, I
mean, you keep it

00:26:58.604 --> 00:27:00.530 align:middle line:84%
the same for that
specific purpose?

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: For that
specific purpose.

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:05.280 align:middle line:84%
So now I've developed a
catalog of what I call

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:06.600 align:middle line:90%
sigils for different purposes--

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For different things.

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: --that I freely give
out to the whole wide world.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And I have people contact
me every day from all

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:18.770 align:middle line:84%
over the world telling me
these just astounding stories

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:20.840 align:middle line:84%
about things that they've
been able to attract

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:21.950 align:middle line:90%
into their lives.

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's creepy,
sometimes it's good fortune.

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:28.719 align:middle line:84%
You can use it for any
type of manifestation.

00:27:28.719 --> 00:27:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And it shows me that
whether you want

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:37.610 align:middle line:84%
to attract a UFO, or a ghost,
or good luck, or more money,

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:41.090 align:middle line:84%
or a better project,
or whatever it is,

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:45.980 align:middle line:84%
these sigils apparently can help
us manifest things mentally.

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the Chinese
believe, for example,

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:51.150 align:middle line:84%
that the symbol of
the eight, right--

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:51.950 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Yes.

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --will manifest
money and wealth, as long

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.042 align:middle line:90%
as you don't put greed into it.

00:27:57.042 --> 00:27:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to tell
you an interesting story.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.380 align:middle line:10%
You know Glynis McCants,
the numerologist?

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.830 align:middle line:10%
She's on "Coast to
Coast" one night,

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:06.050 align:middle line:10%
and she's talking about symbols.

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And she said, draw
a symbol of an eight

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:13.760 align:middle line:84%
and put it in your
wallet or purse.

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And then if you go to a casino
or you do something like that,

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.200 align:middle line:90%
you will probably win.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.520 align:middle line:84%
Happens 8 out of
10 times, she says.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.620 align:middle line:84%
8 out of 10 times,
I'm saying to myself.

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.030 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:30.050 align:middle line:84%
So I had a friend of mine who
was listening to the show.

00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:32.230 align:middle line:90%
He's not with us anymore.

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:36.940 align:middle line:84%
But he heard it, and he wrote an
eight and put it in his wallet.

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:41.530 align:middle line:84%
He went to the casino,
and he won $2,000.

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:43.240 align:middle line:90%
He never wins.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:46.450 align:middle line:84%
He's telling me this, and he
was a manager of a restaurant.

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:49.540 align:middle line:90%
He's all excited.

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And his name was George also,
and I said, George, there's

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:55.190 align:middle line:90%
a secret to this, though.

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:57.020 align:middle line:90%
I've learned this.

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:59.360 align:middle line:90%
Don't be greedy.

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.480 align:middle line:90%
You won, the symbol worked.

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.130 align:middle line:90%
Don't be greedy.

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:05.990 align:middle line:90%
He didn't listen to me, Josh.

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:08.180 align:middle line:90%
He goes back to the casino.

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:13.640 align:middle line:84%
He's got the 8 in his wallet,
loses the entire $2,000.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.854 align:middle line:84%
There's a lesson
here, isn't there?

00:29:15.854 --> 00:29:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: There
is a great lesson,

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:19.550 align:middle line:84%
and I'm glad that you bring
this up at particular,

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:25.760 align:middle line:84%
because just recently, a friend
gave me a remarkable gift.

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:30.140 align:middle line:90%
It is a coin made into a ring.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And that coin was taken
from a shipwreck in which

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.900 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of people died
hundreds of years ago.

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:36.764 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tragedy.

00:29:36.764 --> 00:29:38.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: So I got this,
and it's a beautiful piece,

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:42.350 align:middle line:84%
but I thought, man,
is this cursed?

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:44.226 align:middle line:84%
Because it went down
with all these people.

00:29:44.226 --> 00:29:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, you would
think it was cursed.

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.250 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: And then people who
tried to rescue the shipwreck,

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:51.800 align:middle line:84%
they also had
tragedy and deaths.

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized, you know,
there's a difference, though.

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:58.580 align:middle line:84%
All those people who died
were going and looking

00:29:58.580 --> 00:29:59.840 align:middle line:90%
for the treasure.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.100 align:middle line:90%
They had that money lust.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:06.560 align:middle line:84%
This was a gift that just
appeared freely in my hand,

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:09.590 align:middle line:84%
and there's a big
difference in, like you

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:11.929 align:middle line:84%
say, having a greedy
mindset or just having--

00:30:11.929 --> 00:30:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or something powerful.

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: --an
acceptive mindset.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:15.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:17.254 align:middle line:84%
Let's look more at
how you use symbols.

00:30:17.254 --> 00:30:18.054 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:18.054 --> 00:30:21.018 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:21.018 --> 00:30:34.356 align:middle line:90%


00:30:34.356 --> 00:30:35.870 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:37.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, that seems to
be a better picture

00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:39.640 align:middle line:90%
of the first one we saw.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.020 align:middle line:90%
It looked like the same symbol.

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:41.920 align:middle line:90%
Was it?

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, it
varies actually,

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:47.740 align:middle line:84%
because I have this giant
range of tones that I can play

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:50.380 align:middle line:84%
and many different messages
that I can insert into them.

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.690 align:middle line:90%
And what I found was that--

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:58.360 align:middle line:84%
what we just saw there was
water and just plain white light

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.240 align:middle line:84%
taking on various
forms and shapes.

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.706 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: But then
when I start changing

00:31:02.706 --> 00:31:04.690 align:middle line:84%
the way I'm viewing
it, and I view it

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:08.170 align:middle line:84%
under infrared light and
ultraviolet light and laser

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:10.810 align:middle line:84%
light, different
features of the symbol

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:13.780 align:middle line:84%
appear that would
otherwise be somewhat

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:15.820 align:middle line:90%
invisible to the naked eye.

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:18.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does the
music, the frequency,

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.660 align:middle line:90%
have anything to do with this?

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Oh, yeah.

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:22.020 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:23.394 align:middle line:84%
Well, what you
find is that there

00:31:23.394 --> 00:31:27.430 align:middle line:84%
is a relationship between the
type of speaker that you're

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:31.810 align:middle line:84%
using, the size of the
container, the amount of water,

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:33.790 align:middle line:84%
the density of the
water-- for example,

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:36.810 align:middle line:84%
I've experimented with both
salt water and fresh water.

00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Salt water
works better, doesn't it?

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Well, it just depends.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I thought.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: It's different.

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:42.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's more conductive.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, but
it's also more dense.

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And so it's definitely
a lot more conductive

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:48.880 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to electricity.

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: But what
you find is that it's

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:56.860 align:middle line:84%
a matter of tuning the special
relationship between all

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:58.060 align:middle line:90%
the parts.

00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:01.660 align:middle line:84%
So you might have one
tone, and you get nothing.

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And let's say you're playing
something like 2,000 hertz.

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:06.750 align:middle line:90%
You get nothing.

00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:11.500 align:middle line:84%
You bump it up to 2,100 hertz,
you get a big crazy symbol,

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:16.360 align:middle line:84%
and then you take it to
2,300, you get nothing again.

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:20.440 align:middle line:84%
It's a very particular
nuanced method.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I found that
getting this standardized

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:27.670 align:middle line:84%
is going to be a
challenge, because this is

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:29.884 align:middle line:90%
a brand new field of research.

00:32:29.884 --> 00:32:30.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It really is.

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And nobody else is
really pioneering this.

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: You have people out
there who are creating patterns

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:40.150 align:middle line:84%
using cymatics, but I don't know
if anybody else is doing what

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:42.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing, which is
taking this technology

00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:47.280 align:middle line:84%
and applying it to sigils
and magic and paranormal.

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And day-to-day life.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:49.800 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Exactly.

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.730 align:middle line:90%
Manifestation, it's like--

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:55.120 align:middle line:84%
I hate it when people
think that manifestation

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.830 align:middle line:84%
has to be applied to
just the spooky things--

00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:58.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:00.255 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Just the
ghosts and the UFOs.

00:33:00.255 --> 00:33:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can people
watching this program

00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:06.160 align:middle line:84%
apply these symbols
for their own lifestyle

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:08.170 align:middle line:90%
and beneficial lifestyle?

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:11.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, it's
easy to attain a sigil.

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:13.177 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do
is go to my website.

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:42.930 align:middle line:90%
but technically I guess I am.

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:44.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You could be.

00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:45.400 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: In a moderate way.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You put on good spells.

>>WARREN: Yeah.

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, I believe anything
you try to project out there

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.620 align:middle line:90%
is going to come back to you.

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:56.860 align:middle line:84%
But if you get one of these
sigils, all you have to do

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.390 align:middle line:90%
is print it out.

00:33:58.390 --> 00:33:59.236 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:33:59.236 --> 00:34:00.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Put it

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:03.310 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see it
at least four or five

00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:04.352 align:middle line:90%
times throughout the day.

00:34:04.352 --> 00:34:05.151 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:34:05.151 --> 00:34:06.370 align:middle line:90%
Do you say anything to it?

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:07.390 align:middle line:90%
Do you sing to it?

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:08.586 align:middle line:90%
Do you hum?

00:34:08.586 --> 00:34:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: You could,
but I don't do anything.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.830 align:middle line:90%
I just look at it.

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:14.409 align:middle line:84%
Also, you can just keep
it on a digital device,

00:34:14.409 --> 00:34:16.400 align:middle line:90%
like keep it on your cell phone.

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:17.420 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't necessarily
have to be printed out--

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:18.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could you just
put it in your pocket too?

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.320 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Put it in your pocket.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.659 align:middle line:84%
In my pocket, I
usually keep one.

00:34:22.659 --> 00:34:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And so by simply
staring at it, I

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:31.409 align:middle line:84%
believe that it changes
the brain waves.

00:34:31.409 --> 00:34:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we kind of
do a reverse engineered

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.530 align:middle line:84%
with the symbols and
turn it into some kind

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:38.230 align:middle line:90%
of modern symbolism for us?

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:40.570 align:middle line:90%
And then what would that do?

00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:42.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: That's one
of my next projects.

00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:44.199 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
going to be the one.

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: I hope so,
because imagine this--

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.179 align:middle line:84%
when Thomas Edison
created his phonograph,

00:34:52.179 --> 00:34:55.389 align:middle line:84%
he essentially had
a horn, a funnel.

00:34:55.389 --> 00:35:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And he would speak into
it, and that vibration

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:02.960 align:middle line:84%
would be magnified
by a little needle.

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:03.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Etched.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: And yeah, it would
etch a groove into a wax

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.890 align:middle line:90%
cylinder that was spinning.

00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And then if you took
that wax cylinder,

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:14.900 align:middle line:84%
and you handed that to somebody,
and said, what is this?

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:16.120 align:middle line:90%
Well, I don't know.

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.610 align:middle line:84%
They had no clue
what they're holding.

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:21.400 align:middle line:84%
But you take that wax
cylinder and you put it back

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.460 align:middle line:84%
into that system,
and you reverse it,

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:28.090 align:middle line:84%
so that now the needle
picks up the grooves,

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:32.080 align:middle line:84%
sound magically comes out of
the funnel, out of the horn.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's magic.

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: This is exactly
the same kind of thing

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:39.770 align:middle line:84%
that I believe we might be
able to do with these sigils.

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:42.350 align:middle line:84%
If in my para-cymatics
research I'm

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:46.340 align:middle line:84%
able to take these
vibrations, these tones,

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:49.340 align:middle line:84%
and understand how they
turn into different types

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:54.290 align:middle line:84%
of symbols, I should be able
to take some of these symbols

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:59.090 align:middle line:84%
all throughout history
and somehow energize them

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:05.570 align:middle line:84%
so that we can pick up the tone
or the energy form from them

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:11.150 align:middle line:84%
and be exposed to whatever
that language or mental energy

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:15.500 align:middle line:84%
was that was put into them,
literally back engineering

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:19.190 align:middle line:84%
these symbols just as we
would back engineer a wax

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:22.730 align:middle line:90%
cylinder in Edison's day.

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have made reference
to Robert the Haunted Doll.

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Yeah.

00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:28.166 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us
about this thing.

00:36:28.166 --> 00:36:29.780 align:middle line:84%
What is Robert the
Haunted Doll when

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:33.386 align:middle line:84%
he's down in Homestead,
Florida in a glass case?

00:36:33.386 --> 00:36:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Robert
the Haunted Doll

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:40.090 align:middle line:84%
is the most infamous of
the creepy haunted dolls

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:40.890 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ever made.

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:42.660 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Yeah.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:45.130 align:middle line:84%
He's well over
100 years old now.

00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:45.930 align:middle line:90%
He's quite large.

00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:47.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Made by a family?

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, the
story in Key West,

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Florida goes that there
was a wealthy family that

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.580 align:middle line:90%
had a little boy named Robert.

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:59.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: And they also had
a servant from the islands,

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:01.740 align:middle line:84%
and the servant became
disgruntled with the family.

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing you know,
she's presenting the little boy

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:08.770 align:middle line:84%
Robert with, at that
time, a life-size doll--

00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:09.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: --that she
also called Robert.

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:16.620 align:middle line:84%
So to prevent confusion, they
started calling the little boy

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:18.019 align:middle line:90%
Eugene or Gene.

00:37:18.019 --> 00:37:19.060 align:middle line:90%
That was his middle name.

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:20.420 align:middle line:90%
And they called the doll Robert.

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:24.560 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: The little boy
became obsessed with this doll.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:25.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was his buddy.

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:27.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: All
throughout his life.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:28.737 align:middle line:90%
When he became a grown man--

00:37:28.737 --> 00:37:29.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He kept the doll.

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Yeah.

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:32.220 align:middle line:84%
His wife didn't like it,
because he spent more time

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:33.750 align:middle line:90%
with the doll than the wife.

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:36.990 align:middle line:84%
He had a little room made with
little furniture for the doll.

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:38.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he's dressed up.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:38.890 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Oh, yeah.

00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:40.140 align:middle line:90%
He looks like a little sailor.

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:41.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A little sailor boy.

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: And in fact,
sometimes, his wife

00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:47.680 align:middle line:84%
would appear in
town with bruises.

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And people would
go to him and say--

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:50.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bruises?

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: --are you
beating your wife?

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh boy.

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:55.500 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: And he would
say, Robert did it.

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:56.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh.

00:37:56.650 --> 00:38:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: And so the
doll took on this rather

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:04.060 align:middle line:90%
sinister reputation.

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:07.660 align:middle line:84%
After he died, and the
wife sold the house,

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:08.997 align:middle line:90%
she left the doll in the house.

00:38:08.997 --> 00:38:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just left it upstairs--

00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:10.900 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: She left it--

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:11.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --in the attic, right?

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:12.910 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: In the attic.

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:15.430 align:middle line:84%
For years, people claimed they
would see that doll running

00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:16.840 align:middle line:90%
around the house.

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, when the house was
sold, residents of the house

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:23.320 align:middle line:84%
said the doll would come
to life and run around.

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:25.810 align:middle line:84%
A little girl claimed that
he strangled her one night.

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:27.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So he was
like a demonic doll?

00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, some
people viewed him that way.

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:32.340 align:middle line:84%
You'll never catch me
saying that, George.

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:33.140 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you that.

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:34.869 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He strangled
someone and you

00:38:34.869 --> 00:38:35.910 align:middle line:90%
don't think he's demonic?

00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:38.415 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: If you say bad
things about Robert the Doll,

00:38:38.415 --> 00:38:40.540 align:middle line:84%
guess what could come
crawling through your window?

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what could
you say good about him,

00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:42.395 align:middle line:84%
if he strangled
some little girl?

00:38:42.395 --> 00:38:44.894 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, I'm not going
to say anything bad about him.

00:38:44.894 --> 00:38:46.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or bruised a woman?

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, I
met him, though.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.020 align:middle line:84%
I was the only
person in the museum

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:52.640 align:middle line:84%
aside from the lady
at the front desk.

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:55.030 align:middle line:90%
I walked into that room.

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:57.850 align:middle line:84%
The walls are covered
with hundreds of letters

00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:00.550 align:middle line:84%
from people all over the
place begging forgiveness,

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:03.480 align:middle line:84%
because they visited him
and were disrespectful,

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:06.410 align:middle line:84%
or they took a picture
without asking for permission.

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:07.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He doesn't like that.

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:08.980 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: No.

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:11.492 align:middle line:84%
So I walked in,
and I tell you, he

00:39:11.492 --> 00:39:13.450 align:middle line:84%
looked like a little man
sitting there, George.

00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:15.094 align:middle line:90%
He didn't look like a doll.

00:39:15.094 --> 00:39:16.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he's
in a glass case.

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:18.520 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: He was
in a glass case.

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:20.380 align:middle line:90%
He's sitting in a rocking chair.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And I swear to you when
I first saw his face,

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:26.450 align:middle line:84%
it looked to me
like he's very cold.

00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: And I stopped,
and I said, Robert, my name

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:32.600 align:middle line:90%
is Joshua P. Warren.

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:36.130 align:middle line:84%
I have traveled a long way to
get to know you, to study you,

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:39.730 align:middle line:84%
and to do a report on you
that will be heard by millions

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:41.360 align:middle line:90%
of people, blah blah blah.

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm asking
for your permission,

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.800 align:middle line:84%
and I tell you, at
that point, maybe it

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:50.200 align:middle line:84%
was just my imagination, but
it looked to me like his face

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.460 align:middle line:90%
softened into a little smile.

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:53.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:54.250 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Yep.

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did his eyes
seem to follow you?

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:59.770 align:middle line:84%
I think everybody can
say they experience

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:06.070 align:middle line:84%
that he has these little beady
black eyes, kind of dull,

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:08.590 align:middle line:90%
but there's no doubt about it.

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:09.880 align:middle line:90%
He's a creepy looking guy.

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:12.460 align:middle line:84%
But the funny thing is,
when I went down there,

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:15.820 align:middle line:84%
they told me that that
glass case around him

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:18.660 align:middle line:84%
had not been removed in
years, four or five years.

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:19.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.313 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: They had a
couple of guys come out

00:40:21.313 --> 00:40:22.720 align:middle line:90%
with suction cups.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:25.270 align:middle line:84%
They lifted this big
heavy glass case off.

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:32.270 align:middle line:84%
I knew that UV light does not
pass through glass very well.

00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And I shine the UV light
on him, and this symbol

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:40.102 align:middle line:90%
appears on his sleeve.

00:40:40.102 --> 00:40:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What kind of symbol?

00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:44.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: It looked like a
little distorted snowflake.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.350 align:middle line:84%
now, this was invisible
to the naked eye.

00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:49.170 align:middle line:84%
If I didn't have the UV light
on it, you would never know.

00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
significance of the symbol?

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.406 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Well, I went back.

00:40:52.406 --> 00:40:55.650 align:middle line:10%
This is what got me into
symbols and sigils and all this.

00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:58.320 align:middle line:10%
I was talking to you
about it on the air.

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:01.920 align:middle line:10%
And a caller called
in and said, this

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:05.440 align:middle line:10%
sounds like it might come
from this ancient grimoire.

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:06.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mhm.

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.614 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: And I
started studying.

00:41:07.614 --> 00:41:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, I
found a book that's

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:11.100 align:middle line:84%
at least hundreds
of years old that

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:15.070 align:middle line:84%
has symbols that different
types of magicians would use--

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:15.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Magical.

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:19.590 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: --in their magic
rituals for thousands of years.

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And there is that symbol in that
book or something close to it.

00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:25.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
it say next to it?

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:27.300 align:middle line:90%
It's used for--

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: It is used for
animating inanimate objects.

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So when people
talked about seeing Robert

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:38.940 align:middle line:90%
scurrying behind a window.

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:42.957 align:middle line:84%
You see that look, ch-ch-ch,
could have been him.

00:41:42.957 --> 00:41:44.790 align:middle line:84%
We've got to get you
back on "Beyond Belief"

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:47.079 align:middle line:84%
and talk about ghosts
and poltergeists.

00:41:47.079 --> 00:41:48.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Sounds perfect.

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:49.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's something
going on in that area.

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:51.390 align:middle line:10%
