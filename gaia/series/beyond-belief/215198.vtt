00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well, welcome,
my friends, to Beyond Belief.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.340 align:middle line:10%
Jerry Sargeant back with
us, a world-renowned healer

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.400 align:middle line:10%
who founded Star Magic
Healing back in 2016.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, he teaches a
groundbreaking approach

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.410 align:middle line:84%
that merges quantum physics
and visualization to manifest

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.280 align:middle line:90%
profound transformation.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.840 align:middle line:90%
Jerry, good to see you again.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>>JERRY SARGEANT: It's
great to be back, brother.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:41.790 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Came in all the
way from London, huh?

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:43.895 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: Absolutely.

00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long
is that flight?

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: I think
it's about eight hours.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, eight hours.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you wish
you could teleport?

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: I wish
I could teleport.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.550 align:middle line:90%
Won't be long.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Last time
you were here,

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.810 align:middle line:84%
you told us an amazing
story of your life of crime

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.690 align:middle line:90%
and debauchery.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.664 align:middle line:84%
Let's cover it again just
for people who are brand new.

00:01:05.664 --> 00:01:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Yeah, I mean, I used
to have a very different life

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.600 align:middle line:90%
from the one that I live now.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.330 align:middle line:10%
Used to smuggle drugs, involved
in lots of high-level bank

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.800 align:middle line:10%
fraud, guns, all sorts
of unsavory activities.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.890 align:middle line:10%
And I did that for a number of
years, was very happy doing it,

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:23.900 align:middle line:10%
earning lots of money.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.250 align:middle line:10%
Really didn't think that
it would ever change.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And then I was
involved in a car crash

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.880 align:middle line:84%
back in 2004, where
the taxi that I

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.010 align:middle line:84%
was in with my family,
ex-wife and two children,

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.900 align:middle line:90%
it ran three ladies over.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.880 align:middle line:84%
First one came through
the windscreen,

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.550 align:middle line:84%
smashed me in the face, got
flipped over the car and died.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.220 align:middle line:84%
Second one had her
ankles cut off,

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.750 align:middle line:84%
and the third one
was physically OK.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.250 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know any of this had
happened because I was asleep.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.910 align:middle line:90%
I just woke up.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:48.868 align:middle line:90%
There was a loud crash.

00:01:48.868 --> 00:01:52.020 align:middle line:84%
There was glass, wind, cars
swaying from side to side.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.650 align:middle line:84%
Got out of the taxi when it had
stopped, checked on the kids

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.450 align:middle line:90%
and stuff.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.960 align:middle line:90%
Everyone was OK.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Saw the lady with her ankles cut
off about 30 meters up the road.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.420 align:middle line:84%
The other lady-- both
of them were screaming.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.490 align:middle line:84%
A guy had come out
from a nearby factory.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.600 align:middle line:90%
I just walked past them.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.100 align:middle line:84%
I thought, there's
nothing I can do.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And I saw about 150
meters back up the road

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.110 align:middle line:90%
what looked like a dead body.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And I get closer and closer
and realize it's a dead body.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.350 align:middle line:84%
Get within about 10 meters
and see this lady soul

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.650 align:middle line:90%
hovering above her body.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.420 align:middle line:90%
And this was what woke me up.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.070 align:middle line:90%
I got closer and closer.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.880 align:middle line:84%
By the time I got to her body,
looked down over her body,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.945 align:middle line:90%
it was smashed to pieces.

00:02:27.945 --> 00:02:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Her legs were wrapped
up over her head,

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.250 align:middle line:84%
and this soul just fizzled
off into the ether.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And I saw the connection
and the disconnection.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.070 align:middle line:84%
There's something else
inside this physical form

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.400 align:middle line:90%
that isn't physical.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.830 align:middle line:90%
And I saw it with my eyes.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.330 align:middle line:84%
Not with my mind's
eye, with my own eyes.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And you can't really
unsee something like that.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And that was the catalyst
that got me kind of searching.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jerry, prior
to the accident,

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.590 align:middle line:84%
you had never seen a soul
hovering over a body before?

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: I'd never had any
kind of spiritual experiences,

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.910 align:middle line:90%
nothing at all.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.070 align:middle line:84%
I thought this stuff
was mumbo jumbo.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.970 align:middle line:84%
I thought people like
me were nuts and crazy,

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.090 align:middle line:90%
yeah, talking about--

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.040 align:middle line:90%
I mean, if I'd have--

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.200 align:middle line:84%
I would have never watched
a show like this years ago.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.760 align:middle line:84%
I just wouldn't
have entertained it.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.517 align:middle line:90%
It was just way out of my field.

00:03:10.517 --> 00:03:12.475 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: , Now it's one
of the first you watch.

00:03:12.475 --> 00:03:14.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: Now, it's all I do.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.140 align:middle line:84%
Energy healing,
meditation, stuff

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.645 align:middle line:84%
that you guys talk about here on
Gaia TV all the time is my life

00:03:21.645 --> 00:03:22.445 align:middle line:90%
is what I live for.

00:03:22.445 --> 00:03:27.912 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Without that car crash,
what would you have missed?

00:03:27.912 --> 00:03:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: What
would I have missed?

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely the best
moments of my life.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Coming
onto this path

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.460 align:middle line:84%
and getting the opportunity to
work with hundreds and thousands

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.190 align:middle line:84%
and millions of people
all over the world,

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.090 align:middle line:84%
watching people get
up from wheelchairs,

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.780 align:middle line:84%
watching people take their
hearing aids out that were deaf,

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.180 align:middle line:84%
watching people that were
blind get their eyesight back,

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.160 align:middle line:84%
watching people
with brain tumors,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.560 align:middle line:84%
watching the brain
tumors disappear,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.680 align:middle line:84%
seeing people get empowered
and get their life back,

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.428 align:middle line:90%
you can't beat that.

00:04:00.428 --> 00:04:02.220 align:middle line:84%
I would have missed
out on so much of that.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How quickly,
Jerry, do you

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.995 align:middle line:84%
see the transformation
in these people?

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Well, sometimes
it can be straight away.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.280 align:middle line:84%
I remember last time we
had the conversation,

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.700 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about our
American tour and people

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.090 align:middle line:90%
getting up out of wheelchairs.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.339 align:middle line:84%
We had two people get
up out of wheelchairs.

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:21.680 align:middle line:84%
We had a lady two weeks ago in
our group, Healing in London.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.490 align:middle line:84%
She was on a Zimmer
frame, couldn't walk.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.890 align:middle line:90%
She needed a Zimmer frame.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.330 align:middle line:84%
She chucked the
Zimmer frame away

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.780 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the group healing.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.630 align:middle line:84%
That's within two days, 48
hours, that kind of transition

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:33.720 align:middle line:90%
is taking place.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it can be
a little bit longer,

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.740 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes it's immediate.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.040 align:middle line:84%
It's just about
retemplating someone,

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.268 align:middle line:84%
recoding them to their original
kind of mathematical formula,

00:04:43.268 --> 00:04:44.810 align:middle line:84%
because we're
mathematics underneath.

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.710 align:middle line:84%
We're energy, light,
frequency, sound.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.260 align:middle line:84%
So once you plug people back
into their original mathematical

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.425 align:middle line:84%
sequence, then boom, the
healing just takes place.

00:04:53.425 --> 00:04:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were telling
us about your life of crime.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.120 align:middle line:90%
But you made a deal.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.230 align:middle line:90%
You made a pact.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.170 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:05.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Yeah, I
had to go to court.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.575 align:middle line:90%
I moved to New Zealand.

00:05:06.575 --> 00:05:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And when I moved back
from New Zealand,

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.900 align:middle line:84%
I went to the passport
office to renew my passport.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And I got arrested
for conspiracy

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.380 align:middle line:84%
to defraud the Bank of Scotland
and holding a false passport.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.445 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I was looking
at 10 years in prison.

00:05:19.445 --> 00:05:20.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my God.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.012 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: And when I went to
court, I said to the universe,

00:05:23.012 --> 00:05:26.290 align:middle line:84%
listen, if you get me off this
court case, then I promise you,

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.960 align:middle line:90%
then I'll devote my life to--

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.917 align:middle line:84%
or dedicate my
life to Star Magic

00:05:29.917 --> 00:05:32.250 align:middle line:84%
and do this healing stuff
that you really want me to do,

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.520 align:middle line:84%
because they've been priming me
since 2004 all the way through.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking at
this court case in 2014,

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.820 align:middle line:90%
so a lot had happened.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.050 align:middle line:90%
So I went to court.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.470 align:middle line:84%
The judge walked in with
the two accomplices.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And the one on his right, my
left, she had wings on her back.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And she winked at me, and
I could see her wings.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to myself,
I'm going to get off this.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.710 align:middle line:84%
But my ego was like, nah,
you're never going to get off.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.020 align:middle line:84%
The prosecution gave
their side of the story,

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.290 align:middle line:90%
made me out to look terrible.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.280 align:middle line:84%
My solicitor gave our
side of the story.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.220 align:middle line:84%
They went out and deliberated,
came back 40 minutes later,

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.300 align:middle line:84%
asked me to stand and just
said, you're a changed man.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.790 align:middle line:84%
We're going to give you a
one-year conditional discharge

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.120 align:middle line:90%
and an 80-pounds court fee.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.930 align:middle line:90%
You're free to go.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that point, I
knew I had to do Star Magic.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:21.385 align:middle line:84%
So within a year and a half,
2016, yeah, we kicked it off.

00:06:21.385 --> 00:06:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nobody gets
leniency like that.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.390 align:middle line:90%
That's an amazing story.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.822 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: I had a mission.

00:06:27.822 --> 00:06:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think there were
other beings looking out

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.100 align:middle line:84%
for me to make sure that
I didn't go to prison,

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.180 align:middle line:90%
and I stayed the course.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.555 align:middle line:84%
When I look back at my life
now, all the way back through

00:06:35.555 --> 00:06:37.230 align:middle line:84%
my teenage years, my
childhood, my 20s,

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.630 align:middle line:84%
there were so many things
that could have gone wrong.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.300 align:middle line:84%
I should really be dead or in
prison somewhere along the line,

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.100 align:middle line:90%
but I'm not.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And I feel it's because I had
to be sat in this chair with you

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.900 align:middle line:84%
right now, fulfilling
this mission

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.540 align:middle line:84%
and helping all these people
heal, transform, elevate,

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.043 align:middle line:84%
doing the grid work that
we do, and just help

00:06:54.043 --> 00:06:55.210 align:middle line:90%
with this ascension process.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What compelled you
to start Star Magic Healing?

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Well,
I was being shown

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.330 align:middle line:90%
all of these healing tools.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.310 align:middle line:84%
I spent time in ancient
mystery schools.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.680 align:middle line:84%
I met my Lyran and family
when I was in New Zealand.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.020 align:middle line:84%
They took me in a spacecraft
to Alpha Centauri,

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.460 align:middle line:90%
got all these codes.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And I went to these mystery
schools in my meditation

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:15.950 align:middle line:90%
with my son.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.758 align:middle line:84%
And I was being shown
how to use the codes.

00:07:17.758 --> 00:07:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And then people started
coming into my life

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:20.383 align:middle line:90%
that needed healing.

00:07:20.383 --> 00:07:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying it
and it was working.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.250 align:middle line:90%
So I started Star Magic in 2016.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.483 align:middle line:84%
And then shortly afterwards,
the same blue beings,

00:07:29.483 --> 00:07:31.400 align:middle line:84%
the Lyrans that came to
pick me up and take me

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.428 align:middle line:84%
to Alpha Centauri, they told
me to build healing centers.

00:07:34.428 --> 00:07:36.470 align:middle line:84%
So we're in the process
of building our first one

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:37.950 align:middle line:90%
in Transylvania at the moment.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.910 align:middle line:84%
So I've just been a little
bit like a robot, really,

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.392 align:middle line:84%
just following
instructions, just

00:07:42.392 --> 00:07:44.850 align:middle line:84%
doing what I needed to do to
make the world a better place.

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:46.467 align:middle line:84%
And everything that
these Lyrans have

00:07:46.467 --> 00:07:48.925 align:middle line:84%
been telling me is going to
happen has just been happening.

00:07:48.925 --> 00:07:52.595 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, Transylvania is
the home of Dracula, isn't it?

00:07:52.595 --> 00:07:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: I was speaking
to Rob, who brought me here

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.562 align:middle line:84%
in the car, and we were
talking about Transylvania.

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:01.020 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
think Transylvania.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.920 align:middle line:84%
They just associate it
with Count Dracula and some

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.220 align:middle line:90%
of these negative connotations.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.470 align:middle line:90%
But Romania is an amazing place.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:10.320 align:middle line:84%
If you go back thousands
and thousands of years,

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.500 align:middle line:84%
there were three
main crystal pillars

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.358 align:middle line:84%
that kind of operated a lot of
the frequency on the planet.

00:08:15.358 --> 00:08:16.650 align:middle line:90%
And one of them was in Romania.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:17.370 align:middle line:90%
One was in America.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:18.180 align:middle line:90%
One was in India.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And they got destroyed
through wars,

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.600 align:middle line:84%
but they're coming
back online now.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.413 align:middle line:84%
And Romania is becoming--
it's an incredible place.

00:08:24.413 --> 00:08:25.830 align:middle line:84%
The energy is off
the chart there.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I mean, I love it there.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:29.935 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, how many healing
centers do you plan to build.

00:08:29.935 --> 00:08:30.735 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: 13.

00:08:30.735 --> 00:08:34.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why that number?

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: There are 13
constellations in our Zodiac.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.100 align:middle line:84%
There are 13 transmission
centers or multi-dimensional

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.370 align:middle line:90%
chakras in our body.

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:45.090 align:middle line:84%
There are 13 points on our
multi-dimensional Merkaba field.

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:49.970 align:middle line:84%
The number 13 is
so mission critical

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.650 align:middle line:84%
when you talk about
ascension, when

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:54.780 align:middle line:84%
you talk about birthing
humans onto this planet.

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.670 align:middle line:84%
When you talk about
exiting this matrix,

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.860 align:middle line:84%
the number 13 comes in
left, right, and center.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.300 align:middle line:84%
There are also 13 body parts
that link to the 13 star

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.330 align:middle line:90%
constellations.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, the first healing
center that we're building

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.780 align:middle line:90%
is called Ophiuchus.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And Ophiuchus links to
the human nervous system.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.570 align:middle line:84%
So the first healing
center is going

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:13.548 align:middle line:84%
to be the backbone and
the nervous system,

00:09:13.548 --> 00:09:15.090 align:middle line:84%
which connects to
all the body parts.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.460 align:middle line:84%
Without the nervous system,
the human body is no good.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.825 align:middle line:84%
So that's the piece that
we're putting down first.

00:09:19.825 --> 00:09:22.075 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who is compelling
you to build these centers?

00:09:22.075 --> 00:09:23.716 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: The Lyrans.

00:09:23.716 --> 00:09:25.255 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they assisting you?

00:09:25.255 --> 00:09:26.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: 100%.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.280 align:middle line:90%
We've got a portal on the land.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And they open and close it
and come through sometimes.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.020 align:middle line:90%
And we have these--

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.070 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember who I
was talking to about it.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:36.980 align:middle line:90%
It was someone this morning.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.500 align:middle line:84%
We've seen these
crazy insects that you

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:40.740 align:middle line:90%
don't get on this planet.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.160 align:middle line:84%
They're these big, hairy
kind of caterpillars

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.920 align:middle line:90%
that are huge, massive.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.860 align:middle line:84%
When the portal opens, some
of these things come through.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.210 align:middle line:90%
My girlfriend was there one day.

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And she was kind of sunbathing
near where the portal is,

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.370 align:middle line:84%
and it opened up and
these beings came through.

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And she got her phone out
and started videoing them.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.250 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, they walked back through
the portal, looked at her.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And they did something, and her
phone just completely just wiped

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.430 align:middle line:90%
out, a brand new phone.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:06.290 align:middle line:84%
They just blocked
it because they

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:07.590 align:middle line:90%
didn't want us to show anyone.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:10.970 align:middle line:84%
We were there one day, and
they came through the portal.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And they were doing
some electrical work.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm not exactly sure
what they were doing,

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:16.950 align:middle line:84%
but they've been reformatting
the grids under our land,

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.270 align:middle line:90%
ready for this healing center.

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.440 align:middle line:90%
And they burnt one of the trees.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.240 align:middle line:90%
It caught on fire.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.580 align:middle line:84%
There was all these
electric blue flames

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:23.480 align:middle line:90%
coming out of the top of the--

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: So we
said, listen, guys,

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:27.693 align:middle line:84%
we can't really call
the fire brigade

00:10:27.693 --> 00:10:30.360 align:middle line:84%
and put this out because there's
all these electric blue flames.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.277 align:middle line:84%
They're going to think
something's suspicious.

00:10:32.277 --> 00:10:33.120 align:middle line:90%
Please put it out.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:33.920 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.770 align:middle line:84%
They ended up putting the
fire out and discharging it.

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jerry, of these 13
centers you plan to build,

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.437 align:middle line:84%
where are you going
to build them?

00:10:40.437 --> 00:10:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: So we're
going to build them

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:44.550 align:middle line:84%
on different points of the
Christ Consciousness Grid,

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.130 align:middle line:90%
so, Maria, Egypt.

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:47.630 align:middle line:84%
The one we're
building at the moment

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.680 align:middle line:90%
is in Transylvania in Romania.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.380 align:middle line:84%
We've already bought
land in the UK-

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All over the planet.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:52.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: Portugal.

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:53.830 align:middle line:90%
All over the place.

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:55.728 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, very strategic locations.

00:10:55.728 --> 00:10:56.645 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, here in America.

00:10:56.645 --> 00:10:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you going to
be at some of these spots?

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: I'm going to
travel to all of them.

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:05.580 align:middle line:84%
We've trained thousands of
people so far in like 70-plus

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.507 align:middle line:84%
countries to work
in these healing,

00:11:07.507 --> 00:11:09.340 align:middle line:84%
healing centers once
they're up and running.

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.280 align:middle line:84%
So I will be going
around and overseeing it

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:16.450 align:middle line:84%
and running workshops, medicine
retreats, trainings, all sorts,

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.220 align:middle line:90%
but alongside the facilitators.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.555 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who will attend
the healing centers?

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: People from all over
the world, men, women, children,

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.960 align:middle line:90%
whoever.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.450 align:middle line:84%
When we start them out,
20% of everything we do

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:31.510 align:middle line:90%
is going to be free.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:33.125 align:middle line:90%
So people have got no money--

00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:33.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:34.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Yeah, we're
going to give away--

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.390 align:middle line:84%
every training will
have 20% allocated

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:39.520 align:middle line:84%
for free spots, every meditation
group, everything that we do.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so we can give back.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, we'll shift
that maybe 70/30, 60/40.

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:50.218 align:middle line:84%
And just keep working it
until we can be given back--

00:11:50.218 --> 00:11:52.010 align:middle line:84%
doing energy exchanges
as much as possible.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is an
eternal membership?

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: So what we're
doing with these healing

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.660 align:middle line:84%
centers is we're selling
memberships to people.

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:07.210 align:middle line:84%
So you can buy one week in the
healing center for 44,000 euros.

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be able to
go there for eternity.

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.420 align:middle line:84%
So every year you
pick a week, and you

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:15.880 align:middle line:84%
go-- you can drink medicine,
training, horse healing,

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.340 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to do
there with your girlfriend,

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:19.360 align:middle line:90%
with your family.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And when you pass
back to spirit,

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.660 align:middle line:84%
it gets passed through
a trust to your children

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.080 align:middle line:90%
and the children's children.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.750 align:middle line:84%
So it actually stays in
your family for eternity.

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.985 align:middle line:84%
Instead of buying life
insurance and that money

00:12:30.985 --> 00:12:32.610 align:middle line:84%
going down the drain,
you're better off

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:33.990 align:middle line:84%
paying for something
like this and having it

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:35.200 align:middle line:90%
in your family forever.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.990 align:middle line:84%
People can stay plugged
in, tuned in, in alignment,

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:40.005 align:middle line:90%
their frequency really high.

00:12:40.005 --> 00:12:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Cosmic
grandfathers, what are they?

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:44.180 align:middle line:90%
Who are they?

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: So in
June this year,

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:50.740 align:middle line:84%
I was contacted by this
cosmic grandfather.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.970 align:middle line:90%
His name was Mauro.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And he took me up
to what they call

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:55.270 align:middle line:90%
the realm of the grandfathers.

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:56.920 align:middle line:90%
And there was eight of them.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And each of these
cosmic grandfathers

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.960 align:middle line:90%
represents a multiverse.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.960 align:middle line:84%
So if you imagine the frequency
that's in each of these beings--

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I came
face to face with them,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.360 align:middle line:84%
each one of their
heads is like a car.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.170 align:middle line:90%
They're massive.

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:12.610 align:middle line:90%
They're like 70-foot tall.

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:13.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Their faces are kind
of a bluey-purpley electric blue

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:18.790 align:middle line:90%
with diamond and crystal white.

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:19.720 align:middle line:90%
They got long hair.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.160 align:middle line:84%
They got long
beards like wizards,

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.330 align:middle line:84%
but they're just extremely
friendly, extremely wise.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And what they were
showing me was how men

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.740 align:middle line:90%
needed to be on planet Earth.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:36.180 align:middle line:84%
They were explaining to me that
the father isn't mature enough

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:39.010 align:middle line:84%
to support the mother,
but the grandfather is.

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:41.920 align:middle line:84%
So they were teaching me all of
these grandfather principles.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting
because exactly one

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:49.800 align:middle line:84%
month after they came to visit
me and took me up to space,

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.510 align:middle line:84%
I had a retreat starting
called Savage Man.

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And Savage Man was
all about bringing men

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:57.690 align:middle line:84%
into an environment where
we taught them mixed

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:01.150 align:middle line:84%
martial arts skills,
ice baths, exercise,

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:04.750 align:middle line:84%
all different tools to help
with their family environment,

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:07.570 align:middle line:84%
working with their wives,
girlfriends, children,

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:11.918 align:middle line:84%
that sort of thing, basically
turned them into the best

00:14:11.918 --> 00:14:14.460 align:middle line:84%
version of a divine masculine
we could in that period of time

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.488 align:middle line:90%
that they were with us.

00:14:15.488 --> 00:14:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And so they were teaching
us values that we

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.880 align:middle line:90%
had to share in that workshop.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.840 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that
they did is they told me

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.240 align:middle line:84%
that I had to go on
a bit of a mission.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And the mission was to go to
15 countries around the planet

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:30.947 align:middle line:90%
and bury crystals.

00:14:30.947 --> 00:14:32.280 align:middle line:90%
And they told me that I needed--

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.238 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bury crystals?

00:14:33.238 --> 00:14:34.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: Bury crystals, yeah.

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:38.220 align:middle line:84%
They told me that I needed to
get 15 two-pointed clear quartz

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:41.590 align:middle line:84%
crystals and 15
unakite crystals.

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:44.520 align:middle line:90%
They gave me the 15 crystals--

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:45.570 align:middle line:90%
the locations.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:46.950 align:middle line:90%
I bought, the crystals.

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:49.600 align:middle line:84%
I got a map of the world,
put the points on the map,

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.360 align:middle line:84%
drew them together, and it
formed a perfect dragon's wing.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.420 align:middle line:84%
So we had to go to
all these 15 countries

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:56.920 align:middle line:90%
end of July, all through August.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.800 align:middle line:84%
In four and a half weeks, we
did about 120,000 air miles,

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:03.190 align:middle line:84%
me and my girlfriend,
Cherie, our videographer,

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:05.820 align:middle line:84%
and just buried these crystals
in the ground and set up these

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.100 align:middle line:90%
new seventh dimensional grids.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How deep?

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:11.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: It
depended where we were.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:15.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sometimes we went down
sort of like a foot or so.

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Two of the crystals
in one location,

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:21.040 align:middle line:84%
we had to drop into a
lake, put into the water.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Yeah,
some of them-- we

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:27.000 align:middle line:84%
were climbing up like
hilltops, clifftops,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.575 align:middle line:84%
and hanging on for dear
life, digging holes and stuff

00:15:29.575 --> 00:15:31.325 align:middle line:84%
and burying them in
the side of mountains.

00:15:31.325 --> 00:15:32.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was nobody
following you, stealing

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:34.220 align:middle line:90%
the crystals after you left?

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:35.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: No, we made sure.

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:38.270 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we were completely on
our own everywhere we went.

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is your grid work,
and how did you get into that?

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: This is
an interesting story.

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:46.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, first of
all, grid work is--

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:48.640 align:middle line:84%
there are many people that do
grid work around the planet.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And there are many, many
grids on the planet.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Some of the grids are very
clean, and some of the grids

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:54.820 align:middle line:90%
are a little bit dirty.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:57.100 align:middle line:90%
And so some people clean grids.

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.110 align:middle line:90%
Some people lay new grids down.

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And the grids actually support
the development of and expansion

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:03.610 align:middle line:90%
of human consciousness.

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:05.200 align:middle line:84%
They support the
ascension process.

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.790 align:middle line:90%
There are grids.

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:09.182 align:middle line:84%
Mother Earth has ley
lines, dragon lines.

00:16:09.182 --> 00:16:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And energy moves
through these ley lines.

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:11.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All over.

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: All over the planet.

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And the new grids that
we were laying down

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:17.640 align:middle line:84%
were these new seventh
dimensional grids, which are not

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:18.890 align:middle line:90%
on planet Earth at the moment.

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:19.973 align:middle line:90%
These were the first ones.

00:16:19.973 --> 00:16:21.682 align:middle line:84%
And there's another
reason we built them,

00:16:21.682 --> 00:16:22.690 align:middle line:90%
which we can come on to.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.810 align:middle line:84%
How I got into grid work is
a really interesting story.

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:28.260 align:middle line:90%
I had a dream one night.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And in my dream, I was at
Cashel Castle in Ireland.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And in this dream, there
was a little blue plate.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I wake up
in the morning,

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.350 align:middle line:90%
and I go onto my laptop.

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And Amazon just pings
up from nowhere.

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And on Amazon, there's
this little blue plate.

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:47.850 align:middle line:90%
So I bought the blue plate.

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I had
to go to Ireland.

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:52.630 align:middle line:84%
So I got a flight to
Waterford, hired a car,

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:54.150 align:middle line:90%
drove up to Cashel Castle.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:56.520 align:middle line:90%
And Cashel Castle is on a hill.

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.780 align:middle line:90%
So I walked up into the castle.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:00.270 align:middle line:90%
It was a sunny day.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:03.161 align:middle line:84%
And I'm walking down this
corridor in the castle.

00:17:03.161 --> 00:17:04.619 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
kind of-- it looks

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:06.099 align:middle line:90%
like a man walking towards me.

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:07.060 align:middle line:90%
He's got a hood up.

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.363 align:middle line:84%
He was a big guy, well-built.
And as I get closer,

00:17:09.363 --> 00:17:11.530 align:middle line:84%
I look under his hood, and
I realize he's not human.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.200 align:middle line:84%
He was completely
white like a ghoul,

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.420 align:middle line:84%
like another being
from somewhere.

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.381 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, OK,
something's going on.

00:17:18.381 --> 00:17:20.339 align:middle line:84%
So I walked down this
passageway in the castle,

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:21.670 align:middle line:90%
and it was a dead end.

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And I got to the dead
end, walked back out.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:27.240 align:middle line:84%
I came back out onto this
grass, and it's on a hilltop,

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.450 align:middle line:90%
looking down over the fields.

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm stood there,
and this wave of energy,

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.930 align:middle line:84%
it comes across me,
knocks me off of my feet,

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.590 align:middle line:90%
and slams me into the floor.

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And then this big beam of light
comes down through my body,

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:39.490 align:middle line:90%
right down into the grids.

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And I see the grid line between
the Vatican and Cashel Castle

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:43.775 align:middle line:90%
is completely dark.

00:17:43.775 --> 00:17:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And there's all
these beings that

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:47.950 align:middle line:84%
are helping me work
through this grid.

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And they needed a physical
anchor in the space to do it,

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:51.370 align:middle line:90%
which was me.

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:53.287 align:middle line:84%
So all this light was
running through my body,

00:17:53.287 --> 00:17:56.070 align:middle line:84%
out through my body, and
the grid lines got cleared.

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.988 align:middle line:90%
I get up.

00:17:56.988 --> 00:17:58.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how long
I was down there for.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:17:59.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm really not sure.

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:02.070 align:middle line:84%
I get up, and I look
down into the field,

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.653 align:middle line:84%
and there's this little
baby calf all on its own.

00:18:04.653 --> 00:18:07.320 align:middle line:84%
There's no other baby-- there's
no other mom and dad cows around

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.200 align:middle line:90%
or anything.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.180 align:middle line:90%
So I go down the hill.

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:12.610 align:middle line:84%
I jump this fence,
and I'm in the field.

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And this baby calf is
running away from me.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:17.020 align:middle line:84%
So I start chasing this
baby calf through the field.

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And we're going down
this kind of hedge line.

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And I see the baby
calf turn right

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.880 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the hedge
line, and it disappears.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.170 align:middle line:90%
I carry on running.

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:27.770 align:middle line:84%
I get to the end
of the hedge line.

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:28.570 align:middle line:90%
I turn right.

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:30.040 align:middle line:90%
I look at this baby cow.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:34.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like 20 meters away from
me, and its hoof is on a rock.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.830 align:middle line:90%
It's just staring at me.

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:37.838 align:middle line:84%
So I walk up towards
the baby calf.

00:18:37.838 --> 00:18:39.130 align:middle line:90%
It takes its foot off the hoof.

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:42.400 align:middle line:84%
I picked up the rock, and
there was a hole in the ground

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.460 align:middle line:84%
exactly the same size
as the blue plate

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.850 align:middle line:90%
that I bought from Amazon.

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:49.255 align:middle line:84%
So I got the blue, plate,
put it in and buried it over.

00:18:49.255 --> 00:18:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And I just hearing this
voice in my head say,

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.510 align:middle line:90%
you can home now, Jerry.

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:55.180 align:middle line:84%
That was the first time I'd sort
of been on a grid work mission.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And I've been on bundles
of them ever since.

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.850 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting places, crazy.

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:01.433 align:middle line:84%
Some of them just
seem wacky and wild,

00:19:01.433 --> 00:19:03.142 align:middle line:84%
but you've just got
to trust the process.

00:19:03.142 --> 00:19:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
sent us a video

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.760 align:middle line:84%
about you mapping
out your journey.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.162 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:19:08.162 --> 00:19:08.962 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:08.962 --> 00:19:11.670 align:middle line:84%
- The cosmic
grandfathers instructed

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:15.780 align:middle line:84%
me to buy specific quartz
crystals and unakite eggs

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:19.590 align:middle line:90%
for 15 locations worldwide.

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:21.970 align:middle line:84%
After marking these
spots on a map,

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:25.620 align:middle line:84%
I discovered they
formed a dragon's wing.

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:29.410 align:middle line:84%
Over five weeks, we
traveled to these countries,

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:32.850 align:middle line:84%
burying the crystals and eggs
to create a dragon's wing

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:36.330 align:middle line:84%
grid, which is a part of
the new seventh dimensional

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:38.010 align:middle line:90%
architecture.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:41.700 align:middle line:84%
The grids are known
as the fusion grids.

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.550 align:middle line:84%
These grids hold the new
divine mother frequency

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.740 align:middle line:90%
coming to Earth.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:51.930 align:middle line:84%
The grid is also a key to
activate the solar clock.

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:54.360 align:middle line:84%
The solar clock
compresses energy

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:57.490 align:middle line:84%
until it reaches a
convergence point,

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:01.470 align:middle line:84%
resulting in a burst of energy
that triggers a global DNA

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:05.480 align:middle line:84%
upgrade through what many
know as solar flares.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.225 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:20:07.225 --> 00:20:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do many ley
lines need to be replaced?

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:12.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: I wouldn't say
that any ley lines need

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.940 align:middle line:84%
to be replaced, but I
would say that some ley

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:17.680 align:middle line:90%
lines need to be cleaned.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots of groups
around the planet that

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.960 align:middle line:84%
clean them, that have been
cleaning them for a long time,

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.350 align:middle line:84%
and they are still
cleaning them now.

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:24.985 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
clean a ley line?

00:20:24.985 --> 00:20:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: You clean
them multi-dimensionally.

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:32.080 align:middle line:84%
So you'd go down into the
earth with your light body.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And you'd set up certain
crystalline structures.

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And you'd wash the darker energy
out from the grid structures

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:39.910 align:middle line:90%
and clean them.

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's many different
processes for that.

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And there's many
groups doing it.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.200 align:middle line:90%
We're one of them.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.190 align:middle line:84%
I know some really good
groups around the planet

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:48.990 align:middle line:84%
that are really kind of
like-- it's all they do.

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:50.990 align:middle line:84%
From morning till night,
they're cleaning grids.

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:53.760 align:middle line:84%
But what needed to
happen on planet

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Earth is a new set of grids
needed to be put in place,

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:00.630 align:middle line:84%
because we're moving through
this fifth dimensional

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:01.590 align:middle line:90%
playground.

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got the
sixth dimensional playground.

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:06.095 align:middle line:84%
Then you've got the seventh
dimensional playground.

00:21:06.095 --> 00:21:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
getting up there.

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Yeah, to
anchor yourself in 5D,

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:11.070 align:middle line:90%
you need to be plugged into 6D.

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:14.200 align:middle line:84%
To anchor yourself in 6D, you
need to be plugged into 7D.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.725 align:middle line:84%
So the divine mother
frequencies that

00:21:16.725 --> 00:21:18.850 align:middle line:84%
are coming through planet
Earth are a lot stronger,

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:20.890 align:middle line:84%
but they needed a
framework to house them.

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:24.842 align:middle line:84%
So this dragon grid is the
first piece of the framework.

00:21:24.842 --> 00:21:28.055 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Seven-dimensional
fusion grids, what are they?

00:21:28.055 --> 00:21:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: So a
lot of people think

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:34.180 align:middle line:84%
that this fifth dimensional
space is all love and light.

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.530 align:middle line:84%
But the grandfathers, they
call the fifth dimensional

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:41.190 align:middle line:84%
grids the chaos grids, because
in this fifth dimension

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:42.670 align:middle line:90%
things are breaking down.

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:45.060 align:middle line:84%
Everything's kind
of falling apart.

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:48.300 align:middle line:84%
This dualistic kind of world
that we play the game of life in

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.540 align:middle line:90%
is kind of crumbling.

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And people are realizing
that there's so much

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:53.170 align:middle line:90%
more beyond this physical form.

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And so this is kind
of a chaotic space

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.720 align:middle line:84%
to be in because everything's
crumbling and being rebuilt.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.345 align:middle line:84%
And then you get to the sort of
top end of the fifth dimension.

00:22:01.345 --> 00:22:02.860 align:middle line:90%
You start to move into unity.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.890 align:middle line:84%
So the sixth dimensional
grids are the unity grids.

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got the
seventh dimensional grids,

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:09.850 align:middle line:90%
which are the fusion grids.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:12.910 align:middle line:84%
So the fusion grids are where
we all kind of fuse together.

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:16.467 align:middle line:84%
And unity really formulates
at a higher dimensional level.

00:22:16.467 --> 00:22:19.050 align:middle line:84%
That's when the magic is going
to happen on planet Earth, when

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:20.753 align:middle line:84%
this frequency
really starts flowing

00:22:20.753 --> 00:22:21.920 align:middle line:90%
through human consciousness.

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jerry, why is it so
important to rebuild or replace

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.660 align:middle line:90%
the grids?

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:29.250 align:middle line:10%
>>SARGEANT: Because there's been
a lot of dark energy running

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:30.670 align:middle line:10%
through them for a long time.

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:33.550 align:middle line:10%
So if you look at churches
that are built on the planet,

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:36.140 align:middle line:10%
if you look at schools,
if you look at hospitals,

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.570 align:middle line:10%
they're all built on ley lines.

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these
places experience fear.

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:43.570 align:middle line:84%
So when the fear
ignites, whether they're

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:45.430 align:middle line:84%
watching a scary movie
or someone's going

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:47.740 align:middle line:84%
through an operation
or whatever it is,

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.180 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of
fear in schools,

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:51.880 align:middle line:84%
that energy gets drawn down
into the grid structures

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and sent to certain
points around the planet.

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:55.970 align:middle line:84%
One of those points
is Stonehenge.

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Underneath Stonehenge,
there's been a huge crystal,

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:00.230 align:middle line:90%
and it stores this dark energy.

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And then every now and again,
it gets sent off planet

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.740 align:middle line:84%
where other beings can
feed off of this frequency.

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who has shown you
where to build these grids?

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:15.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: So the grandfathers,
they gave me the 15 points.

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:18.557 align:middle line:84%
As we saw on the map,
we kind of mapped it out

00:23:18.557 --> 00:23:20.890 align:middle line:84%
and were told to build those
grids to form this dragon's

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:21.690 align:middle line:90%
wing.

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:23.990 align:middle line:84%
But there's so much more
to this dragon's wing,

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:29.000 align:middle line:84%
because when we were traveling
through on this tour--

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.350 align:middle line:90%
we were in Ethiopia.

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:32.115 align:middle line:84%
Some amazing things
happened in Ethiopia.

00:23:32.115 --> 00:23:34.448 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Ark of the
Covenant is out there, they say.

00:23:34.448 --> 00:23:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Well,
we went to the place

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:37.590 align:middle line:84%
where the Ark of
the Covenant was.

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And when we were there, where
the Ark of the Covenant,

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:40.673 align:middle line:90%
I was stood outside.

00:23:40.673 --> 00:23:41.936 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's church, right?

00:23:41.936 --> 00:23:43.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: There's a
monastery, and then there's

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.480 align:middle line:90%
another monastery.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.220 align:middle line:84%
So there's an old monastery
where the Ark is, and there's

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:48.610 align:middle line:90%
a new, bigger monastery.

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:51.130 align:middle line:84%
This guy comes over,
this Ethiopian guy.

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me,
and he grabbed my wrist.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And he just stared
deep into my soul.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And he just told me to follow
him without speaking any words.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.367 align:middle line:84%
And he took me to
meet this other guy.

00:24:02.367 --> 00:24:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And this guy gave him a key, and
he took me into the monastery

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:05.890 align:middle line:90%
on my own.

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:09.070 align:middle line:84%
So we go into this monastery,
walk all the way to the front,

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:10.870 align:middle line:84%
and I'm stood there
staring into his eyes.

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And this big smile comes across
his face from ear to ear.

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was like his
humanness just disappeared.

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And I saw his light body
come out of his crown.

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And he was diamond and gold
and all these beautiful colors.

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And he comes out in his
high-dimensional form

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:26.290 align:middle line:90%
and gives me a key.

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:28.150 align:middle line:84%
He says, you're going
to need this key.

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:31.260 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, we found
out that this key

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:33.600 align:middle line:84%
was to dismantle
some very dark energy

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.110 align:middle line:84%
lines underneath the Vatican,
which we actually did when we

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:38.360 align:middle line:90%
came back off this excursion.

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:38.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:40.402 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: At the
same time, what we

00:24:40.402 --> 00:24:42.360 align:middle line:84%
found out is that this
dragon grid wasn't just

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:45.690 align:middle line:84%
a grid to hold the
divine mother frequencies

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:47.920 align:middle line:84%
in this seventh
dimensional architecture.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.947 align:middle line:84%
It was actually to
instigate the solar clock.

00:24:50.947 --> 00:24:52.530 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
around planet Earth

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:53.680 align:middle line:90%
talk about the solar flares.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Oh, there's these solar
flares coming to Earth.

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:57.755 align:middle line:84%
They're sending waves of
energy through the planet.

00:24:57.755 --> 00:24:59.140 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
upgrade our DNA.

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:02.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, what we were shown
is that this dragon's

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:05.520 align:middle line:84%
grid, when you pick
it up electrically

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:09.585 align:middle line:84%
or holographically, you lay it
over the universal template,

00:25:09.585 --> 00:25:11.585 align:middle line:84%
it actually plugs into
different constellations.

00:25:11.585 --> 00:25:12.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And fits perfectly.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Fits
absolutely perfectly

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.570 align:middle line:90%
and pulls in this frequency.

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:19.300 align:middle line:84%
Last Sunday, it was, we
did a big workshop online.

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:22.530 align:middle line:84%
There's 500 people that
all came online on Zoom

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:24.670 align:middle line:84%
to activate this solar
clock and hold space.

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:28.980 align:middle line:84%
So we went into this ascension
temple in the Cradle of Lyra

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:30.370 align:middle line:90%
with the grandfathers.

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And we took the dragon's wing,
overlaid it over the planet,

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.030 align:middle line:90%
and activated the solar clock.

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And the solar clock doesn't
tick forwards or backwards.

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:42.160 align:middle line:84%
What it does is it
compresses energy.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:43.830 align:middle line:84%
So it compresses it
and compresses it,

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:46.080 align:middle line:84%
pulling all the frequency
from these different planets

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.280 align:middle line:90%
and different systems.

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.760 align:middle line:84%
And what happens, what
the grandfathers explained

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.490 align:middle line:84%
is once it reaches a convergence
point where everything's

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:57.840 align:middle line:84%
kind of compressed as much
as it will go, it explodes.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And then it sends a wave of
energy, not just to Earth,

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.120 align:middle line:84%
but other parts
of the galaxy too.

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.743 align:middle line:84%
And that is when the
whole of humanity's DNA

00:26:05.743 --> 00:26:06.785 align:middle line:90%
is going to get upgraded.

00:26:06.785 --> 00:26:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happens when you
complete the grid structure?

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Well, when we
completed the grid structure,

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:15.580 align:middle line:84%
we were able to activate
the solar clock.

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:18.370 align:middle line:84%
But there's other parts
to this grid, too, George.

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:20.860 align:middle line:84%
So we've just-- and I didn't
know this at the time,

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.360 align:middle line:84%
but since we've
been back, I've been

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:24.060 align:middle line:84%
given the dragon's
tail, which is Hong

00:26:25.942 --> 00:26:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going to Hong
Kong in a couple of weeks.

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:30.720 align:middle line:84%
We're going to New
Zealand in that part

lay down the dragon's tail.

look at some of the places

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:36.700 align:middle line:90%

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:01.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, she's amazing.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:03.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She's into
this in a big way, too.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:04.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: Yeah, yeah.

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:06.160 align:middle line:90%
We did the mission together.

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.230 align:middle line:84%
It had to be that
kind of equilibrium,

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:10.930 align:middle line:84%
that kind of equal
masculine, feminine energy.

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:13.145 align:middle line:84%
It was much needed, the
magnetic and the electrical.

00:29:13.145 --> 00:29:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I saw you
outside the monastery.

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:16.385 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:29:16.385 --> 00:29:18.677 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: That was where
the Ark of the Covenant was.

00:29:18.677 --> 00:29:21.093 align:middle line:84%
That was where the story that
I was just telling, where we

00:29:21.093 --> 00:29:22.505 align:middle line:90%
went in and we got the key.

00:29:22.505 --> 00:29:23.835 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you see it?

00:29:23.835 --> 00:29:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: Not the Ark, no.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:28.388 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't go into the
monastery where the Ark was.

00:29:28.388 --> 00:29:29.680 align:middle line:90%
We went into the one next door.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.063 align:middle line:90%
No one's allowed in that one.

00:29:31.063 --> 00:29:32.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they don't let you in.

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:34.770 align:middle line:84%
They don't even
let the priests in.

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:36.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was really interesting.

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:41.160 align:middle line:84%
When we were in Ethiopia, they
do this thing every single month

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.100 align:middle line:90%
for a week.

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:46.200 align:middle line:84%
So seven days, once a month,
they take a replica Ark

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.900 align:middle line:84%
and they march it around
the streets at 4 o'clock

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:49.750 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And there's literally
thousands of men and thousands

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:53.980 align:middle line:84%
of women, all with
candles, dressed in white.

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:57.060 align:middle line:84%
So we went along one
morning, and we're following

00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.240 align:middle line:90%
this kind of procession.

00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.080 align:middle line:90%
It's really sacred.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.430 align:middle line:84%
They were doing
all this chanting.

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And then we get back to this
kind of town square, which

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:03.765 align:middle line:90%
isn't really like a square.

00:30:03.765 --> 00:30:04.870 align:middle line:90%
It's like a circle.

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And all the priests were
kind of sat in chairs.

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:09.940 align:middle line:84%
Everybody else is sort
of around the outside.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And we were stood
around the outside.

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And this priest came over with
two chairs and put them down.

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:19.113 align:middle line:84%
And we were kind of
looking at them thinking,

00:30:19.113 --> 00:30:20.530 align:middle line:84%
why are they giving
us two chairs?

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And there was a little boy stood
next to me, and he elbowed me.

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:25.000 align:middle line:90%
And he looked at me.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.130 align:middle line:84%
He was able to say, go
and sit in the chairs.

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:28.797 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
interesting because it

00:30:28.797 --> 00:30:31.500 align:middle line:84%
was like all of the priests
knew why we were there

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.170 align:middle line:84%
in Ethiopia, to
bury these crystals

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:38.340 align:middle line:90%
and bring this grid online.

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:41.300 align:middle line:84%
By them putting that
the chairs down, it

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:44.410 align:middle line:84%
was their kind of sign to say,
listen, we acknowledge you.

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:46.510 align:middle line:84%
We know you're here and
just thank you so much.

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:47.470 align:middle line:90%
It was great.

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:49.380 align:middle line:84%
We sat down with all the priests
and went through this whole kind

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:50.230 align:middle line:90%
of transmission.

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:51.030 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Earlier in
the program, Jerry,

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:56.190 align:middle line:84%
you talked about
ET intervention.

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:58.060 align:middle line:90%
Does that continue?

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Yeah, I mean,
we had a lot of support.

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:04.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when we went to the
Pyramid of the Sun in Bosnia,

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.820 align:middle line:90%
we were inside the tunnels.

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was walking there in the
tunnel, probably 15 to 20 meters

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:14.980 align:middle line:84%
being into it, and this huge
being comes out from the side.

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:19.770 align:middle line:84%
This huge higher dimensional
Arcturian walks into the space

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:22.030 align:middle line:84%
and was just sort of
winking and nodding.

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:23.850 align:middle line:90%
You're all good.

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:26.400 align:middle line:84%
They were everywhere,
supporting us, watching over us,

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.490 align:middle line:84%
because what we
did was so vitally

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:31.790 align:middle line:90%
important for human ascension.

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:33.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dramatic.

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:35.520 align:middle line:90%
It truly is.

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Your ET guides, what
else do they tell you?

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: There
with me all the time.

00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:46.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Deron and Derek White
are my main two Lyran guides.

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And they're always
just guiding me daily,

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:52.090 align:middle line:84%
what decisions to make,
where to put my energy,

00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:54.940 align:middle line:84%
where not to put my
energy, who to work with,

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:58.590 align:middle line:84%
who not to work with,
how to help Star Magic

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:02.150 align:middle line:84%
expand, our mission, our
business, left, right,

00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:02.950 align:middle line:90%
and center.

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:05.460 align:middle line:84%
They're also giving me higher
dimensional information

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:07.975 align:middle line:84%
on what's happening with
the grids on planet Earth,

00:32:07.975 --> 00:32:10.600 align:middle line:84%
but also what's happening with
the grids throughout the cosmos,

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.760 align:middle line:84%
because everything is
electrically programmed.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:14.370 align:middle line:90%
Everything is electromagnetic.

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:16.750 align:middle line:84%
The grid structures are
not just on planet Earth.

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:18.120 align:middle line:90%
They're on every single planet.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And every single
planet and every star

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.900 align:middle line:84%
and every sun and
every moon is linked

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:23.350 align:middle line:90%
through these grid systems.

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:25.980 align:middle line:84%
So being told how
the energy is flowing

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:28.645 align:middle line:84%
and keeping up to
speed of all of that

00:32:28.645 --> 00:32:30.270 align:middle line:84%
and getting the run
down on all of that

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:32.350 align:middle line:84%
is really important for
the work that we do.

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:35.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Being around all
these high-powered grids,

00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:38.176 align:middle line:84%
do you feel something
different physically?

00:32:38.176 --> 00:32:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: When we
were laying these grids,

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:43.420 align:middle line:90%
I was shifting so much.

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:47.060 align:middle line:84%
The second place we went to
was called [NON-ENGLISH].

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:48.310 align:middle line:90%
It was in the Golden Triangle.

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:51.010 align:middle line:90%
It was Mary Magdalene country.

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:54.330 align:middle line:84%
We actually stayed
in Nostradamus' house

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:57.520 align:middle line:84%
that he stayed in
between 1520 and 1527.

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's a museum
now, but somehow, we

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.210 align:middle line:90%
ended up staying in it.

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:03.503 align:middle line:84%
And it was a kind of
a strange old place,

00:33:03.503 --> 00:33:05.170 align:middle line:84%
and lots of weird
things happened there.

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:07.985 align:middle line:84%
But when we got there,
I got very angry.

00:33:07.985 --> 00:33:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: All of
this deep-rooted trauma

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:12.690 align:middle line:84%
was coming up in
me because I hadn't

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:14.830 align:middle line:84%
been back to these
sacred lands for so long.

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:18.520 align:middle line:84%
So being around all of these
kind of grid structures,

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.460 align:middle line:84%
I went to a new
level of healing.

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:23.120 align:middle line:84%
There was another level of
stuff that I didn't even

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:26.280 align:middle line:84%
know existed inside of me,
all came up to the surface.

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was like a 36-hour
process to clean this stuff

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:29.880 align:middle line:90%
through me.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:30.750 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:32.760 align:middle line:84%
So by going on
this grid mission,

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.850 align:middle line:90%
I evolved as a human being.

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Everybody that was
involved in this

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.150 align:middle line:90%
was upgrading all of the time.

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And even people back in the UK
and America and different parts

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:44.250 align:middle line:84%
around the world that
were holding space for us,

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:46.920 align:middle line:84%
they could feel the
shifts on a daily basis

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.460 align:middle line:84%
as we were laying down the
grids and orchestrating

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.320 align:middle line:90%
this structure.

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:53.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you feel
grids walking by them?

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:55.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: Absolutely.

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:57.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:33:57.150 --> 00:34:00.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so much
to this whole story.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.300 align:middle line:84%
When we went to Romania, we went
to a place called Sarmizegetusa,

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:08.560 align:middle line:84%
which is like-- it's an ancient
kind of circle made from wood.

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.060 align:middle line:84%
It used to be made from stone,
but they took the stones away

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:12.000 align:middle line:90%
and put wood there.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And not a lot of people
really know that.

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:15.179 align:middle line:84%
But underneath, there's
an Arcturian base,

00:34:15.179 --> 00:34:18.060 align:middle line:84%
lots of spacecrafts, and it
goes deep into the ground.

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:23.770 align:middle line:84%
When we were walking up this
kind of windy road or pathway,

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:27.500 align:middle line:90%
I saw these kind of goddesses.

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:30.739 align:middle line:84%
They came out from the woods in
their multi-dimensional form.

00:34:30.739 --> 00:34:34.250 align:middle line:84%
There were these crystal
white and diamond wolves.

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:36.400 align:middle line:90%
And I saw this doorway.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:40.969 align:middle line:10%
And it was a beautiful sunny
day, not a whisper of wind.

00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:43.639 align:middle line:84%
And Laurie and I were stood
there in front of this doorway.

00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And I asked, should we
walk through this doorway

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:48.710 align:middle line:90%
before we go and do this work?

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And we were told
yes, but we told yes

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:53.630 align:middle line:90%
by lightning and thunder.

00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:56.210 align:middle line:84%
So we stood there on
a crystal clear day,

00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:58.780 align:middle line:84%
not a whisper of wind, not
even a leaf is blowing--

00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With lightning
and thunder all around you.

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:02.868 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: There was no
lightning and thunder.

00:35:02.868 --> 00:35:05.710 align:middle line:84%
I asked the question, should
we walk through the doorway?

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:07.185 align:middle line:84%
Lightning and
thunder from nowhere.

00:35:07.185 --> 00:35:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I guess the
answer was yes, right?

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: It was
yes, so we walked

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:10.820 align:middle line:90%
through the door and boom.

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:12.050 align:middle line:90%
The whole frequency shifted.

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:15.407 align:middle line:84%
We walked up, went down
and we laid the grids--

00:35:15.407 --> 00:35:16.365 align:middle line:90%
laid the crystals down.

00:35:16.365 --> 00:35:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jerry, does
science and mathematics

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.010 align:middle line:90%
have anything to do with this?

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:22.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Everything
is mathematical.

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:23.990 align:middle line:90%
Our bodies are mathematical.

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:25.540 align:middle line:90%
The trees are mathematical.

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.800 align:middle line:84%
The whole grid structure
is mathematical.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.430 align:middle line:84%
So mathematics plays a
big, big part in everything

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:31.550 align:middle line:90%
that we do at Star Magic.

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:34.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our healing
frequency is mathematical.

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And our physical bodies
are actually running off

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:38.630 align:middle line:90%
a false mathematical template.

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:42.010 align:middle line:84%
So when we run codes and
frequencies through a human body

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:44.240 align:middle line:84%
and they switch to their
original architecture,

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:46.780 align:middle line:84%
their kind of divine
template, their mathematics

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:47.960 align:middle line:90%
comes back online.

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:50.865 align:middle line:84%
That's when people start
seeing or the tumor disappears.

00:35:50.865 --> 00:35:52.240 align:middle line:84%
They get up out
of the wheelchair

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:54.782 align:middle line:84%
because they've realigned with
their original template, which

00:35:54.782 --> 00:35:56.348 align:middle line:90%
is a mathematical equation.

00:35:56.348 --> 00:35:57.223 align:middle line:90%
It's all mathematics.

00:35:57.223 --> 00:35:58.300 align:middle line:90%
It's all numbers.

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you know
where the grids are?

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT:
Sometimes I see them.

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:04.400 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes I feel them.

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I get
information from other beings

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:08.790 align:middle line:90%
that show me where they are,

00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like
architectural sketches?

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Well, you know when
you watch the film Star Wars?

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:17.670 align:middle line:84%
They might bring up this
holographic structure

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:18.470 align:middle line:90%
of a planet.

00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: And
they'll be spinning it.

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:20.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Changing and moving.

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: So there's
this hologram of a planet.

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:23.000 align:middle line:84%
You've got all these
different people.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:23.800 align:middle line:90%
There's trees.

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.870 align:middle line:84%
That's what I see,
the schematics

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:27.910 align:middle line:84%
in a multi-dimensional
holographic format.

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:31.005 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can anything
go wrong with this?

00:36:31.005 --> 00:36:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: Yeah.

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:36.020 align:middle line:84%
So there's stargates
around the planet.

00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:38.750 align:middle line:90%
You've got stargates in Iraq.

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:41.630 align:middle line:84%
You've got stargates
in Ireland, France.

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:44.690 align:middle line:84%
You've got stargates
in Iran, in Somalia.

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:48.336 align:middle line:84%
You've got stargates
in Russia, Jerusalem.

00:36:48.336 --> 00:36:50.027 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These are
portals, right?

00:36:50.027 --> 00:36:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Well,
they're a little bit

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:52.568 align:middle line:90%
different from portals.

00:36:52.568 --> 00:36:56.680 align:middle line:84%
The stargates allow inter
and multi-dimensional travel

00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:58.160 align:middle line:90%
through physical form.

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.280 align:middle line:84%
So you can walk into a
stargate with your body

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.560 align:middle line:90%
and pop out somewhere else.

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:05.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to know
where stargates are,

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:07.640 align:middle line:90%
look where wars have been.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.430 align:middle line:84%
So stargate 10 is
in Iraq, which is

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:13.850 align:middle line:84%
really instrumental in the mind
control that's on planet Earth.

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:16.960 align:middle line:90%
So that is a hijacked stargate.

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And the grid systems that come
out of stargate 10, one of them

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:23.680 align:middle line:90%
is the Golden Eagle grid.

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:26.650 align:middle line:84%
The golden Eagle grid
is a hijacked grid

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:29.060 align:middle line:90%
which comes out of stargate 10.

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.530 align:middle line:90%
And it's a dirty grid.

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:33.878 align:middle line:84%
And lots of lightworkers,
planetary grid workers,

00:37:33.878 --> 00:37:35.920 align:middle line:84%
people like me, and other
people around the world

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:38.020 align:middle line:84%
are doing work on these
grids all the time.

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:39.520 align:middle line:84%
But these new grids
that we've built

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.687 align:middle line:84%
are completely disconnected
from all of these grids.

00:37:41.687 --> 00:37:43.490 align:middle line:84%
It's a completely
new infrastructure,

00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:45.740 align:middle line:84%
which is going to enable
a completely new energy.

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:49.082 align:middle line:84%
And these grids are so
protected by other beings

00:37:49.082 --> 00:37:51.040 align:middle line:84%
that it's going to be
very hard for these grids

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:51.840 align:middle line:90%
to get corrupted.

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:55.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jerry, what does
negative energy mean to you?

00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:57.875 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Negative
energy, it depends

00:37:57.875 --> 00:37:59.000 align:middle line:90%
how you look at it, really.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for most people, I
think negative energy would

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:02.930 align:middle line:90%
mean heavy energy.

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:06.710 align:middle line:84%
So if you're feeling, guilt,
if you're feeling anger,

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:08.110 align:middle line:84%
if you're feeling
fear, if you're

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:10.610 align:middle line:84%
feeling any of these kind of
lower vibrational emotions,

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:12.470 align:middle line:90%
they could be kind of negative.

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:15.225 align:middle line:84%
But negative energy is
also very important.

00:38:15.225 --> 00:38:16.850 align:middle line:84%
If you've got your
Merkaba field, which

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:18.267 align:middle line:84%
is part of your
light-- well, it's

00:38:18.267 --> 00:38:20.700 align:middle line:84%
part of your multidimensional
architecture.

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.260 align:middle line:90%
You've got two tetrahedrons.

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:24.930 align:middle line:84%
You've also got a
multi-dimensional Merkaba field,

00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:26.490 align:middle line:90%
which is 10 tetrahedrons.

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:29.180 align:middle line:84%
But the two tetrahedrons
that make up

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:31.950 align:middle line:84%
your kind of normal Merkaba
field, one is positive,

00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:36.310 align:middle line:84%
one is negative, one is
electrical, one is magnetic.

00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:37.560 align:middle line:90%
They're positive and negative.

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:41.060 align:middle line:84%
So for this purpose,
the negative energy

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:44.390 align:middle line:84%
is important, because you need
the negative and the positive

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:46.220 align:middle line:84%
plus the neutral in
the middle, which

00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:50.300 align:middle line:84%
enables you to open
gateways and portal systems

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:52.980 align:middle line:84%
and to function
properly as a human.

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:54.862 align:middle line:84%
So it depends on
which perspective

00:38:54.862 --> 00:38:55.945 align:middle line:90%
you're looking at it from.

00:38:55.945 --> 00:38:58.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You use the
grids for healing.

00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:00.570 align:middle line:90%
What about consciousness?

00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:01.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: It's the same.

00:39:01.830 --> 00:39:07.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, consciousness-- the
expansion of consciousness

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:11.940 align:middle line:84%
is kind of governed partly
by the grid structures,

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:13.850 align:middle line:84%
because the grid
structures enable

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:15.470 align:middle line:90%
us to hold a certain frequency.

00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And if we can hold
a certain frequency,

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:19.690 align:middle line:84%
it enables the human
beings' vibration

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:21.598 align:middle line:84%
to rise and
consciousness to expand.

00:39:21.598 --> 00:39:23.140 align:middle line:84%
So the grids are
kind of instrumental

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:24.015 align:middle line:90%
from that standpoint.

00:39:24.015 --> 00:39:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You talked about
dimensions, 5, 6, 7, is there

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:29.960 align:middle line:90%
a difference?

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Yeah, I mean, you've
got dimensions 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:34.100 align:middle line:90%
5 all the way up.

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:35.690 align:middle line:90%
There's multiple dimensions.

00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And the lower the dimension,
the heavier it is.

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And the higher the
dimension, the lighter it is.

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And just because it's lighter
in the higher dimension

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:49.180 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean it's uncorrupt,
because this kind of trickery

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:52.478 align:middle line:84%
and manipulation goes all the
way up the dimensional fields.

00:39:52.478 --> 00:39:54.770 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think you
get into the fifth dimension,

00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:56.728 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to be all
sunshine and rainbows.

00:39:56.728 --> 00:39:58.100 align:middle line:90%
That's just a load of BS.

00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:59.930 align:middle line:84%
The trickery goes up
and down the chain,

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:02.140 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of
corruption in the higher

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:03.030 align:middle line:90%
dimensional fields.

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:06.626 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would we want to
progress to a higher dimension?

00:40:06.626 --> 00:40:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Well, there's a
number of different reasons.

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:11.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're here in these
physical bodies, which

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:14.380 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely amazing, but
there's a whole universe

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:15.530 align:middle line:90%
out there to play in.

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:17.873 align:middle line:84%
And beyond that universe,
there's a whole multiverse.

00:40:17.873 --> 00:40:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And then once you get out of
this kind of 15th dimensional

00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:22.610 align:middle line:84%
time matrix, you go
into the God worlds.

00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:25.130 align:middle line:84%
There's gateways into
other multiverses.

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:27.355 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's beautiful
being here on planet Earth,

00:40:27.355 --> 00:40:29.480 align:middle line:84%
getting to have conversations
with people like you,

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.670 align:middle line:84%
going around the planet
doing this grid work,

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:33.590 align:middle line:84%
meeting people,
having a girlfriend,

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:36.890 align:middle line:84%
making love, eating great
food with awesome people.

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many experiences
to have on planet Earth.

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:42.070 align:middle line:10%
But why would you not want
to be able to access all

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:43.610 align:middle line:10%
of the other information too?

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:47.410 align:middle line:10%
So be able to bring your
soul out of your body

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:50.380 align:middle line:10%
and travel through different
dimensional spaces, which

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:53.570 align:middle line:10%
is possible for everybody right
now through certain processes,

00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:55.710 align:middle line:10%
why would you not want to
go and experience that?

00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've changed
your life completely,

00:40:57.740 --> 00:41:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Jerry, even since the
last time I talked to you.

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Do I look
different, feel different?

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You act different.

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:05.037 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: I act different.

00:41:05.037 --> 00:41:06.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're more upbeat.

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:08.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: I think
we're always shifting,

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:11.150 align:middle line:90%
and we're always changing.

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:15.250 align:middle line:10%
And I think anybody that
is not doing this work

00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:17.240 align:middle line:10%
is going to ultimately
stay stagnant.

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you stay
stagnant, there's

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:21.020 align:middle line:84%
only one way that
you're going to go

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:23.270 align:middle line:84%
and that is a slippery
slope backwards.

00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:29.260 align:middle line:10%
So for me, waking up every
day, meditating, exercising,

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:32.030 align:middle line:10%
doing my intermittent
fasting, eating clean foods,

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:35.815 align:middle line:10%
staying hydrated, doing all the
things that raise my vibration,

00:41:35.815 --> 00:41:37.940 align:middle line:10%
expand my consciousness
and make me a better human,

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:39.620 align:middle line:10%
everybody should be
doing this stuff.

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:41.203 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
always a progression.

00:41:41.203 --> 00:41:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If people want to sign
up for these healing centers,

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:45.375 align:middle line:90%
how do they find you?

00:41:45.375 --> 00:41:47.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Go to
starmagichealing.org and get

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:49.060 align:middle line:90%
in contact with the team.

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:50.175 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's that simple?

00:41:50.175 --> 00:41:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: It's
that simple, brother.

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:54.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
a waiting list?

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:56.080 align:middle line:10%
>>SARGEANT: We've
got a lot of people

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:58.308 align:middle line:10%
that are interested
in buying memberships,

00:41:58.308 --> 00:42:00.350 align:middle line:10%
because we've not put them
out to the market yet.

00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:04.070 align:middle line:10%
They're going to go out to the
market end of January next year.

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:06.310 align:middle line:84%
So we've got a lot of
people that are interested,

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:07.940 align:middle line:90%
and there's only so many spaces.

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:11.540 align:middle line:84%
So if anyone is interested,
get in contact, let us know.

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, when we start
selling the memberships,

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:18.320 align:middle line:84%
you'll be there and
one of the first.

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How is our
grid system right now?

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:22.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: It depends.

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:24.542 align:middle line:90%
There's multiple grid systems.

00:42:24.542 --> 00:42:30.730 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are in great stead,
and some of them are very heavy.

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:32.360 align:middle line:90%
And it's a yo-yo game.

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:34.070 align:middle line:90%
It's up and down, up and down.

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And there's always this
kind of power maneuver

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:39.710 align:middle line:90%
to take control of the grids.

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:41.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look at
Lebanon two years ago,

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:43.760 align:middle line:90%
they had that massive explosion.

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:45.710 align:middle line:84%
That's because there's
a stargate in Lebanon.

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And the explosion was really
for domination and control

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:49.520 align:middle line:90%
of that stargate.

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:52.160 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it wasn't to do with
anything else apart from that.

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.955 align:middle line:84%
Even though the
news and the media

00:42:53.955 --> 00:42:56.330 align:middle line:84%
will portray that it was for
this reason and that reason,

00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:57.380 align:middle line:90%
it's all BS.

00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:59.360 align:middle line:84%
The real reason is
control of the stargate.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.950 align:middle line:84%
So there's always this battle
over interdimensional and

00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:04.110 align:middle line:90%
multi-dimensional travel.

00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:07.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If somebody wants to
live near one of these grids,

00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:09.525 align:middle line:90%
what would you recommend?

00:43:09.525 --> 00:43:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: Feel it.

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:12.740 align:middle line:90%
Feel it.

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:14.110 align:middle line:90%
It's not for everybody.

00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:17.800 align:middle line:84%
Some people that are
exposed to these grids that

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:19.580 align:middle line:84%
haven't done a
lot of inner work,

00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:21.530 align:middle line:90%
it could fry them a little bit.

00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:25.060 align:middle line:84%
It's going to bring up
a lot of old toxicity

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:28.070 align:middle line:84%
because we carry a lot
of ancestral trauma.

00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:30.748 align:middle line:84%
We carry a lot of parallel
life conditioning.

00:43:30.748 --> 00:43:32.540 align:middle line:84%
Some people would call
it past life trauma.

00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Some people would call
it future life trauma.

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:36.458 align:middle line:84%
But once you get out of your
body and into the field,

00:43:36.458 --> 00:43:37.580 align:middle line:90%
there's only now.

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:42.080 align:middle line:84%
But we carry all of this in our
system, in our RNA, in our DNA.

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:44.680 align:middle line:84%
So when you go and live by these
kind of high-frequency grid

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:46.555 align:middle line:84%
points, it's going to
bring all of that stuff

00:43:46.555 --> 00:43:48.452 align:middle line:84%
to the surface to
clear and cleanse you.

00:43:48.452 --> 00:43:49.785 align:middle line:90%
So you need to be aware of that.
