00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.210 align:middle line:84%
MAN: And I think many
people today don't

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.180 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.330 align:middle line:84%
MAN: People are basically
going to keep on to help

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.580 align:middle line:90%
uncover what really happened.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.610 align:middle line:84%
WOMAN: It felt like
something was watching me.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.750 align:middle line:84%
MAN: We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.205 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.205 --> 00:00:26.110 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.620 align:middle line:10%
Well, welcome back to another
edition of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.490 align:middle line:10%
In our first part
with Eldon Taylor,

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.729 align:middle line:10%
we talked about
mind programming,

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.210 align:middle line:10%
how they are trying to
manipulate everything

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.730 align:middle line:10%
we do, our minds, our actions.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, in this
program, we're going

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.030 align:middle line:84%
to talk about his
work called "Choices

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.520 align:middle line:84%
and Illusions," where Eldon
will tell us we do have choices,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.975 align:middle line:90%
or do we not?

00:00:47.975 --> 00:00:49.950 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] What a wonderful--

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.460 align:middle line:10%
Is it just an illusion?

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.630 align:middle line:10%
You know, in many
senses, it is, George.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.380 align:middle line:84%
Krishnamurti said, look,
choice is an illusion.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.660 align:middle line:10%
Do I do this, or do I do that
arises as a state of confusion.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.710 align:middle line:10%
When I know clearly what
to do, there's no choice.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.110 align:middle line:10%
But I think the most
interesting piece of research

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.850 align:middle line:10%
that I have discovered
in my lifetime comes out

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.680 align:middle line:10%
of functional magnetic resonance
imaging, and that's this piece.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.170 align:middle line:84%
An MRI technician
watching your brain

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.950 align:middle line:84%
make a decision live
time will know 6

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.920 align:middle line:90%
to 10 seconds before you know--

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.160 align:middle line:90%
---what you're going to do.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.300 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.311 align:middle line:84%
Now that should just
shock us, shock us all.

00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:40.610 align:middle line:84%
I love that.
Unbelievable science.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:41.920 align:middle line:90%
For sure.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.340 align:middle line:84%
My favorite poem is the Robert
Frost poem of "The Road Not

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Taken," where he talks
about this individual

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.980 align:middle line:90%
looking at two scenarios.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And he took the road less
traveled by, and in his mind,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.770 align:middle line:90%
it made all the difference.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Is that what you
also mean by choices?

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Picking and doing
something that could

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.960 align:middle line:84%
reflect something for maybe
the rest of your life.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you'll regret
it, maybe you won't.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.840 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.250 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely do.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.860 align:middle line:84%
I am, I'm convinced
and the data shows us

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.020 align:middle line:84%
that we are inculturated
in such a way

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.700 align:middle line:84%
that we live our
lives as though we're

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.440 align:middle line:84%
answering a multiple
choice question in school.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.510 align:middle line:10%
So we have A, B and C. Those are
our choices, period, that's it,

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.130 align:middle line:10%
you know.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.340 align:middle line:10%
I like to illustrate
that by telling

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.430 align:middle line:10%
a story that reflects it, that
I call the flower pot story.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.240 align:middle line:84%
But you know, the bottom
line comes down to this,

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.460 align:middle line:84%
if I think I can only
do this or that, then

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.870 align:middle line:90%
that's how I respond.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.370 align:middle line:84%
When I stop and
realize that there

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.860 align:middle line:84%
are all these
other alternatives,

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.700 align:middle line:90%
then my life changes.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.900 align:middle line:84%
It takes on a whole
different dimension.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.615 align:middle line:90%
Sure does.

00:03:00.615 --> 00:03:05.452 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's take a look
at the flower pot story.

00:03:05.452 --> 00:03:07.200 align:middle line:90%
ELDON TAYLOR: Choices.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.295 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine walking down
the street in New York City.

00:03:11.295 --> 00:03:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Those of you who have visited
New York, the Big Apple, I'm

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.400 align:middle line:90%
over on 32nd.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm in the high rise condos.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Boy, these are $1.5
million, $2 million condos,

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.984 align:middle line:90%
before the real estate boom.

00:03:24.984 --> 00:03:27.374 align:middle line:84%
And I'm walking along,
kind of looking, sky line.

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And from a third store
balcony, flower pot falls.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.050 align:middle line:90%
Bah, hits me in the head.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Falls to the ground, pot
breaks, flower falls out.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.700 align:middle line:90%
I have some choices.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.728 align:middle line:90%


00:03:43.728 --> 00:03:45.570 align:middle line:84%
I bet you can all
think of this one.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.440 align:middle line:90%
We sue this guy.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.010 align:middle line:90%
He's got a lot of bucks.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.242 align:middle line:90%
Look at the place he lives in.

00:03:50.242 --> 00:03:53.250 align:middle line:90%
I'll claim concussion.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Get my digital little
portable phone out

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.070 align:middle line:90%
and call my attorney right now.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.920 align:middle line:90%
You can do that.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.960 align:middle line:90%


00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.550 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I wanted to be John Wayne.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take
this broken flower pot

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.440 align:middle line:90%
and put it you know where.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.970 align:middle line:84%
But I get to the door and I
see this guy's a linebacker

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.480 align:middle line:90%
for the Chicago Bears.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.420 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:24.270 align:middle line:90%


00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.110 align:middle line:90%
I can be meta physical.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.350 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.730 align:middle line:84%
That probably brought
some enlightenment to me.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.260 align:middle line:90%


00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.660 align:middle line:90%
What else can I do?

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.470 align:middle line:84%
What could I do that would turn
this situation into thank you,

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.520 align:middle line:90%
gratitude situation?

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.860 align:middle line:90%


00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.880 align:middle line:84%
What if I were to
take that flower,

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.730 align:middle line:84%
go over to the corner
florist, have it repotted,

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.720 align:middle line:90%
take the pot back to the owner.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Fell off your balcony,
pot was broke,

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.086 align:middle line:84%
wanted to return
it to you repotted.

00:05:02.086 --> 00:05:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Of all the things
I could have done,

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.730 align:middle line:84%
which one would have
made me feel the best?

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:07.890 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:08.950 align:middle line:90%
Last one.

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.750 align:middle line:84%
My body would have been
filled with all those

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.810 align:middle line:90%
good, warm, fuzzy chemicals.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.760 align:middle line:90%
I would have had a moment of ah.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.930 align:middle line:84%
I had a great laugh
looking at the expression

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.040 align:middle line:90%
on a person's face.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.880 align:middle line:84%
That would have been
my best, wouldn't it?

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, the old
flower pot, Eldon.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.090 align:middle line:90%
Interesting technique.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.260 align:middle line:84%
You know that old saying
of would have, could have,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.940 align:middle line:90%
should have.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.630 align:middle line:84%
You really can't
go back, though,

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.100 align:middle line:90%
after you make your choice.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.150 align:middle line:84%
You've got to live with it.
-OK.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.180 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you're right.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, once we take a road,
we're going down that road.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.490 align:middle line:84%
But can we reassess things
and change our life?

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.670 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.780 align:middle line:84%
We used to believe that
personality was fixed.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I remember
when I went to college,

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.130 align:middle line:84%
and I'm dating myself now, but
you were told IQ was fixed,

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.860 align:middle line:90%
personality was fixed.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.810 align:middle line:84%
That fixed somewhere between
two and four years of age.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.570 align:middle line:84%
Brain cells begin to
die in your early 30s

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.160 align:middle line:84%
and they never
regenerated, and all kinds

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.480 align:middle line:84%
of myths, if you will,
things that we know

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.070 align:middle line:90%
today are just false to fact.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.400 align:middle line:84%
The best thing we
can often do today

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.780 align:middle line:84%
is listen to the
words of Nietzsche.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.711 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not a big fan
of Frederick Nietzsche,

00:06:23.711 --> 00:06:24.410 align:middle line:90%
don't get me wrong.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.790 align:middle line:84%
But in his essay "Twilight,"
he says, why is it

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.670 align:middle line:84%
we don't sit down and
decide the characteristics

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.700 align:middle line:90%
that we want to be?

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.640 align:middle line:84%
If we want to be honest
and we want to be outgoing,

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.640 align:middle line:84%
we want to be
successful, we want

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.390 align:middle line:84%
to have good relationships, what
does it take for us to do that?

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.590 align:middle line:90%
Can we be honest?

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.810 align:middle line:90%
Can we practice integrity?

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.050 align:middle line:10%
Why don't we sit down and
make a list of these things

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.010 align:middle line:10%
and then change our
personality in order

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:58.270 align:middle line:10%
to begin representing the
person we want to be tomorrow?

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, today, psychologists
will tell you

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.050 align:middle line:84%
that the most
effective thing you

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.410 align:middle line:84%
can do to improve your life,
change your personality.

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.630 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, sure, we
didn't get down a road--

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.260 align:middle line:90%
Easier said than done.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.090 align:middle line:90%
Yes and no.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Everything begins
one step at a time.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.930 align:middle line:84%
If we say, this is going to
be really monumentally yard,

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.470 align:middle line:90%
it becomes monumentally hard.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:28.090 align:middle line:84%
How we predispose ourselves
by the way we talk to our self

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:33.480 align:middle line:84%
becomes really
critically important.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.960 align:middle line:10%
I've given lots and
lots of seminars

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.180 align:middle line:10%
where I try to
explain to people how

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.120 align:middle line:10%
important our own self-talk,
our inner talk, is.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And the best way I
can do that is I've

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.940 align:middle line:84%
illustrated it many times with
the millionaire proposition.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.670 align:middle line:84%
How many of you want
to be millionaires?

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.600 align:middle line:90%
Everybody raises their hand.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.920 align:middle line:84%
OK, now I want you
to say to yourself,

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.310 align:middle line:84%
and meaningfully, this year
I'm going to make $1 million.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And remember, I said
make $1 million, earn it.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.510 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to win the lottery.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.400 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to
have to go at risk.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.860 align:middle line:84%
You may have to quit your
job or borrow some money.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.760 align:middle line:90%
Start a business, something.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:13.470 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:14.540 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.820 align:middle line:10%
I want you to believe
that you can do that.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:17.810 align:middle line:90%
Say that to yourself.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it only takes a
couple of minutes and people

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.085 align:middle line:84%
start getting this
stream of back talk.

00:08:23.085 --> 00:08:23.790 align:middle line:90%
It's an affirmation.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.520 align:middle line:90%
Is that what we're doing?

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.522 align:middle line:84%
Well, they start getting
things like, what are

00:08:28.522 --> 00:08:30.280 align:middle line:90%
you going to do, rob a bank?

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.179 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't believe
inside that they can do that.

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:35.370 align:middle line:90%
So the negativity comes out.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:36.419 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:40.450 align:middle line:84%
So what happens
is we need to stop

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.390 align:middle line:84%
paying attention to that
stream of consciousness,

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.340 align:middle line:90%
begin to modify it.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:52.010 align:middle line:84%
But when you say
harder than it sounds,

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't want people to
believe that it's too hard.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:56.875 align:middle line:90%
It takes mindfulness.

00:08:56.875 --> 00:08:58.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I have to pay attention.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:03.340 align:middle line:84%
It has to be a regular
part of how I live.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:07.400 align:middle line:84%
But it's not something
that's impossible.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:13.310 align:middle line:84%
We're inculturated very
much like a chicken raised

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:16.840 align:middle line:84%
in a chicken yard, or a
duckling, I should say,

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.370 align:middle line:90%
raised in a chicken yard.

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:26.950 align:middle line:84%
We practice out
our lives in ways

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:32.130 align:middle line:84%
that we begin to decide what's
good luck, what's bad luck.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And people begin to
say, well, you know,

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:37.920 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't born with a
silver spoon in my mouth.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.660 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get all
of the advantages.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.190 align:middle line:84%
I made these mistakes
when I was young.

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:45.170 align:middle line:90%
I had this bad luck.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:50.230 align:middle line:84%
But you know, bad luck
is defined by perception.

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.410 align:middle line:90%
We make our own luck.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.310 align:middle line:90%
There's no question about it.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:57.400 align:middle line:84%
Eldon, have you ever
been to Las Vegas?

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.920 align:middle line:84%
I lived there for
a number of years.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And I tell you, if
you live in Las Vegas,

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:03.140 align:middle line:90%
you don't play in Las Vegas.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.050 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:09.790 align:middle line:84%
But people who go there-- and
I've watched them-- some people

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:13.630 align:middle line:84%
have good luck, some
people have bad luck.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.740 align:middle line:90%
What determines that?

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.880 align:middle line:90%
Who wins, who doesn't?

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.340 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed a number of
guests on "Coast to Coast"

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.030 align:middle line:84%
who have written
books about luck.

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:26.940 align:middle line:84%
They are convinced-- and
they've done some testing--

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.020 align:middle line:84%
one guy even went out there
with a group of his students

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.850 align:middle line:90%
to manifest luck.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And they all say that
positive thinking

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:44.010 align:middle line:84%
and being forthright and being
energetic changes your luck.

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Those people who come in
thinking, I'm going to lose,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.730 align:middle line:84%
this is not going
to work, they lose.

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.260 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't know that
I could answer that.

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:58.770 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that
our attitude infects,

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:03.550 align:middle line:84%
and that's a good word,
everything in our lives.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:06.975 align:middle line:84%
And so no doubt, if I'm
confident and positive,

00:11:06.975 --> 00:11:10.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to
interpret the outcome

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:15.290 align:middle line:84%
in a confident, positive way,
regardless of whether I won big

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:19.390 align:middle line:84%
or I just minimized
my losses, OK.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.130 align:middle line:84%
That could have
something to play.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:23.720 align:middle line:84%
We call that the
expectation factor.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.050 align:middle line:84%
But there's also
a lot of research

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:29.030 align:middle line:84%
that shows the mind
influences such things

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:31.640 align:middle line:90%
as random number generators.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:37.600 align:middle line:84%
So there is a level
of science that

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.180 align:middle line:84%
wants to live look
at the mind as being

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:44.340 align:middle line:90%
an artifact of the organ brain.

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And as a pure artifact
of the organ brain,

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:51.060 align:middle line:84%
obviously, there's no such
thing as mind at a distance.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:55.610 align:middle line:10%
However, there is all sorts of
evidence that demonstrates mind

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:59.380 align:middle line:10%
at a distance in operation.

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't just
remote viewing.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.105 align:middle line:84%
I know you've had Ed
Dames on your show.

00:12:03.105 --> 00:12:05.780 align:middle line:84%
It isn't just remote
viewing kinds of things.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:10.730 align:middle line:84%
It's you can take
a tongue depressor

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.900 align:middle line:84%
and remove glial
cells from my mouth,

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.980 align:middle line:84%
place them in a
Petri dish, divide

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:21.640 align:middle line:84%
that in half, take half of them
up to five miles away-- this

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:26.970 align:middle line:84%
has actually been done--
electronically stimulate

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:30.650 align:middle line:84%
those cells-- they
don't like electricity--

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:34.330 align:middle line:84%
and the cells you're
stimulating, say in the lab,

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.880 align:middle line:84%
will respond, and the
cells five miles away

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:41.920 align:middle line:84%
will respond at the same
time in the same way.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Now that's clearly an indication
that mind is not a local event.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.070 align:middle line:90%
So George, I don't know.

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:51.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be
the guy that says,

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.690 align:middle line:84%
oh, your mind gets
into the computers

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:56.400 align:middle line:90%
or those slot machines.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And most of the big
winners come off the slot

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:02.340 align:middle line:90%
machines, not the 21 table.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.460 align:middle line:90%
But who knows?

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:08.770 align:middle line:84%
Give me one of your examples
of good and bad luck.

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think
good and bad luck,

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:17.320 align:middle line:84%
for the most part, influences
how we perceive our worlds

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.750 align:middle line:84%
and the way we conduct
ourselves in it.

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:24.500 align:middle line:84%
If I feel that I am
a victim of bad luck,

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:29.410 align:middle line:84%
I respond in a way that is
not conducive to my best

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:32.780 align:middle line:84%
outcome And doesn't have
my highest best in it.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And if I respond as though
there is luck in everything that

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:42.410 align:middle line:84%
comes to me, there is some good
in everything that comes to me,

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:45.630 align:middle line:90%
well then, that outcome changes.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And what we have instead is a
direction that flows from it

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:53.130 align:middle line:84%
that it is positive,
beneficial and does

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:57.640 align:middle line:84%
support the goals,
optimum goals of our life.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:02.250 align:middle line:84%
There's a story about an old
rancher, back Civil War days.

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And this rancher,
farmer has got a boy.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And he can't get around
because of arthritis.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:10.950 align:middle line:84%
But his son is taking
care of the farm.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:12.985 align:middle line:84%
And they're just
barely getting by.

00:14:12.985 --> 00:14:14.720 align:middle line:90%
That's most farms, too.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, especially in those days.

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.650 align:middle line:90%
And it's time to seed.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And so his boy goes out
one day, hooks the mules

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:28.590 align:middle line:84%
on that old plow and
starts working the field,

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:33.000 align:middle line:84%
and a storm comes up, lightning
strikes, scares those mules,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.700 align:middle line:84%
they bolt, and the old
harness can't hold them,

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:40.075 align:middle line:84%
plow tips forward, a harness
breaks, the horses bolt

00:14:40.075 --> 00:14:41.740 align:middle line:90%
and run away.

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:44.940 align:middle line:84%
Everybody in the town
turns out, such bad luck.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, if you
can't farm that ground,

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:51.540 align:middle line:84%
how are you going to
be able to stay or eat?

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:54.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, the next day,
those mules came back.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:58.360 align:middle line:10%
And behind them came a
whole herd of wild horses.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.710 align:middle line:10%
So the old farmer and
his boy, they ran out.

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:02.280 align:middle line:90%
They got the corral gates open.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.020 align:middle line:90%
The horses follow the mules in.

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.810 align:middle line:84%
They closed them up and
the whole town turned out.

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:09.260 align:middle line:90%
What good luck.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.210 align:middle line:90%
Horses were a premium.

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, the boy decides,
you know, I'm going

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.260 align:middle line:90%
to have to break these horses.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.050 align:middle line:90%
I sell them to the army.

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:18.920 align:middle line:84%
So he goes out the
next day to break them,

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.660 align:middle line:84%
the first one's a sun
fisher, flips over backwards,

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.755 align:middle line:90%
breaks his arm, breaks his leg.

00:15:23.755 --> 00:15:25.850 align:middle line:90%
Whole town turns out.

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.120 align:middle line:90%
Such bad luck.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.960 align:middle line:84%
No farmer, good luck,
bad luck, who knows?

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:36.990 align:middle line:84%
You just have to wait
to see for the outcome.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, the next day,
the army marches in.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And they subscript
every able-bodied person

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:46.060 align:middle line:90%
and they're headed for Shiloh.

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:46.920 align:middle line:90%
Murder.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.380 align:middle line:90%
Hardly any come back.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.840 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.320 align:middle line:84%
They didn't take the
boy, because he had

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.130 align:middle line:90%
a broken arm and a broken leg.

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And the whole town,
such good luck.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:16:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And the old farmer, good
luck, bad luck, who knows?

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.090 align:middle line:90%
There's a message there.

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:05.010 align:middle line:90%
There is, George, there is.

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And if we live our lives
as though-- good luck,

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:11.080 align:middle line:84%
there is some luck,
there is some good.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Let me share another quick
one with you, if I can.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.570 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was a pretty
jaded criminalist.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.000 align:middle line:90%
And what's a criminalist?

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's
someone that practices

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.510 align:middle line:90%
police science privately.

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:28.170 align:middle line:84%
Well sometimes with
law enforcement.

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:31.770 align:middle line:84%
But usually, it's the
guy that carries the gun.

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:34.080 align:middle line:84%
It's the guy that runs
the lie detection test.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.310 align:middle line:84%
It's the guy that does the
profiling of the criminal.

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:38.760 align:middle line:90%
You see this on the television.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.389 align:middle line:84%
-The behind-the-scenes guy.
-Yeah.

00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:44.680 align:middle line:84%
A criminologist, he gets
his sociology training.

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And we talk about
penology and things

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:48.820 align:middle line:84%
of that nature,
where the criminalist

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.040 align:middle line:90%
is actually in the field, OK.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.200 align:middle line:84%
So I was a kind of
jaded criminalist.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And not many things were working
in my life, except money.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.280 align:middle line:90%
I was making money.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.460 align:middle line:90%
I was successful.

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.910 align:middle line:90%
But nothing else.

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And it was a pretty sucky
life, to be truthful.

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I needed to make
some changes in my life.

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:09.569 align:middle line:90%
I was paranoid.

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:10.890 align:middle line:90%
I was suspicious.

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:12.470 align:middle line:90%
Totally unhappy.

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:15.310 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't make a relationship
work for any reason.

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:19.000 align:middle line:84%
I didn't trust anybody
for anything, George.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.819 align:middle line:90%
So I sought some help.

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And this person, counselor,
if you will, said to me,

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Eldon, if you're going
to change your life,

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.710 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
to change your outlook.

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Instead of seeing things
black and white as you do,

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:36.470 align:middle line:90%
some things are grey.

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:39.680 align:middle line:84%
You're just going to have
to trust that things happen

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.660 align:middle line:90%
to you for a good reason.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.440 align:middle line:84%
They happen to all of
us for a good reason.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.320 align:middle line:84%
He says, you've got
to be kidding, Connie.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.590 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to tell
me everything is good?

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:49.120 align:middle line:90%
Well, it can be good.

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.640 align:middle line:90%
It can have good outcomes.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.950 align:middle line:90%
I want you to do this, she says.

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:56.370 align:middle line:84%
From now on, when anything
happens to you that you're

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:59.600 align:middle line:84%
going to take negatively, I
want you to say to yourself,

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.080 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait to see what
good comes from this.

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Because just that little
shift in your attitude

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.646 align:middle line:84%
make a big difference
in the outcome.

00:18:07.646 --> 00:18:08.800 align:middle line:84%
Huge difference.
No doubt.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.356 align:middle line:90%
So I left her.

00:18:10.356 --> 00:18:12.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm driving into my office.

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:15.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a strip mall
and as you drive in,

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.690 align:middle line:84%
right here in the front of
the mall is this restaurant.

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And as I pass the restaurant,
this old rig backs out,

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:29.980 align:middle line:84%
slams into the side of my new
Eldorado Biarritz, chrome roof.

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:32.400 align:middle line:90%
I am-- OK.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.350 align:middle line:84%
I say to myself, George,
I can't wait to see

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:38.840 align:middle line:90%
what good comes from this.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.500 align:middle line:90%
And I get out of the car.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.430 align:middle line:84%
Now maybe a week
earlier, I would

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:45.590 align:middle line:84%
have got out of the car with
a whole different attitude.

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And the fellow that
just backed into me,

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.790 align:middle line:84%
he's shaking a finger
at me and accusing

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:54.140 align:middle line:90%
me of hiding my car behind his.

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:57.560 align:middle line:84%
So he-- well, it just
happened, two law enforcement

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.970 align:middle line:84%
officers were coming out of the
restaurant, they saw it happen.

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:02.550 align:middle line:84%
I ended up in the
car with one of them,

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:04.490 align:middle line:84%
and we were rolling
about this guy

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:07.720 align:middle line:84%
just-- I hid behind
his old jalopy

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.710 align:middle line:90%
so he could run into my new car.

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:12.300 align:middle line:90%
Today, I think about that.

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And I've shared that story
with many, many people.

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:19.900 align:middle line:84%
The body has two budgets
analogous to a government.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.940 align:middle line:84%
One is for growth,
one is for defense.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:26.910 align:middle line:84%
The minute I pour on all those
negative neuro chemicals, all

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:30.920 align:middle line:84%
those defense neuro chemicals,
the adrenalines, et cetera,

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.390 align:middle line:90%
the body goes to defense.

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:35.530 align:middle line:90%
And three things happen.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:38.660 align:middle line:84%
The optimal operation
of our endocrine,

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:42.741 align:middle line:84%
our immune, and our autonomic
nervous system cease to work.

00:19:42.741 --> 00:19:44.550 align:middle line:84%
-They stop.
-That's right.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:51.510 align:middle line:84%
So when I am in growth, all
of these things work best.

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:53.970 align:middle line:84%
So if I just stop
and say, what's

00:19:53.970 --> 00:20:00.410 align:middle line:84%
the pragmatic way to deal with
negativity, with bad luck?

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's to take a good
luck attitude towards it.

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:04.500 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm going
to live longer,

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to live healthier,
I'm going to be happier.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.460 align:middle line:90%
You know, stuff happens.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.350 align:middle line:90%
We all deal with it.

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:16.830 align:middle line:84%
But we also all move through
it, if we choose to, George.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:21.640 align:middle line:84%
I tell a story in
"Choices and Illusions."

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.430 align:middle line:84%
A lie detection friend
of mine from South Africa

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:28.240 align:middle line:84%
was here a few years ago
in my home and offices.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.891 align:middle line:84%
And he was doing some
seminars with law enforcement

00:20:31.891 --> 00:20:32.590 align:middle line:90%
down there.

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And law enforcement
had-- one of the reasons

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:38.830 align:middle line:84%
he was in was to get a program
from me that they could use

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:41.450 align:middle line:84%
in their interrogation
so they quit beating

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:43.010 align:middle line:90%
confessions out of people.

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:46.110 align:middle line:84%
So law enforcement there
is not law enforcement

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:47.810 align:middle line:90%
here, all right.

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:49.490 align:middle line:90%
They get away with things--

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:50.860 align:middle line:90%
That most departments can't.

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:54.090 align:middle line:90%
Their modus operandi is-- OK.

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:55.020 align:middle line:90%
Intimidation.

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:58.670 align:middle line:84%
He was attempting to
motivate law enforcement

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:00.980 align:middle line:84%
to move away from
these kinds of things

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:02.250 align:middle line:90%
and to change their attitudes.

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And in order to communicate
with them about that,

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:06.240 align:middle line:90%
he had a model.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.920 align:middle line:84%
You called it the
escalator of life.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.320 align:middle line:90%
And I love this model.

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Because there are folks
that go through life

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.540 align:middle line:90%
collecting cookies.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.700 align:middle line:84%
We'll call them bad cookies,
or crumbling cookies.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.220 align:middle line:84%
He called them the
big S word that we

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:22.820 align:middle line:90%
can't use in media, cookies.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And they are so intent
on filling their backpack

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:27.650 align:middle line:90%
with these cookies.

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:29.790 align:middle line:84%
Because each one of
these cookies means

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.910 align:middle line:90%
they garner more attention.

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:34.820 align:middle line:84%
Because they could top
the story of whoever

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:36.630 align:middle line:90%
is suffering in their group.

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:38.570 align:middle line:84%
You know that cop
that stopped me today?

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I've got a
better one than that.

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And so here comes a
bad deal, a possible.

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And they'll jump on that
escalator to grab that cookie

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:52.260 align:middle line:84%
and put it in their
back, so that they

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:56.180 align:middle line:84%
can, again, embellish that story
and share it with their group.

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:59.300 align:middle line:84%
There is a mentality
in our population

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:02.730 align:middle line:84%
that deals primarily
from that perspective,

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:06.100 align:middle line:90%
to talk about good things.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.340 align:middle line:90%
Life's wonderful.

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:09.310 align:middle line:90%
Living is just fantastic.

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:11.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm really
enjoying my work.

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm really loving my family.

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:17.180 align:middle line:90%
Who wants to hear that?

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:18.950 align:middle line:90%
That's same old same.

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:21.060 align:middle line:84%
So we don't see
that in television.

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, my first
radio show was

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:26.360 align:middle line:84%
called "The Good
News Hour," broadcast

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:30.420 align:middle line:90%
out of Utah on KTKK radio.

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:33.330 align:middle line:84%
We ran out of good news, George.
-Fast.

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:34.330 align:middle line:90%
Fast.

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:35.110 align:middle line:90%
Fast.

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:37.720 align:middle line:10%
We were dependent on
callers calling in.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.210 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever see a newscast,
a television newscast,

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:41.940 align:middle line:90%
lead with a good story?

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Never.
Never.

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:44.230 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.230 align:middle line:90%
And it gets worse.

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Today, the media's
about sensationalism.

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:52.230 align:middle line:84%
You and I have talked
before, so you know this.

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:57.140 align:middle line:84%
But an example of that is
Stallone's "First Blood"

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:58.240 align:middle line:90%
movies.

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.030 align:middle line:84%
In the first one,
one person is killed.

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:09.520 align:middle line:84%
By the time we get to his fourth
movie, over 100 are killed.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:13.250 align:middle line:84%
We also see that same
logarithmic increase

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:16.450 align:middle line:84%
in the number of people he
kills with his shirt off.

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And if you see the first
one versus the last one,

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:20.930 align:middle line:84%
you can see he's
doing a lot of things

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:23.820 align:middle line:84%
to make that shirt off
look more impressive.

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:29.460 align:middle line:84%
We live in a society where
our threshold of arousal

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:33.530 align:middle line:84%
is systematically requiring
more and more stimulus.

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:36.920 align:middle line:84%
Because it's been
desensitized over the years.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Marilyn Monroe, and the
skirt flutters into the air.

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:45.060 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's seen that.

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:47.330 align:middle line:84%
That's nothing titillating
about that today.

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:50.400 align:middle line:84%
Look at what goes on
in prime time TV today.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.100 align:middle line:84%
The sad thing is,
we begin to expect

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.270 align:middle line:90%
that as a normal way of life.

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:58.880 align:middle line:84%
We begin to require
that or we're bored.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.390 align:middle line:90%


00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And that, too, is
one of our choices.

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.540 align:middle line:90%
We can choose otherwise.

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:11.690 align:middle line:84%
With "Choices and Illusions,"
the successful people,

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:14.660 align:middle line:84%
have they made the right
choices in their lives?

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:16.310 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes yes, sometimes no.

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:18.701 align:middle line:84%
They're just screwed up as
everybody else sometimes,

00:24:18.701 --> 00:24:19.400 align:middle line:90%
aren't they?

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.860 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there are lots
of folks out there

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:21.795 align:middle line:90%
that have made it big.

00:24:21.795 --> 00:24:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And they made it
big in athletics.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.690 align:middle line:90%
But they're not happy.

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:25.460 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:26.160 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.560 align:middle line:90%
Or they made fortunes.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:33.860 align:middle line:10%
And I've talked to elite
athletes, hall of fame athletes

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:38.580 align:middle line:10%
who, life sucks.

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:39.790 align:middle line:10%
Nothing works for them.

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:41.640 align:middle line:10%
They were good on the field.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.170 align:middle line:90%
It's truly amazing.

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:44.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And you would think,
we see them as heroes.

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:50.160 align:middle line:10%
I've talked to multi
millionaires who--

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.840 align:middle line:10%
And they're self-destructive.

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:53.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:56.870 align:middle line:84%
They made the wrong
choices because

00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:00.350 align:middle line:84%
of the order of their
priorities and because

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:05.130 align:middle line:84%
of the way that we think,
the way that we are funneled

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:07.080 align:middle line:90%
into seeing alternatives.

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.480 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Eldon, thank you again for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Both shows have been
just superb with you.

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:15.290 align:middle line:84%
It's my pleasure indeed.
Thank you, sir.

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:16.520 align:middle line:90%
I love everything you do.

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:20.420 align:middle line:10%
This latest work, called
"Choices and Illusions."

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.190 align:middle line:10%
We do have choices.

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:24.780 align:middle line:10%
But there are
illusions, as well.

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:29.450 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:35.000 align:middle line:90%
