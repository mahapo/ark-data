to believe anymore.

>> George Noory: Hardly a day
goes by without somebody coming

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.161 align:middle line:84%
up to me talking about
weather manipulation,

00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:29.230 align:middle line:84%
and the possibility of
chemtrails,

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.966 align:middle line:84%
and our next guest on
"Beyond Belief" has a lot

00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:34.135 align:middle line:90%
of experience in these areas.

00:00:34.135 --> 00:00:35.836 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:00:35.836 --> 00:00:36.971 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens:
I'm Scott Stevens.

00:00:36.971 --> 00:00:39.907 align:middle line:84%
I was a television
weatherman for 20 years.

00:00:39.907 --> 00:00:43.377 align:middle line:84%
These chemtrails are
absolutely required

00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:47.848 align:middle line:84%
to impact whatever weather
event they were designing.

00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:52.353 align:middle line:84%
And the trails were an absolute
necessary ingredient for them

00:00:52.353 --> 00:00:55.890 align:middle line:84%
to achieve their weather
modification goals.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.627 align:middle line:84%
So we're finding the aerosols,
the metal particulates,

00:00:59.627 --> 00:01:02.263 align:middle line:84%
the weather engineering, whether
it's scalar, ionic,

00:01:02.263 --> 00:01:04.765 align:middle line:84%
or orgon, or the
chi of the atmosphere.

00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:07.935 align:middle line:84%
All of those can be
used and leveraged

00:01:07.935 --> 00:01:11.739 align:middle line:84%
to create weather events that
are several standard deviations

00:01:11.739 --> 00:01:14.775 align:middle line:84%
or outside what would
be typically normal.

00:01:14.775 --> 00:01:15.976 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
As you just heard,

00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:18.379 align:middle line:84%
his name is Scott Stevens,
and he is a weatherman.

00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:20.181 align:middle line:84%
Scott, how did you
get into this?

00:01:20.181 --> 00:01:21.248 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens:
George, believe it

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:22.782 align:middle line:84%
or not it was the Boy
Scout merit batch.

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:26.453 align:middle line:84%
I was 12 years old looking to
get to my Eagle Scout award,

00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:28.022 align:middle line:84%
and I'm looking through
merit badges,

00:01:28.022 --> 00:01:30.457 align:middle line:84%
and I'm reading requirements
for weather.

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:31.992 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, "I could do that."

00:01:31.992 --> 00:01:35.262 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the requirements
was to watch the weatherman,

00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:37.231 align:middle line:84%
log reports, and then
build a weather station,

00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:39.066 align:middle line:90%
and keep your own journal."

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:40.501 align:middle line:90%
And so through July of --

00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:42.603 align:middle line:84%
I think it was 1979
is when I did that.

00:01:42.603 --> 00:01:45.639 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of that month,
habits had been formed.

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:48.609 align:middle line:84%
I was taking high and low,
and precipitation readings,

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:50.144 align:middle line:90%
and watching the news.

00:01:50.144 --> 00:01:51.712 align:middle line:90%
And I got addicted.

00:01:51.712 --> 00:01:54.381 align:middle line:84%
It was just a habit I
began, and I started looking

00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:57.451 align:middle line:84%
and noticing, and I
found another love.

00:01:57.451 --> 00:01:59.220 align:middle line:84%
At the same time I had
come across astronomy,

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.590 align:middle line:84%
so they were 2 things that, you
know, had me looking skyward.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:03.791 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Why do people get

00:02:03.791 --> 00:02:06.827 align:middle line:90%
so fascinated with the weather?

00:02:06.827 --> 00:02:08.529 align:middle line:90%
That's all they talk about.

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:09.597 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: Well,
it's the one thing

00:02:09.597 --> 00:02:11.432 align:middle line:90%
that we all have in common.

00:02:11.432 --> 00:02:13.534 align:middle line:84%
When we step outside and
we're all experiencing the

00:02:13.534 --> 00:02:14.935 align:middle line:90%
same environment.

00:02:14.935 --> 00:02:17.137 align:middle line:84%
So it's something that
we can talk about,

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:18.639 align:middle line:90%
and we have that common ground.

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:20.674 align:middle line:84%
And if we're coming from
different locations,

00:02:20.674 --> 00:02:23.043 align:middle line:84%
then we can compare, "Oh,
this is coming your way," or,

00:02:23.043 --> 00:02:24.111 align:middle line:90%
"How is your winter going?"

00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:25.613 align:middle line:84%
"Oh, we haven't had
snow," or, "Oh, man,

00:02:25.613 --> 00:02:26.881 align:middle line:90%
we are so cold and frozen up."

00:02:26.881 --> 00:02:29.383 align:middle line:84%
So it's some dialogue
that we can begin

00:02:29.383 --> 00:02:30.885 align:middle line:90%
and keep on with small talk.

00:02:30.885 --> 00:02:32.253 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
When you got involved

00:02:32.253 --> 00:02:34.021 align:middle line:90%
with weather forecasting --

00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:35.054 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: Yes.

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:36.323 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: --
did you ever think

00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:39.426 align:middle line:84%
that you would be investigating
weather manipulation --

00:02:39.426 --> 00:02:40.261 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: Yes.

00:02:40.261 --> 00:02:41.395 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: -- chemtrails?

00:02:41.395 --> 00:02:43.097 align:middle line:84%
You just thought, "Hey,
I'm going to go and talk

00:02:43.097 --> 00:02:46.133 align:middle line:84%
about today's high
front and low front,

00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:48.302 align:middle line:84%
and just talk about
the weather."

00:02:48.302 --> 00:02:49.737 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens:
Truly; you know,

00:02:49.737 --> 00:02:52.239 align:middle line:84%
the forecasting came
rather easy for me.

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.075 align:middle line:84%
It was something that I had
a mentor through high school.

00:02:55.075 --> 00:02:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, I had a very,
very beautiful teacher.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.683 align:middle line:84%
His name was Ken Torrey, and I
had called Ken because I wanted

00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:04.485 align:middle line:90%
to use my local town

00:03:04.485 --> 00:03:06.887 align:middle line:84%
and be the weather
watcher for that location.

00:03:06.887 --> 00:03:08.222 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Sure.

00:03:08.222 --> 00:03:09.056 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: He said,
"No, Scott, I don't have room

00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:10.224 align:middle line:90%
for another town, but come on in

00:03:10.224 --> 00:03:11.392 align:middle line:84%
and I'll give you a
tour of the station."

00:03:11.392 --> 00:03:12.191 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yes.

00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:13.294 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: And so --

00:03:13.294 --> 00:03:14.228 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: You loved it.

00:03:14.228 --> 00:03:15.328 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: TV!

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:16.931 align:middle line:84%
I did love it, because
there's a part of me

00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:18.499 align:middle line:90%
that was the performance aspect

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:20.234 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't know
was really there.

00:03:20.234 --> 00:03:22.569 align:middle line:84%
And that allowed
that to begin to bud.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.172 align:middle line:84%
So I ended up being, you know,
photographer, news shooter,

00:03:25.172 --> 00:03:26.707 align:middle line:90%
getting to do some editing.

00:03:26.707 --> 00:03:28.976 align:middle line:90%
And so that was the fascination.

00:03:28.976 --> 00:03:32.246 align:middle line:84%
But once I got to
Kansas and to school,

00:03:32.246 --> 00:03:35.349 align:middle line:84%
that first semester there we
had a forecasting contest.

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.651 align:middle line:84%
And Ken had taught me
so well that I ended

00:03:37.651 --> 00:03:39.153 align:middle line:90%
up second place nationally --

00:03:39.153 --> 00:03:40.154 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Good for you.

00:03:40.154 --> 00:03:40.955 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens:
-- as a freshman.

00:03:40.955 --> 00:03:41.789 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Nationally.

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:43.157 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: Nationally.

00:03:43.157 --> 00:03:44.825 align:middle line:84%
You know, so it's something
that yes, you look at the sky,

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:47.127 align:middle line:84%
you look at the charts,
you interpret the models,

00:03:47.127 --> 00:03:49.830 align:middle line:84%
but there's an intuitive
aspect of forecasting.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.131 align:middle line:84%
And that's not something
you're taught,

00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:52.199 align:middle line:90%
that's something either you have

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.501 align:middle line:84%
and you learn to
cultivate, or not.

00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:59.173 align:middle line:84%
And what I learned, unknowingly,
was to forecast the extremes.

00:03:59.173 --> 00:04:02.676 align:middle line:84%
And I got busted a couple of
times when I was in Tulsa.

00:04:02.676 --> 00:04:03.677 align:middle line:90%
The main guy, I would come in

00:04:03.677 --> 00:04:05.479 align:middle line:84%
and completely reworked
his forecast.

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:07.281 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of annoys
the personality --

00:04:07.281 --> 00:04:08.382 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Sure.

00:04:08.382 --> 00:04:09.583 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: --
of that --

00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:10.684 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: But you
were correct, weren't you?

00:04:10.684 --> 00:04:12.086 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: And
for a year I had --

00:04:12.086 --> 00:04:15.422 align:middle line:84%
he had the number 3 guy checking
my numbers, checking my numbers.

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:18.659 align:middle line:84%
And at the -- I saw in the
verification sheet in out

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:20.661 align:middle line:90%
of 12-period 6 days highs

00:04:20.661 --> 00:04:23.731 align:middle line:84%
and lows I beat everybody
in 10 of those slots.

00:04:23.731 --> 00:04:25.466 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Did he like you?

00:04:25.466 --> 00:04:26.166 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: Yes.

00:04:26.166 --> 00:04:27.401 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Okay.

00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:28.202 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: And I
think that enabled an aspect

00:04:28.202 --> 00:04:29.970 align:middle line:90%
of respect to then show up.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.071 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Good.

00:04:31.071 --> 00:04:32.473 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: So
once you can demonstrate

00:04:32.473 --> 00:04:36.076 align:middle line:84%
that you can do this, you know,
then the respect has to come.

00:04:36.076 --> 00:04:38.078 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Scott, before
we get into manipulation

00:04:38.078 --> 00:04:41.448 align:middle line:84%
and the possibility of
chemtrails, we are going

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:44.018 align:middle line:84%
through an incredible time
right now weather wise.

00:04:44.018 --> 00:04:49.957 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I cannot think of a time
where we had so much flux --

00:04:49.957 --> 00:04:51.258 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: Yes.

00:04:51.258 --> 00:04:53.694 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: -- highs
and lows, cold weather

00:04:53.694 --> 00:04:55.162 align:middle line:90%
and then warm weather.

00:04:55.162 --> 00:04:57.798 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just the
Midwest recently --

00:04:57.798 --> 00:04:58.899 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: Yes.

00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:00.034 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: -- was
hit with a horrible,

00:05:00.034 --> 00:05:04.238 align:middle line:84%
horrible 20-year cold
that they haven't seen

00:05:04.238 --> 00:05:06.273 align:middle line:90%
in a long, long time.

00:05:06.273 --> 00:05:09.676 align:middle line:84%
Yet weeks later it popped
back up into the 50s.

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:10.678 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: Yes.

00:05:10.678 --> 00:05:11.645 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
What's happening here?

00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:13.013 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: Well,

00:05:13.013 --> 00:05:15.749 align:middle line:84%
unbeknownst to me this is why
I was forecasting extremes.

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:18.552 align:middle line:84%
You under-forecast the lows and
you over-forecast the highs,

00:05:18.552 --> 00:05:21.021 align:middle line:84%
as these oscillating
events come in.

00:05:21.021 --> 00:05:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think really
what we're suffering

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.026 align:middle line:84%
through is this battering
of the biosphere,

00:05:26.026 --> 00:05:28.929 align:middle line:84%
whether it's incredible,
unprecedented drought

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:31.732 align:middle line:90%
in the West, and then this cold.

00:05:31.732 --> 00:05:33.233 align:middle line:84%
George, I looked at
the stuff before I came

00:05:33.233 --> 00:05:35.636 align:middle line:84%
in today. It is not relaxing
its grip on the East.

00:05:35.636 --> 00:05:36.437 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: No.

00:05:36.437 --> 00:05:37.504 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: And so --

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:38.172 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: It's
still there biting,

00:05:38.172 --> 00:05:39.306 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:05:39.306 --> 00:05:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: Yes;
and we have this nation

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.475 align:middle line:90%
that is literally cut in half.

00:05:41.475 --> 00:05:43.944 align:middle line:84%
And here in Colorado we're kind
of on the fine line between,

00:05:43.944 --> 00:05:46.547 align:middle line:84%
where we get that beautiful
warm weather that shouldn't be

00:05:46.547 --> 00:05:50.217 align:middle line:84%
in place in the winter, and out
East where it's as it should be,

00:05:50.217 --> 00:05:52.086 align:middle line:90%
it has been for centuries.

00:05:52.086 --> 00:05:53.319 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: When
you hear the phrase,

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:55.689 align:middle line:84%
"weather manipulation,"
what does that mean to you?

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.357 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: I laughed
the first time I heard that.

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:58.959 align:middle line:84%
I said, "There's absolutely
no way that's possible."

00:05:58.959 --> 00:05:59.927 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: "You
people are crazy."

00:05:59.927 --> 00:06:00.627 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: Truly.

00:06:00.627 --> 00:06:02.362 align:middle line:90%
"Do you not understand?"

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:03.330 align:middle line:90%
And --

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.331 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
"You were listening

00:06:04.331 --> 00:06:05.099 align:middle line:84%
to that 'Coast To
Coast' radio show.

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:06.200 align:middle line:90%
That's what you people do.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.401 align:middle line:90%
You're crazy."

00:06:07.401 --> 00:06:10.571 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: [Laughs]
But I came across that.

00:06:10.571 --> 00:06:12.973 align:middle line:84%
I've always been an
alternative media kind of guy.

00:06:12.973 --> 00:06:14.708 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you're
in mainstream media,

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:16.310 align:middle line:90%
you know how much is left out.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.879 align:middle line:84%
And when you've got 90
seconds to tell a story,

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:19.980 align:middle line:90%
you can tell one side.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.348 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: That's right.

00:06:21.348 --> 00:06:22.749 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: And maybe a
sentence or 2 for the other.

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:24.651 align:middle line:84%
And so that always left
me wondering, "You know,

00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:28.789 align:middle line:84%
what's the rest of the
story," the Paul Harvey phrase.

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:33.861 align:middle line:84%
And so I was engaged in
researching free energy.

00:06:33.861 --> 00:06:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought if we're into
free energy, if we can be free

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.700 align:middle line:84%
of petroleum and natural gas,
then we can change the world.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.302 align:middle line:84%
And I came across this
Soviet weather engineering

00:06:42.302 --> 00:06:43.537 align:middle line:90%
from Colonel Beardon.

00:06:43.537 --> 00:06:46.073 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, "That's
a little bizarre."

00:06:46.073 --> 00:06:47.174 align:middle line:90%
And reading his stuff,

00:06:47.174 --> 00:06:48.675 align:middle line:84%
his physics honestly
was over my head.

00:06:48.675 --> 00:06:50.110 align:middle line:84%
That was not something
I was familiar with.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.345 align:middle line:84%
I had been out of school
long enough that --

00:06:51.345 --> 00:06:53.113 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: But he
was spot on, right?

00:06:53.113 --> 00:06:54.982 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: He was --
there was something to it.

00:06:54.982 --> 00:06:55.816 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yes.

00:06:55.816 --> 00:06:56.917 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: And it was --

00:06:56.917 --> 00:06:57.684 align:middle line:84%
the pictures that
were on his website

00:06:57.684 --> 00:06:59.520 align:middle line:90%
that had me going, "Hmm."

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.522 align:middle line:84%
So I got onto eBay and
bought a digital camera.

00:07:01.522 --> 00:07:03.724 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can go through
film like nobody's business.

00:07:03.724 --> 00:07:04.925 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yes.

00:07:04.925 --> 00:07:05.759 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: So
digital was working for me.

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:06.593 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: That

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:07.861 align:middle line:90%
saved you some money, didn't it?

00:07:07.861 --> 00:07:09.062 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: Oh,
goodness; and time, and time,

00:07:09.062 --> 00:07:11.698 align:middle line:84%
and not go off to Kodak to get
it developed.

00:07:11.698 --> 00:07:15.736 align:middle line:84%
And so I start seeing in my
skies in eastern Idaho the same

00:07:15.736 --> 00:07:18.105 align:middle line:90%
stuff that was on his website.

00:07:18.105 --> 00:07:20.607 align:middle line:84%
And then the shapes
were not round,

00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:22.576 align:middle line:90%
they became square and oblong --

00:07:22.576 --> 00:07:23.243 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Bizarre.

00:07:23.243 --> 00:07:24.311 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: --

00:07:24.311 --> 00:07:25.913 align:middle line:84%
and tubular, and --
yes, truly bizarre.

00:07:25.913 --> 00:07:28.882 align:middle line:84%
And in Beardon's work there was
this scalar weaponry

00:07:28.882 --> 00:07:31.418 align:middle line:84%
that you can literally
send 2 beams that cross

00:07:31.418 --> 00:07:34.221 align:middle line:84%
and they intersect, and
you can play with time.

00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And in his work there is
the etheric field.

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.592 align:middle line:90%
There is the morphogenic field,

00:07:38.592 --> 00:07:41.795 align:middle line:84%
the field that -- you know, in
meteorology it's thermodynamics,

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:45.098 align:middle line:84%
it's heat and humidity, and the
mixing and the movement of such.

00:07:45.098 --> 00:07:48.235 align:middle line:84%
He was looking at a
whole different energy.

00:07:48.235 --> 00:07:52.172 align:middle line:84%
And that had me thinking,
"Hmm, I wonder what if?"

00:07:52.172 --> 00:07:56.009 align:middle line:84%
And so endothermic mode,
these antenna, these energy,

00:07:56.009 --> 00:07:57.978 align:middle line:84%
these waves can pull
heat out of a zone

00:07:57.978 --> 00:07:59.646 align:middle line:90%
and deposit it somewhere else.

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:02.382 align:middle line:84%
And in his imagery there were
huge stacks in Northern Siberia

00:08:02.382 --> 00:08:05.219 align:middle line:84%
where this heat was being
vented into the Arctic,

00:08:05.219 --> 00:08:08.422 align:middle line:84%
and leaving steam trails that
were hundreds of miles long.

00:08:08.422 --> 00:08:09.623 align:middle line:90%
The other mode is exothermic

00:08:09.623 --> 00:08:12.226 align:middle line:84%
mode where you're
depositing heat in a storm.

00:08:12.226 --> 00:08:17.064 align:middle line:84%
And so '99, 2000, 2001, storms
coming in off the Pacific,

00:08:17.064 --> 00:08:18.298 align:middle line:90%
I'm forecasting, you know,

00:08:18.298 --> 00:08:20.033 align:middle line:84%
a nice winter storm
for eastern Idaho.

00:08:20.033 --> 00:08:22.769 align:middle line:84%
We've got ski resorts, you
know, counting on storms.

00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:23.971 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Sure.

00:08:23.971 --> 00:08:24.605 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: We've
got farmers wanting water

00:08:24.605 --> 00:08:25.706 align:middle line:90%
in the watersheds.

00:08:25.706 --> 00:08:27.473 align:middle line:84%
We've got kids that want
to get out of school

00:08:27.473 --> 00:08:28.775 align:middle line:84%
because we've got
a storm coming.

00:08:28.775 --> 00:08:29.876 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: They
want that snow day.

00:08:29.876 --> 00:08:31.545 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens:
Doesn't happen.

00:08:31.545 --> 00:08:34.781 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm thinking,
"WTF, what's happening?"

00:08:34.781 --> 00:08:38.452 align:middle line:84%
So, I keep getting like these
forecasts are missing it.

00:08:38.452 --> 00:08:39.987 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, "Something's up.

00:08:39.987 --> 00:08:44.191 align:middle line:84%
There's some delta, there's some
input that we're not grasping."

00:08:44.191 --> 00:08:47.661 align:middle line:84%
So I see the resonance picture
or the resonance patterns

00:08:47.661 --> 00:08:52.132 align:middle line:84%
in the sky, and finally,
finally by about 2004,

00:08:52.132 --> 00:08:53.934 align:middle line:90%
I see that something --

00:08:53.934 --> 00:08:57.137 align:middle line:84%
well, let's rewind. Let's go
to maybe 2002 and 3.

00:08:57.137 --> 00:09:00.641 align:middle line:84%
A storm's coming through,
and it's 1, 2 in the morning.

00:09:00.641 --> 00:09:02.509 align:middle line:84%
I'm off work, I'm home,
I'm watching them,

00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:03.777 align:middle line:90%
waiting for the snow to begin.

00:09:03.777 --> 00:09:04.611 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Should be predictable.

00:09:04.611 --> 00:09:05.913 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: I'm waiting.

00:09:05.913 --> 00:09:07.848 align:middle line:84%
Yes; should be predictable,
hence why we do our jobs.

00:09:07.848 --> 00:09:08.949 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yes.

00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:11.485 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: And
I'm hearing planes.

00:09:11.485 --> 00:09:13.754 align:middle line:84%
I'm hearing planes at 2 in
the morning eastern Idaho.

00:09:13.754 --> 00:09:15.455 align:middle line:90%
I'm not on any flight path.

00:09:15.455 --> 00:09:16.757 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:09:16.757 --> 00:09:19.059 align:middle line:84%
Look up and you can see
stars through the clouds.

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:20.193 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yes.

00:09:20.193 --> 00:09:21.194 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: And
it should be snowing.

00:09:21.194 --> 00:09:22.529 align:middle line:84%
There's no definition
to the clouds.

00:09:22.529 --> 00:09:23.897 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, "What's
happened to the storm?

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:26.600 align:middle line:84%
It's just falling apart
right on top of us."

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.934 align:middle line:90%
On the eastern edge

00:09:27.934 --> 00:09:29.736 align:middle line:84%
of the mountains we should
have this orographic lift --

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:30.871 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Right; huge, yes.

00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:32.773 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: --
so we get the push.

00:09:32.773 --> 00:09:34.107 align:middle line:90%
That's not happening.

00:09:34.107 --> 00:09:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And so in the infrared satellite
imagery you can see these

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:39.379 align:middle line:90%
warming holes showing up.

00:09:39.379 --> 00:09:41.848 align:middle line:84%
And I'm ending up
under these holes.

00:09:41.848 --> 00:09:42.983 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm like, "Okay.

00:09:42.983 --> 00:09:45.285 align:middle line:90%
So why is this storm warming?"

00:09:45.285 --> 00:09:47.387 align:middle line:84%
In hindsight, it
was this addition

00:09:47.387 --> 00:09:49.923 align:middle line:84%
of this heat being added
to the storm, or --

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:51.491 align:middle line:84%
and because I've not
been briefed on any

00:09:51.491 --> 00:09:53.393 align:middle line:84%
of the technologies
and how it's used,

00:09:53.393 --> 00:09:56.363 align:middle line:84%
it could be that there's an
ionic pulse, something coming

00:09:56.363 --> 00:09:57.931 align:middle line:90%
from a HARP-like apparatus.

00:09:57.931 --> 00:09:58.632 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Somthing shooting.

00:09:58.632 --> 00:09:59.466 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: Yes.

00:09:59.466 --> 00:10:00.267 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Just shooting.

00:10:00.267 --> 00:10:00.967 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about chemtrails.

00:10:00.967 --> 00:10:02.102 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: Okay.

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:02.903 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: But before
we do, let's take a look

00:10:02.903 --> 00:10:05.205 align:middle line:90%
at what we're talking about.

00:10:05.205 --> 00:10:06.406 align:middle line:90%
>> Before jumping

00:10:06.406 --> 00:10:08.375 align:middle line:84%
on the chemtrail bandwagon
was I needed a motive.

00:10:08.375 --> 00:10:10.777 align:middle line:84%
Without a motive you can't
say what they're doing

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:11.745 align:middle line:90%
and why they're doing it.

00:10:11.745 --> 00:10:13.113 align:middle line:90%
You have to have a motive.

00:10:13.113 --> 00:10:16.183 align:middle line:90%
So the agenda was drought.

00:10:16.183 --> 00:10:19.152 align:middle line:84%
The agenda was to
kill the storm,

00:10:19.152 --> 00:10:20.721 align:middle line:84%
at least in that
one particular spot.

00:10:20.721 --> 00:10:22.422 align:middle line:84%
And you can kill
a storm in place.

00:10:22.422 --> 00:10:23.590 align:middle line:90%
That's easy to do with HARP.

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:25.058 align:middle line:84%
You just change the
polarization,

00:10:25.058 --> 00:10:27.060 align:middle line:84%
you change the
ionization in the atmosphere,

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.527 align:middle line:90%
and the storm will fall apart.

00:10:28.527 --> 00:10:31.798 align:middle line:84%
So it's very easy to add those
particulates of aluminum, barium

00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:33.734 align:middle line:84%
and whatever else they
want to put in there.

00:10:33.734 --> 00:10:35.235 align:middle line:90%
And as you add heat to that,

00:10:35.235 --> 00:10:37.471 align:middle line:84%
those particulates
then radiate the heat

00:10:37.471 --> 00:10:40.307 align:middle line:84%
into the atmosphere,
and it warms.

00:10:40.307 --> 00:10:42.743 align:middle line:84%
Let's just say the storms
can develop more violently,

00:10:42.743 --> 00:10:45.512 align:middle line:84%
more quickly, in places
that are not necessarily

00:10:45.512 --> 00:10:48.348 align:middle line:84%
as what you would
expect them to be.

00:10:48.348 --> 00:10:53.652 align:middle line:84%
And we've got technologies
available to us now that can do,

00:10:53.652 --> 00:10:57.557 align:middle line:84%
you know, continent-sized
projects.

00:10:57.557 --> 00:11:00.093 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Truly amazing, Scott.

00:11:00.093 --> 00:11:01.728 align:middle line:90%
What are chemtrails?

00:11:01.728 --> 00:11:02.963 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: Hmm.

00:11:02.963 --> 00:11:05.565 align:middle line:84%
"Chemtrails" is a
term that I truly --

00:11:05.565 --> 00:11:08.301 align:middle line:84%
I found a little disturbing
the first time I saw it.

00:11:08.301 --> 00:11:09.536 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yes.

00:11:09.536 --> 00:11:10.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: I thought,
"Are you kidding me?"

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:11.905 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are
just contrails.

00:11:11.905 --> 00:11:12.873 align:middle line:90%
And --

00:11:12.873 --> 00:11:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Almost unbelievable.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:14.708 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens:
Almost, truly almost;

00:11:14.708 --> 00:11:16.543 align:middle line:90%
and for many it still is.

00:11:16.543 --> 00:11:19.646 align:middle line:84%
And in the late '90s
and the first part

00:11:19.646 --> 00:11:22.916 align:middle line:84%
of the last decade there were
sites that were beginning to pop

00:11:22.916 --> 00:11:24.518 align:middle line:90%
up dealing with this issue.

00:11:24.518 --> 00:11:27.587 align:middle line:84%
So these sites just didn't
know the meteorology.

00:11:27.587 --> 00:11:30.590 align:middle line:84%
They -- goofy terms, didn't
match with the pictures.

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:32.926 align:middle line:84%
And so it was easy
for me to dismiss.

00:11:32.926 --> 00:11:35.262 align:middle line:84%
And it took me quite a while
to get on that bandwagon

00:11:35.262 --> 00:11:36.830 align:middle line:84%
because it just didn't
make any sense.

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:38.899 align:middle line:90%
Why would they be doing this?

00:11:38.899 --> 00:11:44.771 align:middle line:84%
So then in 2004, I'm looking
at some satellite imageries.

00:11:44.771 --> 00:11:46.807 align:middle line:90%
There was a visible picture,

00:11:46.807 --> 00:11:49.910 align:middle line:84%
and it was a cold front
coming through Montana.

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:52.612 align:middle line:84%
And there were these
like taking sliced bread,

00:11:52.612 --> 00:11:55.816 align:middle line:84%
these regular dissections
of these clouds.

00:11:55.816 --> 00:11:59.119 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, "That's way too
regular for a cloud formation

00:11:59.119 --> 00:12:01.321 align:middle line:84%
over the mountain terrain
of western Montana.

00:12:01.321 --> 00:12:02.889 align:middle line:90%
This is not right."

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:06.326 align:middle line:84%
But then there was this square
cloud in the right central part

00:12:06.326 --> 00:12:07.694 align:middle line:90%
of the screen and it's arrowed.

00:12:07.694 --> 00:12:10.764 align:middle line:84%
It was a square cloud and it
was this shadow over Billings,

00:12:10.764 --> 00:12:11.698 align:middle line:90%
Montana --

00:12:11.698 --> 00:12:13.066 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Clouds aren't
square.

00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:14.768 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: Shouldn't
be, George, but now they are.

00:12:14.768 --> 00:12:16.903 align:middle line:84%
And if you go to the west,
or right in the middle

00:12:16.903 --> 00:12:18.939 align:middle line:84%
of the screen, there's
another arrow.

00:12:18.939 --> 00:12:21.608 align:middle line:84%
And that cloud looked like it
had truly been just stamped

00:12:21.608 --> 00:12:25.779 align:middle line:84%
out of that front, and
then set off to the east.

00:12:25.779 --> 00:12:28.248 align:middle line:84%
And it was that Sunday
evening, it was the 6th of June,

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:30.750 align:middle line:90%
'04 that my stomach sank.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.853 align:middle line:84%
And I thought -- I had
come to terms that, "Yes,

00:12:32.853 --> 00:12:34.821 align:middle line:84%
they could engineer
the larger events."

00:12:34.821 --> 00:12:39.860 align:middle line:84%
But when I saw that picture
there, I thought, "Oh, crap,

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.461 align:middle line:90%
this is on a very small scale."

00:12:41.461 --> 00:12:42.496 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Hmm.

00:12:42.496 --> 00:12:43.296 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are chemtrails
out there --

00:12:43.296 --> 00:12:44.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: There are.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:45.232 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: -- they say.

00:12:45.232 --> 00:12:47.901 align:middle line:84%
You know, vapor from
jets, they're out there.

00:12:47.901 --> 00:12:53.039 align:middle line:84%
The problem that I see is let's
use Los Angeles as an example.

00:12:53.039 --> 00:12:57.744 align:middle line:84%
On one day you wake up and it's
a clear sky, and it stays clear.

00:12:57.744 --> 00:12:58.979 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: Yes.

00:12:58.979 --> 00:12:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And you
know the flight patterns are

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.081 align:middle line:90%
the same.

00:13:01.081 --> 00:13:02.015 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: Day
after day after day.

00:13:02.015 --> 00:13:02.949 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
They don't change.

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:04.084 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens:
No, they don't.

00:13:04.084 --> 00:13:05.218 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: So the
next day you wake up,

00:13:05.218 --> 00:13:08.555 align:middle line:84%
same kind of weather,
except that clear sky --

00:13:08.555 --> 00:13:09.756 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: Where is it?

00:13:09.756 --> 00:13:10.524 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: -- now
looks like a Tic Tac Toe.

00:13:10.524 --> 00:13:11.791 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: Yes.

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:12.492 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You have
these patterns everywhere.

00:13:12.492 --> 00:13:13.793 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: Yes.

00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:16.363 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Why is it
that you can have jet trail

00:13:16.363 --> 00:13:19.199 align:middle line:84%
on that day, but you
can't on the previous day?

00:13:19.199 --> 00:13:21.401 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: And that's
what I ask the nonbelievers.

00:13:21.401 --> 00:13:23.837 align:middle line:84%
That is my question, my
direct question to them is,

00:13:23.837 --> 00:13:27.440 align:middle line:84%
"How do you -- how can you
justify one day being blue --

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.708 align:middle line:90%
" again, as you said,

00:13:28.708 --> 00:13:31.777 align:middle line:84%
with commercial traffic it
should be there every day.

00:13:31.777 --> 00:13:32.479 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: Or not.

00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:33.179 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Or not.

00:13:33.179 --> 00:13:34.581 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: Yes.

00:13:34.581 --> 00:13:35.782 align:middle line:84%
And so engines -- these engines
have become exceedingly clean

00:13:35.782 --> 00:13:37.250 align:middle line:90%
over the last 20, 30 years.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.820 align:middle line:84%
Jet fuel is not cheap,
and so we must conserve it

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.924 align:middle line:84%
and get the most energy
out of each gallon.

00:13:43.924 --> 00:13:46.226 align:middle line:84%
So what I needed to figure
out how the chemtrails fit

00:13:46.226 --> 00:13:49.529 align:middle line:84%
into the weather
modification with cameras.

00:13:49.529 --> 00:13:51.298 align:middle line:84%
So I got online, bought 4
cameras,

00:13:51.298 --> 00:13:53.400 align:middle line:84%
2 with mini DVDs, 2 little
webcams,

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.968 align:middle line:84%
2 computers, and some
time lapse software,

00:13:54.968 --> 00:13:57.070 align:middle line:84%
and I ran firewire around the
house.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.906 align:middle line:84%
Within 4 months, George, there
was a sorty of flights,

00:13:59.906 --> 00:14:03.076 align:middle line:84%
looking off to the southwest
on a sunny April afternoon.

00:14:03.076 --> 00:14:07.147 align:middle line:84%
And there were 6 planes
in maybe 5, 6, 7 minutes.

00:14:07.147 --> 00:14:09.583 align:middle line:84%
And only 1 of them left a
trail; and it wasn't a big one,

00:14:09.583 --> 00:14:10.850 align:middle line:84%
because it was one
of those dry days.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:11.952 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Sure.

00:14:11.952 --> 00:14:12.652 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: But
this little segment

00:14:12.652 --> 00:14:13.987 align:middle line:90%
of trail was remained.

00:14:13.987 --> 00:14:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Two of planes then hit,
"boom," the end of the trail,

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.259 align:middle line:84%
and one went right up the
center and bisected it.

00:14:19.259 --> 00:14:21.761 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, "Oh, it's geometry.

00:14:21.761 --> 00:14:23.930 align:middle line:84%
They're leaving these
bits of trails

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:26.833 align:middle line:84%
because that trail is
remaining illuminated not

00:14:26.833 --> 00:14:29.369 align:middle line:84%
because of moisture but
because of some other force...

00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:30.604 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yes.

00:14:30.604 --> 00:14:31.805 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: ...whether
it's a vertical lift --

00:14:31.805 --> 00:14:34.307 align:middle line:84%
and I see it more often
with a push from the side.

00:14:34.307 --> 00:14:36.810 align:middle line:84%
These trails will literally just
[makes sound] just be pushed

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:38.478 align:middle line:90%
out and they stay bright.

00:14:38.478 --> 00:14:40.313 align:middle line:90%
And this part will fade away,

00:14:40.313 --> 00:14:41.815 align:middle line:84%
and then this one
becomes illuminated

00:14:41.815 --> 00:14:43.016 align:middle line:90%
and pushed to the side.

00:14:43.016 --> 00:14:43.783 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Right;
and they hang, don't they?

00:14:43.783 --> 00:14:45.051 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: They do;

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:47.387 align:middle line:84%
especially when there's
active manipulation happening.

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:51.524 align:middle line:84%
So my conclusion, or tentative
conclusion, because I don't know

00:14:51.524 --> 00:14:53.526 align:middle line:90%
for sure, is that a lot

00:14:53.526 --> 00:14:58.064 align:middle line:84%
of engineering technology is
onboard those aircraft; onboard.

00:14:58.064 --> 00:15:01.301 align:middle line:84%
We can go back to the work of
Wilhelm Reich and his discovery

00:15:01.301 --> 00:15:04.070 align:middle line:84%
of the orgon, the etheric
field that how it impacts clouds

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.672 align:middle line:90%
and the water molecule.

00:15:05.672 --> 00:15:06.806 align:middle line:90%
And then that technology,

00:15:06.806 --> 00:15:08.642 align:middle line:84%
that understanding
was developed further

00:15:08.642 --> 00:15:11.945 align:middle line:84%
by James Trevor Constable,
and they were able to --

00:15:11.945 --> 00:15:15.515 align:middle line:84%
little Cessna Piper Cub planes
put little ionization tubes

00:15:15.515 --> 00:15:17.317 align:middle line:84%
and then roll over
the thunderstorms,

00:15:17.317 --> 00:15:18.551 align:middle line:90%
roll over the rain.

00:15:18.551 --> 00:15:21.054 align:middle line:84%
This was in the tropics
where the atmosphere is rife

00:15:21.054 --> 00:15:24.090 align:middle line:84%
with energy and life, and so
it's easy to turn it over.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:25.925 align:middle line:84%
In the West we're
really been desert,

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:28.928 align:middle line:84%
and it's a little more
difficult to get this to happen.

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:30.263 align:middle line:90%
So they've demonstrated

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:33.800 align:middle line:84%
that very small lightweight
technology can have massive

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.536 align:middle line:84%
impacts if you're not stuck
in thermodynamic world.

00:15:36.536 --> 00:15:39.072 align:middle line:84%
If you go to the etheric,
or the electrical world,

00:15:39.072 --> 00:15:42.876 align:middle line:84%
you can greatly impact the
weather with minimal input

00:15:42.876 --> 00:15:46.546 align:middle line:84%
because this biosphere is so
balanced, it's so perfect,

00:15:46.546 --> 00:15:49.482 align:middle line:84%
that all we have to do is tease
it a little bit to the dry or

00:15:49.482 --> 00:15:52.385 align:middle line:84%
tease it a little bit to
the wet, and it happens.

00:15:52.385 --> 00:15:53.787 align:middle line:90%
It happens.

00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:54.921 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Let's assume
that manipulation is occurring.

00:15:54.921 --> 00:15:55.622 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: Yes.

00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:56.289 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Why?

00:15:56.289 --> 00:15:57.757 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing?

00:15:57.757 --> 00:15:59.426 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: That's a good
question, and one I ask myself.

00:15:59.426 --> 00:16:01.828 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And we have
droughts in California now.

00:16:01.828 --> 00:16:03.563 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't they there trying
to help that?

00:16:03.563 --> 00:16:04.864 align:middle line:90%
It's just strange.

00:16:04.864 --> 00:16:06.332 align:middle line:84%
So what do you think
they're doing?

00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:08.601 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: I think
they need public oversight

00:16:08.601 --> 00:16:11.738 align:middle line:90%
so we can change the agenda.

00:16:11.738 --> 00:16:13.406 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, there's big
picture and little picture

00:16:13.406 --> 00:16:15.575 align:middle line:84%
to that answer --
to that question.

00:16:15.575 --> 00:16:20.080 align:middle line:84%
I think as Secretary -- Defense
Secretary Colin said in 1997

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.648 align:middle line:84%
that they're using
the planet now

00:16:21.648 --> 00:16:23.917 align:middle line:84%
as primary forms
of eco-terrorism.

00:16:23.917 --> 00:16:24.751 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Sure.

00:16:24.751 --> 00:16:25.518 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: It's a weapon.

00:16:25.518 --> 00:16:26.820 align:middle line:90%
It's what it seems to be.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.622 align:middle line:84%
And, George, what's the best
weapon; the secret weapon?

00:16:29.622 --> 00:16:30.990 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
The secret weapon.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:32.692 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: The secret
weapon that no one can believe

00:16:32.692 --> 00:16:33.960 align:middle line:90%
that is so fantastic --

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.228 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: They can
blame it on Mother Nature.

00:16:35.228 --> 00:16:36.463 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: And
insurance companies paid for it

00:16:36.463 --> 00:16:39.032 align:middle line:84%
because it is, quote,
unquote, "an act of God."

00:16:39.032 --> 00:16:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yes.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.768 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: And so that
way the money keeps rolling

00:16:41.768 --> 00:16:46.406 align:middle line:84%
through the system, the economy
keeps moving, and we have --

00:16:46.406 --> 00:16:49.542 align:middle line:84%
what hurts, though, is the
human toll that it takes.

00:16:49.542 --> 00:16:51.878 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Do you think
the intent initially started

00:16:51.878 --> 00:16:53.480 align:middle line:90%
to help the environment?

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.950 align:middle line:84%
"Let's make it rain somewhere,
because they need it?"

00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:58.351 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: I don't.

00:16:58.351 --> 00:17:02.422 align:middle line:84%
No, no. I think in the wake of
D-Day, World War II, that they,

00:17:02.422 --> 00:17:04.791 align:middle line:84%
the Military Industrial
Complex knew that they needed

00:17:04.791 --> 00:17:09.129 align:middle line:84%
to have the weather on their
side for their next war.

00:17:09.129 --> 00:17:10.764 align:middle line:90%
And that was the goal.

00:17:10.764 --> 00:17:14.701 align:middle line:84%
And by God, you know,
if Beardon's right,

00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:17.804 align:middle line:84%
Stalin basically
told his people,

00:17:17.804 --> 00:17:20.407 align:middle line:84%
"We need something the
Americans don't have.

00:17:20.407 --> 00:17:22.008 align:middle line:84%
They're building bomb,
after bomb, after bomb.

00:17:22.008 --> 00:17:23.409 align:middle line:90%
We need something special."

00:17:23.409 --> 00:17:26.012 align:middle line:84%
So they went and leveraged
Tesla's technologies.

00:17:26.012 --> 00:17:27.280 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yes.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.648 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: And so
upwards of, according to him,

00:17:28.648 --> 00:17:31.951 align:middle line:84%
10,000 physicists working on
this project that became named

00:17:31.951 --> 00:17:34.454 align:middle line:84%
"Energetics," in
the '50s and '60s.

00:17:34.454 --> 00:17:36.256 align:middle line:84%
And that it was deployed
after the Bay

00:17:36.256 --> 00:17:37.657 align:middle line:90%
of Pigs, shortly thereafter.

00:17:37.657 --> 00:17:39.726 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well, we know
the Chinese during the Olympics

00:17:39.726 --> 00:17:41.961 align:middle line:84%
said, "Don't worry
about the weather.

00:17:41.961 --> 00:17:43.129 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: "We'll
take care of that."

00:17:43.129 --> 00:17:43.963 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: We
control the weather.

00:17:43.963 --> 00:17:45.165 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: Yes, yes, yes.

00:17:45.165 --> 00:17:46.199 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: When I
saw that statement, Scott,

00:17:46.199 --> 00:17:48.301 align:middle line:90%
I said, "Holy Toledo."

00:17:48.301 --> 00:17:49.335 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens:
They actually said it.

00:17:49.335 --> 00:17:50.303 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
they're admitting

00:17:50.303 --> 00:17:51.671 align:middle line:84%
that they can control
the weather.

00:17:51.671 --> 00:17:55.175 align:middle line:84%
Now, if they're doing it, and
the Russians are doing it --

00:17:55.175 --> 00:17:56.276 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: Why aren't we?

00:17:56.276 --> 00:17:57.744 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: -- you
know we're doing it.

00:17:57.744 --> 00:17:59.379 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: And especially
since we've not said a thing.

00:17:59.379 --> 00:18:00.713 align:middle line:90%
Then that's when you know.

00:18:00.713 --> 00:18:03.383 align:middle line:84%
You know, if they're not talking
about it, it's happening.

00:18:03.383 --> 00:18:04.417 align:middle line:90%
It's happening.

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:06.386 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
You mentioned HARP,

00:18:06.386 --> 00:18:07.987 align:middle line:90%
and we mentioned chemtrails.

00:18:07.987 --> 00:18:08.822 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: Yes.

00:18:08.822 --> 00:18:09.823 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Are we talking

00:18:09.823 --> 00:18:11.724 align:middle line:84%
about 2 distinctly
different things?

00:18:11.724 --> 00:18:12.926 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: I believe so;

00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:16.062 align:middle line:84%
but I also believe the
chemtrails can provide --

00:18:16.062 --> 00:18:19.899 align:middle line:84%
honestly the longer I've been
aware of them and watching them,

00:18:19.899 --> 00:18:24.504 align:middle line:84%
the program is elegant, it is
exquisite, and my hats off going

00:18:24.504 --> 00:18:26.039 align:middle line:90%
to the guys that developed it

00:18:26.039 --> 00:18:30.143 align:middle line:84%
because it is truly an amazingly
-- it's a ballet in the sky.

00:18:30.143 --> 00:18:31.311 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Is it genius?

00:18:31.311 --> 00:18:32.512 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens:
In a way it is.

00:18:32.512 --> 00:18:33.880 align:middle line:90%
It truly is.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.850 align:middle line:84%
If it were just used for
the betterment of mankind,

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:38.751 align:middle line:84%
then it would be
a different story

00:18:38.751 --> 00:18:41.487 align:middle line:84%
because we could use it more
sparingly, we wouldn't have

00:18:41.487 --> 00:18:44.958 align:middle line:84%
to have this huge fallout
of these toxins from the sky

00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:46.392 align:middle line:90%
that we've all breathed.

00:18:46.392 --> 00:18:47.894 align:middle line:90%
That's just a given.

00:18:47.894 --> 00:18:51.531 align:middle line:84%
But I believe those trails
provide them an interface

00:18:51.531 --> 00:18:53.266 align:middle line:84%
from the etheric,
electromagnetic,

00:18:53.266 --> 00:18:54.734 align:middle line:90%
and thermodynamic realms.

00:18:54.734 --> 00:18:56.703 align:middle line:84%
So we have these eggs
that are layered,

00:18:56.703 --> 00:18:58.271 align:middle line:90%
and they can play this boundary

00:18:58.271 --> 00:19:00.840 align:middle line:84%
where we can move electrical
energy from the etheric,

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.775 align:middle line:84%
and then down into
thermodynamics.

00:19:02.775 --> 00:19:04.177 align:middle line:90%
So I believe that plays that.

00:19:04.177 --> 00:19:07.814 align:middle line:84%
And also at the same time if you
are going to watch our river,

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:10.516 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a river of air
or a river of water moves,

00:19:10.516 --> 00:19:13.119 align:middle line:84%
put a string on it,
or a line of powder,

00:19:13.119 --> 00:19:15.488 align:middle line:84%
and see how it undulates
and moved.

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:18.091 align:middle line:84%
But the big discovery with the
time lapse cameras, George,

00:19:18.091 --> 00:19:20.493 align:middle line:84%
was once you have
one trail going on,

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:21.628 align:middle line:90%
there's always defamations.

00:19:21.628 --> 00:19:24.230 align:middle line:84%
There's breaks, there's
tears in them.

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:25.698 align:middle line:90%
There's disruptions.

00:19:25.698 --> 00:19:28.968 align:middle line:84%
Other planes come along and
hit those brakes perfectly,

00:19:28.968 --> 00:19:32.205 align:middle line:84%
at the end, at the other,
or even in the middle.

00:19:32.205 --> 00:19:33.506 align:middle line:90%
It's really --

00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:34.807 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: They know
exactly what they're doing.

00:19:34.807 --> 00:19:36.376 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: And
there's some super-computer

00:19:36.376 --> 00:19:38.111 align:middle line:84%
up there probably
guiding it all.

00:19:38.111 --> 00:19:39.445 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: What
chemicals are they using?

00:19:39.445 --> 00:19:43.416 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: From lab
analysis it's barium, strontium

00:19:43.416 --> 00:19:45.051 align:middle line:90%
and aluminum are the big ones.

00:19:45.051 --> 00:19:46.352 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Okay.

00:19:46.352 --> 00:19:47.554 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: I don't
know, the biggest things --

00:19:47.554 --> 00:19:49.088 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And what
do those chemicals do?

00:19:49.088 --> 00:19:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: Give
them reflectivity,

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:53.393 align:middle line:84%
so from space they
can use sounding data

00:19:53.393 --> 00:19:54.694 align:middle line:90%
to see what the different layers

00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:56.596 align:middle line:84%
of the atmosphere
are doing discreetly,

00:19:56.596 --> 00:19:58.798 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the layer
above say 31,000 feet,

00:19:58.798 --> 00:20:01.401 align:middle line:84%
and then a little layer,
you know, 31 to 21,000,

00:20:01.401 --> 00:20:05.038 align:middle line:84%
another one from 21 to
28,000 feet and then below.

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:07.106 align:middle line:84%
If they're all colored a
little bit differently,

00:20:07.106 --> 00:20:11.044 align:middle line:84%
then from above you can see
what's happening in real time.

00:20:11.044 --> 00:20:12.845 align:middle line:84%
The guys at the National
Weather Service are stuck

00:20:12.845 --> 00:20:13.947 align:middle line:90%
using balloons.

00:20:13.947 --> 00:20:15.315 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Right.

00:20:15.315 --> 00:20:16.449 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: You know,
with radio sounds going

00:20:16.449 --> 00:20:17.583 align:middle line:84%
up that are all sensing
temperature and humidity

00:20:17.583 --> 00:20:20.320 align:middle line:84%
and wind direction, and
then some other values.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.155 align:middle line:84%
But they're missing
the big picture.

00:20:22.155 --> 00:20:26.059 align:middle line:84%
And their resolution is
so coarse, so, you know,

00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:29.696 align:middle line:84%
2 in a state tops, except
for Texas and California.

00:20:29.696 --> 00:20:31.831 align:middle line:84%
You know, they just
don't get the resolution

00:20:31.831 --> 00:20:34.834 align:middle line:84%
to see what's truly happening
on this very small scale

00:20:34.834 --> 00:20:36.002 align:middle line:90%
that these pros are working at.

00:20:36.002 --> 00:20:37.003 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
what happened, Scott,

00:20:37.003 --> 00:20:39.605 align:middle line:84%
to people who breathe
these chemicals;

00:20:39.605 --> 00:20:41.607 align:middle line:84%
because they eventually
fall, right? They come down.

00:20:41.607 --> 00:20:42.475 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens:
Eventually, eventually; yes.

00:20:42.475 --> 00:20:43.743 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: What happens?

00:20:43.743 --> 00:20:46.446 align:middle line:84%
People have all kinds of
respiratory issues these days.

00:20:46.446 --> 00:20:48.915 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: And we are
dealing with Alzheimer's,

00:20:48.915 --> 00:20:52.819 align:middle line:84%
Parkinson's, ADHD, all of
these neurological diseases.

00:20:52.819 --> 00:20:54.887 align:middle line:84%
And so I think there's a
concerted effort to dumb

00:20:54.887 --> 00:20:57.523 align:middle line:84%
down the population so that when
they figure these things out,

00:20:57.523 --> 00:20:59.926 align:middle line:84%
they're paralyzed and don't
know what to do, don't know how

00:20:59.926 --> 00:21:02.962 align:middle line:84%
to respond, or simply
can't grasp the concept

00:21:02.962 --> 00:21:05.598 align:middle line:84%
that it is happening, which
is the bigger picture.

00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:07.467 align:middle line:84%
So if you kind of keep
the brain locked down,

00:21:07.467 --> 00:21:10.370 align:middle line:84%
whether it's fluoride in the
water, shut down the pineal,

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:14.040 align:middle line:84%
aluminum to disrupt the
nervous system, you know,

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.709 align:middle line:84%
these artificial
sweeteners to continue

00:21:16.709 --> 00:21:20.179 align:middle line:84%
to degredate
the nervous system,

00:21:20.179 --> 00:21:22.048 align:middle line:90%
then we're just in a pen.

00:21:22.048 --> 00:21:23.583 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Now,
is this being done all

00:21:23.583 --> 00:21:27.153 align:middle line:90%
around the planet, or just here?

00:21:27.153 --> 00:21:30.323 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: I like to look
at the earth as a closed system;

00:21:30.323 --> 00:21:33.993 align:middle line:84%
that there's no way off of
it, that one chimney in China,

00:21:33.993 --> 00:21:38.431 align:middle line:84%
or Gary, Indiana is pumping into
our single atmosphere,

00:21:38.431 --> 00:21:42.535 align:middle line:84%
and so we're all
breathing it, all of us.

00:21:42.535 --> 00:21:46.406 align:middle line:84%
South America was largely immune
to this until about 2008, 2009.

00:21:46.406 --> 00:21:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: But
we got to that too.

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.075 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: Until we
had the big Chile earthquake.

00:21:49.075 --> 00:21:50.076 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yes.

00:21:50.076 --> 00:21:51.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens:
And then it seemed

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:53.546 align:middle line:84%
after that event,
the skies opened up.

00:21:53.546 --> 00:21:55.915 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Are we
manipulating earthquakes too?

00:21:55.915 --> 00:21:56.783 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: I believe so.

00:21:56.783 --> 00:21:58.217 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
In your opinion?

00:21:58.217 --> 00:21:59.819 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: And there are
a couple of depths of quakes

00:21:59.819 --> 00:22:01.821 align:middle line:84%
that I'm curious about, 5
kilometer, 10 kilometer,

00:22:01.821 --> 00:22:05.958 align:middle line:84%
35 kilometer depth earthquakes
I find highly suspicious.

00:22:05.958 --> 00:22:07.927 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: How
will they do that?

00:22:07.927 --> 00:22:10.063 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: We go
back to scalar technology,

00:22:10.063 --> 00:22:13.399 align:middle line:84%
or to Tesla's work, and if you
can through the disruption

00:22:13.399 --> 00:22:16.302 align:middle line:84%
of time pull away the force
of gravity off one side

00:22:16.302 --> 00:22:18.438 align:middle line:84%
of an earthquake
-- of a fault line,

00:22:18.438 --> 00:22:20.606 align:middle line:84%
then all of a sudden the
other fault doesn't even see

00:22:20.606 --> 00:22:21.808 align:middle line:90%
that it's there.

00:22:21.808 --> 00:22:24.777 align:middle line:84%
It's like, "Ooh, I have
a void to my left, boom."

00:22:24.777 --> 00:22:27.146 align:middle line:90%
And then it moves.

00:22:27.146 --> 00:22:29.949 align:middle line:84%
And that's an
oversimplification, but it's all

00:22:29.949 --> 00:22:32.351 align:middle line:90%
about playing with space-time.

00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:33.786 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Where are the pilots,

00:22:33.786 --> 00:22:35.555 align:middle line:90%
because this is the big issue.

00:22:35.555 --> 00:22:36.756 align:middle line:90%
Where are the pilots --

00:22:36.756 --> 00:22:37.824 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: Do you
believe there are pilots?

00:22:37.824 --> 00:22:38.624 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: --
who are doing this?

00:22:38.624 --> 00:22:39.726 align:middle line:90%
Do you think they're drones?

00:22:39.726 --> 00:22:40.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: I
think they're drones.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:41.694 align:middle line:84%
I think they've been
drones for years;

00:22:41.694 --> 00:22:42.995 align:middle line:90%
years, and years, and years.

00:22:42.995 --> 00:22:46.065 align:middle line:84%
And so there's some air base
where the airmen show up,

00:22:46.065 --> 00:22:48.501 align:middle line:84%
sit down, and they're
probably not even military.

00:22:48.501 --> 00:22:49.435 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Because they don't have

00:22:49.435 --> 00:22:50.770 align:middle line:84%
to be big jets or
planes, do they?

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:52.805 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: And I have
seen more smaller planes

00:22:52.805 --> 00:22:57.110 align:middle line:84%
than ever before, Cessnas,
Lears, Golfstreams, all --

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:58.177 align:middle line:90%
and you would say, "Oh,

00:22:58.177 --> 00:23:00.480 align:middle line:84%
that's just a little
plane, small trail."

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:03.583 align:middle line:84%
But no, it's interested
in something off there.

00:23:03.583 --> 00:23:06.486 align:middle line:84%
So you could watch it
investigate another target,

00:23:06.486 --> 00:23:08.054 align:middle line:84%
another disruption,
or disturbance,

00:23:08.054 --> 00:23:09.889 align:middle line:84%
or distortion in
a previous trail.

00:23:09.889 --> 00:23:11.757 align:middle line:90%
And it hits it precisely.

00:23:11.757 --> 00:23:14.861 align:middle line:84%
And 90 degrees, 90
degrees, that's all --

00:23:14.861 --> 00:23:16.462 align:middle line:90%
some are at 90-degrees angles.

00:23:16.462 --> 00:23:17.663 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yes --

00:23:17.663 --> 00:23:19.031 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: And what
happens in meteorology

00:23:19.031 --> 00:23:21.367 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to develop a
storm, it must have vorticity.

00:23:21.367 --> 00:23:24.504 align:middle line:84%
It's some kind of a spin,
some kind of a churn.

00:23:24.504 --> 00:23:26.572 align:middle line:90%
That gets the storm going.

00:23:26.572 --> 00:23:29.275 align:middle line:84%
The maximum way to get that
spin is to run something

00:23:29.275 --> 00:23:31.110 align:middle line:84%
across one another
at 90 degrees.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:32.912 align:middle line:84%
You do that across your
hand, you get heat,

00:23:32.912 --> 00:23:35.648 align:middle line:90%
and then you create turbulence.

00:23:35.648 --> 00:23:38.184 align:middle line:84%
And all the electricity
that we use in this country,

00:23:38.184 --> 00:23:41.921 align:middle line:84%
save for solar, is developed
by turbine, spinning,

00:23:41.921 --> 00:23:44.423 align:middle line:84%
whether it's water, whether
it's air, it's a turbine.

00:23:44.423 --> 00:23:46.692 align:middle line:90%
And this generates the current.

00:23:46.692 --> 00:23:48.628 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
time lapse photography

00:23:48.628 --> 00:23:52.165 align:middle line:84%
of the simple cumulus cloud,
or the towering thunderstorm,

00:23:52.165 --> 00:23:54.133 align:middle line:90%
they're always spinning.

00:23:54.133 --> 00:23:57.036 align:middle line:84%
So there's this inherent
spiral in the weather,

00:23:57.036 --> 00:23:59.372 align:middle line:84%
and we can go right
back to the orgon.

00:23:59.372 --> 00:24:01.774 align:middle line:84%
It's the spiral of
the life force.

00:24:01.774 --> 00:24:05.344 align:middle line:84%
And so they use this inherent
spiral and then form it,

00:24:05.344 --> 00:24:07.880 align:middle line:84%
shape it with these
waves that these planes

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.250 align:middle line:84%
or other instruments are
introducing into the atmosphere.

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:15.388 align:middle line:84%
And so that constrains the
movement of the jet stream; so.

00:24:15.388 --> 00:24:17.156 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
What's the altitude

00:24:17.156 --> 00:24:20.159 align:middle line:84%
of these chemtrails;
30,000 feet, 40,000?

00:24:20.159 --> 00:24:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens:
Doesn't matter;

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.929 align:middle line:84%
pretty much from
18,000 to 40,000 feet.

00:24:22.929 --> 00:24:23.963 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Okay.

00:24:23.963 --> 00:24:25.231 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens:
Just the whole depth.

00:24:25.231 --> 00:24:26.299 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're interested
the whole column of air --

00:24:26.299 --> 00:24:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Sure.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:27.967 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens:
-- top to bottom.

00:24:27.967 --> 00:24:29.335 align:middle line:90%
It's all important.

00:24:29.335 --> 00:24:29.902 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Do you think
commercial pilots have flown

00:24:29.902 --> 00:24:30.736 align:middle line:90%
through this?

00:24:30.736 --> 00:24:31.671 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: Absolutely.

00:24:31.671 --> 00:24:33.072 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
I wonder what they say.

00:24:33.072 --> 00:24:37.109 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: I don't know
that they're completely aware.

00:24:37.109 --> 00:24:41.681 align:middle line:84%
I had queried more than one,
you know, in my flights.

00:24:41.681 --> 00:24:43.316 align:middle line:90%
And they clam up.

00:24:43.316 --> 00:24:46.986 align:middle line:84%
So I think they've been
told not to talk about it,

00:24:46.986 --> 00:24:51.390 align:middle line:84%
told that it's nothing
to be concerned about.

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:52.425 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yes.

00:24:52.425 --> 00:24:53.559 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: I
could see how some

00:24:53.559 --> 00:24:55.261 align:middle line:84%
of them might be
participating in the program,

00:24:55.261 --> 00:24:57.997 align:middle line:84%
but I really think we
have a whole other fleet,

00:24:57.997 --> 00:25:00.533 align:middle line:84%
because their intention
on flying

00:25:00.533 --> 00:25:02.401 align:middle line:84%
and hitting atmospheric
phenomena,

00:25:02.401 --> 00:25:04.737 align:middle line:84%
atmosphere anomalies is
extreme --

00:25:04.737 --> 00:25:06.939 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Are most people
skeptical about this stuff?

00:25:06.939 --> 00:25:08.908 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: And
should be; and should be.

00:25:08.908 --> 00:25:10.042 align:middle line:90%
I was.

00:25:10.042 --> 00:25:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Do you
think that's healthy?

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.644 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: I
think it's healthy.

00:25:11.644 --> 00:25:12.845 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:25:12.845 --> 00:25:13.879 align:middle line:84%
I think you must be
skeptical about everything.

00:25:13.879 --> 00:25:17.316 align:middle line:90%
You must. It has to pass a test.

00:25:17.316 --> 00:25:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And for me, you know,
there's a scientific method.

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:23.122 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I did with the
cameras and the photography.

00:25:23.122 --> 00:25:24.891 align:middle line:84%
You know, the cameras
were unbiased.

00:25:24.891 --> 00:25:27.193 align:middle line:84%
You point them up, you have
them capture a picture every 4,

00:25:27.193 --> 00:25:28.461 align:middle line:90%
5, 6, 10 seconds.

00:25:28.461 --> 00:25:29.996 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Without
that, would you believe this?

00:25:29.996 --> 00:25:30.997 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: It
would take me longer

00:25:30.997 --> 00:25:32.298 align:middle line:90%
to come to terms with it.

00:25:32.298 --> 00:25:33.532 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Okay.

00:25:33.532 --> 00:25:34.767 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: I wouldn't
have seen the precision

00:25:34.767 --> 00:25:36.502 align:middle line:84%
of the flights and what
they were exactly interested

00:25:36.502 --> 00:25:37.903 align:middle line:84%
in without the time
lapse.

00:25:37.903 --> 00:25:39.739 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Let's take a
look at another strange picture,

00:25:39.739 --> 00:25:40.806 align:middle line:90%
and you can tell us --

00:25:40.806 --> 00:25:41.907 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: I
had a few of those.

00:25:41.907 --> 00:25:42.608 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: --
what's going on here.

00:25:42.608 --> 00:25:44.010 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] What's this?

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:46.279 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: That was May
'04, and it was Eastern Idaho.

00:25:46.279 --> 00:25:49.482 align:middle line:84%
And I was just -- I hadn't
even yet come to terms

00:25:49.482 --> 00:25:50.650 align:middle line:90%
that yes, this is real.

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:52.418 align:middle line:90%
And then this cloud showed up.

00:25:52.418 --> 00:25:55.554 align:middle line:84%
And oh, man, that's
just too anomalous.

00:25:55.554 --> 00:25:59.659 align:middle line:84%
You can't get that shape to show
up in a fluid without some kind

00:25:59.659 --> 00:26:02.628 align:middle line:84%
of resonance pattern forcing
it to come into place.

00:26:02.628 --> 00:26:03.963 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
that's the issue here.

00:26:03.963 --> 00:26:05.464 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: That's the
issue is we've got resonance

00:26:05.464 --> 00:26:06.699 align:middle line:90%
patterns in the atmosphere,

00:26:06.699 --> 00:26:10.236 align:middle line:84%
and these chemtrails
provide us a visible boundary

00:26:10.236 --> 00:26:13.205 align:middle line:84%
of these patterns,
visible boundary.

00:26:13.205 --> 00:26:15.107 align:middle line:84%
They make what's
invisible, visible.

00:26:15.107 --> 00:26:16.509 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You
know how sometimes

00:26:16.509 --> 00:26:19.111 align:middle line:84%
when you were a kid you'd lie
on your back and you just look

00:26:19.111 --> 00:26:20.913 align:middle line:84%
at the old clouds,
and you look up.

00:26:20.913 --> 00:26:22.848 align:middle line:90%
And you could see faces --

00:26:22.848 --> 00:26:24.083 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: Faces.

00:26:24.083 --> 00:26:25.518 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: -- and
things, "Hey, there's a dog,

00:26:25.518 --> 00:26:28.087 align:middle line:90%
there's a person, there's that."

00:26:28.087 --> 00:26:30.289 align:middle line:84%
Might that be what
we're looking at here?

00:26:30.289 --> 00:26:34.093 align:middle line:84%
I mean, where our mind is
imagining what's going on?

00:26:34.093 --> 00:26:35.328 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: A sign

00:26:35.328 --> 00:26:38.297 align:middle line:84%
of intelligence is the
ability to discern patterns.

00:26:38.297 --> 00:26:40.232 align:middle line:84%
And I consider that
we have intelligence.

00:26:40.232 --> 00:26:41.334 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yes.

00:26:41.334 --> 00:26:42.168 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: So
if a pattern is there,

00:26:42.168 --> 00:26:43.202 align:middle line:90%
we should be able to discern --

00:26:43.202 --> 00:26:44.403 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
you're the expert.

00:26:44.403 --> 00:26:45.838 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: Well, I
think we're all experts,

00:26:45.838 --> 00:26:48.174 align:middle line:84%
because we all have
to come to terms

00:26:48.174 --> 00:26:50.309 align:middle line:84%
with what's happening
in our own time.

00:26:50.309 --> 00:26:52.712 align:middle line:84%
Now, I truly thought
as I began to talk

00:26:52.712 --> 00:26:54.680 align:middle line:90%
and to share my observations

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.549 align:middle line:84%
that there would have been
a fairly healthy movement

00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:58.417 align:middle line:90%
to investigate these things.

00:26:58.417 --> 00:27:01.787 align:middle line:84%
But a head in the sand
can really keep you

00:27:01.787 --> 00:27:02.955 align:middle line:90%
from seeing a lot of things.

00:27:02.955 --> 00:27:06.125 align:middle line:84%
I had a discussion last
night with a researcher,

00:27:06.125 --> 00:27:08.361 align:middle line:84%
an atmospheric researcher
at NCAR.

00:27:08.361 --> 00:27:12.431 align:middle line:84%
And he had a couple statements
that are rather revealing

00:27:12.431 --> 00:27:14.200 align:middle line:90%
to me about group think.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.267 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yes.

00:27:15.267 --> 00:27:16.535 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: And
one of them was --

00:27:16.535 --> 00:27:19.004 align:middle line:84%
you know, his job was to
begin to share the CO2 message

00:27:19.004 --> 00:27:21.040 align:middle line:84%
with the world that
this is happening,

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.209 align:middle line:84%
we're doing it, this
is a problem.

00:27:23.209 --> 00:27:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And so we had a little
talk about the sun,

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:27.146 align:middle line:84%
and climate change, and
sunspot minimum.

00:27:27.146 --> 00:27:30.049 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, "What
about contrails?"

00:27:30.049 --> 00:27:31.183 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
And he went, "What?"

00:27:31.183 --> 00:27:32.218 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens:
He said, "You know,

00:27:32.218 --> 00:27:33.886 align:middle line:84%
about every 5 years
I look into that.

00:27:33.886 --> 00:27:36.756 align:middle line:84%
You know, does it add to
warming, does it add to cooling?

00:27:36.756 --> 00:27:40.459 align:middle line:84%
You know, how does that play
with the global warming agenda?"

00:27:40.459 --> 00:27:43.129 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "You know, I
really don't have an opinion,

00:27:43.129 --> 00:27:47.266 align:middle line:84%
but it might, you know, allow
us an aspect of cooling,

00:27:47.266 --> 00:27:49.068 align:middle line:84%
because of the increased
cloud cover."

00:27:49.068 --> 00:27:51.170 align:middle line:84%
My other side of that is once
we've got clouds overhead

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:51.871 align:middle line:90%
at sunset --

00:27:51.871 --> 00:27:52.905 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Sure.

00:27:52.905 --> 00:27:53.739 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens:
-- we trap the heat,

00:27:53.739 --> 00:27:55.074 align:middle line:90%
especially like a metal blanket.

00:27:55.074 --> 00:27:57.743 align:middle line:84%
We have these Mylar blankets
in our emergency, you know,

00:27:57.743 --> 00:27:59.278 align:middle line:90%
car outfits to stay warm;

00:27:59.278 --> 00:28:03.682 align:middle line:84%
same kind of thing
happening in the sky.

00:28:03.682 --> 00:28:05.684 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Can any of
this be done in order just

00:28:05.684 --> 00:28:07.486 align:middle line:90%
to make the environment better?

00:28:07.486 --> 00:28:08.587 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens:
Oh, absolutely,

00:28:08.587 --> 00:28:10.489 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I would
like to see change;

00:28:10.489 --> 00:28:12.625 align:middle line:84%
because if we could
take this away

00:28:12.625 --> 00:28:14.460 align:middle line:84%
from the Military
Industrial Complex --

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:15.661 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: That's the key.

00:28:15.661 --> 00:28:16.796 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: --
that's the key, and bring it

00:28:16.796 --> 00:28:19.932 align:middle line:84%
into public oversight,
the world will change.

00:28:19.932 --> 00:28:22.768 align:middle line:84%
The drought can end in
California; bumper crops

00:28:22.768 --> 00:28:24.303 align:middle line:84%
in the middle part
of the nation.

00:28:24.303 --> 00:28:27.540 align:middle line:84%
You know, Australia could
finally get some rain

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:28.574 align:middle line:90%
to put out those fires.

00:28:28.574 --> 00:28:29.875 align:middle line:90%
You know, we can --

00:28:29.875 --> 00:28:31.143 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You could
make it rain in the desert.

00:28:31.143 --> 00:28:32.678 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: -- have
a Garden of Eden, George;

00:28:32.678 --> 00:28:34.079 align:middle line:90%
but that's not what they want.

00:28:34.079 --> 00:28:38.451 align:middle line:84%
There has to be this poverty,
this doing without, this famine.

00:28:38.451 --> 00:28:42.788 align:middle line:84%
That's apparently what
these people thrive on.

00:28:42.788 --> 00:28:45.057 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: So you
think they want chaos.

00:28:45.057 --> 00:28:47.626 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: Undoubtedly;
undoubtedly, you know,

00:28:47.626 --> 00:28:49.228 align:middle line:90%
whether it's a Katrina event,

00:28:49.228 --> 00:28:51.530 align:middle line:84%
and the federal government
withholding supplies,

00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:54.400 align:middle line:84%
withholding relief, and
keeping these people locked up.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.935 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's --
and I've heard stories

00:28:55.935 --> 00:28:57.203 align:middle line:84%
that there were handwritten
notes,

00:28:57.203 --> 00:28:58.871 align:middle line:90%
Carl Rove, "We'll hold this off

00:28:58.871 --> 00:29:00.573 align:middle line:84%
until we get martial
law declared."

00:29:00.573 --> 00:29:01.707 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yes.

00:29:01.707 --> 00:29:03.042 align:middle line:84%
How did your news
directors feel about this,

00:29:03.042 --> 00:29:06.312 align:middle line:84%
as you started going
down this path?

00:29:06.312 --> 00:29:09.081 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: I
knew in October of '04

00:29:09.081 --> 00:29:11.283 align:middle line:84%
when I wrote my missive
to George here

00:29:11.283 --> 00:29:13.853 align:middle line:84%
at Urban Survival that I would
lose my job.

00:29:13.853 --> 00:29:15.888 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't know how
quickly it would happen.

00:29:15.888 --> 00:29:16.655 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yes.

00:29:16.655 --> 00:29:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: I was --

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:20.826 align:middle line:84%
had been at that station by
the time I left for 9 years

00:29:20.826 --> 00:29:24.430 align:middle line:84%
and 9 months, and for 8-1/2
years we were number 1

00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:26.031 align:middle line:90%
or tied for number 1 news.

00:29:26.031 --> 00:29:29.535 align:middle line:84%
And the station when I
started was a distant 3rd.

00:29:29.535 --> 00:29:31.737 align:middle line:84%
And so I was valuable
to the tune of millions

00:29:31.737 --> 00:29:34.206 align:middle line:84%
of dollars annually
to that station.

00:29:34.206 --> 00:29:36.342 align:middle line:90%
And my general manager was fine.

00:29:36.342 --> 00:29:38.177 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Scott, you
do your interviews --

00:29:38.177 --> 00:29:39.578 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: "Go for it."

00:29:39.578 --> 00:29:40.646 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens: -- you go for
it, but you do it on your time

00:29:40.646 --> 00:29:43.015 align:middle line:84%
and you just don't
bring it to our air."

00:29:43.015 --> 00:29:47.887 align:middle line:84%
And after Katrina, doing
"Coast To Coast," and creating

00:29:47.887 --> 00:29:50.389 align:middle line:84%
that turmoil, the
station up the street,

00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:53.692 align:middle line:84%
the ABC station's
sales department went

00:29:53.692 --> 00:29:56.095 align:middle line:84%
to the regional Ford dealers
and said, "You do not want

00:29:56.095 --> 00:29:57.296 align:middle line:90%
to advertise with Channel 6.

00:29:57.296 --> 00:29:58.464 align:middle line:90%
Scott Stevens is crazy.

00:29:58.464 --> 00:29:59.498 align:middle line:90%
He's talking about these things.

00:29:59.498 --> 00:30:00.833 align:middle line:90%
You want to advertise with us."

00:30:00.833 --> 00:30:01.667 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
"We're straight."

00:30:01.667 --> 00:30:02.801 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: And then

00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:04.870 align:middle line:84%
when corporate got wind
of that, that was it.

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:05.704 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: That was it.

00:30:05.704 --> 00:30:06.539 align:middle line:90%
>> Scott Stevens: That was it.

00:30:06.539 --> 00:30:07.940 align:middle line:90%
Do not impact the bottom line.

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.308 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well, Scott,
keep doing what you're doing.

00:30:09.308 --> 00:30:11.143 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's got to watch
those clouds for us.

00:30:11.143 --> 00:30:12.344 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Stevens:
[Laughs] Undoubtedly.

00:30:12.344 --> 00:30:13.546 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Next time
you look in the skies,

00:30:13.546 --> 00:30:15.281 align:middle line:84%
look at that pattern,
look at those chemtrails,

00:30:15.281 --> 00:30:19.718 align:middle line:84%
and then you decide
whether it is manmade,

00:30:19.718 --> 00:30:20.986 align:middle line:90%
or made from Mother Nature.

00:30:20.986 --> 00:30:21.954 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:30:21.954 --> 00:30:24.189 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:30:24.189 --> 00:30:25.190 align:middle line:90%
