tremendous fear of dying.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.560 align:middle line:84%
It seemed to spring
up out of nowhere,

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.530 align:middle line:84%
and it just had me
secretly look for evidence

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.460 align:middle line:90%
to believe in to rest my fears.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.670 align:middle line:84%
I started feeling like
there's so much more to life

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:23.660 align:middle line:90%
than meets the eye.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.580 align:middle line:84%

the afterlife is?

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.650 align:middle line:84%

at a different energy,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.600 align:middle line:90%
but they're here right now.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.299 align:middle line:84%
Whatever we have left
undone here on Earth,

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:33.650 align:middle line:90%
we can do on the other side.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.440 align:middle line:84%
I think our loved ones are busy,
but they're only a thought,

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.970 align:middle line:90%
a heartbeat, a breath away.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.030 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, we are part
of a much bigger picture,

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.590 align:middle line:90%
and we can never die.

welcome to "Beyond Belief."

In 1996, the fear of
dying led Sandra Champlain

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.270 align:middle line:10%
on a journey to find
evidence of the afterlife.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.080 align:middle line:84%
She has spent 25 years
researching and eventually

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.690 align:middle line:84%
sharing the truth that
she has uncovered,

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.110 align:middle line:90%
which she'll share with us.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.070 align:middle line:84%

Oh, George, thank you.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happy to
be here with you.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's great
seeing you again.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.040 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to you so
many times on the radio,

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.230 align:middle line:84%
but it's good to see you
up front and personal.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Absolutely.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Normally, it's in the middle
of the night for me, but--

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sure is.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.452 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: --I love it.

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were once a
skeptic about all of this.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.450 align:middle line:90%
What changed your mind?

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Yeah,
skeptic about all of it.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.310 align:middle line:10%
My dad-- very
scientifically minded,

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.980 align:middle line:10%
and kids, you need to
see it to believe it,

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.808 align:middle line:10%
that sort of attitude.

00:01:38.808 --> 00:01:40.850 align:middle line:10%
And then I went through
it just a tremendous fear

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.270 align:middle line:10%
of dying that seemed to
spring up out of nowhere,

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.690 align:middle line:10%
and it just had me
secretly look for evidence,

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.450 align:middle line:10%
look for something to
believe in to rest my fears.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.450 align:middle line:84%
So throughout my
journey, I started

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.200 align:middle line:84%
having weird experiences like
psychic things happening to me.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.930 align:middle line:84%
I'd know a song before
it came on the radio.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, how
does that happen?

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.540 align:middle line:90%
And so that--

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were these
like messages,

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.148 align:middle line:84%
people were trying to
tell you something?

00:02:05.148 --> 00:02:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: At that point, no.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.432 align:middle line:84%
But I'd hear "Love Me Tender"
in my brain, Elvis singing it,

00:02:10.432 --> 00:02:12.265 align:middle line:84%
and I'd turn on the
radio, and it was there.

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:13.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: (IMPERSONATING
ELVIS) Thank you very much.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: So it
was my first hint

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.770 align:middle line:84%
that we are more than
we believe we are.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up taking
a course in mediumship,

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.710 align:middle line:84%
which I wanted to be
true, but I thought

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.830 align:middle line:84%
things that seem to be too
good to be true usually

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.740 align:middle line:84%
are, and out of my own
head, could accurately

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.450 align:middle line:84%
tell people some details
about their loved ones.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I started feeling like
there's so much more to life

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.520 align:middle line:90%
than meets the eye.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was it
that began to start

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.613 align:middle line:84%
changing your mind about
the skeptic to a believer?

00:02:43.613 --> 00:02:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Well, like
I said, the mediumship

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.180 align:middle line:90%
was the very first part.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.720 align:middle line:84%
I had taken a course,
and with my eyes closed,

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.530 align:middle line:84%
I was told to use my
imagination and literally invent

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.290 align:middle line:84%
someone standing behind the
partner I was working with--

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.858 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: --because what
the instructor was saying

00:02:59.858 --> 00:03:00.920 align:middle line:90%
is this is just practice.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.070 align:middle line:90%
We aren't really doing it.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.490 align:middle line:84%
So it took away all my
fears, and, of course, I'm

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.830 align:middle line:90%
very creative, I think.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And so I invented a man
standing behind my partner.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.540 align:middle line:84%
With my eyes
closed, I said, it's

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.000 align:middle line:84%
your grandfather
on your mom's side.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.860 align:middle line:90%
He was a fisherman in Denmark.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.530 align:middle line:84%
My imagination gave
me a fishing boat.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.750 align:middle line:84%
I saw him puffing
away on a cigarette.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.970 align:middle line:84%
I saw a big gap between
his two front teeth.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.840 align:middle line:84%
I hear the name, Jan, and
that-- and the word, "Denmark,"

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.800 align:middle line:90%
like he's from Denmark.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I just shared what I
saw, and when I opened my eyes,

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.170 align:middle line:90%
she's crying.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.470 align:middle line:90%
Her grandfather's name was Jan.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.720 align:middle line:90%
He was a fisherman in Denmark.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
didn't know that?

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: None of it.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.958 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I never
even met this woman.

00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:43.760 align:middle line:84%
So that began the journey, and
then I stayed very, very quiet,

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.000 align:middle line:84%
and I got interested in
electronic voice phenomena by--

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: EVPs.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: --watching things
on the computer, reading books,

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.850 align:middle line:84%
and lo and behold, I
took a course on EVPs.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.555 align:middle line:84%
And late at night, with
my digital tape recorder

00:03:59.555 --> 00:04:03.650 align:middle line:84%
is what I had, I was staying at
the Omega Center in Rhinebeck,

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.690 align:middle line:84%
New York, and just
recording raindrops.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And I really wanted to come
forward and be honest to people

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.190 align:middle line:90%
that I believe in the afterlife.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.640 align:middle line:84%
But I was still so scared
what people would think of me.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.130 align:middle line:84%
But I said to any loved
ones that were with me,

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.810 align:middle line:84%
I said, if this
is real and I need

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.450 align:middle line:84%
to share about the
reality of the afterlife,

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.010 align:middle line:84%
I said, I need
you to try to talk

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.610 align:middle line:90%
really loud into my microphone.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: And then
I'll say good night.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And when I replayed
this short recording,

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.410 align:middle line:84%
it says, good night,
Sandra, in a man's voice.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.780 align:middle line:84%
Two women whispered,
good night, good night.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:39.980 align:middle line:90%
And then another male--

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.490 align:middle line:90%
male's voice saying, good night.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: So talk
about putting goosebumps

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.080 align:middle line:84%
throughout me, but that
was the first thing

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.900 align:middle line:84%
that gave me, like,
tangible evidence, something

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:52.700 align:middle line:90%
I could share.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, I
just started experimenting

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:55.830 align:middle line:90%
and working with people.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:56.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And growing with it.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.855 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: And
growing with it.

00:04:57.855 --> 00:05:00.380 align:middle line:84%
So not only could I see
people in my mind's eye,

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.740 align:middle line:84%
but I was getting recordings
that were so special,

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.420 align:middle line:90%
mostly "I love yous."

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.260 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Yeah, and then it--

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.780 align:middle line:84%
now, I kept all of this
secret from most people,

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.670 align:middle line:84%
because I really thought
people would think

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.260 align:middle line:90%
I would be a little strange.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.110 align:middle line:84%
So I collected all kinds
of really good information

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.900 align:middle line:84%
about the afterlife,
feeling that someday, I'll

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.923 align:middle line:90%
tell people, but just not now.

00:05:22.923 --> 00:05:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And look
what you're doing now.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Yeah.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Look what
you're doing now.

Sandra, in the Gaia series,
"Damanhur, A Journey

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.210 align:middle line:84%
through Time,"
Crotalo Sesamo teaches

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.450 align:middle line:84%
why synchronicity is
a fundamental source

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:36.400 align:middle line:90%
of evolution.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.200 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the evolution for us is
what I've been briefly describe

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.420 align:middle line:84%
as the process of the
spiritualization of the matter.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.150 align:middle line:84%
In other-- in other
hands, it is what

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.280 align:middle line:84%
is being called
the Enlightenment,

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.590 align:middle line:84%
or again, in spiritual
physics is what we call also

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:53.880 align:middle line:90%
metamorphosis.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's literally to bring
the matter to become light,

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.840 align:middle line:84%
to bring the form
to become energy.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.720 align:middle line:84%
It's everything that
is born to the idea

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.300 align:middle line:84%
that the form could be
transformed in something

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.100 align:middle line:90%
that we call spirit.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, but complexity,
it's now very interesting

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.710 align:middle line:84%
to help us to understand how
synchronicity, it's bonding

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.730 align:middle line:90%
all these different events.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.390 align:middle line:84%
So we can truly
say that everything

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:25.140 align:middle line:84%
that is happening, so all
these events that are not

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.270 align:middle line:84%
based on cause/effect, but
on synchronicity, are guided,

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.950 align:middle line:84%
are drawn to a higher
level of evolution.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.680 align:middle line:84%
So I like to imagine that the
universal form is immersed

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.830 align:middle line:84%
in something that is
literally pulling or pushing,

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.340 align:middle line:84%
if you like, everything
in a direction

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.280 align:middle line:84%
of spiritualized
matter to transform

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.930 align:middle line:90%
the matter into light.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:53.670 align:middle line:84%
So everything is pulled
to become more evolved.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, we are still talking
about a field of possibilities

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.330 align:middle line:84%
because we don't have
to forget that we have

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.270 align:middle line:84%
a very important other element
that we've been introduced

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.400 align:middle line:90%
that is called the free will.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And the free will is
always the possibility

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:13.530 align:middle line:84%
to evolve or to evolve fast
or also not to evolve, to stop

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:14.980 align:middle line:90%
or even to go back.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:15.780 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.970 align:middle line:84%
So free will is the
power of our choices.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:23.295 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have to forget that
we are the masters of our life,

00:07:23.295 --> 00:07:25.920 align:middle line:84%
and we don't have to forget that
all of these possibility, they

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.300 align:middle line:84%
could be used in
many different way.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.620 align:middle line:84%
This is the reason why, also
in the perception of the event,

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.260 align:middle line:84%
something for me could
be extremely positive,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.410 align:middle line:84%
and the same exact
situation for another person

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.360 align:middle line:90%
could be felt exactly negative.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.880 align:middle line:84%
So synchronicity
is moving events

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.550 align:middle line:84%
thanks to the
complexity, to what

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.350 align:middle line:84%
we call the error
of complexity, so

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:49.727 align:middle line:84%
the error of evolution, that
is pulling us to change.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.200 align:middle line:84%
I've always been
fascinated, Sandra,

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.440 align:middle line:84%
by these thinkers who
come up with these things.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.310 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Brilliant.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
"synchronicity" mean to you?

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: My dad would say
it's God's way of remaining

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:05.253 align:middle line:84%
anonymous, and I love
that because as a human--

00:08:05.253 --> 00:08:06.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting phrase.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Yeah,
whether you believe

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:11.160 align:middle line:84%
in God, the universe,
higher power, I think we're

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.080 align:middle line:84%
only shown just what
we need in our life.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.570 align:middle line:84%
We get these little
trails to follow,

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:18.480 align:middle line:84%

on, where if I'm--

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.460 align:middle line:84%
got the courage to say hello
to the next person sitting next

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.710 align:middle line:84%
to me, they're either
coming from a funeral,

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:28.000 align:middle line:90%

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

>>CHAMPLAIN: --they
had a fear of dying,

00:08:30.057 --> 00:08:31.599 align:middle line:84%
so I've had a lot
of synchronicities.

00:08:31.599 --> 00:08:33.307 align:middle line:84%
And I just travel with
a copy of my book.

00:08:33.307 --> 00:08:35.789 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, so have they,
then, to be put next to you.

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:36.789 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Absolutely.

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:37.299 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:38.799 align:middle line:84%
I don't take it
lightly, and I feel

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:41.049 align:middle line:84%
like human beings
have to trust where

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:44.650 align:middle line:84%
we are today in this very moment

for a reason, don't you?

>>CHAMPLAIN: I think things
happen for a reason generally.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:58.630 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's some
really horrific things that

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:02.230 align:middle line:84%
can happen, and
I know that if we

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:04.720 align:middle line:84%
can look at that situation--
what did I learn from it?

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.170 align:middle line:90%
What am I taking away?

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:07.780 align:middle line:90%
How can I help another person?

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who manifests
these things to happen?

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.850 align:middle line:84%
Do we do it, or is there
something out there

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:13.990 align:middle line:90%
that makes it done?

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: What I
say to empower myself,

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.230 align:middle line:84%
because I think each one of
us has to find our own truths,

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:24.460 align:middle line:84%
is that we came into this
Earth on our own free will.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.620 align:middle line:84%
There's stuff to learn
here that we're not

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.420 align:middle line:90%
going to learn anywhere else.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.440 align:middle line:90%
We have emotions.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.920 align:middle line:90%
We have flesh and bones.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:33.880 align:middle line:90%
We can hug people.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.260 align:middle line:90%
We can taste things.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And we choose what our
life's path is going to be,

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:42.070 align:middle line:84%
not down to every
small interaction,

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:45.170 align:middle line:84%
but the general things we
want to learn in our life.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:45.970 align:middle line:90%
So I think we do.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Sandra, what was
your aha moment where you

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:52.100 align:middle line:84%
really realized, I
have a mission here--

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.690 align:middle line:90%
I have a purpose here?

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:54.490 align:middle line:90%
What was it?

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:58.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: It was after
seeing a movie called "50/50"

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.160 align:middle line:90%
that was about--

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.510 align:middle line:90%
well, it was called a comedy.

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
my dad had passed.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:07.910 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:08.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sorry to hear that.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:09.628 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Thank you.

00:10:09.628 --> 00:10:11.255 align:middle line:84%
Enough time has
passed, so I don't

00:10:11.255 --> 00:10:13.380 align:middle line:84%
say time heals all wounds,
but it certainly makes--

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:13.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It helps.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:14.565 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: --the
journey easier.

00:10:14.565 --> 00:10:15.365 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It helps.

00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: But I had collected
so much about the afterlife,

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.160 align:middle line:84%
and I also collected a lot
about the grieving process

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.200 align:middle line:90%
and why it has to hurt so much.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't
handle the thoughts

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.790 align:middle line:84%
in my own head that
were saying, Sandra,

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.470 align:middle line:84%
you've got to tell
people about this.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.810 align:middle line:90%
You can really help humanity.

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.420 align:middle line:84%
But fear can really
cripple people,

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:41.070 align:middle line:84%
so I take myself to the movies
to get my mind off everything,

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:45.630 align:middle line:84%
and this particular movie
had some comedy moments,

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.180 align:middle line:84%
but it was a story of a
young man getting cancer,

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:51.960 align:middle line:84%
going through chemotherapy
treatments, his friends dying,

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.520 align:middle line:90%
and it was about grief.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:58.680 align:middle line:84%
So I got into my car with
tears running down my face,

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.940 align:middle line:84%
and for the very first
time, had my new iPhone--

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.800 align:middle line:84%
never used the
camera, and I just

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.850 align:middle line:84%
felt like making a confession--
and held the camera to my face

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:12.630 align:middle line:84%
and told a 20-minute
story of my journey

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.780 align:middle line:84%
and that this is the
moment I need to share.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, George, I was never going
to show anybody that film.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:19.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You just
wanted a record it.

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:21.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I just wanted
to get it off my chest.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:21.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.595 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: And didn't
a friend of mine call

00:11:23.595 --> 00:11:25.470 align:middle line:90%
and say her dad had passed.

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:26.370 align:middle line:90%
What do I know?

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have the time to
really talk to her, so I said,

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to send
you this video,

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:33.150 align:middle line:84%
but don't share it
with anyone else.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.483 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That you just recorded.

00:11:34.483 --> 00:11:36.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: And I
did, and she went off

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.330 align:middle line:84%
to share it with two friends
and two friends and two friends,

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:40.620 align:middle line:90%
and it just grew.

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And the difference that
it made and people chose--

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:44.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it
make social network?

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:45.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Yes.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It did.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: It did,
and people chose

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.460 align:middle line:84%
not to take their own
lives because of it.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.010 align:middle line:84%
People changed
their relationships.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.230 align:middle line:84%
People had faith
in the afterlife,

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:57.900 align:middle line:84%
and that's when I thought,
I'm the one for this mission.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was your
dad very influential

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:01.590 align:middle line:90%
in some of this for you?

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: He was, and
he was very religious.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.360 align:middle line:90%
He went to church every day.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:07.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: So I was--

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Every day?

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Every day, so
I was afraid to tell him

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.530 align:middle line:84%
that I'd been on this secret
search of the afterlife.

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:17.130 align:middle line:84%
But before he passed, I felt
like I needed to tell him

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:18.570 align:middle line:90%
what was in my heart.

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.750 align:middle line:84%
So I told him about some of the
medium courses that I've done

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.700 align:middle line:84%
and some of the things,
and he looked at me

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.235 align:middle line:84%
with big brown eyes like,
you've got-- you know,

00:12:26.235 --> 00:12:27.990 align:middle line:84%
he wanted to
believe me, but this

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:29.520 align:middle line:90%
was a little far out there.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment,
in my mind, I saw

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.090 align:middle line:84%
a yellow Piper Cub
airplane, tail dragger,

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.190 align:middle line:90%
with black letters on it.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And I felt, in my heart,
a man laughing, saying,

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.340 align:middle line:84%

is beyond the clouds.

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:42.950 align:middle line:84%
I think mediums and people
that can connect with people

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:45.050 align:middle line:84%
can because they're
just vibrating

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:46.490 align:middle line:90%
at a different energy.

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:48.660 align:middle line:90%
But they're here right now.

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.090 align:middle line:84%
So around us right
now, we've got

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.220 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of wireless
signals going on,

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:54.270 align:middle line:84%
and energy can live
in the same place

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:56.670 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, different
sources of energy.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.300 align:middle line:84%
So there's no reason our
loved ones can't be here,

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.260 align:middle line:90%
right here, right now as well.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.710 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very close to
what we have here on Earth,

I'm hoping without
the mosquitoes.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Subtle thing about grief
is where people feel that if I

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:38.860 align:middle line:84%
stop grieving, I am betraying
the person or the thing that

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:42.850 align:middle line:84%
left because I'm forgetting,
and I must remember,

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:45.790 align:middle line:90%
or else I wasn't a true lover.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:47.770 align:middle line:84%
The extraordinary
thing about it is

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:52.630 align:middle line:84%
that as you quiet down from
the active process of grieving,

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:56.950 align:middle line:84%
you quiet down, and
you listen, and you

00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:00.790 align:middle line:84%
begin to appreciate that
the way in which you

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:05.620 align:middle line:84%
are with another person
in love exists independent

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:08.950 align:middle line:84%
of coming and going,
even independent of death

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:11.930 align:middle line:90%
and all of those things.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Ramana Maharshi,
the sage, said when

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.770 align:middle line:84%
he was dying of cancer
and everybody said to him,

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.730 align:middle line:84%
Bhagavan, Bhagavan,
don't leave us.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:19.530 align:middle line:90%
Don't leave us.

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:20.400 align:middle line:90%
And he looked confused.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.480 align:middle line:90%
He says, don't be silly.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.820 align:middle line:90%
Where could I go?

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:25.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm just
dropping a body.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going anywhere.

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And so you realize
that the grieving

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:35.760 align:middle line:84%
is part of the dramatic
storyline of your separateness

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.380 align:middle line:84%

grieve for something

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:38.697 align:middle line:90%

and we literally have
to ride the wave.

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:04.400 align:middle line:90%
What we resist persists.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.780 align:middle line:90%
So go with it.

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:09.970 align:middle line:84%
But our brain body is trying

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:11.750 align:middle line:90%
without that person.

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm-- everything
I'm talking about as far

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.410 align:middle line:84%
as the afterlife, the foundation
of everything is helping people

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:21.850 align:middle line:84%
through grief, but I think grief
can be very powerful to get us

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:26.240 align:middle line:84%
to go on our spiritual journeys
and ask those big questions--

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.250 align:middle line:90%
what is life for?

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:28.150 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And I have found
more times than not,

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:34.870 align:middle line:84%
either grief can kind
of kill somebody inside,

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:38.200 align:middle line:84%
and they stop living, or it
can put them on this journey,

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.363 align:middle line:84%
and they can embrace
the miraculous.

00:16:40.363 --> 00:16:42.280 align:middle line:84%

the afterlife are real.

hmm, what do you
think about this show?

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:04.630 align:middle line:84%
What-- do you listen
to "Coast to Coast AM"?

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:06.430 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
about this and that?

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And you get people
into conversations,

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:11.050 align:middle line:84%
and you realize whether
they're open or they're not.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:13.210 align:middle line:84%
I think people
that are not open,

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:17.060 align:middle line:84%
we shouldn't even try to
push our beliefs on them.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.240 align:middle line:84%
I think we should
still share who we are

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.849 align:middle line:84%
and what we believe in and
have confidence in that,

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:23.260 align:middle line:90%
but never really try to push.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.290 align:middle line:84%
There will be a day that I
think every human being starts

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:27.640 align:middle line:90%
asking these questions.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And when they're

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.300 align:middle line:84%

and say, look at this?

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I have, and
I've got YouTube videos

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:42.340 align:middle line:84%
that I talk about the
10 reasons to believe

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.790 align:middle line:84%
in the afterlife, all coming
from my skeptical mind--

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:49.360 align:middle line:84%
not pushing it on anyone,
but this is my journey.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:53.250 align:middle line:84%
We human beings want
to believe, but we're

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:55.920 align:middle line:84%
so afraid what other
people will think.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And there's a great quote
by Arthur Schopenhauer,

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:03.570 align:middle line:90%
great philosophy from years ago.

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:07.690 align:middle line:84%
He said, "All truth passes
through three stages.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:09.750 align:middle line:90%
First, it is ridiculed.

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:12.750 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, it is
violently opposed.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:16.392 align:middle line:84%
Third, it becomes
realized as self-evident."

00:18:16.392 --> 00:18:18.600 align:middle line:84%
So when you think of people
like the Wright brothers,

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.780 align:middle line:84%
people laughed at them, their
dream of a flying machine.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.550 align:middle line:84%
People really violently
opposed what they were doing,

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:25.350 align:middle line:90%
and then look.

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.930 align:middle line:90%
Here we are--

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:26.640 align:middle line:90%

happen with the afterlife.

I think more people have a
fear of sharing their belief.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.770 align:middle line:10%
Almost everybody has
had a moment where

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:09.260 align:middle line:10%
they know the telephone is
going to ring, and then it does,

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:11.210 align:middle line:10%

at the same time.

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:15.710 align:middle line:84%

There's something that
people can't put their finger

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.780 align:middle line:84%

their memorial services.

so they know we're

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:44.950 align:middle line:84%
going to be together
in just a moment,

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:46.450 align:middle line:84%
and there's actually
a third reason.

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:48.460 align:middle line:84%
I think sometimes
they're giving signs,

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:50.980 align:middle line:84%
and we are so busy either
looking at our phones

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:53.500 align:middle line:84%
or on the computer or being
in our own head worried

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.470 align:middle line:84%
about the future, that there
could be a license plate

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:58.810 align:middle line:84%
right in front of us with
our loved one's name on it,

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:02.745 align:middle line:84%
big rainbow in the sky, all
kinds of things happening,

00:25:02.745 --> 00:25:04.120 align:middle line:84%
but they're not
looking for that.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:05.578 align:middle line:84%
They're looking
for something else.

00:25:05.578 --> 00:25:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The average person
looks at their smartphone 96

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:09.520 align:middle line:90%
times a day.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Wow.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That seems low to me.

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:13.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: It does
seem low to me too.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a buddy of
mine who has passed on.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.318 align:middle line:84%
He would look at his
phone every three minutes.

00:25:18.318 --> 00:25:19.568 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Oh, that's crazy.

00:25:19.568 --> 00:25:20.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Every three minutes.

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:23.650 align:middle line:90%
So what's 3 divided into 1 hour?

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:24.590 align:middle line:90%
20.

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:26.290 align:middle line:90%
20 times an hour.

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:28.540 align:middle line:90%
Eight hours-- that's 160 times.

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:30.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: But
our loved ones come

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.620 align:middle line:84%
through when our mind
is quiet, and they come

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:35.510 align:middle line:90%
through using our imagination.

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:38.650 align:middle line:84%
So if we're so busy
looking at our phone

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:41.712 align:middle line:84%
or thinking about things,
they can't get through.

00:25:41.712 --> 00:25:43.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've
ever been driving,

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:46.000 align:middle line:84%
and you just kind of
feel somebody with you.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.560 align:middle line:84%
Or every so often, out
of the corner of my eye,

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.800 align:middle line:90%
I feel or see my grandmother.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's easy to say, oh,
that's just my imagination.

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:55.572 align:middle line:90%
But that's how they work.

00:25:55.572 --> 00:25:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a call
from a truck driver

00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:01.240 align:middle line:84%
one night on "Coast to Coast,"
and he said, George, you're not

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.410 align:middle line:90%
going to believe this story.

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yeah,
I probably will.

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:12.000 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm driving on a very
curvy, cliffy road in my truck,

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000 align:middle line:90%
semi, and I'm exhausted.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.520 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't have been driving.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:23.290 align:middle line:84%
I doze off going around
these windy, cliffy roads.

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I woke up, and I
was ready to go over the cliff.

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:33.970 align:middle line:90%
A hand grabs my steering wheel.

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:38.140 align:middle line:84%
I already got my two hands
on it, but I'm half asleep.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:43.240 align:middle line:84%
A hand grabs it and turns
me back onto the road.

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:46.320 align:middle line:84%
I was headed right
off the cliff.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.500 align:middle line:90%
I stopped my truck.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.270 align:middle line:90%
I woke up.

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:52.340 align:middle line:84%
I look around, and
there's nobody there.

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:53.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Right.

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:55.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whose hand was it?

00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:57.403 align:middle line:84%
Who steps in to do
things like that?

>>CHAMPLAIN: If
you want to call--

00:26:58.820 --> 00:26:59.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It wasn't his.

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:01.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: --them angels,
but I've heard so many stories

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:02.780 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:04.697 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: About your
dearly departed loved one.

00:27:04.697 --> 00:27:06.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Yeah,
absolutely, they can.

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think, like I said,
they can mess with free will,

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:13.760 align:middle line:84%
but there are times where
they can be involved,

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.400 align:middle line:84%
and there's plenty
of stories, though,

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:20.763 align:middle line:84%
of people who have had these
angels that have helped them.

00:27:20.763 --> 00:27:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And then no one else
has witnessed them,

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:25.490 align:middle line:84%
but they've saved their life,
because their time wasn't up.

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you like
the fact that you

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:30.020 align:middle line:90%
can dabble with the afterlife?

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:31.280 align:middle line:90%
Is it enjoyable to you?

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: It's enjoyable.

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:35.960 align:middle line:84%
It's something I
love investigating.

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:38.205 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's some crazy
things out there, so--

00:27:38.205 --> 00:27:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what do
you mean by crazy?

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:42.038 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Well, I don't--
it's like you don't want

00:27:42.038 --> 00:27:43.860 align:middle line:84%
to throw the baby out
with the bathwater.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:44.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: There's
some-- I totally

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:50.330 align:middle line:84%
believe in trance communication,
some of these mediums

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:53.230 align:middle line:84%
that can speak on behalf
of somebody who's lived.

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:54.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: But I also think
our subconscious mind is

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:00.740 align:middle line:84%
very powerful, and it's
very easy for somebody

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:03.440 align:middle line:84%
to close their eyes
and to say things.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And I've witnessed some
folks that, in my gut,

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.080 align:middle line:90%
I just don't feel as truthful.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.647 align:middle line:90%
But I--

00:28:10.647 --> 00:28:12.365 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think
they made up stories?

00:28:12.365 --> 00:28:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Whether
they made up stories

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:15.410 align:middle line:84%
or they believe it
themselves, I think

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:17.100 align:middle line:90%
our minds can be very important.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:19.760 align:middle line:84%
So I say to people,
look for your own truth.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:23.030 align:middle line:84%
What I say in my book
and on the podcast

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:26.960 align:middle line:84%
may not fit for everyone, but
if it resonates with your soul,

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:27.920 align:middle line:90%
follow it.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we get
signs from the other side

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.980 align:middle line:84%
that our loved ones are out
there communicating with us?

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Well,
there's different ways.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, through
our imagination,

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:41.360 align:middle line:84%
you could smell your
grandmother's apple pie or pipe

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:43.610 align:middle line:90%
your father used to smoke.

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:45.800 align:middle line:84%
I know people say,
I see feathers,

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:46.850 align:middle line:90%
and that must be a sign.

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:48.230 align:middle line:84%
But we have to be
careful of that

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:50.920 align:middle line:84%
too, because there could be a
bird around the corner that--

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:51.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There could be.

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:52.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: --didn't make it.

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:53.620 align:middle line:90%
Music--

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You did a
documentary on a woman

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:57.527 align:middle line:90%
by the name of Sonia Rinaldi.

00:28:57.527 --> 00:28:58.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: That's right.

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:00.210 align:middle line:90%
It's still in the works.

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:01.085 align:middle line:90%
It's almost complete.

00:29:01.085 --> 00:29:02.085 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But who is she?

00:29:02.085 --> 00:29:03.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Sonia
is a scientist

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:06.020 align:middle line:84%
who's been in Brazil,
lives in Brazil.

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:10.940 align:middle line:84%
For over 30 years, she's been
interested in the afterlife.

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.880 align:middle line:84%
I had heard about her at
a conference forever ago,

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:17.030 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, ooh, I want
to meet this woman someday.

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:20.390 align:middle line:84%
At those times,
back in the day, she

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:23.540 align:middle line:84%
would have two chairs
set up and a third chair.

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:26.360 align:middle line:84%
She'd have a mom,
herself, and a chair

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.090 align:middle line:90%
for the child in the afterlife.

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:29.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: An empty chair.

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:30.257 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: An empty chair.

00:29:30.257 --> 00:29:33.260 align:middle line:84%
She would play a
recording of gibberish,

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:35.930 align:middle line:84%
chopped up human
voices, all rearranged.

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:36.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:38.312 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: She'd
talk to the parent

00:29:38.312 --> 00:29:40.790 align:middle line:84%
and say, talk as if
your child's here.

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:42.620 align:middle line:90%
This is all experimentation.

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:44.870 align:middle line:84%
She has never charged
a penny for her work.

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:46.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That had to be
emotional for the parent.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.327 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Very emotional.

00:29:47.327 --> 00:29:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And for thousands of
parents who sat with her,

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:52.520 align:middle line:84%
when she played back
that tape recording,

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:56.180 align:middle line:84%
not only did the parents'
voice beyond their speaking,

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:58.280 align:middle line:84%
but you would hear
the child's response.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.134 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Answering?

00:29:59.134 --> 00:29:59.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Answering.

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: So I knew
someday, I wanted to meet her.

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:04.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That freaks me out.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Yeah, definitely.

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And then you and I had met
at an afterlife symposium,

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:12.658 align:middle line:84%
and Sonia happened to be
there showing her new work.

00:30:12.658 --> 00:30:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I remember that.

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: And
her new work was

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:19.190 align:middle line:84%
filming static on a television
or a computer screen

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:24.390 align:middle line:84%
and having faces show up when
she would play frame by frame.

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:25.700 align:middle line:90%
So in every second of video--

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:26.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You had to look.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: You had to look.

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:28.362 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You had to look.

00:30:28.362 --> 00:30:30.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: She would go
through each 32 frames or 64

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.990 align:middle line:84%
or however many are in
a second in a video,

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:34.460 align:middle line:84%
and there would
be faces in there.

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And she started
Work with parents,

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:38.900 align:middle line:84%
and the child's
faces were there.

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's moved on, so
now she uses, literally,

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:44.570 align:middle line:90%
a clear Easter egg mold.

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And she's got four
mini projectors

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:49.340 align:middle line:84%
that all project
static electricity.

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:53.340 align:middle line:84%
I guess it's static like from
a TV channel that's all static.

And she'll film it, and
she'll work with a parent.

00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:59.297 align:middle line:84%
And she can do it
remotely as well.

00:30:59.297 --> 00:31:00.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:01.922 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Doesn't
need the parent there.

00:31:01.922 --> 00:31:03.530 align:middle line:84%
She's had scientists
come through.

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Very interesting-- Nikola
Tesla has shown his face.

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:09.930 align:middle line:84%
He's never been
filmed or recorded

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:12.310 align:middle line:84%
with a smile on his face,
and lo and beholden, his--

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:13.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They stole his plans.

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:14.360 align:middle line:90%
He's not happy.

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:16.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: --trans
image, he's smiling.

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:19.380 align:middle line:84%
But she's got hundreds
if not thousands

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.400 align:middle line:90%
of pictures-- mainly children.

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.700 align:middle line:84%
She works with parents,
again, for free.

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.070 align:middle line:84%
So we're doing a
documentary on her

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:28.090 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to
have over this winter.

>>NOORY: My signed copy.

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: That's right.

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:47.460 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had an
opportunity to talk to somebody

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:50.980 align:middle line:90%
on the other side--

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:52.590 align:middle line:90%
and I'm sure you do--

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:55.520 align:middle line:84%
but what kind of
questions do you ask?

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Well, it'd
be questions about what

00:31:57.650 --> 00:32:00.110 align:middle line:90%
is life like over there.

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny
because I actually

00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:04.610 align:middle line:90%
do have an opportunity.

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:09.090 align:middle line:84%
Every Friday-- a friend of
mine is a trance medium,

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:10.740 align:middle line:90%
and I met him six years ago.

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, a
skeptical mind would say,

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:16.770 align:middle line:84%
this might be this young
man putting on a voice.

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:19.500 align:middle line:84%
But for the past
year and a half,

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.960 align:middle line:84%
on Fridays, we get to
have a very extraordinary

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.340 align:middle line:90%
conversation.

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:27.090 align:middle line:84%
People can come for free
online and listen and ask

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:28.060 align:middle line:90%
their questions.

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:31.210 align:middle line:84%
So the questions are, what
is the afterlife like?

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:34.890 align:middle line:84%
People that have ended their
own life, do they get punished?

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:36.540 align:middle line:90%
The answer is no.

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:42.580 align:middle line:84%
Things about what is life for,
and how does healing work--

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:45.080 align:middle line:84%
how do we communicate
with our loved ones?

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And I get goosebumps
right now because, for me,

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:51.558 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to talk about because
I think skeptical minds might

00:32:51.558 --> 00:32:52.600 align:middle line:90%
have a hard time with it.

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.360 align:middle line:84%
But this man, this
gentleman named

00:32:55.360 --> 00:33:00.190 align:middle line:84%
Eric, who died at the end of
the 1800s, never misses a beat,

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:02.245 align:middle line:90%
never hesitates in conversation.

00:33:02.245 --> 00:33:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's always there.

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:05.037 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Always
there and can answer

00:33:05.037 --> 00:33:07.480 align:middle line:90%
a question about anything.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:10.315 align:middle line:84%
So I'm in the process
now of creating a library

00:33:10.315 --> 00:33:11.440 align:middle line:90%
of all of these recordings.

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.090 align:middle line:84%

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:14.830 align:middle line:90%

>>NOORY: --which people can
hear on the iHeartRadio app?

00:33:17.163 --> 00:33:20.440 align:middle line:84%

our dear friend, the paranormal

00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:43.000 align:middle line:10%
says that sometimes it's
difficult to present

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.050 align:middle line:10%
scientific proof
to convince people.

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:47.850 align:middle line:10%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:51.990 align:middle line:10%
>> If we consider that there may
be an energy field that we can

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:56.730 align:middle line:10%
project ourselves
and that reality,

00:33:56.730 --> 00:34:00.540 align:middle line:10%
due to what we now consider the
holographic universe principle,

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:04.050 align:middle line:10%
is this conscious, sensitive
medium that we are sort

00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:06.960 align:middle line:10%
of wandering around in, that
we're not separate from,

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.570 align:middle line:10%
that we're a part of,
we ask the question,

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:12.630 align:middle line:10%
to what extent can we
control these things?

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:16.500 align:middle line:10%
Well, now, this is a
picture from our laboratory

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:20.400 align:middle line:10%
of a plasma that was created
between a couple of electrodes.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:24.900 align:middle line:10%
Now, a plasma is a highly
energized state of matter.

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:27.024 align:middle line:10%
It looks like a glowing
ball of light there.

00:34:27.024 --> 00:34:27.824 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:34:27.824 --> 00:34:30.000 align:middle line:10%
>> And we were experimenting
with this plasma--

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.350 align:middle line:10%
a group of us were--

00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:34.199 align:middle line:10%
because we think this
plasma is similar to what

00:34:34.199 --> 00:34:37.560 align:middle line:10%
a ghost is made out of when
people see a glowing form.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:39.000 align:middle line:10%
Well, at one point,
we're standing

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.639 align:middle line:10%
there looking at
that ball of plasma,

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:44.489 align:middle line:10%
and we started talking
about flying saucers.

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:48.510 align:middle line:10%
And something absolutely
mind-boggling happened.

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:52.350 align:middle line:10%
That plasma, before
our eyes, transformed

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:56.272 align:middle line:10%
into a saucer shape.

00:34:56.272 --> 00:34:57.072 align:middle line:10%
>> Now--

00:34:57.072 --> 00:34:57.872 align:middle line:10%
>> Interesting.

00:34:57.872 --> 00:34:59.877 align:middle line:84%
And it seems a little
more illuminated.

00:34:59.877 --> 00:35:02.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it's a little brighter,
and it's taken on that nice

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:03.350 align:middle line:90%
saucer shape.

00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:08.120 align:middle line:10%
Now, this was astounding to us
because if we can demonstrate,

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:10.400 align:middle line:10%
as I'm attempting
to here, that we

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:14.900 align:middle line:10%
have this energy field,
which can be transmitted

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:16.075 align:middle line:10%
outside the body--

00:35:16.075 --> 00:35:17.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Whether you're alive or dead.

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:20.400 align:middle line:10%
>> That's right--
and that this field,

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.390 align:middle line:10%
which is connected with our
consciousness, can, in fact,

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:29.240 align:middle line:10%
shape the space-time holographic
medium that we're walking

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:35.450 align:middle line:10%
in, then this would explain why
we have such great technology,

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:38.840 align:middle line:10%
but we still don't understand
so much about ghosts

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:39.770 align:middle line:10%
and the paranormal.

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:42.980 align:middle line:10%
The reason is
Newtonian physics has

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:46.880 align:middle line:10%
done a great job of allowing
us to build a better mousetrap,

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.190 align:middle line:10%
but we still don't
understand consciousness,

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:50.990 align:middle line:10%
this stream of information.

00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:54.770 align:middle line:10%
If paranormal phenomena
are the product

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:58.340 align:middle line:10%
of this intimate
relationship between the mind

00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:00.440 align:middle line:10%
and the body and
the environment,

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:04.040 align:middle line:10%
but every single person
is a unique individual,

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:05.900 align:middle line:10%
how do you standardize that?

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:07.370 align:middle line:10%
How do you customize that?

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:11.540 align:middle line:10%
Science requires that level
of consistent repeatability.

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:14.420 align:middle line:10%
But if this is something which
depends on the individual

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.010 align:middle line:10%
and it's different
for everybody,

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:18.530 align:middle line:10%
that explains why the
Newtonian approach has not

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:20.480 align:middle line:10%
been effective,
and now people who

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:24.140 align:middle line:10%
are looking into more
mental and holographic

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:26.480 align:middle line:10%
universe-oriented
principles are taking

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:29.210 align:middle line:10%
us closer to
understanding how we

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:32.997 align:middle line:10%
cooperate in this process of
making these things appear.

different interests
in the paranormal,

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You want to
rattle them, don't you?

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Yes, I do.

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I could tell.

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: But I
want to open them up

00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:23.755 align:middle line:84%
to go on their own
journey because when

00:37:23.755 --> 00:37:26.630 align:middle line:84%
these great things start
happening to them, where

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:29.652 align:middle line:84%
there's no explanation-- it can
only be their loved one-- they

00:37:29.652 --> 00:37:30.860 align:middle line:90%
really find out who they are.

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In my career,
there was only one time

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:37.310 align:middle line:84%
that I felt the other
side did not exist.

00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:39.920 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend of mine who
died in a motorcycle accident.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:40.730 align:middle line:90%
He was speeding.

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:43.055 align:middle line:84%
It was his fault.
Cops were chasing him.

00:37:43.055 --> 00:37:44.180 align:middle line:90%
He should have pulled over.

00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:47.000 align:middle line:84%
He kept going,
and he hit a curb,

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.690 align:middle line:84%
and he flew and landed
on top of a stop sign.

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:53.690 align:middle line:90%
It severed his torso.

00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:55.070 align:middle line:90%
That's how he died.

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:59.470 align:middle line:84%
So at the funeral, we're
all looking at the casket.

00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:02.000 align:middle line:84%
They kind of stitched
him up a little bit,

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.560 align:middle line:84%
but you look at this
stark, dead body.

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And it hits you for that
first time, what if that's it?

00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:10.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Right.

00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:11.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's over for him.

00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:12.950 align:middle line:90%
It's done.

00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:14.170 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing else.

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell
you, Sandra, it

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:22.480 align:middle line:84%
was the coldest, loneliest
feeling I've ever had.

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.768 align:middle line:90%
I can't explain why.

00:38:23.768 --> 00:38:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Yeah, we're human.

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:28.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we're meant
to understand at all.

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:29.200 align:middle line:90%
I think it's part of grief.

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.430 align:middle line:90%
We're stunned.

00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:34.690 align:middle line:84%
The good news is whatever we
have left undone here on Earth,

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:36.590 align:middle line:90%
we can do on the other side.

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:39.370 align:middle line:84%
So if you're single,
never had a relationship,

00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:42.230 align:middle line:84%
you can find your true love,
have kids, live happily ever

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:43.030 align:middle line:90%
after.

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:44.738 align:middle line:84%
If you've always wanted
to sing and never

00:38:44.738 --> 00:38:47.410 align:middle line:84%
had a voice here on Earth,
you can pursue that.

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:50.860 align:middle line:84%
I think our loved ones are
busy having their own life,

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:53.560 align:middle line:84%
but they're only a thought,
a heartbeat, a breath away,

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:56.380 align:middle line:84%
and they can be right
here by our sides.

00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:58.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
your new projects?

00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:01.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: My new projects
are really this documentary

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:03.010 align:middle line:90%
that's coming out.

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:03.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: And
online, we've been

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:10.065 align:middle line:84%
hosting some wonderful medium
classes and psychic classes,

00:39:10.065 --> 00:39:11.440 align:middle line:84%
and it's been
really interesting.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.340 align:middle line:84%
More and more people
are online these days.

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:14.548 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's your website?

00:39:14.548 --> 00:39:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Wedontdie.com.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And to work with a partner,
who's just a computer

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:23.980 align:middle line:84%
screen away, and be able to
give them a medium reading

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:27.290 align:middle line:84%
and bring through their
loved one, it's amazing.

00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And every Sunday, George,
we offer something free

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:31.780 align:middle line:90%
called our Sunday Gathering.

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's a Sunday service,
but it's so different.

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.310 align:middle line:90%
We do play music videos.

00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:38.110 align:middle line:90%
There are--

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:39.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's fun.

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:40.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: --a few prayers.

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:42.700 align:middle line:90%
There's an address, a reading.

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:43.960 align:middle line:90%
There's always a topic.

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.150 align:middle line:84%
This weekend, we're going
to do one on change.

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:48.340 align:middle line:84%
But within every
Sunday gathering,

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:50.330 align:middle line:90%
there is a medium demonstration.

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:52.480 align:middle line:84%
So our mediums bring
through loved ones

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.700 align:middle line:84%
for people who are in
our virtual audience,

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:57.040 align:middle line:90%
proving that we don't die.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had to
prove, with one thing,

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:03.940 align:middle line:84%
that the other side exists,
what would that one thing be?

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:06.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I would show
the pictures from Miss Sonia

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:07.730 align:middle line:90%
Rinaldi in Brazil.

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:14.200 align:middle line:84%
I had and I have a video of my
father, his face transforming

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:16.240 align:middle line:90%
out of this static energy.

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:17.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did it baffle you?

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: It baffled me.

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was asking him because
so many people were coming

00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:22.030 align:middle line:90%
through for other people.

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:23.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No trickery,
nothing like that.

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:23.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Nothing.

00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:25.870 align:middle line:84%
I said, Dad, if you're
up there, and you

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:26.920 align:middle line:90%
want to be part of this--

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:27.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pop up.

00:40:27.370 --> 00:40:29.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: --find
this lady in Brazil,

00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:31.127 align:middle line:84%
and put your face--
however she does it.

00:40:31.127 --> 00:40:31.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he did.

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:32.793 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: He did.

00:40:32.793 --> 00:40:35.020 align:middle line:84%
She sent me a group of
unknown photographs,

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:38.260 align:middle line:84%
which I share with my
followers in my Facebook group.

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:40.540 align:middle line:10%
And lo and behold,
this one was my dad,

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:43.990 align:middle line:10%
how he looked when he was
in his 20s in the Air Force.

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:47.380 align:middle line:10%
I have a very similar
picture, but in this picture,

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:50.120 align:middle line:10%
he's looking to the side
in this trans image,

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:53.320 align:middle line:10%
whereas the picture I have of
him, he's looking eye to eye.

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.880 align:middle line:10%
And it's amazing.

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:59.290 align:middle line:84%
So talk about going from
believing to knowing.

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:00.433 align:middle line:90%
And it's miraculous.

00:41:00.433 --> 00:41:02.725 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do people get
your book, "We Don't Die"?

00:41:02.725 --> 00:41:04.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: They can get
it on Amazon or wherever

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.320 align:middle line:90%
they buy books.

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:05.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:07.750 align:middle line:84%
Sandra, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:09.042 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Thank you, George.

00:41:09.042 --> 00:41:10.180 align:middle line:90%
My pleasure being here.

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:11.890 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Another
fascinating discussion

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:15.610 align:middle line:10%
talking about the afterlife,
another discussion where

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:18.550 align:middle line:10%
I'm convinced beyond
a shadow of a doubt

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:21.010 align:middle line:10%
that the other side exists.

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:22.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.840 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:30.000 align:middle line:90%
