00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.628 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.628 --> 00:00:19.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.090 align:middle line:10%
Sean Stone is with us, host
of Gaia series, "Buzzsaw."

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.890 align:middle line:10%
He's also a filmmaker, author.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.750 align:middle line:84%
He's an actor, a
poet, a speaker,

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.570 align:middle line:84%
and most of all,
a seeker of truth,

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.920 align:middle line:90%
and a spiritual activist.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.670 align:middle line:90%
Sean, welcome to the program.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN STONE: Thank you.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:33.710 align:middle line:90%
It's good to see you again.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How have you been?

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.570 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: We're doing well.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.120 align:middle line:84%
This is a crazy time we're
living in, as you know.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.995 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my gosh.

00:00:38.995 --> 00:00:40.477 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: And by
the time this show

00:00:40.477 --> 00:00:42.560 align:middle line:84%
airs, who knows what's
going to happen in between?

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.000 align:middle line:90%
But we're here.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's the
craziest of times.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:46.610 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Right?

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Remember the
saying, the best of times,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.040 align:middle line:90%
the worst of times.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.690 align:middle line:84%
I think we're in all
of that right now.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Absolutely.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have a project
called, "Best Kept Secret."

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.860 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.310 align:middle line:10%
>>STONE: "Best Kept Secret"
is about the dark side

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.560 align:middle line:10%
of the elite, what
we call the elite.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.747 align:middle line:10%
People now talk about the
World Economic Forum--

00:01:04.747 --> 00:01:05.830 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The powerbrokers.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.450 align:middle line:10%
>>STONE: --as
powerbrokers, exactly.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.130 align:middle line:10%
Those heads of
international mega banks

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.950 align:middle line:10%
and giant international
corporations and these

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.250 align:middle line:10%
thought leaders that they
consider to be important

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.460 align:middle line:10%
gathering together.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.110 align:middle line:84%
But overall, we
understand that there

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.910 align:middle line:84%
is an oligarchy at the heart
of, at least, our Western world.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And also, in China,
they have their elite.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.120 align:middle line:84%
So looking at the
nature of power,

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.820 align:middle line:90%
how do they influence mankind?

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, for thousands of years, it
was done through kings, right?

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.320 align:middle line:90%
Emperors and kings.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.900 align:middle line:84%
That was how you essentially
decreed things and then

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.460 align:middle line:90%
through the churches, right?

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.680 align:middle line:90%
The spiritual leaders who--

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And your head.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Exactly.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.770 align:middle line:84%
If you were a
heretic at the time,

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.110 align:middle line:84%
they would chop your head
off or burn you at the stake,

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.170 align:middle line:84%
if you rebelled against
the power structure.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.520 align:middle line:90%
So it's transitioned, right?

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.610 align:middle line:84%
We have so-called democracy,
so-called freedom.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the elite
has not gone away.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.039 align:middle line:84%
The financial elite that creates
the central banking systems,

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.490 align:middle line:84%
for example, and
coins, the currency,

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.595 align:middle line:84%
essentially is influencing
the politicians of the world.

00:02:18.595 --> 00:02:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
they want, Sean?

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.700 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: So the
way that I see it--

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.830 align:middle line:84%
and I break it down with
"Best Kept Secret"--

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.580 align:middle line:84%
is they want to continue
to rule over humanity.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.950 align:middle line:84%
There is a side-- there
is an aspect of wanting

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.107 align:middle line:90%
to limit the population.

00:02:31.107 --> 00:02:33.190 align:middle line:84%
We've heard people like
Bill Gates and others talk

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.980 align:middle line:84%
about that, wanting to
reduce the population.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.990 align:middle line:84%
The Georgia Guidestones
talked about it.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.080 align:middle line:90%
There's different numbers.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Look what
happened to them.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Look what
happen to them.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They got blown up.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.160 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: They got blown up.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.077 align:middle line:90%
It's very interesting.

00:02:43.077 --> 00:02:45.010 align:middle line:84%
So there's different
numbers, as far as

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.718 align:middle line:84%
how they want to
depopulate, whether it's

00:02:46.718 --> 00:02:47.620 align:middle line:90%
under half a million.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Some people say, 75% of the
population, which is basically

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.470 align:middle line:84%
down to 2 billion or
less people on the planet

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.690 align:middle line:90%
huge, huge, huge reductions.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how is this
going to be achieved?

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.340 align:middle line:84%
We don't go into all of
that in the documentary.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.840 align:middle line:84%
What we go into,
though, is the idea

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.970 align:middle line:84%
of controlling humanity at one
level of controlling the mind,

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:05.770 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:06.460 align:middle line:90%
How do they do that?

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Through the media,
through the narratives

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.580 align:middle line:84%
that are given to us
through the media.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.510 align:middle line:90%
And you know all about that.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.427 align:middle line:90%
You work in the media.

00:03:11.427 --> 00:03:14.230 align:middle line:84%
You see the stories that are
tailored and, essentially,

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.780 align:middle line:84%
given to us, whether it's
propaganda for a war,

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.520 align:middle line:84%
or for a political campaign,
or for an economic campaign,

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.320 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.470 align:middle line:90%
We need a war on poverty.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.428 align:middle line:90%
We need a war on drugs.

00:03:25.428 --> 00:03:26.510 align:middle line:90%
We need a war on terror.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.310 align:middle line:90%
We need a--

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I see
that all the time.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.700 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Right?

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I try to screen as
much of that out as I can.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.930 align:middle line:84%
What does sovereignty
mean to you, Sean?

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.730 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: So sovereignty is
what we are endowed with.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And what the Constitution and
the Declaration of Independence

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.250 align:middle line:84%
really helped to
clarify, I would say,

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.607 align:middle line:84%
it's what we are endowed with
by a divine creator, something

00:03:48.607 --> 00:03:49.690 align:middle line:90%
that is beyond this world.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's our gift.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: It's innate.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.150 align:middle line:90%
It's given to us, right?

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.850 align:middle line:84%
The Declaration talks
about that all men--

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.650 align:middle line:84%
obviously, men and
women-- are created

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.510 align:middle line:84%
equally by the creator
with unalienable rights

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.900 align:middle line:84%
to, essentially, freedom
and to the desire

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.040 align:middle line:84%
to pursue our freedoms,
to pursue our happiness.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.780 align:middle line:84%
So this gift that
our creator gives us

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.810 align:middle line:84%
is clarified by the Constitution
of the United States,

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.550 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that
the government only

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.350 align:middle line:84%
has power that the
states and the people

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.987 align:middle line:90%
there give the government.

00:04:19.987 --> 00:04:21.529 align:middle line:84%
Most countries around
the world don't

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:23.360 align:middle line:84%
stipulate those same
freedoms necessarily.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And many governments
around the world

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.190 align:middle line:84%
say that, essentially, the
people were given their rights

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.363 align:middle line:90%
by the kings.

00:04:30.363 --> 00:04:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And then when the kings left,
essentially, the governments

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:33.720 align:middle line:90%
took over.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And so, oftentimes,
it's the people

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.420 align:middle line:84%
having rights given to
them by the government.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.310 align:middle line:84%
But, no, sovereignty
is that your rights

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.018 align:middle line:84%
are endowed to you by
your creator, which

00:04:42.018 --> 00:04:43.140 align:middle line:90%
is from beyond this world.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.808 align:middle line:84%
And no one can take those,
violate those rights without--

00:04:46.808 --> 00:04:49.100 align:middle line:84%
essentially, they should not
have any right to do that.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.310 align:middle line:84%
If they do, there should be,
as the Declaration talked

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.740 align:middle line:84%
about, an insurrection, a
rebellion, a revolution, right?

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.865 align:middle line:84%
There has to be gathering
of people to say, no, you

00:04:56.865 --> 00:04:58.430 align:middle line:90%
don't have the right to take--

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.340 align:middle line:84%
you, government, don't have
the right to take this from me

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.570 align:middle line:90%
without some kind of agreement.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And so, I think that sovereignty
is an important point

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.900 align:middle line:84%
because we're at
this time period

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.500 align:middle line:84%
when sovereignty is also a
multidimensional experience

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.550 align:middle line:84%
of realizing who, that we are
these divine beings remembering

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.370 align:middle line:84%
our true nature, that we
are entering a new age where

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.540 align:middle line:84%
we are becoming more sensitive
to this multi-dimensional

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:23.340 align:middle line:90%
universe.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.020 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about aliens--

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.575 align:middle line:84%
from Coast-to-Coast
and all your work,

00:05:27.575 --> 00:05:28.700 align:middle line:90%
you know about this, right?

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.440 align:middle line:84%
All these dimensions
of experience,

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.370 align:middle line:84%
paranormal, supernatural that
we're awakening to this reality

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.680 align:middle line:84%
and realizing that we
are Galactic humans.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.570 align:middle line:84%
That we are not just here on
this Earth by an accident.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think people are
at a breaking point right now?

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: People are rightfully
upset because that's

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.580 align:middle line:84%
part of the awakening
process, I believe.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.730 align:middle line:84%
When you get woken up-- as you
know, if you want to sleep,

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.020 align:middle line:90%
it can be very jarring.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.790 align:middle line:90%
It can be aggravating.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.280 align:middle line:84%
But collectively, we are going
through this Pluto returns time

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.080 align:middle line:90%
period.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.320 align:middle line:84%
It's eight-year cycle
of Pluto returning.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.440 align:middle line:84%
It was 2016-- if I'm
correct, 2016 to 2024.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And the similitude is
basically to the time

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.050 align:middle line:84%
of the American Revolution
in terms of Pluto's return.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
is excavates it.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.590 align:middle line:84%
It brings up all
kinds of darkness.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.323 align:middle line:90%
It becomes more awareness of--

00:06:18.323 --> 00:06:20.490 align:middle line:84%
as I said before, people
are more aware of the World

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:21.290 align:middle line:90%
Economic Forum.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.760 align:middle line:84%
They're more aware of global
elites, and there's agendas,

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.450 align:middle line:84%
and they're seeing through
the facade, let's say,

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.400 align:middle line:90%
of government wanting to help.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.350 align:middle line:90%
There's an agenda here.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.535 align:middle line:90%
We don't trust you anymore.

00:06:32.535 --> 00:06:35.160 align:middle line:84%
So that's part of the awakening,
and there's also an anger that

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.060 align:middle line:90%
comes with it, right?

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.440 align:middle line:84%
People are saying,
save the children.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.857 align:middle line:84%
People are realizing
that there is

00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:40.450 align:middle line:90%
human trafficking in the world.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.110 align:middle line:84%
In America across the world
as well, but in America, too.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.735 align:middle line:84%
They're realizing
these things that are

00:06:44.735 --> 00:06:46.585 align:middle line:90%
going on that are very dark.

00:06:46.585 --> 00:06:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They never
believed it before.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:49.710 align:middle line:90%
They are believing it now?

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: It's not
just believing it.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.668 align:middle line:84%
It's truly a revelation
process, I would call it.

00:06:55.668 --> 00:06:57.210 align:middle line:84%
We are living through
the revelations

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.335 align:middle line:90%
of the Book of Revelations.

00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:01.557 align:middle line:84%
Because, as you know,
belief is so difficult.

00:07:01.557 --> 00:07:03.390 align:middle line:84%
Because I could say,
yeah, sure, I believe--

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.490 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's
possible or maybe.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.457 align:middle line:84%
But all of a sudden,
there's a revelation.

00:07:08.457 --> 00:07:09.540 align:middle line:90%
All of a sudden, you know.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.180 align:middle line:90%
You say, OK, I know now.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.770 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole new realization
that people are coming to you.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:15.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: And they're
realizing that why--

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.800 align:middle line:84%
they're starting to
really question, OK,

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.390 align:middle line:84%
why do we have, essentially,
these self-proclaimed rulers,

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:25.860 align:middle line:84%
these self-proclaimed
elite, right?

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.363 align:middle line:84%
The elite talking
amongst themselves

00:07:27.363 --> 00:07:28.530 align:middle line:90%
at the World Economic Forum.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.090 align:middle line:84%
They're calling
themselves the elite.

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:31.110 align:middle line:90%
We trust the elite.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.360 align:middle line:84%
We realize the elite
trust the elite more

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.430 align:middle line:84%
and the common person
doesn't trust the elite.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.020 align:middle line:84%
Who are you
self-proclaimed elite?

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.070 align:middle line:90%
What makes you elite?

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.210 align:middle line:90%
What gives you that right?

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Because you have
more money, right?

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.740 align:middle line:84%
Because you have more access to
politicians, and governments,

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:44.657 align:middle line:90%
and access to capital?

00:07:44.657 --> 00:07:45.823 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ordered and titled?

00:07:45.823 --> 00:07:46.800 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Yeah, exactly.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.330 align:middle line:90%
It's like the old aristocracy.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.973 align:middle line:84%
So just because you're
born as the son of a king,

00:07:50.973 --> 00:07:53.640 align:middle line:84%
that makes you a prince, and you
have the right to rule over me?

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.440 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.930 align:middle line:90%
We're waking up to that reality.

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And again, this gets us
to sovereignty to say,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:04.110 align:middle line:84%
I am actually a divine being
with the same rights, the same,

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:05.340 align:middle line:90%
essentially, quality.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, the problem is, many
people think equality

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.072 align:middle line:90%
is equality of outcome.

00:08:09.072 --> 00:08:11.280 align:middle line:84%
No, you and I are going to
have different experiences

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:11.820 align:middle line:90%
of our reality.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.590 align:middle line:84%
We're never going
to be equal, but we

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.510 align:middle line:90%
are equal in the eyes of God.

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.700 align:middle line:84%
We're equally expressions
of the Divine,

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.240 align:middle line:84%
and we're realizing
that equality.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.667 align:middle line:84%
And that's a
beautiful experience.

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:22.500 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening is
people are waking up,

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.697 align:middle line:84%
but there's confusion that
comes with that, right?

00:08:24.697 --> 00:08:25.530 align:middle line:90%
People are confused.

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:27.900 align:middle line:84%
Because they're saying, wow,
there has been this racism,

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:31.800 align:middle line:84%
and there has been sexism, and
there have been many problems.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:36.059 align:middle line:84%
And the key now is
to take that anger

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:38.370 align:middle line:84%
and to put it into a
way of love and not

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:40.140 align:middle line:90%
into a way of retribution.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.640 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you know what, you owe me.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.870 align:middle line:84%
No, we have to shift our
psychology from a owing

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:51.690 align:middle line:84%
because that creates a victim
mentality into a state of,

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:54.430 align:middle line:84%
how can we come into a better
way of being with each other?

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:57.637 align:middle line:84%
How can we become more conscious
in our relationships, right?

00:08:57.637 --> 00:08:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is
where we're moving

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.697 align:middle line:90%
towards-- more reciprocity.

00:09:00.697 --> 00:09:01.780 align:middle line:90%
I have something to offer.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:02.947 align:middle line:90%
You have something to offer.

00:09:02.947 --> 00:09:06.600 align:middle line:84%
How can we reciprocate with
my offering and your offering

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.168 align:middle line:84%
to share in this new
society that we're building?

00:09:09.168 --> 00:09:10.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On Gaia's
"Open Minds" show,

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:14.550 align:middle line:84%
Neil Kramer talks, much like
you do, about sovereignty

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.100 align:middle line:90%
and how to gauge it.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.610 align:middle line:10%
>>NEIL KRAMER: If you consider
yourself your own authority,

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:22.410 align:middle line:10%
lots of things fall into place.

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:26.130 align:middle line:10%
If you ever bow down to
authority, lots of things

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:27.390 align:middle line:10%
begin to drift.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:29.340 align:middle line:10%
A good test is
that if a policeman

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.500 align:middle line:10%
knocks on your door, what
do you-- how do you fee?

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.570 align:middle line:10%
Most people go, oh, God.

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:35.370 align:middle line:90%
Something's wrong.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:36.000 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.780 align:middle line:90%
Hello?

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:37.380 align:middle line:90%
Somebody dead?

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:38.180 align:middle line:90%
Have I done?

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:38.980 align:middle line:90%


00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: I don't.

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.390 align:middle line:84%
I feel quite
differently about that.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:43.560 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: I know you do.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.920 align:middle line:84%
If a policeman knocks on your
door, how do you feel, right?

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:47.940 align:middle line:90%
That's a good benchmark.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:48.857 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Indignant.

00:09:48.857 --> 00:09:50.670 align:middle line:84%
What are you doing
here on my property?

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:54.558 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So that is a
lovely test because prior

00:09:54.558 --> 00:09:56.850 align:middle line:84%
generations-- my parents',
and grandparents', and great

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:00.330 align:middle line:84%
grandparents' generation, those
authority figures who just did

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.200 align:middle line:90%
what you were told.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.610 align:middle line:84%
So this movement
of empire, let's

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:08.070 align:middle line:84%
just acknowledge for
a minute, that it's

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:11.400 align:middle line:84%
brought a great teaching to
us, which is hang on a second.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.650 align:middle line:84%
No, you don't do
what you're told.

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:14.940 align:middle line:90%
You shouldn't do that.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And just because
they've got a badge

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.590 align:middle line:84%
and a uniform doesn't
mean that you should

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:21.120 align:middle line:90%
do what you're told, right?

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.660 align:middle line:10%
Now, that, in England, is
unthinkable in the 1920s,

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.220 align:middle line:10%
and '30s, in '40s, in '50s.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.050 align:middle line:84%
You did what you were
told because there

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:32.070 align:middle line:84%
was the conception, which is
a misconception misconception.

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:34.418 align:middle line:84%
There was the idea that
the government is good.

00:10:34.418 --> 00:10:36.210 align:middle line:84%
They're voted in by
the people, and they're

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:37.510 align:middle line:90%
doing a very, very good job.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.135 align:middle line:84%
They're doing the
best they can in very

00:10:39.135 --> 00:10:40.480 align:middle line:90%
difficult circumstances.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.170 align:middle line:10%
We know now that
that's not true,

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:47.250 align:middle line:10%
and it has never been true
in all of ancient history,

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:49.650 align:middle line:10%
going back as far as
you can, 8,000 years.

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.690 align:middle line:10%
It gets well hazy prior to that.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:55.110 align:middle line:10%
So certainly, in the
last 2,000 years,

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.480 align:middle line:10%
where we have a decent
record of history in Britain,

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:02.460 align:middle line:10%
I can't see any examples of
wise, equitable management

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:05.460 align:middle line:10%
of people through a
freely elected government,

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.690 align:middle line:10%
not a single example of it.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, some of
those rules change.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:15.510 align:middle line:10%
So you do get conscious
excellent community

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:17.730 align:middle line:10%
policing to make sure that
when there's a problem,

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:18.600 align:middle line:10%
it's dealt with.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.360 align:middle line:84%
But they're not enforcing
things necessarily

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.322 align:middle line:84%
because the community
doesn't require it.

00:11:23.322 --> 00:11:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Based on
what you've said,

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.767 align:middle line:84%
I would tend that you
would agree with him.

00:11:26.767 --> 00:11:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Absolutely.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.600 align:middle line:84%
No, I mean, take the
police, for example.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:35.760 align:middle line:84%
When the George Floyd incident
occurred, immediately,

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.350 align:middle line:84%
what occurred to
me was not so much

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.990 align:middle line:84%
the racial issue because
the cop's involved.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.522 align:middle line:84%
If you saw, there
was a white cop.

00:11:41.522 --> 00:11:42.480 align:middle line:90%
There was an Asian cop.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.410 align:middle line:90%
There was a Black cop.

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:44.697 align:middle line:90%
There were multiple races.

00:11:44.697 --> 00:11:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of them
just standing around.

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.150 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: I saw it as authority.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And this is our issue as a
society is this relationship

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:55.140 align:middle line:84%
with authority and why
this authority figure

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:59.710 align:middle line:84%
has the right to, again,
tell me I don't have rights.

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:01.230 align:middle line:90%
I have to be detained.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:02.340 align:middle line:90%
I can be thrown in jail.

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.658 align:middle line:84%
Even if I'm not
guilty of anything,

00:12:04.658 --> 00:12:06.450 align:middle line:84%
if they simply-- if
they say, well, there's

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:07.590 align:middle line:90%
allegation or whatnot.

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:09.540 align:middle line:84%
But this fear of the
authority figure,

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.880 align:middle line:84%
this submissiveness
to the authority

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.770 align:middle line:84%
figure, why should the
authority figure not

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:15.510 align:middle line:90%
respect me the same way?

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:19.300 align:middle line:84%
If the cop wants respect, then
the cop should also respect me.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is why
I talk about reciprocity.

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Reciprocity starts with how
we are able to respect one

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:29.820 align:middle line:84%
another, no matter what your
background, your ethnicity,

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:31.950 align:middle line:90%
or religion, you name it.

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.567 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And most cops do that.

00:12:33.567 --> 00:12:34.650 align:middle line:90%
And most of those cops do.

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Oh, I have no issue.

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not saying
across the board it's police.

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:40.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm simply saying, this notion,
this power system of authority,

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:42.660 align:middle line:84%
and putting us, as
he was talking about,

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.180 align:middle line:84%
into this place of
submissiveness and fear,

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.820 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to a place
of, the authorities

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.530 align:middle line:84%
should come from a
place of respect.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And many times, I've
had that exactly.

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:52.860 align:middle line:84%
I've respected the
police officer.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.150 align:middle line:90%
I felt the same back.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.460 align:middle line:84%
But the point is
that with respect we

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.520 align:middle line:84%
have to have a reciprocal
relationship with everyone

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.490 align:middle line:84%
in our reality,
from the president,

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:07.050 align:middle line:84%
from the CEO of a company, all
the way down to the janitor.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.180 align:middle line:84%
Why can't we just
have that same respect

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:13.900 align:middle line:84%
for every being as
an expression of God?

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do humans become
so obsessed with controlling?

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Mind control, people
control, everything.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.612 align:middle line:90%
Why are we obsessed with these?

00:13:23.612 --> 00:13:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: So this is exactly--

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.903 align:middle line:84%
the "Best Kept Secret,"
you mentioned that series,

00:13:26.903 --> 00:13:29.290 align:middle line:84%
we get into this to
a certain extent.

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:33.350 align:middle line:84%
I believe the control comes
from the reptilian brain stem,

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:34.150 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And so, it's interesting how,
as you know, people like,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.080 align:middle line:90%
not just David Icke.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.330 align:middle line:90%
He got it from Zulu shamans.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Credo mutua, for example,
talked about this, the idea

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:48.070 align:middle line:84%
that there is this what you
could call reptilian beings

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:50.620 align:middle line:84%
from beyond this
dimension, that work

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.523 align:middle line:90%
through the guise of humans.

00:13:52.523 --> 00:13:53.690 align:middle line:90%
And this is across cultures.

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:55.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've talked to people
in the Islamic world who

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.183 align:middle line:84%
talk about the jinn,
and they describe

00:13:57.183 --> 00:14:00.730 align:middle line:84%
them also, oftentimes, as
serpent-like creatures,

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:02.440 align:middle line:90%
reptilian creatures.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.320 align:middle line:84%
So to say that whether
or not the reptilian is

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:09.400 align:middle line:84%
an actual multidimensional
being, appearing human,

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.960 align:middle line:84%
there's still an
interesting synonym

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.840 align:middle line:84%
that we all have the reptilian
brain stem in the evolution

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.190 align:middle line:90%
of the human being, right?

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:19.330 align:middle line:84%
As we have evolved
over time, we still

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.190 align:middle line:84%
have the reptilian
brain in us at our root.

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:23.830 align:middle line:84%
It's our primitive fight
or flight modality.

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And that part of us that is so
rooted in the four F's, as they

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:33.070 align:middle line:84%
say-- fornication, fear,
fighting, and fleeing--

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:37.000 align:middle line:84%
this aspect of us,
if you think about,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.530 align:middle line:84%
it's, perhaps, overactive
in many beings.

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Especially people
that have more power,

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:42.948 align:middle line:84%
they ultimately
are in more fear.

00:14:42.948 --> 00:14:44.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Machiavelli
talked about it, right?

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:45.910 align:middle line:90%
You have to rule with fear.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:47.890 align:middle line:84%
You have to make people fear
you because, otherwise, they're

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:48.580 align:middle line:90%
going to take from you.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.650 align:middle line:84%
If you have a lot, if you're
a Bill Gates or whatnot,

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:51.220 align:middle line:90%
you have a lot.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:52.750 align:middle line:84%
You have a lot more
to lose, right?

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:56.340 align:middle line:84%
So you want to control how
people interface with you.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And we all have that
at some level, right?

00:14:58.090 --> 00:14:59.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every one
of us has to deal

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:00.817 align:middle line:90%
with that in a relationship.

00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:02.080 align:middle line:90%
I want to control my partner.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.030 align:middle line:84%
We have to recognize
in ourselves

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:06.430 align:middle line:84%
that we have some fear
in us that we'll be left,

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:07.805 align:middle line:84%
that we will be
abandoned, right?

00:15:07.805 --> 00:15:09.055 align:middle line:90%
That it will be taken from us.

00:15:09.055 --> 00:15:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's an
insecurity, isn't it?

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: It can be
boiled down to that.

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:14.830 align:middle line:84%
But there is some
root in us that

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:18.278 align:middle line:84%
is a wound, that
essentially is this--

00:15:18.278 --> 00:15:20.320 align:middle line:84%
you could even say the
separation from the mother

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.190 align:middle line:90%
when we're born, right?

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:22.000 align:middle line:90%
We come out of the womb.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.040 align:middle line:84%
It's the same feeling
of separation from God,

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.390 align:middle line:90%
that we have this insecurity.

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.490 align:middle line:84%
We don't know exactly
who we are, why

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:28.820 align:middle line:90%
we're here, what we're doing.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And so, there is this
wound of insecurity.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Then, depending on
if you don't work

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:35.380 align:middle line:84%
with that, if we
don't work to heal it

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:40.270 align:middle line:84%
and to evolve into our higher
frontal, the neocortex,

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:41.560 align:middle line:90%
and the frontal lobes.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:45.080 align:middle line:84%
Meditation practices,
actually, helps activate those.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.710 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that, as
we evolve, consciously and

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:50.230 align:middle line:84%
maturity, we can
then approach life

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:53.620 align:middle line:84%
with more faith and more love
without the need for control.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:57.130 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that
most of our dark elite

00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:00.580 align:middle line:84%
are fixated on controlling
because they are,

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:03.460 align:middle line:84%
so you could say,
maybe insecure,

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:07.638 align:middle line:84%
but fundamentally, they're
in need of their food source.

00:16:07.638 --> 00:16:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they afraid?

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.097 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Well,
it's a food source.

00:16:10.097 --> 00:16:13.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, again, it's
interesting, these synonyms.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.060 align:middle line:84%
There's people talking
about reptilian beings that

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:17.230 align:middle line:90%
feed on humans.

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.210 align:middle line:84%
But even, literally,
as you know,

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:21.850 align:middle line:90%
there's a synonym, the metaphor.

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:27.550 align:middle line:84%
If you're a performance artist,
and you have a big audience,

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:28.637 align:middle line:90%
you feed on that energy.

00:16:28.637 --> 00:16:29.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:32.050 align:middle line:84%
I just had one in
Everett, Washington,

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:34.930 align:middle line:84%
where the place was
sold out, and there's

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:38.920 align:middle line:84%
nothing like that feeling
of applause, and laughter,

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.570 align:middle line:90%
and interactiveness, Sean.

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:41.870 align:middle line:90%
It's infectious.

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:42.670 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Yes.

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.590 align:middle line:90%
And so, it's across the board.

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:45.410 align:middle line:90%
It's a food source.

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:46.210 align:middle line:90%
What is McDonald's?

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:49.460 align:middle line:84%
It needs the food source of
all the customers coming in

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:50.650 align:middle line:90%
and feeding it, right?

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:53.650 align:middle line:84%
The point is that
there's this feeding

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:57.370 align:middle line:84%
system of the current
economy that, essentially,

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:59.770 align:middle line:84%
is looking to get the
lifeblood, the energy of people.

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And it wants and it needs
to maintain that, right?

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:05.650 align:middle line:84%
McDonald's has to
keep that market.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:08.342 align:middle line:84%
What if McDonald's lost a
billion customers next year?

00:17:08.342 --> 00:17:09.550 align:middle line:90%
They would probably collapse.

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:10.119 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're at the creek.

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:10.390 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Right?

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:11.470 align:middle line:90%
They'd probably collapse.

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:13.579 align:middle line:90%
So there's this feeding process.

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:17.140 align:middle line:84%
So there's an aspect,
as I said, of a mutual,

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.359 align:middle line:84%
I call it, the puppet
master and the puppet.

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:20.440 align:middle line:90%
They're entangled.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.030 align:middle line:84%
The puppet master
doesn't realize.

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:23.020 align:middle line:90%
He thinks, oh, I'm controlling.

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:23.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm the elite.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.579 align:middle line:90%
I'm controlling humanity.

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:30.410 align:middle line:84%
But no, actually, this is my
food source for my economy.

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And so, I think that there's a
real interesting question here

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:38.560 align:middle line:84%
of when we talk about
depopulation agenda, which

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:42.300 align:middle line:84%
people, like Gates and others,
are they essentially trying

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:45.840 align:middle line:84%
to control the
collapse of economies?

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.970 align:middle line:84%
Because companies like
McDonald's and others

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:49.240 align:middle line:90%
will also suffer.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.060 align:middle line:90%
So it's very interesting to me.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.340 align:middle line:84%
I think there is a real
debate within elite.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.125 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that the elite
are unanimous in, so far,

00:17:56.125 --> 00:17:57.750 align:middle line:84%
as they're saying,
we-- obviously, they

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:59.640 align:middle line:84%
want their food
source to be humanity.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.790 align:middle line:84%
But if humanity does
depopulate, what does that mean?

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean that they,
then, lose their economy?

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.170 align:middle line:90%
That they lose their customers?

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Or will they just be left
with a smaller population

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:12.733 align:middle line:84%
that, essentially,
these major corporations

00:18:12.733 --> 00:18:13.650 align:middle line:90%
will be in control of?

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Because as we saw during the
lockdowns, what happened was,

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.480 align:middle line:84%
many small businesses
were closed down,

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.890 align:middle line:84%
but the big ones continued
to expand, right?

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:21.690 align:middle line:90%
The Amazons.

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're right on
when you talk about control.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.980 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to
Neil Kramer again

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.570 align:middle line:90%
and look at what he has to say.

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:29.850 align:middle line:84%
You two seemed like you might
have talked on the phone

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:32.250 align:middle line:90%
because you're pretty similar.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:36.150 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: I went to my very
first 4th of July barbecue

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:39.510 align:middle line:10%
this year, and the people I was
with were excellent and lovely,

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:43.920 align:middle line:10%
and they were patriotic in
an intelligent, and broad,

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.270 align:middle line:10%
and human way.

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And they were like,
we like our community.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.630 align:middle line:90%
God bless America.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.400 align:middle line:90%
Let's have some sausages, right?

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:54.480 align:middle line:84%
During that time, I saw all
these flags out, of course.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.850 align:middle line:10%
And I know what the
people are thinking, which

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:58.360 align:middle line:10%
is, we like our way of life.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.510 align:middle line:84%
We do have certain
freedoms here that appear

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:02.280 align:middle line:90%
to be disappearing elsewhere.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.470 align:middle line:90%
We like the way we do things.

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And the principle
of what's happening

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:10.920 align:middle line:84%
in America in its pure
state is quite good.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.820 align:middle line:90%
And I would agree with that.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:16.050 align:middle line:10%
However, if they knew what
that flag actually represented,

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:19.410 align:middle line:10%
they would set it on fire
because the flag is not

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:21.330 align:middle line:10%
what they think
it is, and that's

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:23.400 align:middle line:10%
the great dilemma that we
talked about last time,

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.260 align:middle line:10%
the invisibility of empire.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:30.780 align:middle line:10%
To wave a stars and
stripes or a union flag

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:36.660 align:middle line:10%
is a very unusual thing to
do because it is emblazoned

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:40.830 align:middle line:10%
with these symbols
of subjecting oneself

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:43.080 align:middle line:10%
to control outside control.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.350 align:middle line:10%
And when you raise that
flag, you're not saying,

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:49.620 align:middle line:10%
I like my community
and my kindred spirits.

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.332 align:middle line:10%
You are giving your power away.

00:19:51.332 --> 00:19:52.290 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: Absolutely.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:54.840 align:middle line:10%
So sovereignty and
the reformation

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.660 align:middle line:10%
of political systems.

00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.500 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: Discuss.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.890 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, political systems.

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:06.000 align:middle line:10%
Again, my benchmark is when
I look at the body politic

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.220 align:middle line:10%
in England, in the
United Kingdom,

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:12.010 align:middle line:10%
in Britain, however you
want to describe it,

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:13.860 align:middle line:10%
I don't see any wisdom.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:17.790 align:middle line:10%
There was wisdom in the
'50s and '60s a little bit,

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:20.040 align:middle line:10%
from what I can
gather from history.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.230 align:middle line:10%
And my father assures
me that in the '70s,

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:25.710 align:middle line:10%
there were the last vestiges
of wisdom in politics.

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:30.090 align:middle line:10%
When I started to open my eyes
as a young man in the '80s,

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:31.740 align:middle line:10%
I saw no wisdom.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:32.700 align:middle line:10%
None at all.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.040 align:middle line:10%
So I can't understand
how you can

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.220 align:middle line:10%
have a system of people
with no wisdom determining

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:41.040 align:middle line:10%
the administration of
a country and the laws

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.160 align:middle line:10%
that govern that
behavior in that country.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.860 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make any sense to me.

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:51.580 align:middle line:84%
For that reason, I refuse to
give my consent to that system.

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:55.320 align:middle line:10%
So I refuse to give it
my philosophical energy,

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:59.940 align:middle line:10%
and I refuse to give it my
vote because the vote is

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:03.240 align:middle line:10%
the primary way of giving
consent to a system.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is he right, Sean?

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:05.520 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Yes.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:06.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.000 align:middle line:90%
If we're talking about--

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.667 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You hesitated
for a little bit.

00:21:08.667 --> 00:21:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Well, there are
interesting aspects to this.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.010 align:middle line:84%
So for me, for example,
in its principle,

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:17.707 align:middle line:84%
what America
represents-- and this

00:21:17.707 --> 00:21:19.790 align:middle line:84%
is what I think a lot of
people when we're talking

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:20.990 align:middle line:90%
about patriotism in America.

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:24.710 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit different
than some other countries.

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:26.330 align:middle line:90%
America, in its essence--

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:28.670 align:middle line:84%
remember, Declaration
and the Constitution--

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:33.530 align:middle line:84%
is meant to be a revolutionary
country against the empire,

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:34.520 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And basically asserting,
for the first time

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:41.990 align:middle line:84%
in the modern world, the innate
human rights of the individual

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:43.460 align:middle line:84%
that we are endowed
by our creator

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:45.230 align:middle line:84%
with these rights,
these God-given rights.

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It started
the right way.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:47.000 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Right.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.333 align:middle line:10%
And so, I think that's what
people still hold on to when

00:21:49.333 --> 00:21:50.660 align:middle line:10%
we're patriotic despite--

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.160 align:middle line:10%
and then what
happened is that there

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:56.540 align:middle line:10%
has been an explosion of
this federal government.

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.790 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge behemoth.

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:01.730 align:middle line:84%
It's indebted us,
we, the taxpayers,

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:02.810 align:middle line:90%
for 30 plus trillion.

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:04.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's almost
a joke at this point.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:06.830 align:middle line:84%
It's like, we know we're not
going to pay this, right?

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:09.205 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that this
federal government is massive.

00:22:09.205 --> 00:22:11.107 align:middle line:84%
It began with the
First World War.

00:22:11.107 --> 00:22:13.190 align:middle line:84%
Before the First World
War, the federal government

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:15.980 align:middle line:90%
was 6% of the American GDP.

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, now, it's grown
to what proportion.

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.470 align:middle line:84%
I can't even imagine because
it's a major contractor for--

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:23.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, it pays
major contracts

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:25.610 align:middle line:84%
to the military
industrial complex, to--

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:29.390 align:middle line:84%
you name it-- big pharma, to
the major medical industrial

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:32.725 align:middle line:84%
complex, the welfare state, all
these aspects, Social Security.

00:22:32.725 --> 00:22:34.850 align:middle line:84%
All these things are this
is huge amounts of money,

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:36.680 align:middle line:84%
and infrastructure,
and bureaucracies.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.050 align:middle line:84%
So you have a massive
federal government

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:42.170 align:middle line:84%
that wasn't necessarily the
intention in our Constitution.

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:44.090 align:middle line:84%
So when he talks
about voting, yeah, I

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:49.100 align:middle line:84%
agree there is a system that
is entrenched and is moving us

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:52.140 align:middle line:84%
into a direction of globalism,
as I wrote in my New World

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:52.940 align:middle line:90%
Order book.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
the empire modality,

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:57.740 align:middle line:84%
which is government at
a global level, which

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:00.097 align:middle line:84%
takes the power away from
us, the individuals, which

00:23:00.097 --> 00:23:02.180 align:middle line:84%
is what our Constitution
was supposed to be about.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:05.950 align:middle line:84%
The rights that we give the
federal government certain role

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:06.750 align:middle line:90%
to play.

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And then beyond
that, it's supposed

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.610 align:middle line:84%
to be reserved to the States
and the people therein.

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:13.787 align:middle line:84%
And that's
decentralization, right?

00:23:13.787 --> 00:23:16.370 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're talking about
in this time, decentralization

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:17.840 align:middle line:84%
of power, bringing
the power back home,

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.215 align:middle line:84%
bringing back to
the communities,

00:23:19.215 --> 00:23:21.050 align:middle line:84%
to the county level,
to the state level.

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:23.300 align:middle line:84%
That's more manageable
for us as individuals.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:27.410 align:middle line:84%
Once it gets to the level of the
UN, and the Hague, and the EU,

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:31.640 align:middle line:84%
and the various agreements and
accords that are governing us,

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.500 align:middle line:84%
and treaties that
are governing us,

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.020 align:middle line:84%
what say do we have anymore
as individuals, right?

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:40.620 align:middle line:84%
If the Paris Treaty forces us
to take on carbon emissions,

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:41.420 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:44.330 align:middle line:84%
As an individual, I have no
say in that anymore, right?

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:46.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's my point is that
we've taken power so far

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:47.840 align:middle line:90%
away from the individual.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.798 align:middle line:84%
That's taken the authority
away, and that's not

00:23:49.798 --> 00:23:51.933 align:middle line:84%
what I believe our American
Constitution was about

00:23:51.933 --> 00:23:53.100 align:middle line:90%
and our founders were about.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.955 align:middle line:84%
So I do have that
patriotism, and that's

00:23:54.955 --> 00:23:56.330 align:middle line:84%
a different
patriotism in America

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:58.400 align:middle line:84%
than it is for England,
which is grappling

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.550 align:middle line:84%
with an empire for hundreds
and hundreds of years.

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can the individual
control the power himself

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.185 align:middle line:90%
and do a good job?

00:24:07.185 --> 00:24:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: What do you
mean by the power?

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:11.655 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: By taking things
into their own hands.

00:24:11.655 --> 00:24:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Of course,
we do it every day.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.950 align:middle line:84%
I believe-- see, even with
economics, for example,

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:17.690 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we
make choices, right?

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:19.370 align:middle line:84%
We take the power into
our hands when we decide

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:20.453 align:middle line:90%
what to do with our money.

00:24:20.453 --> 00:24:22.380 align:middle line:84%
If I have my money, I
want to invest in you.

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:25.550 align:middle line:84%
I want to buy your product,
I'm investing in you, right?

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:26.690 align:middle line:90%
If I buy someone's product.

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:29.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then, again, you could
make the wrong decision, right?

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: But what's wrong?

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:31.405 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the point
of the question

00:24:31.405 --> 00:24:33.860 align:middle line:84%
is, of course, there's
a right and wrong.

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:35.490 align:middle line:84%
You can look at the
global perspective.

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:37.448 align:middle line:84%
You could say, there's
ecological consequences.

00:24:37.448 --> 00:24:40.460 align:middle line:84%
You could look at the
consequences for our health.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.440 align:middle line:84%
If I eat McDonald's, it's
probably not the best

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.550 align:middle line:90%
for my health, right?

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:45.948 align:middle line:84%
We do have, of course,
the opportunity,

00:24:45.948 --> 00:24:47.240 align:middle line:90%
but that's what freedom allows.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Freedom has to give us
the right to be wrong.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:53.080 align:middle line:84%
If we take away freedom,
then, of course,

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.830 align:middle line:84%
who's going to say
what's right and wrong?

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:55.340 align:middle line:90%
The state?

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Am I going to trust
the state to tell me

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.430 align:middle line:84%
this is what you going
to do for your body?

00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:59.990 align:middle line:90%
You must take these medications.

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.980 align:middle line:90%
You must eat this food.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:02.230 align:middle line:90%
You must listen to this music.

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:04.425 align:middle line:84%
You must listen to this
narrative and the news.

00:25:04.425 --> 00:25:05.300 align:middle line:90%
You must do this job.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do this, do that.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:10.100 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: I mean, no, that's
never going to work in humans.

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Humans are innate
desires for freedom.

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:14.360 align:middle line:84%
That's why every
empire falls because it

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:17.085 align:middle line:84%
can't withstand the pressure
of the human saying I'm

00:25:17.085 --> 00:25:17.885 align:middle line:90%
a free being.

00:25:17.885 --> 00:25:19.710 align:middle line:90%
You can't tell me what to do.

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:22.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't
control them all the time.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.850 align:middle line:84%
What is transhumanism
mean to you?

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:29.247 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: So transhumanism
is a fascinating subject.

00:25:29.247 --> 00:25:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And again, we get into it a
little bit in the "Best Kept

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:34.450 align:middle line:90%
Secret" docuseries.

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:40.700 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's basically a desire
to remake the human being.

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And there's different
facets to it.

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:45.910 align:middle line:84%
There is genetic
modification, at gene editing,

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:47.590 align:middle line:84%
things like this
using mRNA technology.

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a
physical alteration--

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.683 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: There's physical.

00:25:50.683 --> 00:25:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --and a mental change?

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Well, I
mean, for example,

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:59.410 align:middle line:84%
you take Elon Musk's Neuralink,
right, which is essentially

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:03.382 align:middle line:84%
connecting our brains to
be wireless in interfacing

00:26:03.382 --> 00:26:05.590 align:middle line:84%
with something, wirelessly,
with a computer wireless.

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:07.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hook us up
with wireless computers

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:07.730 align:middle line:90%
and satellites.

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Right.

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:08.860 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:10.700 align:middle line:90%
So there's many facets to it.

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.460 align:middle line:84%
But the idea, ultimately,
is redesigning

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:16.690 align:middle line:84%
the human, saying that humanity
has not reached its peak

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:18.610 align:middle line:90%
for optimal performance, right?

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Even though we've
evolved to the state,

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:25.070 align:middle line:84%
we can help it with
science, with technology.

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And so, again, transhumanism
is a huge discipline.

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
speak for all of it.

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.950 align:middle line:84%
My main concern with it
is when the technology

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:35.300 align:middle line:84%
begins to be integrated
into the human body.

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.430 align:middle line:90%
Now, there are, obviously--

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:37.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can that be good, too?

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:37.990 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Of course, it can.

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:39.032 align:middle line:90%
There are great examples.

00:26:39.032 --> 00:26:43.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
Olympians, the athletes

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.538 align:middle line:84%
who have lost limbs,
for example, Right

00:26:45.538 --> 00:26:46.580 align:middle line:90%
and they're being given--

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:47.622 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Prosthetic legs.

00:26:47.622 --> 00:26:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: --prosthetic
legs or arms.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you have an
ability to speak,

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:57.580 align:middle line:84%
it's wonderful to have the
potential for Neuralink.

00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:59.980 align:middle line:84%
My issue, though,
is, ultimately, I

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.900 align:middle line:90%
believe that we are--

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:04.870 align:middle line:84%
again, we are endowed
by a divine spirit.

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:07.360 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we have so much
more ability and capability

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:12.190 align:middle line:84%
within us if we trust
that we are made, really,

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:16.750 align:middle line:84%
in a beautiful organic and
evolved way with nature.

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:20.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm worried about taking us
too far away from nature.

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:22.600 align:middle line:84%
I think we already see
consequences of it.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Think about how being denatured
for children is affecting,

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:34.310 align:middle line:84%
let's say, their
minds, their emotions.

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:38.110 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's a huge issue
with suicide, youth suicide,

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:38.952 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:27:38.952 --> 00:27:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They just
came out with a report

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:45.160 align:middle line:84%
that kids, eight and above,
should be treated for anxiety.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.180 align:middle line:90%
That's crazy.

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:47.555 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: It's
happening en masse,

00:27:47.555 --> 00:27:50.180 align:middle line:84%
and I believe that we are being
taken too far from nature.

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:51.638 align:middle line:84%
It's already
happening, as we know,

00:27:51.638 --> 00:27:54.580 align:middle line:84%
with the video games, the amount
of television, and social media

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:55.622 align:middle line:90%
that we're engaging with.

00:27:55.622 --> 00:27:59.240 align:middle line:84%
But imagine, then, now
putting that into your body.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.970 align:middle line:84%
We don't understand
the consequences

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:03.340 align:middle line:90%
of what this will do to us.

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Because we've ultimately evolved
these bodies in conjunction

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.490 align:middle line:90%
with the natural world.

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:12.530 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very concerned about that
side of the transhuman agenda.

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
there is an agenda

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:16.540 align:middle line:90%
to control humanity better.

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Because if, again,
the psychology

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:21.280 align:middle line:84%
of many of these elite is
that the human being is

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:25.060 align:middle line:84%
just a biocomputer that,
essentially, the DNA

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:26.800 align:middle line:84%
is just a bunch of
on/off switches.

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.050 align:middle line:84%
So if we can just figure
out how to manipulate

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:32.560 align:middle line:84%
the on/off and ones and
zeros like in a computer,

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.530 align:middle line:84%
we can create a
more optimal being.

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:37.720 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very skeptical of that.

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm very skeptical of
the consequence of it

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:42.730 align:middle line:84%
and how much more
harm it will cause.

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:44.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
an upside here?

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:44.830 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Well, of course.

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:46.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, their upside,
they claim, of course,

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:48.260 align:middle line:90%
will be the designer baby.

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.830 align:middle line:84%
We'll get you the baby
that has the freer color.

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:52.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Free of
this, free of that.

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:53.920 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: It'll be larger.

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.020 align:middle line:84%
But again, you can't
be free of disease.

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:57.220 align:middle line:90%
We're in a natural world.

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:59.230 align:middle line:84%
There's germs, and
bacteria, and viruses.

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:00.520 align:middle line:84%
We've co-evolved with
them for a millenia.

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they'll
tell you they will.

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:03.438 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: But that's my point.

00:29:03.438 --> 00:29:04.990 align:middle line:84%
So they say that
there's an upside.

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:06.880 align:middle line:90%
And again, maybe there is.

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:10.720 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that the danger
is greater than the upside,

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.560 align:middle line:90%
just like with, again, AI.

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.540 align:middle line:90%
AI has upsides to it.

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:16.630 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, who
programs the AI?

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:19.030 align:middle line:84%
Because if you program
the AI in such a way,

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:22.730 align:middle line:84%
it can very easily turn
against humanity and say, look,

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:23.980 align:middle line:90%
we're a stupid species.

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:25.390 align:middle line:90%
We're irrational.

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:29.560 align:middle line:84%
For the sake of rationality,
remember, Hitler and others

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.150 align:middle line:90%
created huge genocides.

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:33.940 align:middle line:84%
If you follow the
logic, it's very easy

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:35.110 align:middle line:90%
to end up with genocide.

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:36.400 align:middle line:90%
Because humans are illogical.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.265 align:middle line:84%
We're irrational, but
that's our beauty.

00:29:38.265 --> 00:29:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our friend
William Henry

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:43.540 align:middle line:84%
was on "Open Minds,"
talking about the commodity

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:47.700 align:middle line:84%
texts in relationship to
what you're talking about.

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:49.770 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAM HENRY: Paul
clearly spells out

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:52.380 align:middle line:10%
this warning in the Book
of Ephisians to say,

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:55.050 align:middle line:10%
watch out for these
archons and these powers

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:58.140 align:middle line:10%
that come from other worlds.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:59.400 align:middle line:90%
They want our souls.

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.930 align:middle line:90%
And he has a remedy for it.

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:03.660 align:middle line:10%
He tells us that the way
we can protect ourselves

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:06.720 align:middle line:10%
is by augmenting
the body, by putting

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.850 align:middle line:10%
on what he calls the
crown of salvation,

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:10.590 align:middle line:10%
the breastplate
of righteousness,

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:12.720 align:middle line:10%
the belt of truth,
the sandals of peace,

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:13.930 align:middle line:10%
and the sword of faith.

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:15.600 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: Higher
attributes, virtues.

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:16.433 align:middle line:10%
>>HENRY: Absolutely.

00:30:16.433 --> 00:30:19.650 align:middle line:10%
Are they or are these
actual physical objects

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:21.360 align:middle line:10%
he's telling us to go acquire?

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.600 align:middle line:10%
My answer is, they're
psychospiritual attributes.

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.350 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: They're
psychospiritual, yeah.

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:27.225 align:middle line:10%
>>HENRY: These are
psychospiritual attributes

00:30:27.225 --> 00:30:28.740 align:middle line:10%
that are developed
from within us,

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:31.658 align:middle line:10%
that everybody can
activate from within.

00:30:31.658 --> 00:30:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And so, clearly, if
you're looking for them

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:35.820 align:middle line:84%
as exterior power
tools, it's going

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:37.110 align:middle line:90%
to take you down one path.

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:39.012 align:middle line:84%
But if you're looking
at it internally,

00:30:39.012 --> 00:30:40.720 align:middle line:84%
it's going to take
you down another path.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.803 align:middle line:84%
And clearly, we want to
go down the internal path.

00:30:42.803 --> 00:30:45.060 align:middle line:84%
We don't need this
technology in order

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:48.600 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do all the
things that our technology is

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.010 align:middle line:90%
making it so easy for us to do.

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:51.135 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Absolutely not.

00:30:51.135 --> 00:30:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And you say that this
heavenly realm written about,

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.100 align:middle line:84%
including the archons, is
also in the Nag Hammadi.

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes, absolutely.

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.850 align:middle line:84%
This is the basis for
all the Gnostic taxes.

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:02.610 align:middle line:84%
This New Kingdom of
heaven and this new Earth,

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:06.360 align:middle line:84%
as well as the emergence
of a perfect man, this

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.920 align:middle line:90%
is the term they keep using.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.278 align:middle line:10%
But when you-- as
I have done, have

00:31:10.278 --> 00:31:11.820 align:middle line:10%
gone through these
various traditions

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:14.760 align:middle line:10%
and tried to understand
what is the perfect human?

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, the word perfect
in this context

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:21.780 align:middle line:84%
means whole, wholly,
and complete.

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:23.430 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't mean
that we're going

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:26.640 align:middle line:84%
to augment ourselves through
some kind of Google technology

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:27.660 align:middle line:90%
and become perfect.

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:32.220 align:middle line:84%
Rather, it's a state within
us that everybody can acquire,

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:34.440 align:middle line:84%
this state of
wholeness and holiness.

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And every spiritual
tradition talks

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:40.200 align:middle line:84%
about the emergence of a
perfect human being who

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:42.180 align:middle line:90%
is not a flesh and blood being.

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:45.000 align:middle line:84%
They all agree
that the human body

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.850 align:middle line:90%
was designed for ascension.

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:50.760 align:middle line:84%
It was designed to be spun
into a vortex of energy that

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.673 align:middle line:84%
ultimately manifests as
five-colored rainbow light,

00:31:53.673 --> 00:31:54.840 align:middle line:90%
which they call the rainbow.

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: When
the time comes, when

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:58.240 align:middle line:84%
a person reached that point
in their own evolution.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:02.250 align:middle line:10%
But along the way, there have
been many gurus and avatars

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:05.610 align:middle line:10%
that have attained the
status to show as the way.

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:07.350 align:middle line:10%
And something I find
very interesting

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:11.730 align:middle line:10%
is that when you look into the
Dead Sea Scrolls, for example,

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:13.950 align:middle line:10%
they were clearly
part of this program

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:16.890 align:middle line:10%
that was trying to infuse
humanity with a-- call it

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:19.960 align:middle line:10%
a higher vibrational
being, a new way of living.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.700 align:middle line:84%
They believed that humans
could transform into angels,

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:27.330 align:middle line:84%
and that the angels had
come to Earth to show humans

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:29.910 align:middle line:84%
how to scale the
evolutionary ladder.

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And not through technology,
but psychospiritual means.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk about
technology, for a moment, Sean.

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:38.850 align:middle line:84%
I remember the days we
used to have pagers,

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:40.380 align:middle line:90%
probably before you were born.

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:41.550 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: No, we had pagers.

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:43.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And now, we've
all got smartphones.

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:45.420 align:middle line:90%
Now, we can go on the internet.

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:46.770 align:middle line:90%
Now, we can do research.

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:48.480 align:middle line:90%
Now, you can text people.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.750 align:middle line:84%
You can send pictures to
friends in Europe instantly.

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:53.882 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with that?

00:32:53.882 --> 00:32:55.590 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: I don't have
an issue with that.

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:57.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm not anti-technology.

00:32:57.930 --> 00:32:59.722 align:middle line:84%
I simply said, don't
put it into your body.

00:32:59.722 --> 00:33:01.513 align:middle line:84%
Be careful about putting
it into your body,

00:33:01.513 --> 00:33:02.580 align:middle line:90%
unless it's, of course--

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:04.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
cases of extreme,

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:07.150 align:middle line:84%
people that have, again, lost
limbs, have been damaged.

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:07.950 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:10.170 align:middle line:84%
But be careful about
putting it into your body.

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:11.868 align:middle line:84%
Because our cell phone
is emitting EMFs.

00:33:11.868 --> 00:33:13.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I remember
when I was a kid--

00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:14.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: They told
you, don't put the cell

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:16.590 align:middle line:90%
phone to your head, remember?

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And nowadays, it's like people
have forgotten about that.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.262 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not against technology.

00:33:21.262 --> 00:33:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And I understand that
humans are going to play.

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:24.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look, this
is what we do.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.807 align:middle line:90%
This is part of the freedom.

00:33:25.807 --> 00:33:27.870 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not here to tell
people, don't try it.

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Just be mindful of what
you put into your body.

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:32.070 align:middle line:90%
Be mindful of what you--

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:34.350 align:middle line:84%
because once you break
that blood-brain barrier,

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:36.340 align:middle line:84%
once you've embedded
in your body,

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:38.700 align:middle line:84%
it can be more permanent
or permanent, right?

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:41.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just like
a tattoo, right?

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.940 align:middle line:90%
Be careful.

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:43.330 align:middle line:90%
Be mindful of what you're doing.

00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:44.580 align:middle line:90%
But we are here to experiment.

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:45.600 align:middle line:90%
We are here to explore.

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:51.250 align:middle line:84%
That's an aspect of the
reason why we're here.

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:52.050 align:middle line:90%
It's to play.

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were able to
paint your ideal civilization,

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:59.040 align:middle line:84%
the vision of the
future, of a human being,

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.272 align:middle line:90%
what would that be?

00:34:00.272 --> 00:34:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Oh, wow, they would
look like those rainbow beings

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:03.660 align:middle line:90%
that he was talking about.

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:04.170 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the sense--

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:05.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He loves those things.

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:07.853 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: --the chakra was
activated, filling our energy.

00:34:07.853 --> 00:34:08.730 align:middle line:90%
Look, we're energy.

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:09.760 align:middle line:90%
We're energy beings.

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.389 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the more we
become attuned to the energy

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:18.510 align:middle line:84%
that we are, the more that we
can actually, at one level,

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:21.810 align:middle line:84%
be contained within ourselves
so that we're not always

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:25.260 align:middle line:84%
looking for external feeding,
going back to our conversation

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:29.130 align:middle line:84%
earlier, the feeding, the idea
of needing to feed upon others.

00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:29.940 align:middle line:90%
Give me your money.

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:30.898 align:middle line:90%
Give me your attention.

00:34:30.898 --> 00:34:32.370 align:middle line:90%
Give me your energy.

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:35.520 align:middle line:84%
If it's reciprocated, this
is the future, I believe.

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.929 align:middle line:84%
The future is
reciprocation of energy.

00:34:37.929 --> 00:34:41.340 align:middle line:84%
As I said, if I buy your
good, I'm an investor.

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:42.639 align:middle line:90%
We don't think of it that way.

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:44.790 align:middle line:84%
We think of it as,
I'm a customer.

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:46.840 align:middle line:84%
What if the future is,
no, I'm an investor.

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.862 align:middle line:84%
So I actually get to
be part of your company

00:34:48.862 --> 00:34:50.070 align:middle line:90%
because I'm investing in you.

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:52.170 align:middle line:84%
That's the way I want
us to be in the future.

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:55.170 align:middle line:84%
I want us to be really
attuned to where

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:56.880 align:middle line:90%
we're putting our energy.

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.350 align:middle line:90%
Because money is energy.

00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:00.863 align:middle line:84%
Who am I choosing
to commerce with?

00:35:00.863 --> 00:35:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Who am I choosing
to commune with?

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Who am I choosing to interact
with and create agreements

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:05.090 align:middle line:90%
with?

00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And as we become more
intentional aware,

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:09.270 align:middle line:84%
and we realize,
again, our own energy

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:11.010 align:middle line:84%
and who we share
our energy with,

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:14.340 align:middle line:84%
then I believe we end up
with a more loving society.

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Because we realize
that our power doesn't

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.570 align:middle line:90%
come from fear but from love.

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:22.177 align:middle line:84%
Because despite what Machiavelli
said, that if people fear you,

00:35:22.177 --> 00:35:23.010 align:middle line:90%
they won't hurt you.

00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:24.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, go look at
Harvey Weinstein.

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:25.650 align:middle line:90%
They feared him.

00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:27.330 align:middle line:84%
As soon as he got
weak, what do they do?

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:29.070 align:middle line:90%
They turned on him.

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:31.938 align:middle line:84%
There are people that were
previously friends or working

00:35:31.938 --> 00:35:33.480 align:middle line:84%
with him were happy
to throw him out.

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They all turned out.

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Because that's what
happens if they fear you.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.313 align:middle line:84%
When they love you,
they're going to show up

00:35:38.313 --> 00:35:39.420 align:middle line:90%
at your sick bed, right?

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:40.890 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
bring you flowers.

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:41.490 align:middle line:90%
They're going to--

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:42.698 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's human nature.

00:35:42.698 --> 00:35:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: That's why-- so love
is more powerful than fear.

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a positive
way out for us here?

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Of course.

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.250 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:52.560 align:middle line:84%
Look, I'm not here to
predict the earthquakes

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:55.780 align:middle line:84%
and how many people are going
to be affected or harmed

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:56.580 align:middle line:90%
in the process.

00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:58.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're here
at this time period

00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:01.590 align:middle line:90%
of massive transformation.

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:03.720 align:middle line:90%
This is the time of transition.

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.018 align:middle line:84%
But what kind of
humanity prevails?

00:36:06.018 --> 00:36:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, there's
going to humanities.

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, there'll be a
more roboticized humanity

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:12.810 align:middle line:84%
that will be transhuman,
that will be more, perhaps,

00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:15.990 align:middle line:84%
chipped, that will have
gene editing going in.

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:19.050 align:middle line:84%
They'll be ready to merge
themselves with their computer

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:20.740 align:middle line:90%
technology more quickly.

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And then, there'll be those
of us that are more, perhaps,

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:26.568 align:middle line:84%
organic, more attuned to
our energy and the energy

00:36:26.568 --> 00:36:28.110 align:middle line:84%
that we surround
ourselves with, that

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:29.235 align:middle line:90%
are more attuned to nature.

00:36:29.235 --> 00:36:33.990 align:middle line:84%
Because nature, Earth is
alive, and she's Gaia.

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:35.760 align:middle line:90%
She's a big part of the story.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:36.960 align:middle line:90%
Because she's waking up.

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She may be the story.

00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:38.820 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: She is the story.

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:39.630 align:middle line:90%
Well, she's not the only one.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Because don't forget,
we got the sun,

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:42.900 align:middle line:84%
and we've got the solar
system and the cosmos.

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:45.100 align:middle line:84%
But right now, yeah,
life is happening here.

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:48.602 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You should have
added astrologer to your bio.

00:36:48.602 --> 00:36:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: So this is
where it's at, right?

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:52.630 align:middle line:84%
This is the playground
of evolution.

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think conscious
evolution is taking us

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:57.870 align:middle line:84%
into a place, where,
who knows, we could

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:00.490 align:middle line:84%
be getting-- we could get more
telepathic in this coming time

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:01.290 align:middle line:90%
period.

00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:04.440 align:middle line:84%
We could find all
kinds of abilities

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:07.920 align:middle line:84%
that would have been considered
mystical or fantastic.

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:10.930 align:middle line:84%
We don't know where
we're going as a species.

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:14.820 align:middle line:84%
But I do urge people
be cautious of merging

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.380 align:middle line:90%
the technology with your being.

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Take time with it, but don't
make it your entire life.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.420 align:middle line:90%
Don't allow it to engross you.

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:23.350 align:middle line:84%
Because life is
happening all around us.

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:27.030 align:middle line:84%
It's in, again, the Earth
herself, her activation.

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:28.650 align:middle line:90%
When we go to touch the tree.

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:29.820 align:middle line:90%
We touch the ground.

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:30.900 align:middle line:90%
We walk on the mountain.

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:31.830 align:middle line:90%
We feel the energy.

00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:34.560 align:middle line:84%
We feel the power of the
sun activating us, right?

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.380 align:middle line:84%
This is where the evolution
is actually occurring.

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:40.260 align:middle line:84%
It's occurring at those
vibrational levels

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:41.100 align:middle line:90%
that are invisible.

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:43.290 align:middle line:84%
It's not just at the level
of what iPhone generation

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:44.090 align:middle line:90%
you're on.

00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Humankind,
since the ages,

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:50.760 align:middle line:84%
has expressed itself in the
form of artwork and things

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.250 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Can they depict things in
artwork to change the future?

00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:01.850 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: So this is a
really interesting question.

00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:03.710 align:middle line:90%
I believe that we are creators.

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:04.510 align:middle line:90%
And not just me.

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:05.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, many people
will say this.

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:06.700 align:middle line:90%
Humans are creators.

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:11.890 align:middle line:84%
So why is it so important
that the media plant seeds?

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:14.508 align:middle line:84%
Because if you are the Earth,
you and I are the Earth,

00:38:14.508 --> 00:38:16.300 align:middle line:84%
we are made of the same
stuff of the Earth.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:17.258 align:middle line:90%
What does the Earth do?

00:38:17.258 --> 00:38:19.900 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the seed plants in
the Earth, whe it watered,

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:20.860 align:middle line:90%
it grows.

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:23.260 align:middle line:84%
So when seeds are
planted in our mind,

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:27.720 align:middle line:84%
that grows and that manifests
in our reality, our shared

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:28.520 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.730 align:middle line:84%
So the mainstream
media, I believe,

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:35.750 align:middle line:84%
does plant things that we,
then, collectively manifest.

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:38.150 align:middle line:84%
As you become more conscious
of what we take in,

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:41.120 align:middle line:84%
the media we take in, the
stories that we take in,

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:43.940 align:middle line:84%
I believe we'll be able to
manifest better realities.

00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interested to get
your reaction to Ben Stewart

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:48.230 align:middle line:84%
from Gaia's "Open
Minds," who talked

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:51.500 align:middle line:84%
a little bit about
transhumanism as it relates

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:56.570 align:middle line:84%
to artificial intelligence, as
it relates to a new art form.

00:38:56.570 --> 00:38:59.440 align:middle line:10%
>>BEN STEWART: And so,
the artist, really--

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:02.320 align:middle line:10%
to me, here is why I'm actually
super hopeful about what's

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:06.880 align:middle line:10%
going on in the world is because
there's something about crisis.

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was John F.
Kennedy, who pointed out

00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:15.770 align:middle line:84%
the Chinese symbol for crisis
and opportunity are identical.

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:17.260 align:middle line:90%
So there's something about that.

00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:19.360 align:middle line:84%
There's an element,
these dueling dragons.

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.850 align:middle line:84%
Like, yes, there has
to be the challenge.

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:24.850 align:middle line:84%
There's the pressure on the
coal that creates the diamond.

00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And then, there's that thing
that emerges out of it.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And so, we love escaping
suffering and going for pain--

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:35.470 align:middle line:84%
or I'm sorry-- escaping
pain and suffering and going

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:36.673 align:middle line:90%
for pleasure.

00:39:36.673 --> 00:39:38.590 align:middle line:84%
There's something deeply
about the artist that

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:43.660 align:middle line:84%
takes suffering and pain
and draws forth the beauty

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:46.870 align:middle line:84%
from within it, and
represents it in a new way,

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:50.470 align:middle line:84%
and really shows there's
that sovereignty of choice

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:53.200 align:middle line:84%
and decision making,
which, at present, hasn't

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.460 align:middle line:90%
been eradicated.

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:57.850 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
linking our minds to computer

00:39:57.850 --> 00:39:59.170 align:middle line:90%
and cloud-based technology.

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, that can
become the singular mind.

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:04.030 align:middle line:84%
This is the whole
post-human idea.

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:05.860 align:middle line:90%
It's after transhumanism.

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:07.540 align:middle line:90%
It's having that singular mind.

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.405 align:middle line:90%
And where does the artist go?

00:40:09.405 --> 00:40:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of people
that are just saying, listen,

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:13.322 align:middle line:84%
this is where
technology always went.

00:40:13.322 --> 00:40:15.760 align:middle line:84%
Single-celled organisms
had to combine,

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.440 align:middle line:90%
so you can have your experience.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.840 align:middle line:84%
Let's make way for
the next thing.

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, I agree,
or I understand the logic,

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:26.920 align:middle line:84%
but where that strips
out the accountability

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:31.720 align:middle line:84%
is, where are you taking care
of you in the here and now?

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:34.732 align:middle line:84%
What is your soul telling you in
the here and now is important.

00:40:34.732 --> 00:40:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Are
you even listening?

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:37.065 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN STEWART: Right.

00:40:37.065 --> 00:40:39.430 align:middle line:84%
Because the hugest thing
about the transhuman thing

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:41.477 align:middle line:84%
is the removal of our
own accountability.

00:40:41.477 --> 00:40:42.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Exactly.

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:43.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN STEWART: And
that feels great.

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Overwriting
internal messages

00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:46.325 align:middle line:90%
with external messaging.

00:40:46.325 --> 00:40:47.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN STEWART: Right.

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And so, the very crucial
important task of the artist,

00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:53.620 align:middle line:90%
nowadays, are--

00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:55.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, especially
right now in history

00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:59.650 align:middle line:84%
is, at this important
juncture, to get back

00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:01.900 align:middle line:84%
to some of the primal
meeting places,

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:04.310 align:middle line:84%
where the artist would
always come out as well.

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:07.540 align:middle line:84%
So cultivate the environment
where the artist always

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:09.970 align:middle line:84%
seems to emerge, and
that's community.

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sean, with the "Best
Kept Secret," your documentary,

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:15.208 align:middle line:84%
one could say that
you are an artist.

00:41:15.208 --> 00:41:16.250 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: I would hope so.

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:16.840 align:middle line:90%
I've done a--

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.040 align:middle line:90%
I've written some books.

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:21.180 align:middle line:90%
I've done a couple of films.

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people get
to see this documentary?

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:27.190 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Right now, "Best Kept
Secret" is on Iconic and Vimeo

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:27.990 align:middle line:90%
on demand.

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:30.375 align:middle line:84%
The best place, honestly, for
all my work is my website.

00:41:30.375 --> 00:41:31.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is?

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:32.460 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: seanstone.info.

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:34.380 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: S-T-O-N-E.

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:35.670 align:middle line:10%
>>STONE: Still S-T-O-N-E.

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:36.930 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I love that name.

00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:38.700 align:middle line:10%
>>STONE: Thank you.

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your thoughts
on our future?

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:43.650 align:middle line:90%
What do you really think?

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Look at this world the way
it's happening right now.

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:49.220 align:middle line:90%
Is there really hope for us?

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Yes, because, as he
said, crisis and opportunity,

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:55.160 align:middle line:84%
it goes back to many of
the Indigenous traditions

00:41:55.160 --> 00:42:00.350 align:middle line:84%
that we manifest crises
for us to confront things

00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:02.620 align:middle line:90%
that we don't want to see.

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And going back to what
we were talking about,

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:09.070 align:middle line:84%
this awakening process,
realization of, wow,

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:10.030 align:middle line:90%
I thought I was free.

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:12.490 align:middle line:84%
But the government told me,
I can't open my business.

00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:14.080 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was
free, but I can't

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:16.830 align:middle line:84%
go to assemble because
the government said,

00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:17.630 align:middle line:90%
we're in a crisis.

00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:19.480 align:middle line:84%
So you see, all of a
sudden, your notions

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:22.238 align:middle line:84%
of what you thought was a
free country have morphed.

00:42:22.238 --> 00:42:23.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With the restrictions.

00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:24.330 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Right.

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:26.920 align:middle line:84%
So you start-- so now,
we have to confront,

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:28.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, across the
board, whether it's

00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:33.640 align:middle line:84%
certain woke agenda,
conservative agendas,

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:39.670 align:middle line:84%
we start to realize, what am
I about in this time period?

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:42.180 align:middle line:84%
This is the greatest
opportunity for every one of us

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:44.695 align:middle line:84%
to get more clear into
what we really stand for

00:42:44.695 --> 00:42:45.570 align:middle line:90%
and what we're about.

00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Are we just here
to be manipulated

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:49.140 align:middle line:90%
by someone else's story?

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:50.598 align:middle line:84%
Are we here to tell
our own stories

00:42:50.598 --> 00:42:52.050 align:middle line:90%
and to live our own stories?

00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Big point.

00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:54.460 align:middle line:90%
Big point.

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:57.135 align:middle line:84%
So you think there's a
hopeful way out of this?

00:42:57.135 --> 00:42:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: It's inevitable.

00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:02.280 align:middle line:84%
To me, this is the best
way of clarifying what's

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.260 align:middle line:90%
happened in the last few years.

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:06.690 align:middle line:84%
As a conspiracy guy,
I mean, you as well,

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:08.520 align:middle line:84%
we've, for decades,
have talked about this.

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:09.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We've seen it all.

00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:10.978 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: And at the
same time, it's like,

00:43:10.978 --> 00:43:12.640 align:middle line:84%
people are starting
to see it as well.

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:15.220 align:middle line:90%
So it's clarifying.

00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:17.830 align:middle line:90%
It clarifies, where do I stand?

00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, where do I
stand in the case of all

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.313 align:middle line:84%
these politics, all these
culture wars, all these things.

00:43:25.313 --> 00:43:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Like, where do I stand
as an individual?

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And in order to clarify it,
we have to be confronted.

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:32.080 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, when
you're confronted of,

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:33.280 align:middle line:90%
these are the stipulations.

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.570 align:middle line:84%
You have to take
this pharmaceutical

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:36.190 align:middle line:84%
if you want to keep
your job, right?

00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:36.990 align:middle line:90%
Things like this.

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:39.100 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, you
realize, wait a minute.

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:41.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I can
stand for that because I

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:42.400 align:middle line:90%
stand as a free being.

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.800 align:middle line:84%
So this is what's great
about these time periods.

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:47.290 align:middle line:84%
When you see more
overt expressions

00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:49.960 align:middle line:84%
of authority, censorship,
for example, telling you,

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:50.890 align:middle line:90%
you can't say this.

00:43:50.890 --> 00:43:52.360 align:middle line:90%
If you say that, your band.

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:53.320 align:middle line:90%
You're shadow banned.

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:55.190 align:middle line:90%
You're canceled.

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:56.540 align:middle line:90%
Wow, I stand for freedom.

00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And this is where people are
going to find themselves.

00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:01.310 align:middle line:10%
Do they stand for
freedom, like he

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:03.860 align:middle line:10%
said, which means you have
to take more responsibility,

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:07.040 align:middle line:10%
or do you say, no,
you decide for me.

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.810 align:middle line:90%
I agree with authoritarianism.

00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:11.900 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't bother me. as long as
I can just go about my business

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:14.430 align:middle line:84%
and not offend anyone
or not be offended.

00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:15.230 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:17.240 align:middle line:84%
Authoritarianism has
never worked for a reason.

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:17.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:18.670 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:21.170 align:middle line:84%
But some people will throw
in the towel, won't they?

00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:22.070 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Of course.

00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, people feel that
security is more important,

00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:27.717 align:middle line:84%
and they build
these massive walls

00:44:27.717 --> 00:44:30.050 align:middle line:84%
until they realize that they
are now imprisoned by them.

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:31.425 align:middle line:84%
There are people
that always want

00:44:31.425 --> 00:44:35.413 align:middle line:84%
to surrender self-responsibility
for the sake of security.

00:44:35.413 --> 00:44:36.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
there are others

00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:38.180 align:middle line:90%
who will fight to the end.

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:39.140 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: That's it.

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:40.730 align:middle line:90%
It's always this battle, right?

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:42.770 align:middle line:90%
Freedom and safety.

00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sean, many
successes for you.

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:45.720 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Thank you.

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:45.860 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:47.735 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:44:47.735 --> 00:44:48.890 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Thank you, George.

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:51.140 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The humankind,
it's good to know people

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:55.640 align:middle line:10%
like Sean Stone truly understand
the psyche of a human being.

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Because, eventually, it's
going to pay off for all of us

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:01.970 align:middle line:84%
when we look at the future
for our own families,

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:05.130 align:middle line:84%
for ourselves, and the
direction we're going.

00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:07.840 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:12.000 align:middle line:90%
