>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.910 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.951 align:middle line:10%
And you know, we call the
program "Beyond Belief"

00:00:29.951 --> 00:00:31.720 align:middle line:10%
because we deal with
subject matter that

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.820 align:middle line:10%
is truly beyond belief.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And our special guest
is Freddy Silva.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.830 align:middle line:84%
Freddy is an expert in
ancient civilizations

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.440 align:middle line:90%
and has studied these for years.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.130 align:middle line:84%
But how did you
start, Mr. Silva?

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY SILVA:
Boredom and curiosity.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.489 align:middle line:90%
Terrible combination, George.

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Boredom and curiosity.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.321 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Gets you into all kinds
of interesting little places

00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:53.272 align:middle line:90%
under big rocks.

00:00:53.272 --> 00:00:54.730 align:middle line:10%
And then you start
asking questions

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.230 align:middle line:10%
and you go, wait
a minute, that's

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.240 align:middle line:10%
not what I was told
when I was at school.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's not what I
believe when academia

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.470 align:middle line:90%
writes about ancient temples.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.269 align:middle line:84%
Something's not
quite right here.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:05.560 align:middle line:90%
And that's how it really began.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.770 align:middle line:90%
It was just--

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you went out
looking for your own answers.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.009 align:middle line:84%
Just pure curiosity, and then
reading interesting books that

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.050 align:middle line:84%
came your way, and then
realizing, wait a minute.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.495 align:middle line:84%
There's a different story
that's going on here.

00:01:16.495 --> 00:01:19.120 align:middle line:84%
These buildings were much older
than we've been led to believe.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.310 align:middle line:84%
The people that put them here
were a bit different from us.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.110 align:middle line:90%
So who were they?

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.640 align:middle line:90%
Where did they come from?

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.350 align:middle line:90%
What did they want with us?

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And from then on,
20 years later,

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm still talking about it.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How could science get
some of these things wrong?

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And what's the significance
of being wrong?

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Ah!

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, it really goes back
to about the Victorian era,

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.560 align:middle line:84%
that lovely time when church and
state were kind of going at it.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.964 align:middle line:84%
And the Church pretty
much was saying, well--

00:01:43.964 --> 00:01:45.880 align:middle line:84%
and they actually have
the conference on this,

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.830 align:middle line:84%
if you can possibly
believe this.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.640 align:middle line:90%
It is beyond belief, by the way.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And they were saying, well,
on which day in August 4004 BC

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.650 align:middle line:90%
was the earth created?

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.440 align:middle line:84%
So of course archaeologists,
which were just starting out

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.570 align:middle line:84%
at that era, began
to dig up things

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.910 align:middle line:84%
like dinosaur bones, which
of course were a bit older

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.149 align:middle line:90%
than 6,000 years.

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
problems really began.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.370 align:middle line:84%
They had to try and
force fit anything

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.680 align:middle line:84%
that they found within
a time scale that

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.100 align:middle line:84%
went from the creation
of the earth in 4000 BC

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.840 align:middle line:84%
to massive temples within 2000
BC and sudden civilization

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.850 align:middle line:90%
around 1000 BC.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.040 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
were so hamstrung.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
conservative area of work,

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.280 align:middle line:84%
so they had to slowly
backpedal from that,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.210 align:middle line:84%
and we're still kind of
working through that.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.440 align:middle line:84%
So when you saying a temple
is 3000 BC, like that's

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.320 align:middle line:84%
the usual date given to
Stonehenge, for example,

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.470 align:middle line:84%
the DNA analysis of some of
the postholes at Stonehenge

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.110 align:middle line:90%
are actually dating to 8000 BC.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.990 align:middle line:90%
Whoops.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.790 align:middle line:90%
So yes.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why a huge disparity?

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Because they're
trying to figure out

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.800 align:middle line:84%
how you can basically
assimilate this new idea,

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.950 align:middle line:84%
this new story into
the accepted paradigm.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.340 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't fit.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.710 align:middle line:84%
So now there's a lot
of independent people--

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.317 align:middle line:90%
such as myself, I hope--

00:03:02.317 --> 00:03:04.150 align:middle line:84%
who are trying to figure
out that yes, there

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.260 align:middle line:84%
was another civilization here a
long time ago before the slate

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.255 align:middle line:90%
was wiped clean.

00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the other
stories all around the world.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.755 align:middle line:84%
The more you
travel, the more you

00:03:12.755 --> 00:03:14.530 align:middle line:84%
talk to people and
their oral histories,

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.955 align:middle line:84%
the more they told
you, oh, there

00:03:15.955 --> 00:03:18.520 align:middle line:84%
was people here before us and
they'll die during the flood--

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.480 align:middle line:90%
not all of them.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.600 align:middle line:84%
But they left behind enough
of what we see today.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
find fascinating,

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.859 align:middle line:84%
is that we're now
building on the--

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.400 align:middle line:84%
literally on the
shoulders of giants,

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.127 align:middle line:84%
because they were
giants as well.

00:03:29.127 --> 00:03:30.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little
bit about the flood,

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.237 align:middle line:90%
the historical worldwide flood.

00:03:35.237 --> 00:03:36.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: The biggie.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the significance
of that with some of the things

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.392 align:middle line:90%
that have been left behind.

00:03:40.392 --> 00:03:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: What happened was, is
that then about 11,000 years

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.310 align:middle line:84%
ago, we were actually hit
with the disintegrating

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.200 align:middle line:90%
fragments of a large comet.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.840 align:middle line:84%
It happens very periodically,
and we have the evidence now

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.180 align:middle line:84%
to prove where the
fragments were.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And they seem to have hit pretty
much in areas of large oceans.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.660 align:middle line:84%
What happened was
that the trajectory

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.930 align:middle line:84%
of the actual fragments hit
the earth at such a point

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.180 align:middle line:84%
off the continental shelf
that it created plumes

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.440 align:middle line:90%
of water 5 kilometers high.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa!

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that this was
just the people's stories

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.780 align:middle line:84%
and exaggerations over
time, because there

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.510 align:middle line:84%
is a story in Tibet where
they actually say, oh, yes.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.510 align:middle line:84%
The waters from the flood
came right into the Himalayas.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.100 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty high up.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, I got hold of a
physicist, and they actually

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.650 align:middle line:84%
have been doing work at
Los Alamos doing trajectory

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:27.940 align:middle line:90%
of objects in water.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.450 align:middle line:90%
God knows why.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
actually, no, when

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.500 align:middle line:84%
you have the trajectory
at a certain velocity,

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.300 align:middle line:84%
let's say it's a mile-long
piece of rock that comes out

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.090 align:middle line:84%
of space, if it hits just
off the continental shelf

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.640 align:middle line:84%
in a deep trench
area, for example,

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.550 align:middle line:84%
and the impact would be such
that it will create a plume

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.470 align:middle line:90%
about 5 kilometers high.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.460 align:middle line:90%
That leaves a void.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.250 align:middle line:84%
When that plume comes
back down into the ocean,

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.377 align:middle line:90%
it creates a shock wave.

00:04:52.377 --> 00:04:54.085 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in the
middle of the ocean--

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:55.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a tsunami?

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, before the
tsunami, there's a big ripple.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.590 align:middle line:84%
So there's people in the
ocean at the time which

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.506 align:middle line:84%
have discovered in the
stories of New Zealand,

00:05:02.506 --> 00:05:04.360 align:middle line:84%
for example, there were
people in the ocean

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.680 align:middle line:84%
back then that said,
where did that come from?

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And they knew there
was a big wave coming.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.150 align:middle line:84%
So when the water finally
hits the landmass,

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.910 align:middle line:84%
it creates a tsunami
which is equal in height

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.004 align:middle line:84%
to the original plume,
which is 5 kilometers high.

00:05:19.004 --> 00:05:20.170 align:middle line:90%
I've just finished reading--

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's like
a mile high, right?

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It's 3 miles.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.384 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 3 miles high.

00:05:24.384 --> 00:05:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: 3 miles high.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could you imagine--

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.420 align:middle line:84%
you're on shore and you
see a 3-mile-high wave

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.386 align:middle line:90%
coming your way?

00:05:32.386 --> 00:05:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Hide the
pancakes, dear.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How far inland
would something like that go?

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It would be swept right
into the interior of Australia.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.870 align:middle line:90%
It would run into the Himalayas.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.260 align:middle line:84%
We have the eyewitness accounts
of Native American peoples

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.300 align:middle line:84%
saying that we're in the
Rockies and the waves

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.940 align:middle line:84%
are still coming through the
Rockies right into Oklahoma.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.534 align:middle line:90%
So I mean, I've read 140--

00:05:51.534 --> 00:05:52.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:53.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --of these
stories and I'm

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.408 align:middle line:84%
literally just
pieced them together

00:05:55.408 --> 00:05:57.370 align:middle line:90%
in a chapter in my new book.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And if you can survive
reading that chapter,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.301 align:middle line:90%
you're doing pretty well.

00:06:00.301 --> 00:06:02.766 align:middle line:84%
It's like a weight-reduction
program when you actually

00:06:02.766 --> 00:06:05.140 align:middle line:84%
see it through the eyes of
people who were actually there

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.970 align:middle line:90%
and survived.

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.060 align:middle line:90%
They said, yeah.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.550 align:middle line:84%
They looked like a black
cloud on the horizon.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.960 align:middle line:84%
It was only until
the last moment

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.640 align:middle line:84%
we realized it
wasn't a black cloud,

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.370 align:middle line:84%
it was black-laden
water with debris.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If that were to hit
us today, our US cities, what

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.970 align:middle line:90%
would happen to those cities?

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: This show would
come to a very quick end.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:24.670 align:middle line:90%
It would wipe everything out.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.336 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Buildings
would go, everything.

00:06:26.336 --> 00:06:27.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Everything.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
you start getting

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.280 align:middle line:84%
the stories of the
recovery period, which

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.050 align:middle line:90%
is what I find fascinating.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.390 align:middle line:84%
The people that suddenly
come onshore in the middle

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:37.060 align:middle line:84%
of nowhere, out of nowhere,
in groups of seven.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:40.370 align:middle line:84%
They were supposed to be
half human, half divine,

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.660 align:middle line:84%
a little taller than we are,
usually about 7, 8 feet.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.750 align:middle line:84%
White-skinned, which is a
bit weird in South America

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.480 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
look like that.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.390 align:middle line:84%
They had tunics that went all
the way down to the ground.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And they said that these
people were half human, half

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.460 align:middle line:84%
divine, they were
survivors of the cataclysm,

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.280 align:middle line:84%
and they had the
knowledge of the gods.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And they went around
the world rebuilding.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And I say this from
the Egyptian text.

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.790 align:middle line:84%
The idea was to rebuild the
former world of the gods.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And they had to find
specific locations

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.890 align:middle line:84%
on the face of the earth,
which they already knew

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.860 align:middle line:84%
quite well, to which
they were going to build

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.350 align:middle line:90%
the future historic temples.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.110 align:middle line:84%
This is actually written in
the temple of Edfu in Egypt.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.030 align:middle line:84%
There was a mandate
by a certain group

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.880 align:middle line:84%
of people who knew exactly
about how the earth works,

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.920 align:middle line:84%
how the laws of
physics work, and they

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.470 align:middle line:84%
were going to rebuild it and
try a structure of monuments

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.740 align:middle line:84%
across the face of the earth
for all kinds of reasons,

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.050 align:middle line:84%
into which they
would then create

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.730 align:middle line:90%
a whole new civilization.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment in
the history of humanity,

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.970 align:middle line:84%
suddenly we discover
agriculture, mathematics,

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:44.310 align:middle line:90%
astronomy--

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.692 align:middle line:84%
all the civilizing things
that make us who we are today,

00:07:46.692 --> 00:07:47.650 align:middle line:90%
in the blink of an eye.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A huge change.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:48.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:48.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:49.290 align:middle line:90%
All of a sudden.

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that weird, how
suddenly we all had

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.260 align:middle line:90%
this massive shamanic moment?

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:57.400 align:middle line:84%
Or was it true what the people
say and the survivors said?

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.850 align:middle line:84%
That we were told this by a
group of seven shining beings

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.612 align:middle line:90%
and one person that led them.

00:08:02.612 --> 00:08:03.820 align:middle line:90%
And this happens in Sumeria--

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.760 align:middle line:84%
or Mesopotamia-- Peru, in
North America, in New Zealand,

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.560 align:middle line:90%
in Easter Island.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.082 align:middle line:90%
It's all around the world.

00:08:10.082 --> 00:08:12.040 align:middle line:84%
So they couldn't have
been making this stuff up

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.590 align:middle line:84%
because apparently they had no
contact with each other back

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:15.391 align:middle line:90%
then.

00:08:15.391 --> 00:08:16.556 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something happened.

00:08:16.556 --> 00:08:18.040 align:middle line:84%
In your films, you
talk about some

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.990 align:middle line:84%
of these ancient sites and
some of the amazing things

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:21.790 align:middle line:90%
that go with it.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:23.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Ah.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>> When we dissect the work
of the temple builders,

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.010 align:middle line:84%
we begin to see how their
structures are a kind

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.976 align:middle line:90%
of universal reference library.

00:08:31.976 --> 00:08:35.254 align:middle line:84%
They encode the mathematics
of planetary movements,

00:08:35.254 --> 00:08:39.610 align:middle line:84%
the dimensions of the earth,
strategic angles manipulating

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.815 align:middle line:90%
energy, even sacred geometry.

00:08:41.815 --> 00:08:47.760 align:middle line:90%


00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.245 align:middle line:84%
Some temples enhance
the effects of sound.

00:08:51.245 --> 00:08:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Others encode their
own latitudinal

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:58.470 align:middle line:84%
and longitudinal
red coordinates.

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:02.330 align:middle line:84%
Surely if these were erected
to simply honor the gods,

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.275 align:middle line:84%
as orthodox history
tells us, then why

00:09:05.275 --> 00:09:10.588 align:middle line:84%
was such information
and precision necessary?

00:09:10.588 --> 00:09:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And why did they
choose to encode

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:16.570 align:middle line:84%
such knowledge using some of
the hardest rocks on Earth?

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Did they wish to
immortalize their genius?

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:24.020 align:middle line:90%
Or was there another purpose?

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Freddy, is
there an answer to that?

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:29.390 align:middle line:84%
What was the message behind
this, behind the structures?

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.480 align:middle line:90%
What was happening then?

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They basically
were trying to figure out--

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.580 align:middle line:84%
this is what I find
fascinating about everything.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:40.032 align:middle line:84%
They had a long-range
plan in mind.

00:09:40.032 --> 00:09:42.490 align:middle line:84%
They were very concerned about
the development of humanity.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:44.114 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you think
about it, you and I

00:09:44.114 --> 00:09:46.950 align:middle line:84%
have a life span of about
80 years if we're lucky.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:50.560 align:middle line:84%
They were projecting things
into 30,000-year increments,

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.530 align:middle line:84%
sometimes as much as
140,000-year increments.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:55.810 align:middle line:90%
What was their obsession?

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Why were they so obsessed
with trying to figure out

00:09:58.660 --> 00:09:59.980 align:middle line:90%
the longevity of things?

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:01.570 align:middle line:90%
And I think they realized--

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:03.220 align:middle line:84%
and this is more
than idle conjecture,

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:04.720 align:middle line:84%
because I hear about it
from indigenous people

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.830 align:middle line:90%
around the world--

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.510 align:middle line:84%
that they basically
recognized humanity

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:10.960 align:middle line:84%
as a continuation, a story
that keeps going and going

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.690 align:middle line:84%
and going, despite the
cataclysms that befall us,

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:16.240 align:middle line:84%
despite presidential elections
and all the other stuff

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.390 align:middle line:90%
we have to put up with.

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.840 align:middle line:84%
They recognized that
we are a continuum,

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.150 align:middle line:84%
and that continuum is to
do with the development

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:25.270 align:middle line:84%
of the human soul and
people as a species.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was to build
these monuments that

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:28.670 align:middle line:90%
would last into our lifetime.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that they
could see far enough--

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.100 align:middle line:84%
and again, this is
mentioned again and again,

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.900 align:middle line:84%
that the ancestors could
see far without traveling.

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.096 align:middle line:90%
They were almost psychic.

00:10:37.096 --> 00:10:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And they recognized
that we would

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:40.300 align:middle line:84%
come to a point in
our civilization

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.012 align:middle line:90%
today where we'd hit a dead end.

00:10:43.012 --> 00:10:44.220 align:middle line:90%
We wouldn't know where to go.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.160 align:middle line:90%
We'd get confused.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And they built these
places as a kind of what

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.462 align:middle line:90%
I call self-help centers.

00:10:49.462 --> 00:10:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
go to these sites,

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.634 align:middle line:84%
where there's a pyramid or a
Stonehenge or a stone circle,

00:10:53.634 --> 00:10:55.300 align:middle line:84%
they pretty much
behave in the same way.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.940 align:middle line:84%
There's energy there,
which is measurable.

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:01.120 align:middle line:84%
There are mathematical
encodings which are present,

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.200 align:middle line:90%
which extract--

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.720 align:middle line:84%
from which you can extract
the movements and measurements

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.610 align:middle line:90%
of the planets.

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.280 align:middle line:90%
You know, why is that important?

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.950 align:middle line:84%
The geometry of the
heavens, the way

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:12.670 align:middle line:84%
that the planets relate to
each other, anything that forms

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:15.380 align:middle line:90%
a foundation of civilization.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.900 align:middle line:84%
This is all hard-wired into
the stones and the dimensions

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:18.700 align:middle line:90%
of the temple.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.010 align:middle line:84%
So they reckoned that
no matter what happens,

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:24.610 align:middle line:84%
you know, humans might come and
go, but the temples will stay.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you're clever enough
and you're curious enough,

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.360 align:middle line:84%
and you look at
these things and you

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.780 align:middle line:84%
begin to extract
the information,

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.780 align:middle line:90%
that's how civilization evolves.

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.580 align:middle line:84%
So it was a long-range project
that they had in mind, right

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:35.380 align:middle line:90%
from the start.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Freddy, did they
put these structures where

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:40.380 align:middle line:90%
they are for specific reasons?

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:41.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, very much so.

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:43.810 align:middle line:84%
There's been plenty
of work that's

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:47.450 align:middle line:84%
been done in the last 20 years,
now that we have the technology

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:48.250 align:middle line:90%
to back this up.

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Because in the old
days, they used to say,

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.161 align:middle line:84%
well, I can feel
the energy, man.

00:11:52.161 --> 00:11:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And people used to laugh
at you and think you're

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.576 align:middle line:84%
just some kind of
a new-age nutso.

00:11:55.576 --> 00:11:57.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, now we can
measure the energy.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually been found
that, without exception, all

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.590 align:middle line:84%
the ancient temples
are where they

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.900 align:middle line:84%
are because the
laws of physics are

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.000 align:middle line:84%
a little bit different
at these sites.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.070 align:middle line:84%
Gravity behaves a
little bit differently.

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:11.330 align:middle line:84%
Electromagnetism is
drawn to these sites.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.937 align:middle line:84%
And when you hard-wire
them and literally

00:12:13.937 --> 00:12:15.520 align:middle line:84%
make sure that this
energy stays where

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.850 align:middle line:84%
it is, which is the
purpose of the temple,

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:20.980 align:middle line:84%
then anyone that comes within
the range of that temple

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.721 align:middle line:90%
is influenced by what's there.

00:12:22.721 --> 00:12:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did they
know how to do this?

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:25.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: That's the
big question, isn't it?

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.844 align:middle line:90%
Did they feel it first?

00:12:26.844 --> 00:12:29.260 align:middle line:84%
Were they so intuitive that
they could actually figure out

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:33.160 align:middle line:84%
that if you go 15 feet down the
road, you can actually connect

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.750 align:middle line:90%
with a finer level of reality?

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:35.575 align:middle line:90%
I think they were.

00:12:35.575 --> 00:12:37.105 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or were they told this?

00:12:37.105 --> 00:12:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Or were they told?

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:39.030 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:40.614 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You will
build here because--

00:12:40.614 --> 00:12:41.988 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: That's
the big question.

00:12:41.988 --> 00:12:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Was it from-- did it
come from somewhere else?

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Were we given the information
from somewhere else?

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.760 align:middle line:84%
There's usually the
association with Orion a lot

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.550 align:middle line:84%
in the stories of
these divine people.

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:54.760 align:middle line:84%
There's always this long thread
that connects into Orion.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.980 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a metaphor
or whether they physically

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.104 align:middle line:84%
came from there, that's
a matter of opinion.

00:12:59.104 --> 00:13:00.520 align:middle line:84%
But there's always
this connection

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.960 align:middle line:84%
that there's an other-worldly
element to these people.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.154 align:middle line:84%
They certainly were connected
to another level of reality,

00:13:06.154 --> 00:13:08.320 align:middle line:84%
whether they inherited it
or whether someone gave it

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:08.950 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:10.408 align:middle line:84%
The Native Americans
would probably

00:13:10.408 --> 00:13:13.690 align:middle line:84%
agree with the first part, which
they will say, yes, we keep

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:15.610 align:middle line:90%
communicating with star people.

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And these star people
often would give us

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.730 align:middle line:84%
the information that we'd
then apply in our daily lives.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:26.270 align:middle line:84%
So I think that the
story goes both ways.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:28.780 align:middle line:84%
I think we inherited it,
but we also discovered it

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.420 align:middle line:84%
from people who actually
had the full knowledge

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.350 align:middle line:84%
to understand that,
yes, if you step

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:36.040 align:middle line:84%
15 feet away from
this area, that bit

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.260 align:middle line:84%
there, if you stand
there, it's like you're

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:39.530 align:middle line:90%
being inside the big tube.

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:40.330 align:middle line:90%
And it is.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've had this
experience as well all the time,

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.370 align:middle line:84%
to the point where I
can now feel energy.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:46.780 align:middle line:90%
I can now see it.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.050 align:middle line:84%
From 20 years of doing this,
it becomes second nature.

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And I can just move
15 feet away somewhere

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.800 align:middle line:84%
and I go, well,
that's interesting.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dig here.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:55.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.150 align:middle line:84%
Or just stand here and you
get all these wonderful pieces

00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:59.290 align:middle line:90%
of information.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And then you go away
and research it,

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:02.451 align:middle line:84%
because I can't just
write about that

00:14:02.451 --> 00:14:05.020 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, I just
sat here and you know,

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.400 align:middle line:90%
I've downloaded the information.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And it appeals to
a certain audience,

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:10.710 align:middle line:84%
and it really is true,
but to do what I do,

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:12.720 align:middle line:84%
I want to back that up
with some hard facts.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I could stand
in the middle of, say,

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:17.550 align:middle line:90%
Sacsayhuamán in Peru--

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:20.170 align:middle line:84%
and I have done it, where I'm
talking to a group of people.

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And there's a video
of me that shows

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.600 align:middle line:84%
me looking a bit
sort of struggling,

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.877 align:middle line:90%
trying to talk to my group.

00:14:25.877 --> 00:14:27.960 align:middle line:84%
That's because at the
moment I'm hearing something

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.430 align:middle line:84%
in my left ear and the
temple is telling me,

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:31.620 align:middle line:90%
you want to look at this.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.370 align:middle line:90%
And I'm trying to remember--

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:35.712 align:middle line:84%
I hope I remember this when
I start talking to them.

00:14:35.712 --> 00:14:37.170 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm saying
to these people

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:38.211 align:middle line:90%
doesn't quite make sense.

00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:40.830 align:middle line:84%
I am having a real hard
time, and I haven't even

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:42.270 align:middle line:90%
touched a drink yet.

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:43.844 align:middle line:90%
And then I told them to go away.

00:14:43.844 --> 00:14:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And then I scribbled all the
information that I'm getting.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And then for the next
month, I'll research this

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.180 align:middle line:84%
and the information
is all there.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:51.390 align:middle line:84%
You've just got to
figure out where

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.473 align:middle line:90%
the information is hiding.

00:14:52.473 --> 00:14:53.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's absolutely true.

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.024 align:middle line:84%
And it makes writing
so much easier

00:14:56.024 --> 00:14:57.690 align:middle line:84%
when you've got someone
else feeding you

00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:58.523 align:middle line:90%
all the information.

00:14:58.523 --> 00:15:01.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Funny, when they
built these structures,

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.666 align:middle line:84%
did they go through
anything special doing that?

00:15:04.666 --> 00:15:06.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: In terms of an
initiation, you mean?

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The physical
structure of the structures.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is there-- do
you find a similarity

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.490 align:middle line:84%
in all these different
regions of the planet, where

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:18.420 align:middle line:84%
they build these sacred temples
and structures, but they did it

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:19.807 align:middle line:90%
with a special formula?

00:15:19.807 --> 00:15:20.640 align:middle line:90%
Was there a purpose?

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, they
were definitely

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:24.000 align:middle line:84%
borrowing from the same
formula, the same blueprint.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you go to,
for example, Peru--

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:27.980 align:middle line:90%
great example.

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:28.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.346 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Wonderful
megalithic structures

00:15:30.346 --> 00:15:31.890 align:middle line:90%
which no one can explain.

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:35.340 align:middle line:84%
You move to, let's see, 3,000
miles across the Pacific.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Tiny little piece of land
called Easter Island.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.950 align:middle line:10%
If there wasn't a tidal flow
going under the Pacific,

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:42.344 align:middle line:10%
you wouldn't even find it.

00:15:42.344 --> 00:15:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And you get off a boat, and
the same structures are there.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:45.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There they are.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:47.871 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, now we go to the
other islands of the Pacific,

00:15:47.871 --> 00:15:50.280 align:middle line:90%
places you never even heard of.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.980 align:middle line:84%
I've been reading accounts
from the 1800s of Europeans

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:54.920 align:middle line:84%
that land there and
they'll land on the shore

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.622 align:middle line:84%
and they'll go, wait a minute,
we just saw that in Peru.

00:15:57.622 --> 00:15:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And you keep going all
the way around the world

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.020 align:middle line:90%
and there's the same blueprint.

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Same big stones, same
fitting, same jigsaw patterns,

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:07.140 align:middle line:84%
stones that were
brought from sometimes

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:08.880 align:middle line:90%
as much as 400 miles away.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.330 align:middle line:84%
Same geometries, same
mathematic equations,

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.179 align:middle line:90%
same alignment to the stars.

00:16:13.179 --> 00:16:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And again, they talk-- there's
the stories and the myths that

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:16.830 align:middle line:90%
surround them.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:19.320 align:middle line:84%
People are a bit taller, they
are a bit more fair-skinned.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.280 align:middle line:84%
They call them the
shining people.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly you
realize, wait a minute,

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:24.810 align:middle line:84%
this was a global thing
that was going on.

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:27.660 align:middle line:84%
They are borrowing from exactly
the same blueprint, right down

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.180 align:middle line:84%
to the point where the
stones are into logs,

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.390 align:middle line:90%
using a certain sort of--

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:32.190 align:middle line:90%
what I call them--

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:35.400 align:middle line:84%
I-beam cuts, where if
you look at the stones,

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.047 align:middle line:84%
they have these things that
have been cut into the stone

00:16:38.047 --> 00:16:40.380 align:middle line:84%
and metal has been poured
into them like an alloy, which

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.060 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't have
existed back then,

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:43.970 align:middle line:84%
and it literally holds
the stones together

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.470 align:middle line:84%
and makes sure that they don't
move despite the earthquakes.

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing technologies.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And you'll find
them in Peru, and in Egypt,

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.390 align:middle line:90%
and in Korea, and in China--

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:52.260 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.970 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I think
they were borrowing

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:55.050 align:middle line:90%
from the same blueprint.

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:57.425 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It sounds like they
built things a little better

00:16:57.425 --> 00:16:58.290 align:middle line:90%
than they do today.

00:16:58.290 --> 00:16:59.831 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, god,
they've been trying

00:16:59.831 --> 00:17:01.830 align:middle line:84%
to build a chair that
doesn't wobble today.

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:02.830 align:middle line:90%
It's impossible.

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:03.120 align:middle line:90%
And yet--

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or an
earthquake-proof building.

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Exactly and that's why
I like going to Cuzco a lot,

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:09.480 align:middle line:84%
because you walk down
one particular street--

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.400 align:middle line:84%
and in fact, I use
this as a blueprint

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.319 align:middle line:90%
to show people on my tours.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:16.600 align:middle line:84%
You know, OK, let's
find out who built what.

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.369 align:middle line:84%
Here we have big
stones at the bottom.

00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:21.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes, incredibly large stones.

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:22.950 align:middle line:90%
One of them has 12 angles.

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:24.810 align:middle line:84%
As if four wasn't
difficult enough, let's

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:26.605 align:middle line:90%
put 12 in there to make it fun.

00:17:26.605 --> 00:17:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And then we will
round the corners off.

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:29.771 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll make
them a little bit

00:17:29.771 --> 00:17:31.590 align:middle line:90%
concave as well, just for fun.

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:33.332 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
another section on top

00:17:33.332 --> 00:17:35.790 align:middle line:84%
of that where the stones become
a little bit smaller, still

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:39.540 align:middle line:84%
big, but very meticulous
like machine cuts.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:40.860 align:middle line:90%
Very technological.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:41.880 align:middle line:90%
Impressive.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Almost like there's a
time span between the two.

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Baffling.

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:45.576 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Something happened.

00:17:45.576 --> 00:17:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And then you go
to the next level

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:49.450 align:middle line:84%
and I'll say, now, group,
what happened there?

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:50.681 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's terrible.

00:17:50.681 --> 00:17:52.680 align:middle line:84%
The stones are about--
well, they're manageable.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.794 align:middle line:84%
There's mortar now
that's involved.

00:17:54.794 --> 00:17:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got the stuff
that the Spanish put on top.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:59.130 align:middle line:84%
So when an earthquake
comes along,

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:01.470 align:middle line:84%
the top section of
the stones fall apart.

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:03.346 align:middle line:90%
The Inca stones fall apart.

00:18:03.346 --> 00:18:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And the stuff under it
is still exactly where

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.560 align:middle line:90%
it was 11,000 years ago.

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes a
blueprint of figuring out

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.760 align:middle line:90%
how old the temple is.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.290 align:middle line:84%
So the bigger the rock,
the older it gets.

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:14.260 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that weird?

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.810 align:middle line:84%
That's how we get
to the Roman era.

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:17.580 align:middle line:90%
It's all falling apart.

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:18.450 align:middle line:90%
Oh, dear.

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Back in
2012, NASA started

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.650 align:middle line:84%
doing some investigating
of the planet,

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:24.700 align:middle line:84%
and they found some
magnetic portals.

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, yeah.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here we are.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>> A favorite theme of science
fiction is the portal--

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.810 align:middle line:84%
an extraordinary
opening in space or time

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:37.070 align:middle line:84%
that connects travelers
to distant realms.

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:42.270 align:middle line:84%
A good portal is a shortcut, a
guide, a door into the unknown.

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.800 align:middle line:90%
If only they actually existed.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.180 align:middle line:90%
It turns out that they do--

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.290 align:middle line:90%
sort of.

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And a NASA-funded researcher
at the University of Iowa

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.870 align:middle line:84%
has figured out
how to find them.

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:56.430 align:middle line:10%
"We call them 'X-points,' or
electron diffusion regions,"

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:59.760 align:middle line:10%
explains plasma physicist
Jack Scudder of the University

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.580 align:middle line:10%
of Iowa.

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.010 align:middle line:84%
"They're places where the
magnetic field of Earth

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:06.800 align:middle line:84%
connects to the magnetic
field of the sun,

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.870 align:middle line:84%
creating an uninterrupted
path leading

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:10.990 align:middle line:84%
from our own planet to
the sun's atmosphere

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:13.930 align:middle line:90%
93 million miles away."

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Observations by NASA's
THEMIS spacecraft

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:18.760 align:middle line:84%
and Europe's Cluster
probes suggest

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.670 align:middle line:84%
that these magnetic portals
open and close dozens

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:24.090 align:middle line:90%
of times each day.

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:27.120 align:middle line:84%
They're typically located a few
tens of thousands of kilometers

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.760 align:middle line:84%
from Earth, where
the geomagnetic field

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.600 align:middle line:90%
meets the onrushing solar wind.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.630 align:middle line:10%
Most portals are
small and short-lived.

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:38.870 align:middle line:10%
Others are yawning,
vast, and sustained.

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:41.750 align:middle line:10%
Energetic particles can
flow through the openings,

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:43.700 align:middle line:10%
heating Earth's
upper atmosphere,

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:49.270 align:middle line:10%
sparking geomagnetic storms, and
igniting bright polar auroras.

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:50.900 align:middle line:84%
NASA is planning
a mission called

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:55.130 align:middle line:84%
MMS, short for Magnetospheric
Multiscale Mission,

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:59.180 align:middle line:84%
due to launch in 2014
to study the phenomenon.

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:01.520 align:middle line:10%
Bristling with energetic
particle detectors

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.850 align:middle line:10%
and magnetic sensors, the
four spacecraft of MMS

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:06.890 align:middle line:10%
will spread out in
Earth's magnetosphere

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:10.400 align:middle line:10%
and surround the portals
to observe how they work.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:14.180 align:middle line:90%
Just one problem-- finding them.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:18.740 align:middle line:84%
Magnetic portals are invisible,
unstable, and elusive.

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.140 align:middle line:84%
They open and close
without warning,

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:24.740 align:middle line:84%
"and there are no signposts to
guide us in," notes Scudder.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:29.250 align:middle line:84%
Actually, there are signposts
and Scudder has found them.

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Portals form via the process
of magnetic reconnection.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:36.800 align:middle line:84%
Mingling lines of magnetic
force from the sun and Earth

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.880 align:middle line:84%
criss-cross and join
to create the openings.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.970 align:middle line:84%
X-points are where the
criss-cross takes place.

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:44.770 align:middle line:84%
The sudden joining
of magnetic fields

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:47.920 align:middle line:84%
can propel jets of charged
particles from the X-point,

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:51.250 align:middle line:84%
creating an electron
diffusion region.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.290 align:middle line:84%
To learn how to
pinpoint these events

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:56.110 align:middle line:84%
Scudder looked at data from a
space probe that orbited Earth

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:58.500 align:middle line:90%
more than 10 years ago.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:01.470 align:middle line:84%
"In the late 1990s,
NASA's Polar spacecraft

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:03.300 align:middle line:84%
spent years in Earth's
magnetosphere,"

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.300 align:middle line:84%
explains Scudder, "and it
encountered many X-points

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:08.200 align:middle line:90%
during its mission."

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Because Polar carried sensors
similar to those of MMS,

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Scudder decided to see how
an X-point looked to Polar.

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:19.410 align:middle line:10%
"Using Polar data, we have
found five simple combinations

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:22.470 align:middle line:10%
of magnetic field and energetic
particle measurements that

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:24.690 align:middle line:10%
tell us when we've
come across an X-point

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:27.390 align:middle line:10%
or an electron diffusion region.

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:30.060 align:middle line:84%
A single spacecraft,
properly instrumented,

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:32.650 align:middle line:90%
can make these measurements."

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:36.010 align:middle line:84%
This means that a single member
of the MMS constellation,

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:39.130 align:middle line:84%
using the diagnostics, can
find a portal and alert

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:41.660 align:middle line:84%
other members of
the constellation.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:43.880 align:middle line:84%
Mission planners
long thought that MMS

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.400 align:middle line:84%
might have to spend a year
or so learning to find

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.980 align:middle line:84%
portals before it
could study them.

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:51.430 align:middle line:10%
Scudder's work
shortcuts the process,

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:54.810 align:middle line:10%
allowing MMS to get
to work without delay.

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:58.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a shortcut worthy of the
best portals of fiction, only

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:00.630 align:middle line:90%
this time the portals are real.

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:04.601 align:middle line:84%
And with the new signposts,
we know how to find them.

00:22:04.601 --> 00:22:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that satellite
is up and doing its thing now,

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:07.930 align:middle line:90%
isn't it, Freddy?

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:08.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:10.170 align:middle line:84%
I nearly dropped my
pint of beer when

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:14.660 align:middle line:84%
I read the PR report on this
that talked about portals.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:15.910 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, wait a minute.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:18.160 align:middle line:84%
I've heard about this
before because the Indians

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.042 align:middle line:90%
wrote about this in 8000 BC.

00:22:20.042 --> 00:22:21.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Without a satellite.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Without a satellite.

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:25.540 align:middle line:84%
I've actually described
them as the serpents that

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:28.630 align:middle line:84%
move along the ground which
are mirrored in the sky, which

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:29.910 align:middle line:90%
are the arrows of sorcerers.

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:33.504 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, if you know
the symbology of how they write

00:22:33.504 --> 00:22:35.920 align:middle line:84%
it, it becomes very obvious
because the serpent was always

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.920 align:middle line:84%
the energy of the earth,
electromagnetic energy, which

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.120 align:middle line:90%
is mirrored in the sky.

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So whatever happens
on the earth,

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:43.710 align:middle line:84%
these portals and these
pathways of energy

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:45.130 align:middle line:90%
are mirrored in the heavens.

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:47.216 align:middle line:84%
The arrows of sorcerers
relates to the people

00:22:47.216 --> 00:22:49.590 align:middle line:84%
who work with this energy and
were able to manipulate it.

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:52.360 align:middle line:84%
A sorcerer is someone who works
with the source, the source

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.910 align:middle line:84%
of energy, and you can
direct it like an arrow

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:56.500 align:middle line:90%
to where you want it to go.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And the locations where they
said that these events take

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:01.300 align:middle line:90%
place are in the temples.

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:06.070 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you go to the Hopi
or the Persians or anywhere

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:08.230 align:middle line:84%
around the world, they
talk about the temples

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:10.640 align:middle line:84%
as being connected
to a reed of heaven.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
they just found it.

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These people of
the indigenous time period,

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:23.800 align:middle line:84%
where did they get the knowledge
that we're finding out today?

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you just illustrated
that they knew things

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:30.280 align:middle line:84%
that we are just finding
out with multimillion-dollar

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.360 align:middle line:90%
satellites.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.742 align:middle line:84%
How in God's name did
they know it then?

00:23:33.742 --> 00:23:35.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I think this-- it
goes back to the question,

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:38.769 align:middle line:84%
did we inherit this from someone
who already had the technology

00:23:38.769 --> 00:23:40.560 align:middle line:84%
and kind of somehow
ended up here on Earth.

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:41.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Passed it down?

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:43.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: That's one possibility.

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And the Hopi, again, talk about
the star people quite a lot.

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:47.936 align:middle line:84%
But then there's
another group of people

00:23:47.936 --> 00:23:51.510 align:middle line:84%
that also talk about how
these special human beings who

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:54.130 align:middle line:84%
are, again, a bit
taller, fair-skinned,

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:56.200 align:middle line:84%
sometimes with
blonde or red hair

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.600 align:middle line:84%
and blue eyes and green
eyes, which appear everywhere

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.840 align:middle line:84%
around the world in places
where they shouldn't be.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.400 align:middle line:84%
They said that they
had the ability

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.650 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with
these sorts of things.

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:06.910 align:middle line:90%
They understood nature.

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:08.980 align:middle line:84%
They could manipulate
nature at will,

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:10.690 align:middle line:84%
and they had the
ability to see and use

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:15.190 align:middle line:84%
their God-given ability, like
a lot of psychics have today.

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:18.370 align:middle line:84%
You can project your
aura, if you like,

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:20.050 align:middle line:84%
and actually expand
your consciousness

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:22.730 align:middle line:84%
to actually see the stuff
the satellites now do.

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:24.700 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very cheap
way to doing it.

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.830 align:middle line:84%
We called it "remote
viewing" now.

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:29.190 align:middle line:84%
So I think that both
parts of the story

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:30.769 align:middle line:90%
actually are equally as valid.

00:24:30.769 --> 00:24:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
think the civilizations

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:36.370 align:middle line:84%
of the time, Freddy,
reacted to these structures?

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:38.080 align:middle line:90%
It's a Saturday night.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:38.950 align:middle line:90%
What do they do?

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:40.820 align:middle line:90%
Do they all just crowd in there?

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And then if they
do, what happens?

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, they
used to go into--

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:47.480 align:middle line:84%
they used to use their
temples for different reasons,

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.870 align:middle line:84%
sometimes for just
initiation for having

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:51.064 align:middle line:90%
an out-of-body experience.

00:24:51.064 --> 00:24:53.230 align:middle line:84%
They felt they had an induced
near-death experience.

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:54.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, they
didn't have a television,

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.570 align:middle line:90%
they didn't have radio.

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: They didn't need it.

00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:57.355 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They had this.

00:24:57.355 --> 00:24:58.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: This was so
much more interesting.

00:24:58.810 --> 00:24:59.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:24:59.260 --> 00:24:59.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And they basically
used it to-- well,

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:04.540 align:middle line:84%
literally just to better
themselves, and to also figure

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:05.720 align:middle line:90%
out how things work.

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Because, I mean, we're
stuck in a physical body.

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.420 align:middle line:84%
We're souls trapped in
this limited environment.

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.753 align:middle line:84%
Then they reckoned, well,
there's got to be more to this

00:25:12.753 --> 00:25:14.140 align:middle line:90%
than meets the eye.

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:15.370 align:middle line:90%
What else is out there?

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:17.039 align:middle line:84%
And they're able to
just disappear, go

00:25:17.039 --> 00:25:18.955 align:middle line:84%
into another world, and
come back and apply it

00:25:18.955 --> 00:25:20.330 align:middle line:90%
in their daily lives.

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, by the time
we get to about 11,000 BC,

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.480 align:middle line:84%
we also have the
stories of people

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.900 align:middle line:84%
who had to use this
information to such a degree,

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.240 align:middle line:84%
they could manipulate
energy to such a degree,

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.160 align:middle line:84%
that they began to use
it against themselves.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.570 align:middle line:84%
We talk about the Indian
Vedas, for example.

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:38.050 align:middle line:84%
They talk about the
times of the gods

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:41.242 align:middle line:84%
during the wars of the gods, and
how they had the Vimana craft

00:25:41.242 --> 00:25:42.700 align:middle line:84%
and they used to
attack each other.

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:44.780 align:middle line:84%
They can get from A to B
in the blink of an eye--

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:46.360 align:middle line:90%
these flying boats--

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.350 align:middle line:90%
and attack each other.

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:49.225 align:middle line:84%
And they basically
destroyed themselves.

00:25:49.225 --> 00:25:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Kind of about the same time that
a meteorite finished everybody

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:52.756 align:middle line:90%
else off.

00:25:52.756 --> 00:25:54.380 align:middle line:84%
So I think there is
some truth to that.

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:57.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if these people were
supposed to be so uncivilized,

00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:00.715 align:middle line:84%
how did they come up with
such wonderful fiction?

00:26:00.715 --> 00:26:01.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it's fiction.

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.220 align:middle line:84%
I think these
accounts actually--

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These
are the real deal.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --are
eyewitness accounts.

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:05.466 align:middle line:90%
They're too beautiful.

00:26:05.466 --> 00:26:07.180 align:middle line:90%
They're too well-drawn out.

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:10.450 align:middle line:84%
With, you know,
multiple personalities,

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:12.310 align:middle line:84%
beautiful visions
and descriptions.

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:13.780 align:middle line:90%
They're too well-designed.

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Almost like an engineer
will describe something

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:18.790 align:middle line:90%
to be the work of savages.

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:21.480 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm so uncomfortable
with the academic version

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.230 align:middle line:84%
of what was happening
here in pre-history.

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:25.369 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
annihilate each other?

00:26:25.369 --> 00:26:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, undoubtedly.

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:28.440 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of
problems going on.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.850 align:middle line:84%
The Indian articles
mention this a lot.

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:34.210 align:middle line:84%
They basically got
to the point where

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:38.230 align:middle line:84%
they could manipulate gravity,
they could bend nature at will,

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:39.260 align:middle line:90%
and it gets to you.

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:40.060 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:41.476 align:middle line:84%
Once you have that
kind of power--

00:26:41.476 --> 00:26:43.259 align:middle line:84%
kind of like being
in government--

00:26:43.259 --> 00:26:44.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They
harnessed it, probably.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:45.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --you begin
to actually have

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:48.020 align:middle line:84%
a few problems where,
you know, my aircraft is

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:48.820 align:middle line:90%
bigger than yours.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:49.620 align:middle line:90%
Oh no, it's not.

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:50.510 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now you
don't have aircraft.

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:52.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: You don't
have your aircraft.

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:53.611 align:middle line:90%
What are you going to do?

00:26:53.611 --> 00:26:56.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go back to the
boat and I may have a submarine.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And they basically used
it against themselves.

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And there are places around
the world which clearly

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:04.600 align:middle line:84%
show the signs of what looked
like, for lack of a better

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.620 align:middle line:90%
word, atomic warfare.

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:08.170 align:middle line:84%
It's actually in
the geologic record

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:11.320 align:middle line:84%
where are things done to
the rocks, a certain glaze

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.680 align:middle line:84%
and a certain radioactivity
to rocks which, A, should not

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.910 align:middle line:90%
be radioactive.

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And the glaze, which can only
come from two places-- well,

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.270 align:middle line:90%
three places--

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:20.660 align:middle line:90%
volcanic activity.

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And these places were
nowhere near volcanoes.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Or solar outbursts,
which Robert Schoch

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:26.450 align:middle line:90%
has done quite convincingly.

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Possible.

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:28.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Quite possible.

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And also the possibility
that there was also

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.080 align:middle line:84%
atomic warfare
going on, which is

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.757 align:middle line:84%
what the Indian Vedas
and all of their stories

00:27:34.757 --> 00:27:35.840 align:middle line:90%
talk about quite strongly.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which Robert
Oppenheimer used as a example

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:41.542 align:middle line:90%
to build our atomic bomb.

00:27:41.542 --> 00:27:42.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Strange irony.

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He knew that something
had happened that seemed like

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.630 align:middle line:90%
some kind of atomic weapon--

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:48.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --way back when.

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
ancient people said,

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:54.890 align:middle line:90%
nothing is linear in life.

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:56.170 align:middle line:90%
It's all in circles.

00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:57.970 align:middle line:90%
It all goes round in circles.

00:27:57.970 --> 00:27:58.974 align:middle line:90%
We've been here before.

00:27:58.974 --> 00:28:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of ironic that
we're now talking about this.

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:03.850 align:middle line:84%
11,000 years ago, we'd be
having this same conversation

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:06.130 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of a field
about the very same stuff,

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:08.260 align:middle line:84%
and talking about people
that came before them.

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:11.100 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know,
in 11,800, there's

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.712 align:middle line:84%
also another big
meteorite strike

00:28:12.712 --> 00:28:14.170 align:middle line:84%
that hit the earth
that annihilated

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:15.580 align:middle line:90%
another civilization.

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:18.740 align:middle line:84%
It starts off the glacial
period called the Younger Dryas

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:20.720 align:middle line:84%
that we now get to
hear so much about.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.930 align:middle line:84%
This sort of inter-glacial
period where civilization

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:26.180 align:middle line:84%
had survived three
cataclysms and is now

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:28.010 align:middle line:90%
on its final descent.

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:30.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, what they called
the third and final submersion

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:34.400 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantis and Mu, which,
by the way, Mu and Lemuria,

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.480 align:middle line:84%
they still talk about in
South America up in the Andes.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.700 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, that's
what we came from.

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:41.450 align:middle line:84%
They still openly talk
about it in school,

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:42.325 align:middle line:90%
can you believe this?

00:28:42.325 --> 00:28:43.730 align:middle line:90%
Up in Lake Titicaca.

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:45.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point indeed.

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:48.730 align:middle line:84%
Were these structures used
too for healing purposes?

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:49.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, absolutely.

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:53.370 align:middle line:84%
There was a multifaceted
method to the temples.

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:57.910 align:middle line:84%
One was for movement of energy,
one was for self-improvement.

00:28:57.910 --> 00:28:59.886 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians left
a lot of records

00:28:59.886 --> 00:29:01.510 align:middle line:84%
about the buildings
themselves, the way

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:03.280 align:middle line:84%
that the rooms were
shaped, that it

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:07.090 align:middle line:84%
was designed to musical scales,
a certain geometric shapes.

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:09.229 align:middle line:90%
And they also used alloys.

00:29:09.229 --> 00:29:11.020 align:middle line:84%
You often see the
pictures of the Egyptians

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:12.640 align:middle line:84%
holding these beautiful
rods of power, right?

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:13.600 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Those are made
of a certain alloy,

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:17.380 align:middle line:84%
and they're all tuned to
different musical notes.

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're like antennas.

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: They are-- exactly.

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And what they used to do
is-- because back then,

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.447 align:middle line:90%
healers were also musicians--

00:29:23.447 --> 00:29:25.030 align:middle line:84%
they used to look
at you, because they

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:27.190 align:middle line:84%
had that wonderful intuitive
ability, because they

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:29.870 align:middle line:84%
didn't have all this, you know,
television and all that stuff.

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:31.328 align:middle line:84%
They were much
connected to nature.

00:29:31.328 --> 00:29:32.500 align:middle line:90%
They could feel things.

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.990 align:middle line:84%
You'd walk into a room
and they'll say, George,

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:36.610 align:middle line:84%
you've been traveling
way too much.

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:39.850 align:middle line:84%
I think you're missing a
certain frequency on your body.

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:42.640 align:middle line:84%
You're missing the note A.
Stand up there for a second.

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And they'll go
into the cupboard,

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:46.120 align:middle line:84%
pick up one of the
rods, and they'd

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.520 align:middle line:84%
put it next to your
spine, which of course is

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.340 align:middle line:84%
where all your electromagnetic
energy goes through.

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And they would tap
that rod several times

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:55.500 align:middle line:84%
like a musical note,
and it literally

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.490 align:middle line:90%
would transform to your spine.

00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And you'd walk out of
there completely upright.

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:01.700 align:middle line:90%
Next?

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.040 align:middle line:90%
And that's how they did it.

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.720 align:middle line:84%
A very simple and
a very effective--

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nice tune-up.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: A nice
tune-up, literally.

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And today we know
that sound healing

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:12.580 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most beneficial
therapies out there.

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:15.340 align:middle line:84%
The Germans figured
this out in the 1800s.

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:17.420 align:middle line:84%
They figured that your
liver has a frequency,

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:19.220 align:middle line:90%
your eyes has a frequency.

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:21.660 align:middle line:84%
So if you're missing a certain
frequency in your body,

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:24.160 align:middle line:84%
if you throw the
missing frequency back

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.880 align:middle line:84%
into that location, you will
get it to regenerate itself.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.620 align:middle line:84%
The Sound Healers
Association would

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:33.130 align:middle line:84%
be talking about this today,
and they have a very good track

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:36.250 align:middle line:84%
record of helping people
out with resonance therapy.

00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:38.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Freddy, you've
done a lot of work

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:41.030 align:middle line:90%
in the area of mounds.

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:42.430 align:middle line:90%
What are they, first of all?

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Ah.

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:45.310 align:middle line:84%
I used to think,
like most people,

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:46.690 align:middle line:90%
that people were buried there.

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Because in Europe they
call them the tumuli--

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.080 align:middle line:90%
tumulus.

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.360 align:middle line:84%
80% of the ones that
have been dug up,

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:53.970 align:middle line:90%
there's no one buried there.

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:55.210 align:middle line:90%
Now here's the weirdest part.

00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:57.820 align:middle line:84%
They're all built, not just
with a dumping of earth,

00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:58.930 align:middle line:90%
like a molehill.

00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:02.320 align:middle line:84%
They're built in layers of
organic and inorganic material.

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And we know today that when
you do that, what happens

00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:07.190 align:middle line:84%
is you create a
certain shielding area.

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:09.520 align:middle line:84%
So when you have a mound
with an internal passage

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.100 align:middle line:84%
and you measure the
frequency outside and inside,

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:13.860 align:middle line:84%
the frequencies are
totally different.

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.520 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's a rarified
event that takes place.

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And what I began to realize
is that these things

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:21.610 align:middle line:84%
are marking special locations
on the face of the earth,

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:22.630 align:middle line:90%
as all temples are.

00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:24.545 align:middle line:84%
They're marking the
intersecting points--

00:31:24.545 --> 00:31:26.170 align:middle line:84%
the X-points-- on
the face of the earth

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:27.700 align:middle line:90%
that we talked about earlier.

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And I took a year
off, as one does,

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:33.096 align:middle line:90%
to go and measure a mound.

00:31:33.096 --> 00:31:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'd go there with
a friend of mine.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.550 align:middle line:90%
I do a lot of dowsing.

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And in case people don't
believe in dowsing,

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.600 align:middle line:84%
oil companies actually
use dowsers today

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.017 align:middle line:90%
to locate deposits of oil.

00:31:42.017 --> 00:31:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And I went there
with a friend of mine

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.370 align:middle line:84%
who has a very
developed little machine

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:47.110 align:middle line:84%
to figure out
background frequencies.

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So just in case people wouldn't
believe me, they'd believe him.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.600 align:middle line:84%
So we chose this
mound in England

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.340 align:middle line:84%
not far from Avebury
stone circle.

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And every two weeks
I would go there--

00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:57.250 align:middle line:90%
we would go there--

00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:58.960 align:middle line:84%
and measure these
ripples of energy

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:01.090 align:middle line:84%
that were literally being
generated by the mound.

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And you mark them on the ground,
and you measure the distance

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:04.630 align:middle line:90%
from the center of the mound.

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Then you plot them
on a piece of paper.

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And after a year
you actually were

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:11.830 align:middle line:84%
able to put together
this time-lapse video

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:15.040 align:middle line:84%
of the actual variations
of the ripples coming out

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:15.940 align:middle line:90%
of the mound.

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you've
done it for over a year.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.090 align:middle line:90%
So let's--

00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:18.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --look at this and
have you comment, Freddy,

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:22.720 align:middle line:84%
on just what we're
looking at here.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.420 align:middle line:90%
Because it's truly remarkable.

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:27.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yeah, you're
looking at the aerial footage

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:30.250 align:middle line:84%
of one of the mounds
not far from Avebury.

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:33.610 align:middle line:84%
So what you're seeing here now
are the ripples of energy that

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:35.050 align:middle line:90%
are coming out of the mounds.

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And every two weeks, they
change from positive,

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:44.080 align:middle line:84%
which is the red circles,
and the negative polarity,

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.550 align:middle line:90%
which is the blue circles.

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And how big is that?

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: That mound
is a small one.

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:51.520 align:middle line:84%
It's only about 120
feet in diameter.

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And again, you can see
how every two weeks

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:56.740 align:middle line:84%
the mound breathes in, it
breathes out, it breathes in.

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And also it changes
relative to the position

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.810 align:middle line:84%
of the earth's core,
how it rotates,

00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:03.220 align:middle line:90%
the position of the moon.

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And everything seems
to influence it.

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:08.510 align:middle line:84%
But as you can see, it
honestly is a living,

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:09.550 align:middle line:90%
breathing organism.

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:12.214 align:middle line:10%
Just like the Egyptians always
said that these temples,

00:33:12.214 --> 00:33:13.630 align:middle line:10%
regardless of where
you build them

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:18.550 align:middle line:10%
with earth or with soil or with
stone, they are living beings.

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:20.350 align:middle line:84%
I never understood
what they were talking

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:22.060 align:middle line:90%
about until this moment.

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Because now I realized I'm
now looking at a living,

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:26.800 align:middle line:90%
breathing organism.

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
radiating, isn't it?

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:30.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.420 align:middle line:90%
I love the stuff.

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:35.159 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In terms of height,
Freddy, how high is it?

00:33:35.159 --> 00:33:36.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: This one's
pretty worn down.

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:38.780 align:middle line:84%
It tends to rain
a bit in England,

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:41.600 align:middle line:84%
so this is only
now 15 feet high.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:42.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 15, that's all?

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: That's all now.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:46.310 align:middle line:84%
But if you go to the ones,
the original, the culture that

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:47.750 align:middle line:84%
really created
these mounds, which

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:51.740 align:middle line:84%
are in the Black Sea area,
culture called the Scythians.

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And these mounds date
back to at least 8000 BC.

00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:56.420 align:middle line:84%
You could be
forgiven for thinking

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:57.950 align:middle line:90%
that they are small mountains.

00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:00.650 align:middle line:90%
They are massive beyond belief.

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And we're just beginning
to realize what they are.

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:05.000 align:middle line:84%
The people of the
Ukraine and Russia

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.880 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to suddenly
reveal this information

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.400 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of the world.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:12.469 align:middle line:84%
And we're beginning to realize
that we've inherited these

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:13.950 align:middle line:90%
unusual looking molehills.

00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:16.449 align:middle line:84%
But they are actually much more
than the sum of their parts.

00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:18.949 align:middle line:84%
There are places literally
that not only mark the X-points

00:34:18.949 --> 00:34:21.679 align:middle line:84%
in the face of the earth,
but when you walk into them--

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:24.440 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of them have
chambers inside them--

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:27.461 align:middle line:84%
usually just leave and
disappear and go somewhere else.

00:34:27.461 --> 00:34:29.960 align:middle line:84%
If you're just there by yourself
for an hour, you come back,

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.719 align:middle line:84%
you're not the same
person when you went in.

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:33.929 align:middle line:84%
Something really, really
happens to you and changes you.

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Near St.
Louis, on the other side

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:39.142 align:middle line:84%
of the Mississippi in Illinois,
is the Cahokia Mounds.

00:34:39.142 --> 00:34:40.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes, there is.

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:43.469 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I went and saw
those and they're fascinating.

00:34:43.469 --> 00:34:45.600 align:middle line:84%
They look a little like
that, a little taller.

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I thought,
too, as you did initially,

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:54.560 align:middle line:84%
that there are Native Americans
buried in there like crazy.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And they have found other
structures within the mounds,

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:02.180 align:middle line:84%
but they seem to be
all over the place.

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:03.865 align:middle line:90%
What's the significance of that?

00:35:03.865 --> 00:35:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It was
a global culture.

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.323 align:middle line:84%
Again, they're borrowing
from the same philosophy.

00:35:07.323 --> 00:35:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And the burials tend to play--
the few burials that take

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:11.720 align:middle line:90%
place seem to be intrusive.

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:14.330 align:middle line:84%
They have no correlation to
the age of the actual mound.

00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:17.450 align:middle line:84%
They could be as much as
4,000 years between the burial

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:18.920 align:middle line:90%
and the building period.

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And again, it goes back to
the way that they were built,

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:23.894 align:middle line:84%
the layers of organic
and inorganic material.

00:35:23.894 --> 00:35:25.310 align:middle line:84%
There has to be a
purpose to that.

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And again, they behave
like orgone accumulators.

00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:30.170 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what Wilhelm
Reich was doing in his work,

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:32.360 align:middle line:84%
building these chambers--
that he used for healing,

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.440 align:middle line:90%
by the way--

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:35.490 align:middle line:84%
where there were
layers of steel wool

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:38.150 align:middle line:84%
and organic wool, steel
wool, organic wool.

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And that again attracts
a certain orgone energy,

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:42.810 align:middle line:84%
the energy that
permeates the universe.

00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
inside these chambers,

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:45.849 align:middle line:90%
something happens to you.

00:35:45.849 --> 00:35:47.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what
was happening here.

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:49.430 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly the same process.

00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:52.490 align:middle line:84%
Over time, because these things
are thousands of years old,

00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:54.480 align:middle line:84%
we go through the process
of change culturally.

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.670 align:middle line:84%
So we go from a culture
where we're all inclusive.

00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:58.010 align:middle line:90%
Now it's exclusive.

00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:00.710 align:middle line:84%
We're going to war by
the time it's 1500 BC.

00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:02.240 align:middle line:90%
We've lost the plot as humanity.

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.060 align:middle line:84%
But then we began to use
them as fortifications.

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And then we began to use
them as burial sites.

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:09.080 align:middle line:84%
It's like today, there
could be a building

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:12.980 align:middle line:84%
that was once used as a
hospital, now used as a hotel.

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:13.930 align:middle line:90%
That falls apart.

00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:15.170 align:middle line:90%
It's now used as a pub.

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:18.112 align:middle line:84%
But the original one, the
original use was the hospital.

00:36:18.112 --> 00:36:19.820 align:middle line:84%
So the same thing
happened to the temples

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:21.970 align:middle line:84%
as well, over such a
long period of time.

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:24.110 align:middle line:84%
They would get used
and recycled depending

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:27.800 align:middle line:84%
on the needs and the dictum
of the political era.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These
structures and facilities

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:35.710 align:middle line:84%
that are all over the planet
have these specific purposes,

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:38.800 align:middle line:90%
as you have outlined for us.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.450 align:middle line:84%
But when you make
any building, you

00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:45.910 align:middle line:84%
have some kind of architectural
rendering before you start.

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Who are the architects
for these things?

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They were
very interesting people

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:52.870 align:middle line:84%
who had complete
understanding of the laws

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:55.000 align:middle line:84%
of nature, to the point
where they would go

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.370 align:middle line:84%
and source materials from
hundreds of miles away,

00:36:57.370 --> 00:37:00.280 align:middle line:84%
even though they were actually--
the materials-- available quite

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.460 align:middle line:90%
right next to them.

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:04.480 align:middle line:84%
They understood the manipulation
of space using geometry.

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's like did
they inherit this material?

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:08.336 align:middle line:84%
Were they borrowing
from books that were

00:37:08.336 --> 00:37:10.170 align:middle line:90%
written thousands of years ago?

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:13.000 align:middle line:84%
Was it just downloaded
from the stars?

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Again, all of those stories
keep coming up again and again

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:16.456 align:middle line:90%
and again.

00:37:16.456 --> 00:37:17.830 align:middle line:84%
But they were
definitely in touch

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:19.960 align:middle line:84%
with a recipe book
that told them

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.200 align:middle line:84%
how to build things
in a very unusual way.

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And when you connect
the right stones

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:27.130 align:middle line:84%
with the right electromagnetic
energy at the right location

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:28.780 align:middle line:84%
in the face of the
earth, you create

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:31.000 align:middle line:84%
structures which are
different from a normal house.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.375 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
almost like putting

00:37:32.375 --> 00:37:34.110 align:middle line:90%
a plug into an electric socket.

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:34.985 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, totally.

00:37:34.985 --> 00:37:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once you connect
it, the electricity flows.

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:39.212 align:middle line:84%
It seems like the
same kind of thing.

00:37:39.212 --> 00:37:40.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It's the same thing.

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:42.545 align:middle line:84%
And whenever you're
approaching one of these sites,

00:37:42.545 --> 00:37:44.607 align:middle line:84%
and I'll use the pyramids
as a great example--

00:37:44.607 --> 00:37:46.190 align:middle line:84%
and it's not just
because they're big.

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:49.270 align:middle line:84%
It's because-- and even in
Dahshur, which few people get

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:51.580 align:middle line:84%
to go to, you can
just get off the bus

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:53.170 align:middle line:90%
and you're hit with this wall.

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You feel
it immediately.

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:55.258 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: I mean, you feel it.

00:37:55.258 --> 00:37:57.714 align:middle line:84%
Even the hardest skeptic
can't be but blown away.

00:37:57.714 --> 00:38:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Some of my favorite places are
some of the smallest places

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:00.930 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:02.500 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
smallest pyramid

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:05.320 align:middle line:84%
on the Egyptian plateau, which
no one gives any attention to,

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:07.630 align:middle line:84%
because I want to
see the big thing--

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:10.142 align:middle line:84%
the smallest pyramid is
the most important one.

00:38:10.142 --> 00:38:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you get some
really interesting work done.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen the face
of Zahi Hawass, you know,

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:17.035 align:middle line:90%
hardened academic.

00:38:17.035 --> 00:38:18.160 align:middle line:90%
And you'd just say to him--

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In his day.

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:20.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: In his day.

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And you'd say, Zahi,
the small pyramid.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.390 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my friend.

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:25.660 align:middle line:90%
A different person comes in.

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:27.790 align:middle line:84%
You know something has
happened to him in there.

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:29.500 align:middle line:90%
And I totally agree with him.

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:30.610 align:middle line:90%
Same thing happens to me.

00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:32.280 align:middle line:84%
The big pyramid is
very interesting.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:34.030 align:middle line:84%
I've had my share of
experiences in there.

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:37.240 align:middle line:84%
But the little things, the ones
that people don't pay attention

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.490 align:middle line:84%
to, and that's what
you want to look at.

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:42.067 align:middle line:84%
And you do feel this
sort of field around you.

00:38:42.067 --> 00:38:43.900 align:middle line:84%
You're in the presence
of this living being,

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:47.180 align:middle line:84%
just like I showed with
the dowsing of the mound.

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:50.590 align:middle line:84%
You're in the presence of this
space that actually begins

00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:52.450 align:middle line:90%
to change your environment.

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:54.910 align:middle line:84%
So it prepares you
as a human being,

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:56.650 align:middle line:84%
as an electromagnetic
human being--

00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:57.940 align:middle line:90%
because that's what we are--

00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:00.850 align:middle line:84%
it begins to alter who
you are in order for you

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:02.350 align:middle line:84%
to have an experience
in the temple.

00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, DNA, being very
subjective to fluctuations

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.590 align:middle line:84%
in the local magnetic
field, it only

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:11.200 align:middle line:84%
takes one small
alteration of the local--

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.120 align:middle line:84%
of the electromagnetic
frequency that you're

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.510 align:middle line:84%
interacting with for DNA
to say, wait a minute.

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:17.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm being given different
information here.

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what's happening.

00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:22.720 align:middle line:84%
So when you go into the
temple, the frequencies

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.040 align:middle line:84%
that have been measured
are slightly different.

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:27.520 align:middle line:84%
It makes you feel that you
are feeling a little different

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:28.420 align:middle line:90%
because you are.

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:30.354 align:middle line:84%
You're in a very
rarefied environment.

00:39:30.354 --> 00:39:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And if you'd just pay attention,
if you just give yourself

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:36.226 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of time, just step
back from your mental clutter,

00:39:36.226 --> 00:39:37.600 align:middle line:84%
just sit in there
for little bit,

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:39.433 align:middle line:84%
when you walk out you're
a different person.

00:39:39.433 --> 00:39:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And you know you're
a different person

00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:42.400 align:middle line:90%
because you've been altered.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.480 align:middle line:84%
That's why we use the
word "altar" in temples.

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:46.752 align:middle line:90%
You are there to be altered.

00:39:46.752 --> 00:39:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had to count
how many structures there were

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:51.910 align:middle line:84%
all around the planet,
from the pyramids

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:54.910 align:middle line:84%
to Stonehenge, how many
are we talking about?

00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:56.774 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Tens of thousands.

00:39:56.774 --> 00:39:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's just the
stuff that survived.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:39:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:39:58.820 --> 00:39:59.690 align:middle line:90%
That much?

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh the more you go
away from Europe and the known

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:03.290 align:middle line:90%
worlds--

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:05.170 align:middle line:84%
and I'm focusing on the
Pacific at the moment

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:06.430 align:middle line:90%
for a new project--

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:08.500 align:middle line:84%
I was astonished to
find how much stuff

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:11.200 align:middle line:84%
is in islands you'll never
hear about in the Pacific.

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.180 align:middle line:84%
Platforms, pyramids,
again, things

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:15.552 align:middle line:84%
that we thought were
natural mountains,

00:40:15.552 --> 00:40:17.260 align:middle line:84%
turns out that they're
actually man-made.

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:20.110 align:middle line:84%
There's one in Indonesia,
which has now been dated--

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:20.970 align:middle line:90%
carbon dated--

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:23.440 align:middle line:90%
26,000 BC.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:26.020 align:middle line:84%
You can tell that the guy,
the archaeologist that's

00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:28.570 align:middle line:84%
doing this work, there's a lot
of knives on his back right

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:30.970 align:middle line:84%
now from the local
archaeologists that do not

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:33.790 align:middle line:84%
want to accept that there
was people, Indonesia,

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:38.260 align:middle line:84%
or clever people in Indonesia,
as far back beyond 1000 BC.

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:41.440 align:middle line:84%
26,000 BC, that's now
the oldest site on Earth.

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:42.987 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
part of the world

00:40:42.987 --> 00:40:45.070 align:middle line:84%
is going to be showing us
something very important

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:45.280 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there was
purpose behind these things.

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:47.708 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Total purpose.

00:40:47.708 --> 00:40:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you go
around the world,

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:52.090 align:middle line:84%
they appear to be exactly where
they are for a certain reason.

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:54.680 align:middle line:84%
If you just happen to pull
back with a bird's-eye view

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:55.790 align:middle line:90%
of the earth--

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:58.524 align:middle line:84%
and I remember a very funny
time when I was doing this.

00:40:58.524 --> 00:41:00.190 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize that
Graham Hancock was

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:03.082 align:middle line:84%
doing exactly the same thing
for an identical project,

00:41:03.082 --> 00:41:05.290 align:middle line:84%
and we talked about it and
had a good laugh about it.

00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:07.081 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know,
I've been mapping out

00:41:07.081 --> 00:41:08.560 align:middle line:90%
these old sites on the earth.

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.780 align:middle line:84%
If I was doing this
at a temple level,

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:14.020 align:middle line:84%
I would also be mapping out
the temples geometrically

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:17.160 align:middle line:84%
or mathematically around the
face of the earth, using Giza

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:21.580 align:middle line:84%
as zero, and using longitudes
and using certain numbers

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.680 align:middle line:84%
to do with the earth,
to line up the temples.

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:24.480 align:middle line:90%
And they do.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:25.480 align:middle line:90%
If you actually used--

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:27.229 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you saying
they're connected?

00:41:27.229 --> 00:41:28.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: They're all connected.

00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did point
A know about point B?

00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:32.576 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: That's what
I would love to know,

00:41:32.576 --> 00:41:33.700 align:middle line:90%
because when you actually--

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:35.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I looked at it from
the simple point of view of--

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:36.743 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They didn't
have cell phones.

00:41:36.743 --> 00:41:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Hey, what are you
building over there?

00:41:38.410 --> 00:41:39.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They had
their cell phone.

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:40.399 align:middle line:90%
They didn't need a cell phone.

00:41:40.399 --> 00:41:42.160 align:middle line:84%
You just went, oy,
are you there yet?

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:43.630 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Because they had the
ability to see at a distance

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:47.700 align:middle line:84%
and hear at a
distance, because they

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:49.220 align:middle line:90%
didn't have all the clutter.

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And I've basically
just figured out

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:52.810 align:middle line:90%
that everything is geometric.

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:54.140 align:middle line:90%
All nature's geometric.

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And the geometry of the
earth, the nature of geometry

00:41:57.350 --> 00:41:58.400 align:middle line:90%
is the pentagram.

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Any living organism is
based on pentagonal values.

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:04.250 align:middle line:84%
So the pentagram, 72
degrees is your base angle.

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:07.580 align:middle line:84%
You divide the angles of
the pentagram as longitudes,

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:10.880 align:middle line:84%
you hit exactly the major--
all the sides on Earth.

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Graham was doing
exactly the same thing,

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.810 align:middle line:84%
looking at it from the
processional angle--

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:15.842 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As you were.

00:42:15.842 --> 00:42:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Doing it the hard
way, as he of course does.

00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And we came and
lined up and went,

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:21.870 align:middle line:90%
we got exactly the same thing.

00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And we just said,
well, obviously it just

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:28.190 align:middle line:84%
basically shows that we're on
the right track of inquiry.

00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:29.690 align:middle line:90%
But again, they had a big plan.

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:32.550 align:middle line:84%
They could see from outside the
earth and map the whole thing.

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you in shock,
Freddy, over the fact

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:38.330 align:middle line:84%
that this was happening
thousands of years ago?

00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Nothing surprises
me anymore, George.

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:41.690 align:middle line:90%
That's why I love what I do.

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:43.880 align:middle line:84%
It's the more I just
get out of my own hair,

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:45.270 align:middle line:90%
then just allowed them to speak.

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I like talking
to people who are indigenous.

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:49.946 align:middle line:84%
I want to know what
they have to say.

00:42:49.946 --> 00:42:51.570 align:middle line:84%
If they would claim
to be that stupid--

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:53.194 align:middle line:84%
and I don't accept
that for one moment.

00:42:53.194 --> 00:42:56.035 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just Europeans in
the Victorian era going to--

00:42:56.035 --> 00:42:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
jealous of that.

00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --Native
Americans saying,

00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:59.780 align:middle line:90%
oh, we're so much more special.

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:00.580 align:middle line:90%
Actually, no.

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:02.810 align:middle line:84%
They're talking
about stuff from 20--

00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:06.260 align:middle line:84%
the aboriginal people talk about
stuff from 30,000 years ago.

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And you have experts
from space say--

00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:12.404 align:middle line:84%
they talk about a meteorite
event of 1 million years ago.

00:43:12.404 --> 00:43:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And they go in the middle of
the Outback, and there it is.

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:16.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There it is,
and they knew about it.

00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So there are
eyewitness accounts.

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:21.000 align:middle line:84%
So the more I talk to the people
who experienced it locally,

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.920 align:middle line:84%
the more I'm even less
surprised because, oh, the story

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:25.280 align:middle line:90%
is so much more beautiful.

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We talked, Freddy,
about the healing properties

00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:29.660 align:middle line:90%
of these structures.

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:32.600 align:middle line:84%
If there were a sole
purpose why they

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:35.750 align:middle line:84%
had these built and constructed,
what would that purpose

00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:37.090 align:middle line:90%
be, in your opinion?

00:43:37.090 --> 00:43:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The journey
of the soul as a sort

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:40.730 align:middle line:90%
of a sign of perfection.

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:43.490 align:middle line:84%
You've got to understand the
concept of reincarnation.

00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:47.030 align:middle line:84%
If you can just accept that
for a second without judgment,

00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:49.190 align:middle line:84%
they recognize that
the soul comes here

00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:52.430 align:middle line:84%
on many occasions-- millions
of times, billions of times,

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:53.460 align:middle line:90%
beyond comprehension.

00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And the whole point was
to perfect yourself.

00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:58.980 align:middle line:84%
You come down here to the earth
to actually have an experience.

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:00.350 align:middle line:90%
It's a short experience.

00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:03.260 align:middle line:84%
You leave, and you decide,
do I want to go back?

00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:04.319 align:middle line:90%
Because it hurts.

00:44:04.319 --> 00:44:05.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's our choice.

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.401 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It really hurts.

00:44:06.401 --> 00:44:09.609 align:middle line:84%
Or do I go on to Planet Beach
for a few million years?

00:44:09.609 --> 00:44:10.900 align:middle line:90%
Well, there was that cute girl.

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:12.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go back there.

00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:12.885 align:middle line:90%
And that's how it happens.

00:44:12.885 --> 00:44:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She might not be
around when you get back.

00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:14.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: She might
not be around.

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:17.340 align:middle line:84%
You just pray that she keeps
her side of the bargain.

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:20.570 align:middle line:84%
Or a man, if that's
your thing, you know?

00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think that they recognize
that the whole point of Earth

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:26.360 align:middle line:84%
is a way station, where you
come here to perfect yourself.

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And after so many different
lifetimes you go, OK, I get it.

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:32.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go off and
go somewhere else now.

00:44:32.570 --> 00:44:35.930 align:middle line:84%
The Zoroastrians, who go
back to at least 10,000

00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:39.230 align:middle line:84%
BC, who-- and Zoroaster, by
the way, wasn't one person.

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:40.790 align:middle line:90%
He was many people.

00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:42.770 align:middle line:84%
They said that he
was a blueprint

00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:43.950 align:middle line:90%
for the story of Jesus.

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And in fact they said he was
the 13th and last incarnation

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:50.470 align:middle line:84%
of the original
prophet Zoroaster

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:51.990 align:middle line:90%
from 10,000 years ago.

00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:53.780 align:middle line:84%
I thought, what an
interesting story.

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And I inquired about this
from my Persian friends.

00:44:56.570 --> 00:44:57.560 align:middle line:90%
And they said, yeah.

00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:00.710 align:middle line:84%
They recognize that this soul
keeps coming back and back,

00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:02.350 align:middle line:90%
trying to perfect himself.

00:45:02.350 --> 00:45:04.485 align:middle line:84%
And by the time
he becomes Jesus--

00:45:04.485 --> 00:45:05.390 align:middle line:90%
he's done it all.

00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:06.080 align:middle line:90%
He's seen it all.

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And now he can be a
teacher to somebody else.

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.140 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't need to come back.

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:11.252 align:middle line:84%
Sorry if you waiting
for the second coming.

00:45:11.252 --> 00:45:12.710 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
happen, according

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:14.440 align:middle line:90%
to what the Zoroastrians say.

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:16.472 align:middle line:84%
So I've found a lot
of credence in that.

00:45:16.472 --> 00:45:17.930 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you
know, it's like when

00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:20.690 align:middle line:84%
you travel around the world,
you go to places that you

00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:23.120 align:middle line:84%
are so familiar with, but you
haven't been there before.

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:26.265 align:middle line:84%
How can you explain that unless
you have memory of the site?

00:45:26.265 --> 00:45:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our friend,
Erich von Daniken,

00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:29.306 align:middle line:84%
of course, "Chariots
of the Gods,"

00:45:29.306 --> 00:45:32.180 align:middle line:84%
seems to try to tie
in these structures

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:34.730 align:middle line:90%
from all over the planet.

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>> There are books on
the market, for example,

00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:39.510 align:middle line:90%
from a New Zealand pilot.

00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:41.300 align:middle line:90%
His name is Bruce Cathie.

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And he has a world
grid, which these lines

00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:46.970 align:middle line:84%
go all over the
planet, including

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:49.790 align:middle line:90%
in faraway Peru, Easter Island.

00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:53.160 align:middle line:84%
All these places
are linked together.

00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:57.350 align:middle line:84%
But this is not my research
which I can personally confirm,

00:45:57.350 --> 00:45:59.520 align:middle line:84%
because I did not
make this research.

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:01.370 align:middle line:90%
But it's out in the books.

00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:03.350 align:middle line:10%
Bruce Cathie is his name.

00:46:03.350 --> 00:46:06.967 align:middle line:10%
He was an airline pilot
for Air New Zealand.

00:46:06.967 --> 00:46:08.300 align:middle line:90%
And his books are on the market.

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And he says there is a bold
geometry, all linked together.

00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:15.080 align:middle line:84%
I know it for sure for Europe,
the so-called ley lines,

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:19.190 align:middle line:84%
because he can prove it with
the same names, the same root

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:22.280 align:middle line:84%
words, and you can prove
it definitely in Greece.

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:25.520 align:middle line:10%
All you need is a compass, and
you have places linked together

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:26.810 align:middle line:10%
in the same distances.

00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:31.120 align:middle line:84%
The reasons for the ley lines
and for this so-called holy

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:34.060 align:middle line:90%
or sacred geometry are us.

00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:38.960 align:middle line:84%
The extraterrestrials ordered
our prehistoric ancestor,

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:43.190 align:middle line:84%
make your temples on
that and that place,

00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:47.270 align:middle line:84%
because they knew that the
future generations, thousands

00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:51.150 align:middle line:84%
of years in the future, they
will measure their countries.

00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:52.280 align:middle line:90%
They will fly.

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And then they will realize that
this geometrical pattern cannot

00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:57.750 align:middle line:90%
be coincidence.

00:46:57.750 --> 00:47:00.380 align:middle line:90%
So these made on purpose.

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And now they come up
with the questions.

00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:03.346 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what we have.

00:47:03.346 --> 00:47:06.420 align:middle line:90%


00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrials--
were they here?

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:10.230 align:middle line:90%
Where is the proof?

00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:11.690 align:middle line:90%
Where is the time capsule?

00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Without the
geometrical pattern, we

00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:16.510 align:middle line:90%
would never ask the question.

00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:18.536 align:middle line:84%
That's why it has to
be done in the past.

00:47:18.536 --> 00:47:19.336 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: [LAUGHING]

00:47:19.336 --> 00:47:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, he echoes
a lot of the things

00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:21.680 align:middle line:90%
you've been saying, Freddy.

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:21.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: I know.

00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:23.130 align:middle line:90%
And they gave you the answer.

00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:25.110 align:middle line:84%
They're made on "porpoise,"
so it's done by a dolphin.

00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:25.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:26.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes.

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:27.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing work.

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It is.

00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And he's absolutely
right, I think.

00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:31.561 align:middle line:90%
And I think it was twofold.

00:47:31.561 --> 00:47:33.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one, they recognized
the whole of the universe

00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:35.160 align:middle line:90%
is based on geometry.

00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:38.040 align:middle line:84%
If you ever get lost on another
planet, you can talk geometry

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:39.380 align:middle line:84%
and they'll understand
what you're talking about.

00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:41.100 align:middle line:84%
It's the lattice
of the universe.

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And also they
recognize that if we'd

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:44.700 align:middle line:84%
lost a plot in the
future years, as we're

00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:48.750 align:middle line:84%
doing right now, that if you
recognized it to people who

00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:52.170 align:middle line:84%
are curious, and they put these
things back together again,

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:54.390 align:middle line:84%
they realize the
blueprint, they recognize

00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:56.547 align:middle line:90%
that yes, it's not by accident.

00:47:56.547 --> 00:47:57.630 align:middle line:90%
It's done very deliberate.

00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:58.729 align:middle line:90%
And who came up with it?

00:47:58.729 --> 00:47:59.770 align:middle line:90%
There had to be someone--

00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a
master planner somewhere.

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:01.831 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:48:01.831 --> 00:48:03.330 align:middle line:84%
So there had to be
someone else that

00:48:03.330 --> 00:48:05.550 align:middle line:84%
was here before from
somewhere else, which

00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:07.357 align:middle line:90%
means, oh, we're not alone.

00:48:07.357 --> 00:48:08.190 align:middle line:90%
There's a continuum.

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you put the
planet flat on a map

00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:16.170 align:middle line:84%
and put every structure there,
and then connected them,

00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:17.720 align:middle line:90%
would you see a pattern?

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:18.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:22.200 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I was reading something
in one of the old Indian texts

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:25.070 align:middle line:90%
about one of the gods who--

00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:27.300 align:middle line:90%
the three steps of Vishnu.

00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:29.734 align:middle line:84%
They had this god, walks
in three massive steps.

00:48:29.734 --> 00:48:30.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm thinking, wait a minute.

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:33.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at this
and I'm thinking,

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:38.520 align:middle line:84%
did this god walk geometrically
to create things in triangles?

00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:39.660 align:middle line:90%
And out of-- on a hunch.

00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Again, you just
kind of go with it.

00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:41.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:43.266 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And you
know, Google Earth,

00:48:43.266 --> 00:48:44.390 align:middle line:90%
which is a very addictive--

00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That helps.

00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:46.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --program,
very addictive.

00:48:46.350 --> 00:48:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And I figured, let me
look at things in India.

00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:50.490 align:middle line:84%
There are places here,
there are sacred mountains.

00:48:50.490 --> 00:48:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Some are more
sacred than others.

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:55.380 align:middle line:84%
Three are associated
specifically with this god,

00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:57.520 align:middle line:84%
and there's a story that
connects only those three.

00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I'll put
a pin there, pin there,

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:00.570 align:middle line:90%
and pin there.

00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And you connect the
dots, pull it back,

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:05.370 align:middle line:84%
and you go, my god, it's a
perfect right-angle triangle.

00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:06.960 align:middle line:90%
1,800 miles.

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.424 align:middle line:90%
How did they figure that out?

00:49:08.424 --> 00:49:09.840 align:middle line:84%
But then of course,
scientifically

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:11.080 align:middle line:90%
you've got to keep doing it.

00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:12.600 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what happens in Japan.

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:16.426 align:middle line:84%
The three most sacred
mountains, all reeds of heaven,

00:49:16.426 --> 00:49:17.550 align:middle line:90%
perfect right-angle either.

00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking about a
90-degree angle measured

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:22.890 align:middle line:84%
on the ground, because
obviously when you bring it up,

00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:24.450 align:middle line:84%
the lines get
curved, in case there

00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:25.885 align:middle line:90%
are any skeptics watching.

00:49:25.885 --> 00:49:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And then I began to look at
places in the Native American

00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Southwest, all linked by
age, and stories, and myths,

00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:34.080 align:middle line:84%
because you can't just
make this stuff up.

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:36.325 align:middle line:84%
There has to be a
connection of some point.

00:49:36.325 --> 00:49:37.125 align:middle line:90%
It happened there.

00:49:37.125 --> 00:49:38.500 align:middle line:84%
It happened in
the British Isles.

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:40.680 align:middle line:84%
It's happening all
around the world-- always

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:42.160 align:middle line:90%
perfect triangles.

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And I began to wonder,
well, why the triangle?

00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Well the triangles are
basically a flattened version

00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:47.910 align:middle line:90%
of the tetrahedron.

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:50.400 align:middle line:84%
The tetrahedron is
essentially the-- well,

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:51.317 align:middle line:90%
it's the glue of life.

00:49:51.317 --> 00:49:52.116 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:49:52.116 --> 00:49:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Every
single molecule that

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:56.580 align:middle line:84%
happens in the universe
is glued together

00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:58.870 align:middle line:90%
by a tetrahedronal lattice.

00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:01.640 align:middle line:84%
So they basically just flatten
that on the face of the earth.

00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was to
invoke the energy that

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:07.450 align:middle line:84%
comes from that creative process
and to put it and link it

00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:08.730 align:middle line:90%
to these temples.

00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:11.727 align:middle line:84%
So there was-- again, they're
thinking on a big scale,

00:50:11.727 --> 00:50:13.560 align:middle line:84%
but they're also thinking
on a minute scale.

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:15.893 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to basically
draw the idea of the heavens

00:50:15.893 --> 00:50:18.900 align:middle line:84%
onto the face of the earth and
bestow onto those locations

00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:20.790 align:middle line:84%
the properties that
come with that energy.

00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And when you walk in there,
you take on those properties

00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:26.750 align:middle line:84%
to perfect yourself and
ironically connect back

00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:27.870 align:middle line:90%
to the heavens as well.

00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:30.972 align:middle line:84%
So it's a big circular process
that they were working with.

00:50:30.972 --> 00:50:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Freddy,
for the people who

00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:35.740 align:middle line:84%
don't have the benefit of
visiting these structures,

00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:37.680 align:middle line:90%
what are they missing?

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, are they
missing my glorious words

00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:42.930 align:middle line:90%
and my presence at these sites?

00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:45.400 align:middle line:84%
I think you're missing
something very profound.

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:47.550 align:middle line:84%
It's an opportunity to
get out of your own ego,

00:50:47.550 --> 00:50:49.410 align:middle line:84%
out of your own
head, and literally

00:50:49.410 --> 00:50:50.760 align:middle line:90%
find out that you're a god.

00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And there are places on Earth
where there are inscriptions

00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:57.480 align:middle line:84%
that say, this temple was built
to transform you into a god,

00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:59.070 align:middle line:90%
into a bright star.

00:50:59.070 --> 00:51:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And they're absolutely
right because people

00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:04.140 align:middle line:84%
that go into these sites, you
go there for a day or a week,

00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:06.390 align:middle line:84%
when you come back you're
not the same person.

00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:07.770 align:middle line:84%
Something has
changed within you.

00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And I notice people
that have come

00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:10.770 align:middle line:84%
on my tours that are
just-- incredibly,

00:51:10.770 --> 00:51:12.630 align:middle line:84%
they still talk to
me 10 years later.

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:15.012 align:middle line:84%
And I say, what's happened
to you since we last met?

00:51:15.012 --> 00:51:16.220 align:middle line:90%
And they said, you know what?

00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:17.856 align:middle line:90%
That trip changed my life.

00:51:17.856 --> 00:51:19.230 align:middle line:84%
I have done this,
this, and this,

00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:21.477 align:middle line:84%
and I'm now a much
better person for it.

00:51:21.477 --> 00:51:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And they've gone
through hell as well.

00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:26.460 align:middle line:84%
They've had to completely
disembody themselves, recreate

00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:27.909 align:middle line:90%
themselves from scratch.

00:51:27.909 --> 00:51:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And I see them doing
extraordinary things--

00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:33.030 align:middle line:84%
becoming extraordinary writers,
healers, researchers, even

00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:35.880 align:middle line:84%
prominent politicians,
by the way.

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:37.440 align:middle line:84%
It happens in all
levels of life.

00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And architects as well,
encoding sacred geometry

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:40.974 align:middle line:90%
into their structures.

00:51:40.974 --> 00:51:43.390 align:middle line:84%
People don't want to leave the
buildings that they create.

00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:45.210 align:middle line:84%
So yes, there is a
change that happens

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:47.350 align:middle line:84%
to you on a physiological
and spiritual level

00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:48.150 align:middle line:90%
at these buildings.

00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:49.983 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't trade
that for anything else.

00:51:49.983 --> 00:51:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We talk a lot
about the power grid

00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:56.310 align:middle line:84%
and how it's connected and what
could happen if it goes down.

00:51:56.310 --> 00:51:57.660 align:middle line:90%
What about this grid?

00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:00.480 align:middle line:84%
The world grid that
is strategically

00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:02.520 align:middle line:90%
laid out all over the planet?

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: That's something I'm
beginning to just discover.

00:52:06.570 --> 00:52:08.780 align:middle line:84%
There's-- because if
you think about this,

00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:11.270 align:middle line:84%
if they were talking about
rebuilding the former world

00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:14.930 align:middle line:84%
of the gods and setting up the
mounds of strategic locations--

00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:17.450 align:middle line:84%
the earth had been hit,
the core had swung around,

00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:19.760 align:middle line:84%
the axis had tilted,
things had shifted.

00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:21.930 align:middle line:84%
Because these energy lines
behave like serpents.

00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:22.730 align:middle line:90%
They move.

00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:24.090 align:middle line:90%
They disappear.

00:52:24.090 --> 00:52:25.130 align:middle line:90%
You have to anchor them.

00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And by the time we
start doing the work

00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:30.010 align:middle line:84%
and recognizing that the temples
are anchoring the energy lines

00:52:30.010 --> 00:52:32.900 align:middle line:84%
and the temples are aligned
to geometric and mathematical

00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:34.190 align:middle line:90%
proportions.

00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
are they trying

00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:39.230 align:middle line:84%
to buy us time to a
point that civilization

00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:40.850 align:middle line:90%
evolves to such a degree--

00:52:40.850 --> 00:52:42.140 align:middle line:90%
as we are today--

00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:45.000 align:middle line:84%
that we will hit a
moment of a fracture?

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:45.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Because we are
hitting that moment.

00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:48.143 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt about it.

00:52:48.143 --> 00:52:51.366 align:middle line:84%
I mean, NASA's obsessed with
asteroids all of a sudden.

00:52:51.366 --> 00:52:52.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As they should be.

00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:53.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: As they should be.

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And the calendars
have come to a close.

00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:57.520 align:middle line:90%
The Fourth World has now hit a--

00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:59.270 align:middle line:84%
we're now heading
into the Fifth World.

00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:00.980 align:middle line:90%
Everything is coming to a head.

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And we're beginning
to realize we've

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.400 align:middle line:90%
been living on borrowed time.

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'm watching all
of these temples--

00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:09.390 align:middle line:84%
pyramids, simple stone
circles that were built,

00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:11.909 align:middle line:84%
what, to look at the
sun and the moon?

00:53:11.909 --> 00:53:13.325 align:middle line:84%
You and I can do
that with sticks.

00:53:13.325 --> 00:53:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, no, no.

00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: You know the one.

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:17.880 align:middle line:84%
They are commemorating
long periods of time.

00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:19.700 align:middle line:84%
They are looking at
the sky obsessively.

00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:20.500 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And making things
and building things

00:53:22.370 --> 00:53:24.270 align:middle line:84%
so that they would
last into our lifetime.

00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:26.540 align:middle line:84%
I think that they were
anchoring the energy grid

00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:30.740 align:middle line:84%
so that the earth basically is
stabilized to a certain degree

00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:33.440 align:middle line:84%
within a certain period of
time, to give us enough time

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:35.930 align:middle line:84%
to figure out, hey, we're
going to be learning

00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:39.110 align:middle line:84%
this big lesson
over 12,000 years

00:53:39.110 --> 00:53:41.270 align:middle line:84%
and then it's all going
to come to a complete end.

00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:43.230 align:middle line:84%
We're going to rebuild
and start again.

00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what's happening.

00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:46.880 align:middle line:84%
I think the build is
to give us some time

00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:48.680 align:middle line:90%
to actually work on ourselves.

00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And like everything
in the universe,

00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:53.244 align:middle line:84%
it has a beginning and an end,
and it has a beginning again.

00:53:53.244 --> 00:53:54.660 align:middle line:84%
It's just a theory
I'm working on.

00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:57.110 align:middle line:84%
But the more I travel, the
more I look at these spaces,

00:53:57.110 --> 00:53:58.520 align:middle line:84%
the more I look at the
evidence, the more I

00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:00.920 align:middle line:84%
begin to realize that, yes,
there is some truth to this.

00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:03.950 align:middle line:84%
That they are literally
anchoring the Earth grid

00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:07.700 align:middle line:84%
in order to get you to realize
the big potential within you,

00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:11.780 align:middle line:84%
within society, and eventually
to also recognize that there's

00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:13.659 align:middle line:90%
a continuum to all of this.

00:54:13.659 --> 00:54:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
fascinates you the most

00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:17.270 align:middle line:90%
about all these structures?

00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:20.370 align:middle line:84%
If there's a single one
thing, what would that be?

00:54:20.370 --> 00:54:22.332 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: How old
this stuff really is.

00:54:22.332 --> 00:54:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Older than we think.

00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Older than
is humanly imaginable.

00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:28.220 align:middle line:90%
And also, the--

00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:29.660 align:middle line:90%
I think it's the--

00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:33.830 align:middle line:84%
I have to say, it's the love
that they have for humanity.

00:54:33.830 --> 00:54:37.190 align:middle line:84%
For the ability to put
a mirror in front of us,

00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:39.680 align:middle line:84%
for us to recognize
we can do so much more

00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:41.210 align:middle line:90%
than we've been led to believe.

00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Most people live
in a world of fear.

00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:44.330 align:middle line:90%
It's such a limiting thing.

00:54:44.330 --> 00:54:47.190 align:middle line:84%
Once you get out of that and
recognize that, you know,

00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:50.540 align:middle line:84%
when you die, you go off and--
like Obi-Wan Kenobi said,

00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:53.547 align:middle line:84%
if you strike me down, Vader,
you become more powerful than--

00:54:53.547 --> 00:54:55.880 align:middle line:84%
I'll become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.

00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:57.920 align:middle line:84%
It was a great line
because it's true.

00:54:57.920 --> 00:54:59.360 align:middle line:90%
Death is not the only thing.

00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:00.920 align:middle line:84%
The Templars knew
about this when

00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:04.250 align:middle line:84%
they were being burnt alive and
they went there smiling, going,

00:55:04.250 --> 00:55:07.220 align:middle line:84%
a little moment of pain
is nothing in eternity.

00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was
to do with the fact

00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:12.420 align:middle line:84%
that they loved humanity
enough to tell other people who

00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:14.390 align:middle line:84%
were not quite as
aware as they were,

00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:17.150 align:middle line:84%
that, yes, you can be a
god in your own lifetime.

00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:18.860 align:middle line:84%
If you'd just get
out of your own way,

00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:21.350 align:middle line:84%
go to these special
self-help centers,

00:55:21.350 --> 00:55:23.120 align:middle line:90%
and recognize for one moment--

00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:26.510 align:middle line:84%
or a week-- that you are
much bigger than you are.

00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:27.980 align:middle line:90%
You are very powerful people.

00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you just apply your
intent and your purpose,

00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:32.540 align:middle line:84%
and you are focused
about it, like

00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:34.730 align:middle line:84%
any yogi would tell
you that you can

00:55:34.730 --> 00:55:36.807 align:middle line:84%
achieve extraordinary
things in your lifetime.

00:55:36.807 --> 00:55:38.390 align:middle line:84%
It really comes down
to that, I think,

00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:39.970 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
makes it so special.

00:55:39.970 --> 00:55:43.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the formations
of the structures

00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:47.870 align:middle line:84%
tantamount to doing all these
other unbelievable things?

00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:50.180 align:middle line:84%
The fact that they would
put them where they are,

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:52.580 align:middle line:84%
shape them the way
they shape them--

00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:53.679 align:middle line:90%
how important is that?

00:55:53.679 --> 00:55:54.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, totally important.

00:55:54.970 --> 00:55:56.752 align:middle line:90%
Nothing was about decoration.

00:55:56.752 --> 00:55:58.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there
was no guesswork here.

00:55:58.460 --> 00:55:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: No guesswork at all.

00:55:59.670 --> 00:56:01.250 align:middle line:84%
I look at some of
the temple cut out

00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:02.900 align:middle line:84%
of the living rock
by the Jain, which

00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:06.919 align:middle line:84%
are a very mysterious culture
in the Indian subcontinent.

00:56:06.919 --> 00:56:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And you go into the side
of a mountain, something

00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:11.464 align:middle line:84%
made of granite, not exactly
an easy rock to carve--

00:56:11.464 --> 00:56:12.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, it's not.

00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:13.254 align:middle line:90%
Not with those tools.

00:56:13.254 --> 00:56:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And you go in--
it's little stag heads.

00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And you go in and they've carved
everything in minuscule detail.

00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:21.180 align:middle line:90%
There is not an error anywhere.

00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:21.980 align:middle line:90%
How do they do it?

00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:23.390 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:25.940 align:middle line:84%
Everything is where it should
be because of geometry,

00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:27.380 align:middle line:90%
of mathematics, of--

00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:29.700 align:middle line:84%
and then the Russians
figured this out, by the way,

00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:31.460 align:middle line:84%
that when you go into
these environments,

00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:32.960 align:middle line:84%
the geometry actually
does something

00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:35.480 align:middle line:84%
to you, because each
temple is different.

00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And they recognize,
well, wait a minute.

00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:39.410 align:middle line:90%
What happens if it's true?

00:56:39.410 --> 00:56:41.916 align:middle line:84%
They talk about changes of
consciousness and healing.

00:56:41.916 --> 00:56:43.540 align:middle line:84%
What happens if you
put a person that's

00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:46.370 align:middle line:84%
sick in the room shaped
like a pentagram?

00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And they found that
actually people

00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:50.630 align:middle line:84%
heal better when
they're in the shape

00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:52.220 align:middle line:90%
of a room like a pentagram.

00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And they stretched
that old information

00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:55.850 align:middle line:84%
and they built
hospitals like that.

00:56:55.850 --> 00:56:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And it really came down to
that, that the ancient people

00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:02.300 align:middle line:84%
were basically
hard-wiring everything.

00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:04.730 align:middle line:90%
They would use beauty as a bait.

00:57:04.730 --> 00:57:07.060 align:middle line:84%
But when you go in there and
you start getting curious,

00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:08.590 align:middle line:90%
and you go, what's that?

00:57:08.590 --> 00:57:09.550 align:middle line:90%
And you're sucked in.

00:57:09.550 --> 00:57:10.750 align:middle line:90%
That's how they did it.

00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:13.770 align:middle line:84%
The beauty was just a little
fishing line to get you in.

00:57:13.770 --> 00:57:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And once you were in
there, you can't let go.

00:57:16.410 --> 00:57:17.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
your very favorite?

00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:19.450 align:middle line:90%
One place.

00:57:19.450 --> 00:57:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, that's hard.

00:57:20.550 --> 00:57:21.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I know.

00:57:21.350 --> 00:57:23.020 align:middle line:84%
They're probably
all great for you.

00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:24.550 align:middle line:90%
But you've got to pick one.

00:57:24.550 --> 00:57:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: But you know what?

00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:26.500 align:middle line:84%
It depends on what you're
looking at at the time

00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:28.730 align:middle line:84%
and where you are as
a being at the time.

00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:30.100 align:middle line:90%
So it changes.

00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Right now I'm kind of obsessed
with northern Scotland.

00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:36.820 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite parts of
the world, like so many others.

00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:39.010 align:middle line:84%
I've just come back
from Orkney Islands,

00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:41.050 align:middle line:84%
in the-- halfway
to the North Pole.

00:57:41.050 --> 00:57:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen stuff there
which is out of this world.

00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:44.680 align:middle line:90%
And again--

00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:45.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mind-boggling?

00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:48.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Mind-boggling because
the stones are 20 feet tall.

00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:51.650 align:middle line:90%
They're about this thin.

00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:52.450 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:54.366 align:middle line:84%
And they're standing on
the center of gravity,

00:57:54.366 --> 00:57:56.470 align:middle line:84%
literally cut out of a
little slot on the bedrock.

00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:57.370 align:middle line:90%
And it's windy up there.

00:57:57.370 --> 00:57:58.661 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How far deep are they?

00:57:58.661 --> 00:58:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They're
not that far deep.

00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:01.750 align:middle line:84%
There's only this much of
Earth, and then there's

00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:03.040 align:middle line:84%
a little slot into
which they go into.

00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:03.295 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it?

00:58:03.295 --> 00:58:05.280 align:middle line:84%
How come they haven't
blown over or something?

00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:06.863 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: That's what
I'd love to know,

00:58:06.863 --> 00:58:09.610 align:middle line:84%
because they literally found the
center of gravity of the stone,

00:58:09.610 --> 00:58:12.250 align:middle line:84%
and they're standing there
taking 60 mile-an-hour wind.

00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And if you just rest
your ear, they're going--

00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:15.415 align:middle line:90%
they're humming.

00:58:15.415 --> 00:58:17.950 align:middle line:84%
[WHOOSHES] They're just moving
ever so slightly, humming.

00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:21.800 align:middle line:84%
All of them together create this
wonderful, sinuous resonance

00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:22.600 align:middle line:90%
about them.

00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:24.580 align:middle line:90%
I could not leave.

00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:26.834 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the plane was
leaving and I'm going out

00:58:26.834 --> 00:58:28.250 align:middle line:84%
to get in the car
back to my plane

00:58:28.250 --> 00:58:29.620 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not going to enjoy this.

00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:30.694 align:middle line:90%
And it's hard to leave.

00:58:30.694 --> 00:58:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And when you left, you're
not the same person again.

00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm discovering
things about those things

00:58:35.170 --> 00:58:36.890 align:middle line:90%
just by listening to the sites.

00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:37.760 align:middle line:90%
What are they trying to tell me?

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:38.590 align:middle line:90%
What are they trying to say?

00:58:38.590 --> 00:58:39.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's the message?

00:58:39.370 --> 00:58:41.203 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And then a
month later, scribbling,

00:58:41.203 --> 00:58:43.260 align:middle line:84%
scribbling-- oh, that
makes a lot of sense.

00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:45.010 align:middle line:84%
So that's my favorite
place at the moment.

00:58:45.010 --> 00:58:47.470 align:middle line:10%
But it will change next week
when I'm at a different level

00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:49.780 align:middle line:10%
and I'm needing a different
piece of information.

00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:52.210 align:middle line:10%
I'll go to Peru and there'll
be something there waiting

00:58:52.210 --> 00:58:53.140 align:middle line:10%
for me as well.

00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:54.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's-- and I'm
following that trail.

00:58:54.850 --> 00:58:56.590 align:middle line:84%
That's what I like
about the work I do.

00:58:56.590 --> 00:58:58.180 align:middle line:84%
I follow the trail
of breadcrumbs.

00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:00.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't I don't have an agenda.

00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:02.942 align:middle line:84%
I'm just being led, and that's
what makes it fun and curious.

>>NOORY: Freddy, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:05.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: My pleasure.

00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:07.798 align:middle line:84%
I hope there's a drinks
cabinet here next time.

00:59:07.798 --> 00:59:08.760 align:middle line:90%
I keep asking for one.

00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:10.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, I have mine.

00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:11.822 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Hey.

00:59:11.822 --> 00:59:13.780 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Folks, you may
not have an opportunity

00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:17.530 align:middle line:10%
to travel to all these
incredible structures.

00:59:17.530 --> 00:59:20.200 align:middle line:84%
But with programs like
ours, "Beyond Belief,"

00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:21.560 align:middle line:90%
we'll take you there.

00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:23.050 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for watching.
