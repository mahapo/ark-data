00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:26.750 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.120 align:middle line:10%
Cheryl Costa is a
military veteran

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.060 align:middle line:10%
and was in the US Air Force
and the Navy, as I was.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And these days, she's a
journalist and UFO researcher.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Back in 2018, the
International UFO Congress

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.150 align:middle line:84%
named Cheryl
Researcher of the Year.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And that is one heck
of an honor, Cheryl.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.240 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CHERYL COSTA:
Thank you, George.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And thank you for
your service in the military.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.600 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Thank you.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.230 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for yours.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.605 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dual Air
Force and Navy.

00:00:49.605 --> 00:00:50.480 align:middle line:90%
How'd you do that?

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.730 align:middle line:10%
>>COSTA: They were rifting
people out of the Air Force

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.647 align:middle line:10%
at the end of the war.

00:00:53.647 --> 00:00:54.620 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.560 align:middle line:10%
>>COSTA: And I
had an opportunity

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.660 align:middle line:10%
to go for some very advanced
training in the Navy,

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.370 align:middle line:10%
so I took the opportunity.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.920 align:middle line:10%
They gave us advanced
rank and special schools.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.403 align:middle line:90%
And it was a lot of fun.

00:01:05.403 --> 00:01:06.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.100 align:middle line:90%
I loved the Navy.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.900 align:middle line:90%
I had a great time.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: I had a blast.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.953 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Met some great
people and just had some--

00:01:10.953 --> 00:01:14.120 align:middle line:84%
I was one year short of
a Lieutenant Commander

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.200 align:middle line:90%
when I retired.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And my unit got called up into
Desert Storm back in 1991.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Oh, my.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had gotten out
six months before that.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.480 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Oh, my.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.147 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They came
back with the ribbons

00:01:25.147 --> 00:01:26.480 align:middle line:90%
and all kinds of things.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.880 align:middle line:84%
How did you get involved
in UFO research?

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: Well, I'd
always been around UFOs.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.940 align:middle line:84%
My mother exposed me to my
first sighting when I was 12.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.927 align:middle line:90%
I had another one when I was 14.

00:01:36.927 --> 00:01:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And then, when I was
in the Air Force,

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Christmas Eve 1971, in
Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.540 align:middle line:90%
I had a substantial one.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.045 align:middle line:84%
And so I was always on the
edges of it, reading about it,

00:01:48.045 --> 00:01:48.920 align:middle line:90%
and things like this.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.180 align:middle line:90%
Nothing heavy.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't join any kind
of UFO groups or anything

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.660 align:middle line:90%
because I had a clearance.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.700 align:middle line:90%
And the Air Force--

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.570 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: --frowned
on you if you were

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.050 align:middle line:84%
a member of any kind of group
like MUFON or something.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you
had to stay back.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.950 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Oh, yeah.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.420 align:middle line:84%
So I had to wait for
all the years I was out

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.620 align:middle line:84%
of the military, and then I
did 32 years at Lockheed Martin

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.820 align:middle line:90%
in aerospace.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.350 align:middle line:84%
So I had to wait till
all that was done.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And once I was out from
underneath the strictures

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.040 align:middle line:84%
of my clearance, I
was in the process

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.950 align:middle line:84%
of finishing a 40-year-old
bachelor's degree

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.330 align:middle line:90%
in entertainment writing.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And I was working
for a newspaper.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And one night somebody
had an article up.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.150 align:middle line:90%
I think it was cnn.com.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Had this little sidebar
story up in 2012.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.130 align:middle line:84%
It said, UFOs have been
declining since the 1980s.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.170 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they were always
just an urban legend.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that sounds
like misinformation.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And I went out to the National
UFO Reporting Center's

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.825 align:middle line:90%
database, first time in my life.

00:02:47.825 --> 00:02:48.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Peter Davenport's.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And I got back into
some back pages,

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.960 align:middle line:90%
got some year-end totals.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Dropped them into a
spreadsheet and watched

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.860 align:middle line:90%
the curve go up like a rocket.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what memo
did the UFOs get?

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.810 align:middle line:90%


00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.200 align:middle line:84%
The next evening I started
reading some of these reports

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.460 align:middle line:90%
from people.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And for the most part, people
who were filing reports,

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.760 align:middle line:84%
they just wanted to get
something off their chest.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.362 align:middle line:84%
They had something
profound happen.

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:18.320 align:middle line:84%
They would say, we never
believed in this stuff

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.500 align:middle line:84%
until this thing
happened the other night.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.300 align:middle line:90%
That type of thing.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.980 align:middle line:90%
And I saw all the sincerity.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.430 align:middle line:90%
So I started writing articles.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.040 align:middle line:84%
I wrote some articles up,
and I started pitching them

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.210 align:middle line:90%
to editors and things.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And I got laughed
out of offices,

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.420 align:middle line:84%
and chased out of
offices, and things.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.503 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Until some point.

00:03:33.503 --> 00:03:34.520 align:middle line:90%
And then all of--

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Yes.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Until Larry Dietrich,
the Editor in Chief

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.610 align:middle line:84%
at a weekly newspaper up
in Syracuse, New York,

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:41.820 align:middle line:90%
"Syracuse New Times."

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.755 align:middle line:84%
It's now defunct
about a year ago.

00:03:43.755 --> 00:03:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As most are.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.810 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: As they are.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'll
take a chance on you.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.190 align:middle line:90%
Try you out for a month.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the month,
he called me up and said, just

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.618 align:middle line:90%
keep doing what you're doing.

00:03:52.618 --> 00:03:54.890 align:middle line:90%
You're pulling huge page views.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And six months later, my digital
editor comes to me and says,

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.310 align:middle line:90%
you've got a national audience.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: And he came
to me at the end

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.020 align:middle line:84%
of about-- at the
Christmas party and said,

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.580 align:middle line:84%
you've got an
international audience.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.260 align:middle line:90%
Just keep doing it.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It just kept
growing and growing.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: It just kept growing.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.255 align:middle line:84%
At one point, they told me I
had more page views than all

00:04:11.255 --> 00:04:12.970 align:middle line:90%
their columnists combined.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And so the articles I
wrote, I took the approach--

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.779 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't tell you who,
what, when, where, why.

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:20.970 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't tell you who
because the databases

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.220 align:middle line:90%
don't tell you that.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And even when people
actually started

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.000 align:middle line:84%
talking to me as a
reporter, my editor and I

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.250 align:middle line:84%
agreed we weren't going to
out anybody because there's

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.158 align:middle line:84%
a stigma, the UFO
brush, so to speak.

00:04:32.158 --> 00:04:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And if I could tell you
why and I could prove it,

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.520 align:middle line:90%
I'd be getting a Nobel Prize.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.380 align:middle line:84%
But I could tell you
what, when, and where.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or a Pulitzer.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Yeah, that too.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And so the bottom
line on it was I

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.240 align:middle line:84%
took a very different
approach than most people did

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.630 align:middle line:90%
with UFO articles.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.825 align:middle line:84%
I took the idea of let's
do it matter-of-factly.

00:04:48.825 --> 00:04:51.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to write about it just
like the fire down the street,

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.300 align:middle line:84%
the burglary over in the
other neighborhood, the car

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.770 align:middle line:90%
accident across town.

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And we wrote about
it just that way.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And people received it
very well considering.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.520 align:middle line:84%
We were treating it with
a great deal of respect,

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.700 align:middle line:84%
and just like another thing that
happens in the neighborhood.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Cheryl,
investigator Paola Harris

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.570 align:middle line:90%
was on "Beyond Belief" with me.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is her take
on the difference

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.570 align:middle line:84%
between being a ufologist
and investigative journalist.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.320 align:middle line:10%
Even though you specialize
in investigating UFOs,

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.250 align:middle line:10%
you don't consider
yourself a ufologist.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.050 align:middle line:10%
>>PAOLA HARRIS: No.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.508 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You consider
yourself more

00:05:23.508 --> 00:05:24.720 align:middle line:10%
as an investigative reporter.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.480 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.938 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well,
because a ufologist

00:05:26.938 --> 00:05:29.940 align:middle line:84%
has a preconceived notion
that you're dealing with UFOs.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.063 align:middle line:10%
And I'm an investigative
reporter, so in my case--

00:05:33.063 --> 00:05:34.980 align:middle line:10%
because we're going to
cover a couple of cases

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.840 align:middle line:10%
that are controversial--

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.140 align:middle line:10%
it's my obligation
to look at all of it.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.290 align:middle line:10%
In some of these cases,
like the Billy Meier case,

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.720 align:middle line:10%
most of my colleagues
dissed the whole thing.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.100 align:middle line:10%
I have to see it
as a journalist.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.890 align:middle line:10%
I have to cover the story.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.860 align:middle line:10%
You can decide after if
it's real or not real.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.555 align:middle line:10%
But if you never
cover the story,

00:05:57.555 --> 00:06:00.270 align:middle line:10%
you don't have any
kind of concept.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.470 align:middle line:10%
You have gossip.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.430 align:middle line:10%
You have hearsay.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.930 align:middle line:10%
So everything in my
career I have ever done I

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.350 align:middle line:10%
have covered in
person, on location.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.243 align:middle line:10%
And you've called me, I know,
boots-on-the-ground person.

00:06:13.243 --> 00:06:15.160 align:middle line:10%
I don't see how you could
do it any other way.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.840 align:middle line:10%
So as a journalist-- and Jaime
Maussan is like that, too.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.755 align:middle line:10%
He's got to cover everything.

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:22.380 align:middle line:10%
For him to say, I
don't feel like doing

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.890 align:middle line:10%
that, it doesn't sound real--

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:24.720 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.070 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: I mean,
how can you do that?

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.260 align:middle line:10%
I don't feel like doing
that story because everybody

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.850 align:middle line:10%
will criticize me.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.980 align:middle line:10%
That's not what journalists do.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.890 align:middle line:10%
They cover the
story and then you

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:39.268 align:middle line:10%
decide, especially if you're
a scientist, if it's real.

00:06:39.268 --> 00:06:40.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She's pretty right on.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.290 align:middle line:90%
Don't you think?

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Yes.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.130 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.208 align:middle line:84%
Initially, I reported
mostly citing

00:06:45.208 --> 00:06:46.250 align:middle line:90%
work, that type of thing.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.160 align:middle line:84%
I'd crawl around into
Peter Davenport's data

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.618 align:middle line:84%
and find nice
write-ups and things.

00:06:50.618 --> 00:06:52.077 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And make
a story about it?

00:06:52.077 --> 00:06:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: And make
a story about it.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:54.903 align:middle line:90%
Because I couldn't tell you who.

00:06:54.903 --> 00:06:58.520 align:middle line:90%


00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.580 align:middle line:84%
If I said Joe and Susie were
laying on the hood of his car,

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.250 align:middle line:84%
I made up Joe and Susie but
the facts about the sighting

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.860 align:middle line:90%
were accurate.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:07.700 align:middle line:90%
So I did that.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And then gradually I started--
had to have something

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:10.720 align:middle line:90%
to write about.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.200 align:middle line:84%
New York State
was my beat, but I

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.290 align:middle line:84%
was allowed to write greater
nation articles as well.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:20.870 align:middle line:84%
So I started adding up things in
different cities and counties.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And what I found out was
National UFO Reporting Center

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.700 align:middle line:90%
didn't collect county data.

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And if MUFON did, it was
dependent upon the person

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.980 align:middle line:90%
who was filling out the report.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:31.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Critical.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: And usually
it was wrong.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.067 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:07:33.067 --> 00:07:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: So I added county
data electronically,

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.460 align:middle line:84%
buying a commercial
mailing list.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.020 align:middle line:90%
I built county data into it.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And we started
generating unique data.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And that became a very
strong part of my reporting

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.150 align:middle line:84%
about telling people what
was going on in counties,

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.970 align:middle line:84%
and dispelling the
myths, like she said.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.800 align:middle line:84%
In New York State,
the myths were, well,

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.050 align:middle line:84%
this is where all the sightings
are in New York State.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, I showed them that it
wasn't where all the sightings

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.210 align:middle line:90%
were.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were
in other locations.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:58.900 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Yes.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.638 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:08:00.638 --> 00:08:02.180 align:middle line:84%
Lake Erie-Niagara
Frontier was always

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.700 align:middle line:90%
known as the Lake Erie effect.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the Hudson
Valley was always a hotbed.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.150 align:middle line:84%
But when it came down to
looking where these things were,

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.875 align:middle line:84%
we didn't know that Rochester,
New York was the Lake Ontario

00:08:13.875 --> 00:08:14.675 align:middle line:90%
effect.

00:08:14.675 --> 00:08:17.090 align:middle line:84%
It had almost as many
sightings as Lake Erie.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And ground zero for
UFOs in New York State

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.410 align:middle line:90%
is Suffolk County, Long Island.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.155 align:middle line:90%
It's double anyplace else.

00:08:23.155 --> 00:08:25.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And who would know
that unless you looked?

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: Unless you
looked, and unless you had

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.610 align:middle line:90%
county information to look at.

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:32.539 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes a lot
of little communities

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:36.590 align:middle line:84%
had sightings but it didn't
look like one big city or place

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:37.760 align:middle line:90%
that had a lot of sightings.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you
put county data to it,

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.270 align:middle line:84%
suddenly all these
things added up.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.179 align:middle line:84%
And you could see
that that county

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:45.620 align:middle line:90%
had huge amounts of sightings.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.020 align:middle line:84%
So Suffolk County and
Nassau County on Long Island

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.790 align:middle line:90%
are in the top three.

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As I posed
the question to Paola,

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.760 align:middle line:84%
is she an investigative
journalist or a ufologist,

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.930 align:middle line:90%
I'll ask you the same.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:58.440 align:middle line:90%
Are you a field investigator?

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.487 align:middle line:90%
Are you a journalist?

00:08:59.487 --> 00:09:00.320 align:middle line:90%
Are you a ufologist?

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.400 align:middle line:90%
Or are you all of them?

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: I consider myself
an investigative journalist.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And as far as the data
work that has grown out

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:12.140 align:middle line:84%
of our research and
everything, I consider myself

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.610 align:middle line:90%
a citizen scientist.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.115 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a boots-on-the-ground
field researcher.

00:09:17.115 --> 00:09:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like she is.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.560 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Yeah.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't like ticks, I
don't like barbed wire,

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.240 align:middle line:90%
and I don't like cow patties.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:21.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.060 align:middle line:90%
And they're all in there.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.065 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: [LAUGHS]

00:09:24.065 --> 00:09:25.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're all there.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:26.857 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: But I also
come from the school

00:09:26.857 --> 00:09:28.640 align:middle line:84%
like you'd get in an
Indiana Jones movie.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.500 align:middle line:90%
It starts in the library.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.360 align:middle line:84%
We start researching it,
and then we fly terminals.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
to find in the data.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why don't you consider
yourself, Cheryl, a ufologist?

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:44.850 align:middle line:84%
You study UFOs probably as
much, if not more than, anybody.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Yes.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.830 align:middle line:90%
The term has become burdensome.

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:49.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it?

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:50.230 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Yeah.

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For you?

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:52.000 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Yeah, it has.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people do
call me a ufologist,

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.580 align:middle line:90%
and I'm fine with that.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:10:00.285 align:middle line:84%
But I still look at it from
the standpoint of these days,

00:10:00.285 --> 00:10:02.410 align:middle line:84%
without a newspaper, I'm
an independent journalist.

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'm an investigative
researcher.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Since you've
been doing this,

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:13.280 align:middle line:84%
what has been the most
dramatic case you've looked at?

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: There was one
in upstate New York.

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:19.980 align:middle line:90%
It was in February of 2013.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was up towards the
Schenectady, New York area.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:23.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:24.630 align:middle line:90%
Know it well.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: People saw three
blue lights coming down

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:30.040 align:middle line:90%
into an industrial park area.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:30.840 align:middle line:90%
They came down.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.180 align:middle line:84%
They became one object,
big blue object.

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.602 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing, isn't it?

00:10:34.602 --> 00:10:36.060 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: And as it
came down closer

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.550 align:middle line:84%
to the highway, the utility
roads that were near it,

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:41.175 align:middle line:84%
where local traffic was
driving, all their cars quit.

00:10:41.175 --> 00:10:42.300 align:middle line:90%
All their phones went dead.

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just like
"Close Encounters

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.810 align:middle line:84%
of the Third Kind," when
he was in the truck.

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:46.470 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: Just like
"Close Encounters."

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:47.345 align:middle line:90%
Everything went dead.

00:10:47.345 --> 00:10:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And people that
were reporting it

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:51.990 align:middle line:84%
said they could almost
reach up and touch it.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.400 align:middle line:84%
It was about 12 or 15
feet off the ground.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.740 align:middle line:90%
It was that close.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And when it took off,
it elevated back up.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.535 align:middle line:90%
The pieces split.

00:10:59.535 --> 00:11:01.410 align:middle line:84%
The three pieces split,
and they all went off

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:02.430 align:middle line:90%
in their own little direction.

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:04.805 align:middle line:84%
All the cars started up and
the phones came back to life.

00:11:04.805 --> 00:11:05.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gosh.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.530 align:middle line:90%
What did the people say?

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:09.520 align:middle line:90%
Were they baffled?

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.900 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Awestruck.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.580 align:middle line:90%
Shock and awe, as they say.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:16.922 align:middle line:84%
And I tried for a year to get
a mainstream newspaper up there

00:11:16.922 --> 00:11:18.130 align:middle line:90%
to write an article about it.

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing, huh?

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:19.675 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: And they wouldn't.

00:11:19.675 --> 00:11:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And I saved the article
till the end of 2013.

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:24.870 align:middle line:84%
It was the very last article
I published for 2013.

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what kind
of response did you have?

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: Oh, I had
a lot of response.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.055 align:middle line:84%
Got a lot of mail about
it, even a few people

00:11:30.055 --> 00:11:32.950 align:middle line:90%
who said they'd seen it.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:35.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it hard for you to
get UFO information these days,

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:middle line:90%
or is it easy?

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.720 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: In what regard?

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.017 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In terms of
investigating, to write.

00:11:41.017 --> 00:11:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Usually, I just--

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The case studies.

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:45.167 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: I don't do
case studies per se.

00:11:45.167 --> 00:11:47.500 align:middle line:84%
When I was writing articles--
that was the closest I got

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.240 align:middle line:90%
to a case study--

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:53.290 align:middle line:84%
I would get down into deep data
in the National UFO Reporting

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Center since that's publicly
available information.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you chase
down those stories?

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Sometimes.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:11:59.560 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, I did have a number
of people write me.

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:04.915 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I had a very
strict vetting process.

00:12:04.915 --> 00:12:07.810 align:middle line:90%


00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:09.220 align:middle line:90%
I got bagged once.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.120 align:middle line:84%
Someone bagged me with
a complete false thing.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:12.920 align:middle line:90%
It looked too good.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:13.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, it happens.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: It happens.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:18.280 align:middle line:84%
But after that, I had a very,
very tight vetting process.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.030 align:middle line:84%
What I did, though, I
did make a lot of friends

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:24.770 align:middle line:84%
with the experiencer community,
the abductee experiencer

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:25.570 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And I had a lot of
people sit down with me

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.670 align:middle line:84%
over a burger and a cup
of coffee someplace,

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.910 align:middle line:84%
and share some very
interesting stuff.

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And all of it, when
you look back now,

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:37.600 align:middle line:84%
it's all very consistent
with the stuff

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.400 align:middle line:84%
that the Dr. Edgar
Mitchell Foundation

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.620 align:middle line:84%
folks did, Ray Hernandez
and all those guys.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Noetic sciences
and stuff like that.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.142 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: All of that stuff is
very consistent with everything

00:12:46.142 --> 00:12:47.380 align:middle line:90%
that they wrote about later.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:48.755 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What have
you concluded,

00:12:48.755 --> 00:12:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Cheryl, about what
this all is all about?

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: OK, I've got
several conclusions.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.170 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: I lived in a
monastery for seven years.

00:12:59.170 --> 00:12:59.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You did?

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:01.630 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Yeah.

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:04.480 align:middle line:84%
While I was working at Lockheed
Martin, I lived in a monastery.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.980 align:middle line:84%
It's where I lived,
and I went and I

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:07.063 align:middle line:90%
worked at Lockheed Martin.

00:13:07.063 --> 00:13:08.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's unusual.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.177 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: Dressed like
the Dalai Lama every day

00:13:10.177 --> 00:13:11.650 align:middle line:90%
at corporate headquarters.

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And pushed their diversity
policies to the bleeding edge.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:20.110 align:middle line:84%
But the deal was I've always
had this esoteric view.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.790 align:middle line:90%
And I see two ends of it.

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Whenever someone
sees a genuine UFO

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:31.190 align:middle line:84%
and it profoundly changes them,
you hear this time after time

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.990 align:middle line:90%
after time.

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're never
the same, are they?

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: They're
never quite the same.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of us have
come to the conclusion

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:42.040 align:middle line:84%
that the volume of
UFOs that we have that

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.500 align:middle line:84%
are of the quality that's
not an airplane, that's

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.417 align:middle line:84%
something else kind of thing,
and it changes people--

00:13:47.417 --> 00:13:48.625 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Still might be ours.

00:13:48.625 --> 00:13:49.270 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Still might be ours.

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:50.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Still, you've
got to weigh that.

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:51.968 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: Still
might be ours, and I

00:13:51.968 --> 00:13:54.710 align:middle line:90%
can talk to that in a minute.

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:57.730 align:middle line:84%
But that kind of an effect where
it changes you a little bit,

00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:59.710 align:middle line:84%
almost like a
spiritual experience,

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:04.940 align:middle line:84%
it's increasing the elasticity
of their reality view.

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.560 align:middle line:90%
And this is a good thing.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.610 align:middle line:84%
Because I think for people
to be able to accept ET,

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:13.910 align:middle line:84%
they're going to have to
have a wider view of reality

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:15.330 align:middle line:90%
to appreciate it.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got some
graphs that you brought us

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:21.260 align:middle line:90%
from reports from 2001 to 2018?

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.262 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: '18, yes.

00:14:22.262 --> 00:14:23.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take
a look at them.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And you can explain
what we're looking at.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:26.623 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: All righty.

00:14:26.623 --> 00:14:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go ahead.

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: This is
from 2001 to 2018.

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:35.180 align:middle line:84%
The reason we started
with 2001-- people ask me,

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:36.890 align:middle line:90%
why didn't you go back 40 years?

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:42.710 align:middle line:84%
Much before 2001, the citing
numbers were very, very tiny.

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:46.640 align:middle line:10%
What you see with the apparent
increase the first eight

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.190 align:middle line:10%
years there, or first
five years, six years,

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:51.050 align:middle line:10%
that is an artifact
of reporting.

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:54.590 align:middle line:10%
More people were coming
onto broadband at that time,

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:57.347 align:middle line:10%
and it was easier for people
to report the sightings.

00:14:57.347 --> 00:14:58.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And up they went.

00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:59.513 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: And up they went.

00:14:59.513 --> 00:15:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, that first hump you
see from 2004 to about 2008,

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:08.150 align:middle line:84%
you see that first hump of
three or four right there?

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:11.600 align:middle line:84%
There's a six to seven-year
cycle with UFO sightings.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.135 align:middle line:84%
And then you see another hump
as it goes up real peaky.

00:15:15.135 --> 00:15:16.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then it
trails down again.

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.385 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: It starts
trailing down again.

00:15:18.385 --> 00:15:20.720 align:middle line:90%
Now, it stops in 2018.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.980 align:middle line:84%
What we know now is
in 2019 MUFON numbers

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:26.900 align:middle line:90%
started to tick up slightly.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And this year, National UFO
Reporting Center numbers

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.677 align:middle line:84%
have taken off and are
the best year since 2014.

00:15:32.677 --> 00:15:34.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They've exploded, yeah.

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Peter tells me that he's
getting calls like crazy.

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: His first quarter
was equivalent to 2014,

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:41.120 align:middle line:90%
which was a peak year.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:41.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:42.590 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at our next graphic.

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:43.923 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: They're back in spades.

00:15:43.923 --> 00:15:45.370 align:middle line:90%
They really are.

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:48.910 align:middle line:90%
OK, now this is 2020.

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:50.432 align:middle line:84%
The first three
months there you see

00:15:50.432 --> 00:15:51.640 align:middle line:90%
what the sightings look like.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:52.510 align:middle line:90%
Real good.

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And there's a thing that we
learned by doing our data.

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:59.500 align:middle line:84%
There are four things
that drive UFO sightings--

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.310 align:middle line:84%
population, temperate weather,
leisure time, and hours

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.020 align:middle line:90%
of darkness.

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people were
waiting with bated breath

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:10.870 align:middle line:84%
to find out if the lockdown,
with this increased leisure

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.370 align:middle line:84%
time, so to speak,
would impact it.

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:13.270 align:middle line:90%
And it certainly did.

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sure did.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:14.900 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: 1,000.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, there was a fall-off
during the startup.

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.530 align:middle line:84%
But what we don't
have on this chart

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:24.280 align:middle line:84%
is July numbers are
almost what May's are.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.147 align:middle line:90%
So this is really encouraging.

00:16:26.147 --> 00:16:28.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would, though,
we have such a huge drop-off

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:35.800 align:middle line:84%
from 1,050 reported sightings
down to 538, and then 284?

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.543 align:middle line:90%
It's almost like they shut down.

00:16:37.543 --> 00:16:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: We don't know
what people were doing.

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:43.390 align:middle line:84%
This is also a function
of human activity,

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:45.700 align:middle line:84%
if people are
distracted, getting back

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.330 align:middle line:90%
to work, that type of thing.

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:49.255 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at our next one.

00:16:49.255 --> 00:16:52.060 align:middle line:90%


00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:54.310 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: Now, this one I
just generated the other day.

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These are
all over the country.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: This is by city.

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:08.069 align:middle line:84%
And this is 90 of the top cities
in the country of 20,692 cities

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:10.121 align:middle line:90%
that we have UFOs reported.

00:17:10.121 --> 00:17:11.579 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
correlate, Cheryl,

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:14.072 align:middle line:84%
with the population
of that city?

00:17:14.072 --> 00:17:15.280 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: To some degree, yes.

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if you
have more people,

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:17.185 align:middle line:90%
you have more sightings?

00:17:17.185 --> 00:17:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: There's the
population factor,

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:23.290 align:middle line:84%
but you also see
things like, well,

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:27.050 align:middle line:90%
the top city there was Phoenix.

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:29.123 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which,
compared to New York,

00:17:29.123 --> 00:17:30.290 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have as many people.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:31.090 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Exactly.

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:33.950 align:middle line:84%
But it's a hot area, and
it's temperate weather,

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:35.510 align:middle line:90%
that type of thing.

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And also those people
say, well, there's

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:39.018 align:middle line:84%
got to be a problem
with light pollution.

00:17:39.018 --> 00:17:41.825 align:middle line:84%
But Los Angeles County
has more sightings--

00:17:41.825 --> 00:17:43.700 align:middle line:84%
they're the number one
county in the country.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Of 3,200 counties, they're
the number one county

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:47.700 align:middle line:90%
in the country.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:50.750 align:middle line:84%
They have more sightings
than 40 individual states.

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And Maricopa County in
Phoenix has more sightings

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.092 align:middle line:90%
than 36 individual states.

00:17:56.092 --> 00:17:58.550 align:middle line:84%
So there's something special
going on in both those places.

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You published a
UFO desk reference book.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Yes.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell me about that.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.570 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: We had gotten
to a point in 2015

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:07.880 align:middle line:84%
where we had done an
analysis of New York State.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.440 align:middle line:90%
Again, it was my beat.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And my wife is the
scientist of the two of us.

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:16.103 align:middle line:84%
She's got the science
degrees, research librarian,

00:18:16.103 --> 00:18:17.270 align:middle line:90%
National Academy of Science.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:19.550 align:middle line:84%
She was the head librarian
at the toxicology

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:20.930 align:middle line:90%
library for the EPA.

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:22.700 align:middle line:90%
Sharp lady.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking about maybe
doing some kind of a UFO book.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And she said, so
let's do some science.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.657 align:middle line:84%
So I had the analysis background
and the crunching background.

00:18:31.657 --> 00:18:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I've got
the arts and entertainment

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.900 align:middle line:84%
degree, top hat and
the cane, so to speak.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.690 align:middle line:84%
So we started
crunching the data.

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:40.807 align:middle line:84%
And we decided to do
the whole country.

00:18:40.807 --> 00:18:42.140 align:middle line:90%
We thought it might take a year.

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:44.033 align:middle line:90%
Took us 18 months.

00:18:44.033 --> 00:18:45.450 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know
what we were doing.

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:48.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, processes that we
developed to crunch the data,

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:50.720 align:middle line:84%
and clean it up,
and to organize it,

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.840 align:middle line:84%
what we did then in 18 months we
could probably do in two months

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.903 align:middle line:84%
now because we know
better how do it.

00:18:55.903 --> 00:18:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got it down
to a routine, don't you?

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.570 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: So what
we wanted to do was

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:02.900 align:middle line:84%
produce something that shows
the years, both for the country

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:07.250 align:middle line:84%
and for each individual
state, the monthly patterns,

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:08.180 align:middle line:90%
the weekday patterns.

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.940 align:middle line:90%
There was a thing out there--

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.430 align:middle line:84%
the late John Keel said,
"the Wednesday effect"

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:14.750 align:middle line:90%
back in the '70s.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, he had a small
database to work with,

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.600 align:middle line:84%
and it was mostly weighted
in the southwestern states.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And we found out that when we
did it for the whole United

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.090 align:middle line:84%
States, Saturday is the
hot day for the sightings.

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:27.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:29.570 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: Unless
you're in about 10--

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:31.153 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's great
to know, though.

00:19:31.153 --> 00:19:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: --10 southern states,
it's Wednesday or Thursday.

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And my interns-- they're
from down South--

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.860 align:middle line:84%
they said, well, that's
Bible study night.

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:38.660 align:middle line:90%
Leisure time.

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.570 align:middle line:84%
People are outside, coming
home from Bible study.

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what do they
think they're seeing, Cheryl?

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: It can be anything.

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:50.860 align:middle line:84%
The sighting shapes from
both reporting services--

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:54.290 align:middle line:84%
you can report anything from an
unknown to a light in the sky--

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think they're seeing?

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:56.200 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: --to some shape.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.580 align:middle line:90%
What do I think they are?

00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think they're seeing?

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:01.100 align:middle line:90%


00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.360 align:middle line:84%
You've looked at enough
cases in your career.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: OK.

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Jacques Vallée says 80%
is noise, identifiables.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:13.000 align:middle line:90%
20% is real.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.490 align:middle line:90%
MUFON says 30% are real.

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:19.510 align:middle line:84%
Cheryl and Linda have
come to our own conclusion

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:21.460 align:middle line:84%
using other
approaches with data.

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.680 align:middle line:90%
And we believe it's about 30%.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And Linda will tell
you in a heartbeat

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:29.200 align:middle line:84%
it's the exotic shapes
that are the truth.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.530 align:middle line:84%
We did an experiment where we
eliminated in the database,

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:35.140 align:middle line:84%
in a report, everything
that could be conventionally

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.930 align:middle line:84%
associated with an aircraft,
like a cigar-shaped thing

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:38.890 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:40.870 align:middle line:84%
It could be a side
of an airplane.

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:43.640 align:middle line:10%
We eliminated everything
that was unidentifiable,

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.685 align:middle line:10%
and kept only the oddball
stuff-- the squares,

00:20:45.685 --> 00:20:49.450 align:middle line:10%
the circles, the ovals, the
diamonds, the triangles,

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:51.280 align:middle line:10%
that type of thing,
and the things

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:55.600 align:middle line:10%
that don't represent anything
in our aerodynamic collection.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.830 align:middle line:90%
And it came up to about 30%.

00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:01.400 align:middle line:84%
So we seem to think the
truth is in the shapes.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How was your
reference book received?

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:06.430 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: It was funny.

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Field researchers loved
it because MUFON data was

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:14.120 align:middle line:90%
about 20% to 30% of the data.

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And Peter Davenport's data was
somewhere between 60% and 70%,

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:20.080 align:middle line:90%
depending upon the state.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And does
Peter's and MUFON's kind

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.360 align:middle line:90%
of echo each other?

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.160 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: No.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:24.993 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't.

00:21:24.993 --> 00:21:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: No.

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:32.230 align:middle line:84%
We found about less than a
percent, maybe less than 2%

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:33.730 align:middle line:90%
seem to be duplicates.

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:36.890 align:middle line:84%
But it was a 60-40
ratio for the most part.

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:41.125 align:middle line:84%
And the problem that we ran into
was that field investigators

00:21:41.125 --> 00:21:43.000 align:middle line:84%
loved it because if a
guy was going to go out

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.300 align:middle line:84%
to a county x to investigate
something, suddenly now,

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.570 align:middle line:84%
instead of having to crawl
around in MUFON's CMS system

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:51.940 align:middle line:84%
to find out how many previous
sightings they might have

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.880 align:middle line:84%
had there, suddenly they've
got both databases there

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.770 align:middle line:90%
in one convenient book.

00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:58.390 align:middle line:90%
And they loved it.

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:01.010 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of people in the
UFO community didn't like it.

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:02.990 align:middle line:84%
They would look at and say,
oh, this is charts, graphs,

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.948 align:middle line:90%
and tables and numbers.

00:22:03.948 --> 00:22:05.297 align:middle line:90%
Ew, boring.

00:22:05.297 --> 00:22:06.880 align:middle line:84%
But for the most
part, a lot of people

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:10.450 align:middle line:90%
saw it as very unique research.

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:12.970 align:middle line:84%
The "New York Times" looked
at it and said, my god,

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:14.830 align:middle line:84%
somebody's doing some
primary research here.

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, they're
into this now, too.

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:19.660 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: They wrote us up in
"Science Magazine" in 2017.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.280 align:middle line:90%
Ralph Blumenthal was the author.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.530 align:middle line:84%
He was one of the guys
with Leslie Kean who

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:26.260 align:middle line:84%
wrote the article
in December of 2017,

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:27.910 align:middle line:84%
revealing what the
Pentagon was up to.

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:31.330 align:middle line:84%
So they were
already on the track

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:35.290 align:middle line:84%
to be that paper record that was
going to help break this story.

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
anything that, I think,

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.150 align:middle line:84%
can be positive
news about ufology

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:42.670 align:middle line:84%
that's published
by mainstream media

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:44.440 align:middle line:90%
is important and critical.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.420 align:middle line:90%
So keep doing what you're doing.

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:47.740 align:middle line:90%
My gosh.

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: That was
the beauty of it.

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:51.490 align:middle line:90%
And they're still working at it.

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:53.115 align:middle line:84%
Look at the stories
that just came out.

00:22:53.115 --> 00:22:56.140 align:middle line:84%
One came out during the
lockdown that, oh, yeah,

00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:00.880 align:middle line:84%
confirming that the
2017 material was real.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And now they're telling us,
oh, the Navy intelligence

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:04.640 align:middle line:90%
is handling it.

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And now there's going
to be a task force devoted

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:08.710 align:middle line:90%
to studying this?

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Now Kevin Randall tells
me-- great ufologist--

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:15.250 align:middle line:90%
that he thinks it's just a ruse.

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:16.253 align:middle line:90%
I think otherwise.

00:23:16.253 --> 00:23:17.920 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
something going on here.

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.230 align:middle line:84%
I think they want to
tell us something.

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:22.270 align:middle line:90%
They just don't know how.

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: It's a secret that's
been kept for too long.

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And almost everybody
agrees on this.

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And there's been
a lot of pressure

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.440 align:middle line:84%
from inside what you
might call the deep state

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.740 align:middle line:90%
to share the knowledge of it.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:39.610 align:middle line:84%
After all these years
of secrecy, why now?

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: I think
we have a problem.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And the evidence
with the Navy being

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:47.070 align:middle line:84%
buzzed the way they've been
buzzed the last 10, 15 years,

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:48.750 align:middle line:90%
I think we might have a problem.

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you mean by problem?

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: Well, if the world
governments that are usually

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:57.910 align:middle line:84%
dominated by the United States,
if we don't tell our people

00:23:57.910 --> 00:23:58.710 align:middle line:90%
what's going on--

00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:59.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Somebody else is.

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:00.730 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: --ET's going
to do it for us.

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what's happening.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or Putin might.

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:04.080 align:middle line:90%
Or somebody else, right?

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:04.980 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Exactly.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And so we feel
like we're being rushed

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.430 align:middle line:90%
to come out with some answers?

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:10.668 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Yeah.

00:24:10.668 --> 00:24:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think
that's what it is?

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:13.668 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: I think
that's what it is.

00:24:13.668 --> 00:24:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And the smart money
right now says

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:17.270 align:middle line:84%
we might end up with
Congressional hearings

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:18.330 align:middle line:90%
next year.

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:20.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do we
need a task force

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:24.515 align:middle line:84%
when government probably has
known about this for 50 years?

00:24:24.515 --> 00:24:30.510 align:middle line:90%


00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:32.305 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: There was a
lot of compartmental--

00:24:32.305 --> 00:24:33.180 align:middle line:90%
you were in the Navy.

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.933 align:middle line:90%
There's compartmentalization.

00:24:34.933 --> 00:24:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the
left hand doesn't know

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.650 align:middle line:90%
what the right hand's doing.

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:38.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A lot of times.

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:40.860 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: OK, a lot
of times is right.

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And that compartmentalization
has not helped things.

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:48.660 align:middle line:84%
I had several conversations
with Lou D'Allesandro.

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And he indicated that there were
actually people in the Pentagon

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:56.760 align:middle line:84%
that was restricting the
material he was trying

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.700 align:middle line:90%
to get up to Secretary Mattis.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:24:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I believe that.

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: And, again, there
was this idea of that sick,

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:08.730 align:middle line:84%
spoiled, paint-it-with-UFO
brush and no one will pay any

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:09.690 align:middle line:90%
attention to you.

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:11.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
finding that you're

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:14.340 align:middle line:84%
getting more media
attention than you did five,

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:15.210 align:middle line:90%
10 years ago?

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: I've had phone
calls in the past week

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:19.860 align:middle line:84%
from people I never thought I
would get a phone call from.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:23.640 align:middle line:84%
Major, major outlets
calling me and talking to me

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.590 align:middle line:84%
for 60 to 90 minutes,
and asking me

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:28.860 align:middle line:84%
for other contacts
of lead researchers.

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.800 align:middle line:84%
So something's
really percolating.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think that is?

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:34.590 align:middle line:90%
The interest?

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:35.965 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: I think
the buzz is they

00:25:35.965 --> 00:25:39.030 align:middle line:84%
know it's going to be
a big deal next year.

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:40.710 align:middle line:84%
Look, we've got
senators and congressmen

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:43.572 align:middle line:84%
have been getting all the
classified briefings recently.

00:25:43.572 --> 00:25:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we've been
spending money doing it, too.

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:46.170 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Yeah.

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right?

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:49.405 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: And the deal is
a lot of these congressmen

00:25:49.405 --> 00:25:51.030 align:middle line:84%
and senators are
positioning themselves

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:52.488 align:middle line:84%
to be on the right
side of history,

00:25:52.488 --> 00:25:54.090 align:middle line:90%
so to speak, in my estimation.

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:56.140 align:middle line:84%
I lived in DC for
almost 30 years,

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.990 align:middle line:84%
so that's pretty
much the mindset.

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you're where
the smart money is.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the
UFO desk reference

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.557 align:middle line:84%
book, how many cases do
you think are in there?

00:26:04.557 --> 00:26:05.640 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: There's no cases.

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.682 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No cases at all?

00:26:06.682 --> 00:26:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: I've got 146,801
eyewitness accounts.

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:10.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah!

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:12.460 align:middle line:90%
That's what you call "cases."

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Yes.

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:14.740 align:middle line:90%
Eyewitness accounts.

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:17.190 align:middle line:90%
But it's just data.

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:19.420 align:middle line:84%
There's no write-ups about
any of the sightings.

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:20.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's just what it is.

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: It is what, when,
and where, what shape,

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:25.890 align:middle line:90%
and correlating.

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:28.470 align:middle line:84%
In the data, we do yearly
charts for every state.

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:30.030 align:middle line:84%
We did top counties
for every state.

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
conclusion about the case?

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:32.670 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: No.

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:33.360 align:middle line:90%
No cases.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.470 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: It's just purely the
data and where it took us.

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And the version we're
coming out with next year,

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:43.740 align:middle line:84%
which adds 2019 and
2020 to it, will

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:46.590 align:middle line:84%
have a 20-year snapshot
of UFOs in the first part

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:48.810 align:middle line:90%
of 21st century.

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:50.575 align:middle line:84%
And we'll have shape
analysis in that one.

00:26:50.575 --> 00:26:51.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:55.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, what percent do you think
are real cases or eyewitness

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:56.340 align:middle line:90%
accounts?

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: 30%.

00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:58.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 30%.

00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:59.402 align:middle line:90%
All you need is one case.

00:26:59.402 --> 00:27:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Well, let me--

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:00.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You know that.

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:01.590 align:middle line:90%
Just one.

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:02.160 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Just one.

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.618 align:middle line:84%
But let me give you one that
will give you a flavor for it.

00:27:04.618 --> 00:27:07.860 align:middle line:84%
Take that 30% we
were talking about.

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:12.960 align:middle line:84%
Of the 146,800, 30%
would be about 44,000.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.610 align:middle line:90%
Divide that by 18 years.

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:16.140 align:middle line:90%
That gives you about 2,500.

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:17.650 align:middle line:90%
Divided that by 12 months.

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:20.610 align:middle line:90%
That gives you about 216.

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Assuming every state
is treated equally,

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:28.773 align:middle line:84%
and the DC, divide
that 216 by 51.

00:27:28.773 --> 00:27:30.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're getting
about four a state.

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:31.650 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Four a state.

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Essentially one exotic
sighting every week in all 50

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.770 align:middle line:90%
states for the last 18 years.

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:39.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That makes
it sound huge.

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Yeah.

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Doesn't it?

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:41.597 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Yes, it does.

00:27:41.597 --> 00:27:43.500 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually a
very tiny percentage.

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's very
small percentage,

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:45.210 align:middle line:90%
but it makes it big.

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: That's still how big it
is, even when you take only 30%

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:48.990 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:51.198 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you love doing
what you're doing, Cheryl?

00:27:51.198 --> 00:27:52.390 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Oh, it's a blast.

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:53.190 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:54.857 align:middle line:84%

get ahold of you?

>>NOORY: You should.

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:09.490 align:middle line:84%
My gosh, with all these
eyewitness accounts

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:10.290 align:middle line:90%
you've looked at.

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:12.147 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: Well, OK,
we do have a blog.

00:28:12.147 --> 00:28:18.920 align:middle line:84%
It's
www.cherylcosta.com/ufo/blog.

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did all
this data convince you of?

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.580 align:middle line:90%
That something is happening?

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:25.730 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Yes.

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:26.530 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:28.072 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Without a
shadow of a doubt?

00:28:28.072 --> 00:28:29.920 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: Without a
shadow of a doubt.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.670 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot going on.

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:35.638 align:middle line:84%
And as I did read
accounts people had--

00:28:35.638 --> 00:28:37.180 align:middle line:84%
because remember,
I was still writing

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:39.340 align:middle line:90%
articles and everything--

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:42.190 align:middle line:84%
again, it was a lot of
people waking up to it

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:44.440 align:middle line:84%
who said I never
believed in this stuff

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.090 align:middle line:90%
until the other night.

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:47.030 align:middle line:90%
One good example.

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:48.940 align:middle line:84%
There was a guy in
Auburn, New York.

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:55.230 align:middle line:84%
Watched three balls of red
light fly over his house.

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:56.030 align:middle line:90%
He--

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [SPACESHIP SOUND]

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:58.280 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: And he was so excited.

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.920 align:middle line:84%
He turned around to run in
the house to tell his wife,

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.190 align:middle line:90%
and three more came over.

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:02.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:05.073 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: And he literally
said he fell on his butt

00:29:05.073 --> 00:29:06.740 align:middle line:84%
and just laid there,
looking at it.

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:07.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Watching it.

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: And it's
sightings like that.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.655 align:middle line:90%
It just blows people away.

00:29:11.655 --> 00:29:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
of these people

00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:19.090 align:middle line:84%
do you think are making it
up or a little imbalanced?

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:22.740 align:middle line:84%
I hate to put it that way,
but there are some that are.

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: Statistically,
we say maybe--

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:28.500 align:middle line:84%
since we get such big numbers,
statistically, we usually

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.600 align:middle line:84%
estimate somewhere
between 2% and 5%

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:34.260 align:middle line:84%
might be a serious
error or bogus.

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:36.295 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or just lying about it.

00:29:36.295 --> 00:29:37.480 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: We allow for that.

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.870 align:middle line:84%
That's why we do that
30% off the top number

00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:44.760 align:middle line:84%
to show that we're willing to
edit some of this and say 70%

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:48.030 align:middle line:84%
might not be any good, but
this 30% might be golden.

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:49.300 align:middle line:90%
People are always asking me--

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have
to do it that way.

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: Well, sometimes
people will say, well,

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.538 align:middle line:84%
how do you know some
of them are not real?

00:29:55.538 --> 00:29:56.580 align:middle line:90%
And I say, tell you what.

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:58.800 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of golden
needles in that haystack,

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.750 align:middle line:90%
but we don't know which ones.

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:03.600 align:middle line:84%
So statistically
we take that 30%.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And like I said,
Linda and I came down

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:08.160 align:middle line:84%
to the exotic shapes of what
we should be looking at.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got some more
graphs that you've sent us--

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:10.645 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Please, yes.

00:30:10.645 --> 00:30:12.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --based
on specific times.

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:15.100 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at these.

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:15.930 align:middle line:90%
What is this now?

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:18.800 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at UFO
sightings by month?

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Yes.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we learned
about months--

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:23.140 align:middle line:84%
when we were putting
the book together,

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:24.993 align:middle line:84%
Linda looked over the
terminal at me one day

00:30:24.993 --> 00:30:26.660 align:middle line:84%
beside getting all
the charts, and said,

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:28.930 align:middle line:84%
did you notice that
the northern states

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:32.990 align:middle line:84%
were peaking in the center
during July and August?

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And if you move down into
the middle level states,

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.660 align:middle line:90%
it starts flattening out.

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And when you get down to
the deep South states,

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.180 align:middle line:84%
it's like a statistical
picket fence.

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:47.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it seems to
peak by the weather, which

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:49.217 align:middle line:84%
means more people are
outside looking, right?

00:30:49.217 --> 00:30:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: Temperate
weather again, yes.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:51.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Temperate weather.

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:53.080 align:middle line:90%
And you can see it.

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.820 align:middle line:90%
As it gets colder, it goes down.

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:58.880 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: But when you get
up in the northern states,

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.780 align:middle line:84%
the Great Lakes states
and New England states,

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:05.440 align:middle line:90%
it peaks in July and August.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:08.170 align:middle line:84%
The New England states it's
a little higher in September

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:11.020 align:middle line:84%
because people are out
there for leaf season.

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:12.490 align:middle line:90%
But then it falls off.

00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And the statistical number
you have on the ends--

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:18.250 align:middle line:84%
January, February,
March, April, and then

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:20.950 align:middle line:84%
from about October, November,
December-- those numbers

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:23.020 align:middle line:84%
are relatively small
in most states.

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:25.090 align:middle line:84%
Those are the dog
walkers and smokers.

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:28.160 align:middle line:84%
They're out year in,
year out, every day.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.410 align:middle line:90%
They know the lay of the land.

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:31.990 align:middle line:84%
UFO investigators
from MUFON tend

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:34.460 align:middle line:84%
to look at smokers and dog
walkers as reliable observers

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:36.460 align:middle line:84%
because they know the lay
of their neighborhood.

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:37.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you get
a lot of reports

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:40.480 align:middle line:84%
of people who are walking
their dogs witnessing UFOs?

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:41.280 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Yes.

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.468 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a number of
field investigators

00:31:43.468 --> 00:31:45.760 align:middle line:84%
told me when they look at a
month's worth of sightings,

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.580 align:middle line:84%
they search the text
file on smoke and dog.

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:51.552 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at the
next graphic you sent us.

00:31:51.552 --> 00:31:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: Now, this is
by day of the week.

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:54.427 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By day of the week.

00:31:54.427 --> 00:31:55.820 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is unusual.

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:56.630 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Saturday.

00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I had people
like talk show hosts would

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:01.082 align:middle line:84%
get on there and say to me,
well, Saturday night, yeah,

00:32:01.082 --> 00:32:03.980 align:middle line:84%
people get drunk and
everything, and drugs.

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:06.740 align:middle line:84%
People who are drunk and
drugged don't generally

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:08.540 align:middle line:90%
fill out UFO sighting reports.

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:09.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: It's like filling
out a credit application.

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:11.660 align:middle line:90%
It's nasty.

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:13.535 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would simply
say that there's more

00:32:13.535 --> 00:32:14.827 align:middle line:90%
people outside on the weekends.

00:32:14.827 --> 00:32:15.627 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Thank you.

00:32:15.627 --> 00:32:16.580 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly it.

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:19.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are some states
it varies a little bit.

00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:21.860 align:middle line:84%
All the states have
a peak day, depending

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:23.140 align:middle line:90%
upon what state you're in.

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this an
average of the states?

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: This is all
the states together.

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:27.650 align:middle line:90%
But one thing we did discover.

00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Monday night is
never a peak day.

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.660 align:middle line:90%
Monday is never a peak day.

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:33.950 align:middle line:90%
Monday Night Football.

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:34.850 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's outside.

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:35.210 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:37.293 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, there's no
more football this year.

00:32:37.293 --> 00:32:38.280 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Oh.

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But that's intriguing.

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:42.040 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's look at the other one.

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:44.670 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: But we also
dispelled the John Keel thing

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:46.140 align:middle line:90%
that Wednesday was the hot day.

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:48.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, this one here is not
in the desk reference,

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:50.760 align:middle line:84%
but it's going to
be in the next one.

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:53.420 align:middle line:84%
We had to build a special
algorithm to do this.

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is a huge spike.

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:58.770 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: This is hours
of the day, 24 hours.

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:02.950 align:middle line:84%
68% to 74% of the sightings
happen from 5 o'clock at night

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:03.750 align:middle line:90%
to about 11:30.

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:04.630 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Nighttime.

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:05.790 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Nighttime.

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:08.550 align:middle line:84%
Between 8:30 and 10:30 is
the peak, as you can tell.

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that expected?

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: No.

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:11.640 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't expected.

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll notice
how it falls off.

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:17.562 align:middle line:84%
There's a bump about 1
o'clock in the morning,

00:33:17.562 --> 00:33:20.020 align:middle line:84%
and then another bump around
5 or 6 o'clock in the morning.

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:22.395 align:middle line:84%
That's people starting to go
to work, that type of thing.

00:33:22.395 --> 00:33:24.720 align:middle line:84%
Notice morning drives, 7 or
8 o'clock in the morning,

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:25.800 align:middle line:90%
it dips down.

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.480 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't
really pick up again

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.675 align:middle line:84%
until people are starting
to get off of work.

00:33:29.675 --> 00:33:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That looks like
my radio audience ratings.

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:32.440 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: There you go.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHS]

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:36.210 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: Now, something we
found out with these bumps--

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:40.860 align:middle line:84%
if you did this chart just
for Nevada, particularly

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Clark County, there's
a bump at 1 o'clock,

00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:46.360 align:middle line:84%
2 o'clock, and 4 o'clock, when
the clubs and casinos let out.

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:48.090 align:middle line:84%
If you go to Arkansas,
there's a bump

00:33:48.090 --> 00:33:49.680 align:middle line:90%
at 3 o'clock and 5 o'clock.

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And the farmers
all came up to me

00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:53.653 align:middle line:84%
at the Arkansas UFO
Conference and said,

00:33:53.653 --> 00:33:54.570 align:middle line:90%
we're chicken farmers.

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:57.098 align:middle line:84%
That's when we prep our
birds to go to market,

00:33:57.098 --> 00:33:58.140 align:middle line:90%
3 o'clock in the morning.

00:33:58.140 --> 00:33:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was that
the Ozark UFO thing?

00:33:59.400 --> 00:33:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Yes.

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good people there.

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:01.487 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Great people.

00:34:01.487 --> 00:34:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at our last graphic.

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:07.250 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Now, this is this year.

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:10.130 align:middle line:90%
The blue ones are 2014.

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:12.260 align:middle line:90%
The orange ones are 2020.

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.179 align:middle line:84%
And you can see this
is the best year we've

00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:18.440 align:middle line:90%
had since 2014 by comparison.

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:19.353 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing year.

00:34:19.353 --> 00:34:20.270 align:middle line:90%
2020 is a bumper year.

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:22.842 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what does
this have to do with COVID?

00:34:22.842 --> 00:34:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Well, look at April.

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:24.650 align:middle line:90%
Look at April.

00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:25.804 align:middle line:90%
Again, that 1,000 thing.

00:34:25.804 --> 00:34:27.679 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, when it
started peaking there.

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:29.679 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: And March was
already starting to peak.

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:31.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But then it goes down.

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:34.383 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: Well, again, we don't
understand why it went down,

00:34:34.383 --> 00:34:36.800 align:middle line:84%
other than it may have been
just the fact that people were

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.540 align:middle line:84%
starting to focus on
getting back to work

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:39.708 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:34:39.708 --> 00:34:41.000 align:middle line:90%
That's what we figure happened.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.719 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or maybe the UFOs
actually didn't show up.

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:45.840 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:47.010 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: That's possible.

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's one other
thing it could be.

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.650 align:middle line:84%
What if some of those ones
that people were seeing

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:55.480 align:middle line:84%
were misidentified
commercial aircraft?

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly we're not
flying during the peak--

00:34:57.450 --> 00:34:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're not
flying that much.

00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:58.710 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: We're not
flying that much.

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:03.058 align:middle line:84%
But there were huge amounts of
sightings right after 9/11 too.

00:35:03.058 --> 00:35:04.350 align:middle line:90%
And we were shut down for what?

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:05.150 align:middle line:90%
10 days?

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:06.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:09.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe they wanted
to check in on us.

00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Perhaps.

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:17.330 align:middle line:84%
But my attitude on it is that
it never ceases to surprise me.

00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Something surprises
me all the time.

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does this
data tell you overall,

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:24.630 align:middle line:84%
when you look at it
as a complete picture?

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: If I ever had
any doubt, I don't now.

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of?

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: We have a presence
not from around here.

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:37.410 align:middle line:84%
We have an off-world
presence with us.

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's the bottom
line conclusion.

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:44.100 align:middle line:84%
When I saw my first
sighting, I was watching it.

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.210 align:middle line:84%
It was like a silver
ball in the sky.

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:47.160 align:middle line:90%
I was 12 years old.

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And I got up in the back
window of our Chevy Impala

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:51.460 align:middle line:84%
as my father turned to
car to go towards home.

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:52.710 align:middle line:90%
And I was watching that thing.

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:53.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did he see it too?

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:54.300 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: He saw it.

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:54.960 align:middle line:90%
My mother saw it.

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.370 align:middle line:84%
They pointed it out
to me and told me

00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:57.750 align:middle line:90%
it might be a weather balloon.

00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:58.980 align:middle line:84%
It might be something
NASA's doing.

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:00.438 align:middle line:84%
Might be people
from another world,

00:36:00.438 --> 00:36:02.075 align:middle line:90%
my mother explained to me.

00:36:02.075 --> 00:36:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I crawled up in the
back window of that car.

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And I was watching that
little silver ball out there

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:07.713 align:middle line:90%
and wondering, who are you guys?

00:36:07.713 --> 00:36:08.760 align:middle line:90%
Who are you guys?

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And when it decided to leave,
it was [SNAPS] like that.

00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:13.830 align:middle line:90%
Changes you.

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:18.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever go outside
on a night, look into the sky,

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.720 align:middle line:90%
and will for them to show up?

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:20.520 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Yes.

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I used to do that
as a kid all the time.

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:24.120 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Yes.

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:26.610 align:middle line:84%
We had a clairvoyant
kid in my high school.

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And he used to be
able to call them.

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they show up?

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:33.530 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Yeah, they did.

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:34.697 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's pretty good.

00:36:34.697 --> 00:36:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: Flying
at treetop level.

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.270 align:middle line:90%
He did that once.

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:41.050 align:middle line:84%
We were all on a front porch,
about sunset type of thing.

00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:42.370 align:middle line:90%
He says, I can call them.

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And we all laughed
and everything.

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:44.700 align:middle line:90%
And he says, watch.

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And he went down and did
this meditation thing.

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:47.600 align:middle line:90%
And he says, there.

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:48.620 align:middle line:90%
They're going to come.

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:50.000 align:middle line:90%
And we all went, yeah, yeah, OK.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.350 align:middle line:90%
And we all went home.

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And the next morning,
the newspaper

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:55.430 align:middle line:84%
reported that there
were sightings 10 or 11

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:58.283 align:middle line:84%
o'clock that night at treetop
level in our neighborhood.

00:36:58.283 --> 00:37:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
recommend, Cheryl, people

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:03.567 align:middle line:84%
do if they're still
skittish of filing reports?

00:37:03.567 --> 00:37:04.400 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Well, look.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:08.330 align:middle line:84%
National UFO Reporting
Center, even MUFON, you

00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:09.930 align:middle line:90%
don't have to leave your name.

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:10.730 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to.

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:12.897 align:middle line:84%
You can log the report and
give all the information.

00:37:12.897 --> 00:37:14.480 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
put your name if you

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:16.337 align:middle line:90%
want to be totally anonymous.

00:37:16.337 --> 00:37:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, they'll
take the information.

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: They'll
take the information.

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:20.060 align:middle line:90%
It's all online.

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:21.680 align:middle line:84%
You push the button to
send, and it'll take it.

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.097 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's got
more credibility

00:37:23.097 --> 00:37:24.290 align:middle line:90%
if you leave your name.

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:27.072 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: They do like to talk
to you if it's something that

00:37:27.072 --> 00:37:28.280 align:middle line:90%
really piques their interest.

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:31.940 align:middle line:84%
I know National UFO Reporting
Center, Pete Davenport,

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:34.850 align:middle line:84%
they do like to reach out
and ask a few questions now

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:36.710 align:middle line:90%
and then.

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:39.530 align:middle line:84%
They've had people give
them additional information.

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:42.350 align:middle line:84%
But there are people who
are really, really concerned

00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:44.600 align:middle line:84%
about being painted
with that stigma brush

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.308 align:middle line:84%
and don't want the
notoriety of it.

00:37:46.308 --> 00:37:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we still
getting eyewitness accounts

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:50.063 align:middle line:84%
from pilots and
people like that?

00:37:50.063 --> 00:37:51.230 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Yeah, all the time.

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Those
are great reports.

00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:54.582 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: All the time
they're getting them.

00:37:54.582 --> 00:37:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And Lou D'Allesandro told
me for the most part,

00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:59.743 align:middle line:84%
they're not loitering
around our stateside bases.

00:37:59.743 --> 00:38:02.160 align:middle line:84%
They're loitering around where
our advanced technology is,

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.950 align:middle line:84%
and that's usually
in the fleets.

00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When the late astronaut
Edgar Mitchell, Apollo 14,

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:12.500 align:middle line:84%
told me we're being visited,
that's all I needed.

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:15.800 align:middle line:84%
I've always been looking at
this since I was a teenager.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:20.870 align:middle line:84%
But when Edgar Mitchell said,
George, we're being visited,

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:23.210 align:middle line:90%
I went, my God!

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:24.740 align:middle line:90%
This was an astronaut!

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:26.180 align:middle line:90%
He was on the moon!

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And he's telling me
we're being visited?

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:29.720 align:middle line:90%
So then I asked him.

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:31.670 align:middle line:90%
Edgar, did you see anything?

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:33.290 align:middle line:90%
No, I never have.

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:35.060 align:middle line:90%
Well, how do you know then?

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm told by people
higher up in government

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:40.940 align:middle line:84%
that we're being visited,
and I believe them.

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:42.770 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
he told me, Cheryl.

00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: A very popular remote
viewing target happens to be--

00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:49.430 align:middle line:84%
again, these cards
are done anonymously

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:51.950 align:middle line:84%
for remote viewing class,
that type of thing--

00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:55.170 align:middle line:84%
is visit the alien base on
the back side of the moon.

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep.

00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:56.940 align:middle line:90%
Ingo Swann did that.

00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:57.740 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Yes.

00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:01.418 align:middle line:84%
And I've had six classes of
remote viewers for the last 20

00:39:01.418 --> 00:39:02.960 align:middle line:84%
years, and they've
all visited there.

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And the first
impression they have

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:05.595 align:middle line:84%
when they come
out of the trance,

00:39:05.595 --> 00:39:07.610 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, of
working it, they say,

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:12.230 align:middle line:84%
boy, whoever those folks were,
they didn't want us there.

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:13.750 align:middle line:90%
That is a very common remark.

00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:15.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe that's
why we never went back.

00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: That seems to
lend credence to why

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:19.870 align:middle line:90%
we didn't go back.

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the next
project for you, Cheryl?

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:27.735 align:middle line:10%
>>COSTA: The "2021 UFO Sightings
Desk Reference, Enhanced."

00:39:27.735 --> 00:39:29.360 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You're going
to do that again.

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:29.580 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:30.913 align:middle line:10%
>>COSTA: We're going to do that.

00:39:30.913 --> 00:39:33.560 align:middle line:10%
Plus we're coming out
with a five-book series

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:38.130 align:middle line:10%
on shape analysis, doing it
by the triangles, boomerangs,

00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:40.505 align:middle line:10%
and diamonds, the circles,
the balls, that kind of thing.

00:39:40.505 --> 00:39:42.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The size also as well?

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:43.580 align:middle line:90%
Some are bigger than smaller?

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>>COSTA: No, we're not
worried about size.

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:47.630 align:middle line:84%
We're worried about the
configurations and the shapes.

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:49.730 align:middle line:84%
Five different sets
of configurations.

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
have a separate book

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:52.710 align:middle line:90%
on each one of them.

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be able to
drill right down to the county

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:57.227 align:middle line:84%
level for every
single one of them.

00:39:57.227 --> 00:39:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating work.

00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:58.820 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:39:58.820 --> 00:39:59.240 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: It's fun.

00:39:59.240 --> 00:39:59.660 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Good to have
you on "Beyond Belief."

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:01.490 align:middle line:90%
>>COSTA: Thank you.

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:02.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
there you have it.

00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:05.240 align:middle line:10%
A true investigator
who's giving us

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:08.030 align:middle line:10%
great information about UFOs.

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:12.050 align:middle line:10%
And as she said, 30% of
the eyewitness accounts

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:13.880 align:middle line:10%
are pretty darn credible.

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:16.310 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:19.660 align:middle line:90%
