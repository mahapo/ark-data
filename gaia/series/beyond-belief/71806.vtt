00:00:05.264 --> 00:00:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.888 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.888 --> 00:00:10.634 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.634 --> 00:00:13.240 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.175 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:19.250 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:26.672 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.672 --> 00:00:28.630 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
back to another edition

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.421 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:29.421 --> 00:00:32.439 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and we've
got a very fascinating program

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.050 align:middle line:10%
for you tonight-- an the
Earth-energy catalyst.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.530 align:middle line:10%
Now, you might be seeing
what the heck is that?

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.870 align:middle line:90%
Kelly S. Jones with us.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:40.890 align:middle line:90%
Kelly, what is that?

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.330 align:middle line:90%
What's an Earth-energy catalyst?

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY S. JONES:
Well, I utilize

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.750 align:middle line:84%
a system that's
called feng shui.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.710 align:middle line:10%
It's an art and a science that
the ancient sages brilliantly

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:00.100 align:middle line:10%
understood how to understand,
interpret, and affect

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.330 align:middle line:10%
how the Earth's environment
affects human fortune, so

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.010 align:middle line:10%
mankind.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.580 align:middle line:10%
So they studied and understood
the universal laws and laws

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.330 align:middle line:10%
of nature and with that
were able to interpret

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.890 align:middle line:10%
how mountains, waterways,
our structures, how we orient

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.680 align:middle line:10%
ourself in space actually
affects our experience.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And so there's an
umbrella, if you

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.780 align:middle line:84%
will, where the
cliche of feng shui

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.530 align:middle line:84%
says improve your health,
wealth, and happiness,

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.400 align:middle line:84%
because they've
devised a system that

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.380 align:middle line:84%
allows us to understand
how exactly to do that.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you actually go
into houses and say, folks,

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.907 align:middle line:90%
you've got to move the couch.

00:01:37.907 --> 00:01:38.573 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Indeed.

00:01:38.573 --> 00:01:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got
to move the bed.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.910 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:41.890 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Absolutely.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Actually, one of my clients,
that's exactly what I did.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.640 align:middle line:84%
I went in the living
room, and I flipped it,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.620 align:middle line:84%
and I went in the
bedroom, and I flipped it.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.995 align:middle line:84%
And in less than
three weeks, she

00:01:48.995 --> 00:01:50.910 align:middle line:84%
said I haven't slept
better since I've

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.640 align:middle line:90%
been here for two years.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's a matter of not only
looking at what the eyes see,

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.840 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.320 align:middle line:84%
So that's one
level of feng shui.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.760 align:middle line:84%
It's called form, and it
interprets how what we see

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.474 align:middle line:90%
influences our experience.

00:02:04.474 --> 00:02:05.390 align:middle line:90%
There's another level.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.310 align:middle line:90%
It's called compass.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And actually, that's the
luo pan I use, which--

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:09.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Look at this, guys.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.983 align:middle line:10%
>>JONES: Yeah.

00:02:09.983 --> 00:02:11.930 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I'll hold it up here.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:12.870 align:middle line:90%
What does this do?

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.150 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: So the luo pan,
one of its main functions

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.397 align:middle line:84%
is to help me know what the
compass orientation of a space

00:02:18.397 --> 00:02:18.900 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.830 align:middle line:10%
So with that, when a space
was actually constructed--

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.300 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You actually walk
around with this like that?

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: I do.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.800 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.300 align:middle line:10%
And with a floor plan,
these pieces of information

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.400 align:middle line:10%
create what's called
an energy chart.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.800 align:middle line:10%
It's like an astrology
chart for a space.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.340 align:middle line:10%
And it reveals to
me unseen energy.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.680 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I brought a
little prop, another prop,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.420 align:middle line:90%
shall we say.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.546 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Another prop.

00:02:40.546 --> 00:02:41.254 align:middle line:90%
What is this one?

00:02:41.254 --> 00:02:42.480 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: This is a prism.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.980 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Heavy little thing.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.290 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: --it was a
gift from a friend.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And I've been doing feng shui
for almost 15 years or longer.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And when I received that
a couple of years ago,

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.470 align:middle line:84%
and I'm looking at this
amazing spectrum of color come

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.780 align:middle line:84%
from that, there
is this realization

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.510 align:middle line:84%
that by using the
objects in our space,

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.530 align:middle line:84%
by using how we place
ourself in an environment,

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.352 align:middle line:84%
we activate and bring
forth the unseen energy.

00:03:13.352 --> 00:03:15.810 align:middle line:84%
So we don't walk around seeing
the spectrum of color that's

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:16.684 align:middle line:90%
all around us, right?

00:03:16.684 --> 00:03:17.980 align:middle line:90%
We use an object.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.855 align:middle line:84%
We put a prism so that
we can actually see it.

00:03:20.855 --> 00:03:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And find it.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:22.896 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: And it was amazing.

00:03:22.896 --> 00:03:24.980 align:middle line:90%
It was like, that's what I do.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.940 align:middle line:10%
I bring forth the
potential of a space

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.850 align:middle line:10%
through how we orient ourself in
the space, how we use the five

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.680 align:middle line:10%
elements that the Chinese
related everything to.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.630 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How did
the ancient Chinese

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.220 align:middle line:10%
find out about feng shui?

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.150 align:middle line:90%
How did they know this?

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: Well, actually,
it started supposedly

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.430 align:middle line:84%
with Yin House feng shui, which
is that they actually set up

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.110 align:middle line:84%
a grave site in
such a dynamic way

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.640 align:middle line:84%
that when their ancestors
were on the other side,

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.220 align:middle line:90%
they would bless them.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.084 align:middle line:84%
And then it became
important to recognize--

00:04:01.084 --> 00:04:03.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look at the terms
"feng shui," it literally means

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.930 align:middle line:90%
"wind and water."

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.540 align:middle line:84%
So there's the heaven
aspect, which is wind.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And what the wind
does is it carries qi.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.790 align:middle line:90%
It carries energy.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.660 align:middle line:90%
But we need protection.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's not enough that the
energy is being carried.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.470 align:middle line:84%
We then want to bring in
the Earth energy, which

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.120 align:middle line:84%
is the water aspect, which says
we want to contain and hold

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.000 align:middle line:90%
the energy.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.137 align:middle line:84%
So human nature is to want to
be protected and to be nurtured.

00:04:28.137 --> 00:04:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: So I love
using an example

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.040 align:middle line:84%
of like when we
get on an elevator.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Human nature is not to
walk on the elevator

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.920 align:middle line:90%
and put our back to the door.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.660 align:middle line:84%
We naturally go in, and
we want to sit comfortably

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:42.966 align:middle line:90%
with our back to the wall.

00:04:42.966 --> 00:04:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you very
rarely talk to anybody.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Well, that, too.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.794 align:middle line:84%
That we can work on at another
level, the human level of--

00:04:49.794 --> 00:04:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
ever noticed how

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.560 align:middle line:90%
people do walk on an elevator?

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.970 align:middle line:90%
They kind of move to the back--

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:55.275 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Exactly.

00:04:55.275 --> 00:04:56.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --with
their back there.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: So that's
natural, right?

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.055 align:middle line:90%
We want to be protected

00:04:58.055 --> 00:04:58.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's
a natural thing.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.012 align:middle line:10%
And they just don't want to
look at the other person.

00:05:01.012 --> 00:05:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: Unless you're
on the elevator with me.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, then
I'll look at you.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: I start talking
and welcome people.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.402 align:middle line:84%
So our environment, very much
we can reflect human nature

00:05:12.402 --> 00:05:13.860 align:middle line:84%
through the
environment where, when

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.120 align:middle line:84%
we set up a home, for
example, because you

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.400 align:middle line:84%
can use feng shui
to set up a site.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.670 align:middle line:84%
We like to sit it
deep, let's say,

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.640 align:middle line:84%
with a mountain energy
behind us like a wall.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.430 align:middle line:84%
So we put that mountain
energy behind us.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.910 align:middle line:84%
We put a big open--
what's called

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.050 align:middle line:90%
a ming tang in front of us.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.490 align:middle line:90%
It's an open space.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's where water
carries energy to us

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.800 align:middle line:84%
so that it's life
giving, life supporting.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And as we humans align
with our intentions

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.380 align:middle line:84%
and what it is we desire
to experience in life,

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.510 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Chinese
have devised a system

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.180 align:middle line:84%
to say feng shui is the first
tool that will positively

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.840 align:middle line:90%
affect our destiny and our luck.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And in that, we can
improve the experience,

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.810 align:middle line:84%
amplify the prosperity
we can experience.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.280 align:middle line:10%
And in times that
are more challenging,

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.515 align:middle line:10%
we can minimize the
draw, if you will,

00:06:06.515 --> 00:06:09.590 align:middle line:10%
the lag, the drag of life.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.820 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How does
somebody know to call you?

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:13.590 align:middle line:90%
How do they know--

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: Yeah, that's
a great question.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.326 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --there's
something wrong here.

00:06:16.326 --> 00:06:17.574 align:middle line:90%
We're out of balance.

00:06:17.574 --> 00:06:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: And that's perfect.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:19.900 align:middle line:90%
It is about balance.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.922 align:middle line:84%
And so there are
many varying degrees.

00:06:23.922 --> 00:06:25.630 align:middle line:84%
So somebody might call
me because they're

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:26.962 align:middle line:90%
looking to select a home.

00:06:26.962 --> 00:06:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Somebody might call
because they're

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.211 align:middle line:84%
looking to actually
build a site or they're

00:06:30.211 --> 00:06:32.782 align:middle line:90%
working on a floor plan.

00:06:32.782 --> 00:06:35.240 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with many companies
where they just have a box,

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.820 align:middle line:84%
and they're looking to set out
where do the offices go, where

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.710 align:middle line:84%
does the main door
go, so that you

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.850 align:middle line:84%
set up the energy from
the beginning correct,

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.360 align:middle line:84%
but you could be somewhere
also for 10 years

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.050 align:middle line:84%
and just recognize things aren't
happening the way you want.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Maybe your health
is deteriorating.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.220 align:middle line:84%
Maybe relationships
are being challenged.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.490 align:middle line:84%
There's one energy
system, for example,

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:05.470 align:middle line:84%
that creates emotional,
legal disharmony, and when

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:09.210 align:middle line:84%
we activate it inappropriately,
again it's an unseen energy

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.080 align:middle line:84%
that we can use the
physical world to affect it,

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.250 align:middle line:84%
and we can minimize its
effect or we can amplify it.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.060 align:middle line:84%
So when we don't
understand what's

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.290 align:middle line:84%
happening in our environment and
we go and accidentally amplify

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:26.460 align:middle line:84%
it, then it can trigger
unfavorable experiences.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And the system I
use allows me to see

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.420 align:middle line:84%
what is it that
you're activating

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.680 align:middle line:84%
and how you're activating
your environment

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.660 align:middle line:84%
because everything's alive,
everything's interconnected,

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.130 align:middle line:84%
and everything is
constantly changing as well.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.489 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So activating
energy may not always

00:07:41.489 --> 00:07:42.530 align:middle line:90%
be the best thing, right?

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:43.571 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: That is correct.

00:07:43.571 --> 00:07:44.500 align:middle line:90%
Right, so--

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.099 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:45.640 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Yes.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.700 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what do you think,
in your experience, Kelly,

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.880 align:middle line:84%
would be the most important
thing about feng shui

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.370 align:middle line:84%
with an individual-- the
placement of his bed?

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: I would have
to back up to say--

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:04.589 align:middle line:84%
to recognize our space
actually affects us.

00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:06.755 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I started, it
was like my environment--

00:08:06.755 --> 00:08:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And a lot of
people wouldn't know that.

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:08.405 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: --is
doing what-- right.

00:08:08.405 --> 00:08:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And as the years
have gone by, it's

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.270 align:middle line:84%
to realize that
everything of Earth

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:18.540 align:middle line:84%
is what clothes us, it
feeds us, it houses us,

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.690 align:middle line:84%
it supports us with the
objects in our environment.

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.640 align:middle line:84%
So everything around
us is the Earth energy.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.240 align:middle line:90%
So everything is influencing us.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.950 align:middle line:84%
One level that you're
actually speaking to

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:34.070 align:middle line:84%
might be more of a psychological
aspect, too, a human level,

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:37.630 align:middle line:84%
where we start putting on a new
pair of glasses, so to speak.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And by putting on a feng
shui pair of glasses,

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.980 align:middle line:84%
we start looking at the
energetic influence and what

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.180 align:middle line:84%
something says to our
hearts in our environment.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:52.270 align:middle line:84%
For example, I had a client
where she had flowers,

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.600 align:middle line:84%
three flowers upside
down as a wedding gift.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And I just asked, what
does that mean to you?

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.930 align:middle line:90%
What does that look like to you?

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And she was like, oh,
very happy about it.

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, is it possible
there's a hidden relationship,

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.630 align:middle line:84%
and that's looking
to be exposed?

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:08.459 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:09:08.459 --> 00:09:09.625 align:middle line:90%
You mean like somebody else?

00:09:09.625 --> 00:09:10.619 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Yeah.

00:09:10.619 --> 00:09:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Woo!

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:11.970 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: And it was real.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And she
just got married?

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.683 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: It wasn't her marriage.

00:09:14.683 --> 00:09:16.670 align:middle line:90%
Thank God.

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:22.560 align:middle line:84%
But our environment is like
the subconscious to us.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And so when we're wanting to
have different experiences

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:30.310 align:middle line:84%
in our life, it is beneficial
to walk around our space

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and ask ourselves, what
does this convey to me?

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Is it really representative
of who I want to become

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.610 align:middle line:90%
and who I'm intending to be?

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:41.740 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times we
decorate our space,

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.360 align:middle line:84%
and the decorations
are 5, 10 years old,

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.750 align:middle line:84%
or they're not matching
our intention for today.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:49.020 align:middle line:84%
So at that simple
level, we can do

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:53.190 align:middle line:84%
a lot of benefit for ourselves
without even hiring a feng shui

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:54.520 align:middle line:90%
consultant.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever gone
into a house and went whoa!

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Oh, yes.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was just
totally topsy-turvy.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: And the experience
of those living in it

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.900 align:middle line:84%
reflected exactly what
I saw energetically.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting when you
ask what's most important.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:13.500 align:middle line:84%
It really would depend on
the experience one's having.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.890 align:middle line:84%
If their health is fine,
and relationships are great,

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:18.280 align:middle line:84%
and it's more about
prosperity, career,

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.030 align:middle line:84%
what's happening at
that level, then we're

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.966 align:middle line:90%
going to focus there.

00:10:20.966 --> 00:10:22.090 align:middle line:90%
It might be the front door.

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:22.970 align:middle line:90%
It might be the living room.

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:23.970 align:middle line:90%
It might be the kitchen.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:26.860 align:middle line:84%
What's happening in the living
spaces and the interaction

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:31.430 align:middle line:84%
and the threshold between here,
let's say, and the outer world.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the living space
the first thing you look at?

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: I actually
look at it as a whole.

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.540 align:middle line:84%
I call what I do
mental gymnastics

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:42.530 align:middle line:84%
because I'm constantly looking
at multiple layers and levels

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:43.790 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:48.820 align:middle line:84%
So there's heaven, human, and
Earth energy, so the-- well,

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.090 align:middle line:84%
that just kind of brings
me to this, for example.

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:53.380 align:middle line:84%
So this is called Four
Pillars of Destiny.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.530 align:middle line:90%
That's one's heaven energy.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:58.400 align:middle line:10%
And it's the astrology
of the individual, which

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.940 align:middle line:10%
to me one of the most
fascinating things with feng

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:02.490 align:middle line:10%
shui.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:04.390 align:middle line:10%
And I've not seen this
in any other system--

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:09.010 align:middle line:10%
doesn't mean it doesn't exist--
is that our birth chart has

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:13.250 align:middle line:10%
a direct relationship
to time and space.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:15.860 align:middle line:84%
So based on our
astrology, I can look

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:19.280 align:middle line:84%
at one and their environment
to see how the two overlay

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.390 align:middle line:90%
and interact.

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:23.140 align:middle line:84%
So you might be, let's
say, a front door

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:26.330 align:middle line:84%
is activating what they call
a big consumer direction.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:27.917 align:middle line:84%
And that big
consumer direction is

00:11:27.917 --> 00:11:29.750 align:middle line:84%
saying you're spending
a lot of time, money,

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.550 align:middle line:84%
and energy attempting
to achieve that which

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:36.820 align:middle line:84%
could be easier,
come more gracefully,

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:40.940 align:middle line:84%
and flow in one's life if
that door wasn't there.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you want to
do me with my birth chart?

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:49.020 align:middle line:10%
>>JONES: Well, actually what I
did was I brought a sample one,

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:53.370 align:middle line:10%
so it's actually not you,
but this astrology chart,

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:57.860 align:middle line:10%
for example, this-- well, let me
back up because most people are

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.780 align:middle line:10%
used to going to a
Chinese restaurant.

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: And on the-- it's
I'm this year of the snake,

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.460 align:middle line:84%
or I'm the year of a horse,
or I'm a year of something,

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:06.450 align:middle line:90%
but it's not enough.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:08.470 align:middle line:84%
There's actually--
when we go deeper

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:11.970 align:middle line:84%
into the astrology chart,
it's called the Day Master.

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:16.740 align:middle line:84%
So every moment in time is
identified by five elements.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And that permeates feng
shui, it permeates the body,

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:25.900 align:middle line:84%
it identifies one's
elemental makeup, structure.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.200 align:middle line:84%
So when people get
along, the elements

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.430 align:middle line:90%
are communicating well.

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:32.837 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that could
happen by accident, right?

00:12:32.837 --> 00:12:33.420 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Sure.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, what do you
mean by by accident?

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's say someone
is not practicing feng shui,

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.300 align:middle line:84%
but everything's
working for them.

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:43.930 align:middle line:90%
Everything's clicking along.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:47.651 align:middle line:84%
May they have stumbled
into the right makeup

00:12:47.651 --> 00:12:48.650 align:middle line:90%
and didn't even know it?

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:50.100 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Right, right.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:54.440 align:middle line:84%
So the way the Chinese
speak of the five successes

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.730 align:middle line:90%
of one's life is first destiny.

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:59.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's what destiny chart
did you come in with.

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.120 align:middle line:90%
Second is luck.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.080 align:middle line:84%
So to the Chinese, luck is not
about being in the right place

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.360 align:middle line:90%
at the right time.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.270 align:middle line:84%
It's an overriding energy
system of which we ride through.

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:12.560 align:middle line:84%
So those two they
say are unchangeable.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.140 align:middle line:84%
We don't change
them, but we can use

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:18.490 align:middle line:84%
feng shui, which is the
third, to positively impact

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:19.750 align:middle line:90%
one's destiny and luck.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.360 align:middle line:10%
So it may not change it,
but it will bring one

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.660 align:middle line:10%
into greater harmony
and alignment to it.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:30.170 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What is it about the
planet that creates this energy

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:35.920 align:middle line:10%
to allow people to
tap into feng shui?

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.260 align:middle line:90%
There's something out there.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.070 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: Well, there's
actually a connection

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.590 align:middle line:90%
with-- it's the ladle, actually.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:48.770 align:middle line:84%
When we look planetarily,
interplanetarily, if you will,

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:53.620 align:middle line:84%
that allows us to
discern time, direction.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Those two pieces of
information allow

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:59.590 align:middle line:84%
us to create what's called
a Flying Star Chart.

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:01.590 align:middle line:90%
It's an astrology chart.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:05.130 align:middle line:10%
And so those two
pieces of information

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:10.650 align:middle line:10%
give us these unseen energetics
as to how an environment is

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:14.860 align:middle line:10%
specifically influencing
you, let's say, versus me.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:15.975 align:middle line:10%
It could be different.

00:14:15.975 --> 00:14:18.100 align:middle line:10%
So we might have a different
experience in a space.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.590 align:middle line:10%
So it's not a cookie cutter.

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:21.470 align:middle line:10%
It's not a one size fits all.

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:23.790 align:middle line:10%
So even one's
astrology chart then

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:26.160 align:middle line:10%
says you have a special
relationship with the space,

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.840 align:middle line:10%
and what can I do to attune that
environment to you specifically

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:34.220 align:middle line:10%
that might be different
than another person.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:39.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does this magnify
human magnetics, let's say?

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.040 align:middle line:84%
I've always believed
that magnetism

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.320 align:middle line:90%
is involved in everything we do.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not generally a piece of
metal and a piece of metal,

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:51.050 align:middle line:84%
that it has to do with
emotion, and relationships,

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:51.990 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:55.130 align:middle line:84%
You're either magnetic
together, or you're not.

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:56.544 align:middle line:90%
Does this enhance that?

00:14:56.544 --> 00:14:58.460 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: So when I take
a compass measurement,

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.602 align:middle line:84%
it's actually taking the
magnetic direction, which

00:15:01.602 --> 00:15:03.810 align:middle line:84%
is different, let's say,
than an architect would use.

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:06.160 align:middle line:84%
They'd use true north
instead of magnetic north,

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.340 align:middle line:84%
so it is absolutely
based on magnetics.

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And we are magnetic,
electromagnetic beings.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And so we have
energy fields which

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:15.480 align:middle line:84%
is a composite of
the five elements.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And we're in relationship
to Earth energy,

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.920 align:middle line:84%
which is also a composite
of the five elements.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.439 align:middle line:10%
So it's how do the two
marry, how do they bridge,

00:15:22.439 --> 00:15:24.230 align:middle line:10%
and how do they
communicate, and how can we

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:28.690 align:middle line:10%
best create a communication
device, if you will,

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:31.620 align:middle line:10%
through placement, through
colors, through shapes,

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:36.840 align:middle line:10%
through our use of
space to amplify

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.420 align:middle line:10%
what it is you're intending.

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.510 align:middle line:84%
So then we're bringing
in another dimension

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:43.785 align:middle line:84%
of our beingness, which says
I want to magnetically attract

00:15:43.785 --> 00:15:44.680 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm now focusing in
a certain direction

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:49.140 align:middle line:90%
to call forth this experience.

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:51.130 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes it's interesting.

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:54.730 align:middle line:84%
A client will call, and they're
saying they want one thing,

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:56.795 align:middle line:84%
but there's something in
between what they want

00:15:56.795 --> 00:15:59.420 align:middle line:84%
and where they're at, and that's
the piece that gets addressed.

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they may
not know what they want.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.028 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Exactly.

00:16:01.028 --> 00:16:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And that that's the piece
that actually gets addressed.

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And once that's
aligned and shifted,

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:08.650 align:middle line:84%
then the magnetic
attraction-- as you call it--

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:12.580 align:middle line:84%
that they're looking to actually
call forth is available.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you
just cited an example.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:18.160 align:middle line:84%
It took a couple weeks for
someone, but it changed.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Do you see that kind of
change almost immediately?

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:23.450 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Oh, it depends.

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:24.970 align:middle line:90%
It varies all over the place.

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:26.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because I'm sure
you do followups, right?

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:27.328 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Oh sure.

00:16:27.328 --> 00:16:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And some people
want to-- they just

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:33.951 align:middle line:84%
respond that it's like
everything just feels better.

00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:35.700 align:middle line:84%
Friends come over, and
it's just like they

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:36.560 align:middle line:90%
don't know what happened.

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's the whole,
if you will, the secret.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:38.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And everybody
senses, it, right?

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:39.970 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Exactly.

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:40.590 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:42.200 align:middle line:90%
Because we're energy beings.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.940 align:middle line:10%
So we actually
sense and feel what

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.490 align:middle line:10%
is happening and transpiring
around us, even if we can't put

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:50.110 align:middle line:10%
our finger on it, even if we
can't define it or describe it,

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:52.833 align:middle line:10%
but we experience it.

00:16:52.833 --> 00:16:54.583 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You've heard
of psychic vampires.

00:16:54.583 --> 00:16:55.270 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Yes.

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:58.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People
who are negative,

00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:59.560 align:middle line:90%
they have negative energy.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.830 align:middle line:90%
They draw from you.

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:05.119 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that their
personal feng shui--

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:06.160 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Inner feng shui.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --in their
body is out of whack?

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.040 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Sure.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:10.540 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:12.139 align:middle line:84%
I would call that
the inner feng shui.

00:17:12.139 --> 00:17:14.472 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, what we're doing
is aligning the outer feng

00:17:14.472 --> 00:17:16.250 align:middle line:90%
shui and the inner feng shui.

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.491 align:middle line:84%
And if you fix that, you
change their whole life.

00:17:20.491 --> 00:17:22.240 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: And that's
where I actually look.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.300 align:middle line:84%
I call feng shui
divining the Earth.

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And something else I offer
is called Akashic Records

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Consultations, and that's
unearthing the divine within.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.400 align:middle line:90%


00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.887 align:middle line:84%
This is a very intimate
process for people, and so--

00:17:40.887 --> 00:17:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at some
pictures you brought us, OK?

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: Oh, sure,
sure, that I brought.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are we
looking at here, Kelly?

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:48.280 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Oh, the Tai Chi?

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:48.905 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hm.

00:17:48.905 --> 00:17:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: The Tai Chi is
actually the yin and yang.

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:54.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually what
brought meaning to life.

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:56.960 align:middle line:10%
It gives us up and
down, right and left,

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.610 align:middle line:10%
and from that, the emanation
is the five elements.

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:03.770 align:middle line:10%
And the five elements have a
relationship with one another.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:07.430 align:middle line:10%
And in that relationship,
I can use them

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.980 align:middle line:10%
because they represent
everything in the universe--

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:14.450 align:middle line:10%
color, shapes, location,
time, et cetera.

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:15.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah, this is pretty.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:16.240 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: There we go.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A nice little setting.

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:18.750 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Yes, that's--

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's that got
to do with feng shui?

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: It's a
perfect representation

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.800 align:middle line:90%
of a client I have in St. Bart.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And one of the form
aspects of feng shui,

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:29.570 align:middle line:84%
we spoke about it kind
of being on an elevator.

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:32.740 align:middle line:84%
We want a setting
whereby we have the home,

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:35.420 align:middle line:84%
let's say, up with a
mountain behind it,

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:37.470 align:middle line:84%
arms stretched out
in front of it,

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:43.230 align:middle line:84%
and this vast openness to allow
the qi to come to your home.

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:44.655 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:18:44.655 --> 00:18:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I can
feel it from here.

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:47.050 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: I know.

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:49.270 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:52.251 align:middle line:84%
It's an ideal and
perfect setting.

00:18:52.251 --> 00:18:53.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what
did you do there?

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:55.650 align:middle line:90%
Did you put those chairs there?

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: Well, I'd have
to say Gaia did that.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Gaia did the mountains, the
water, and the plant life.

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:07.750 align:middle line:84%
So what happened was, that was
the home they were selecting.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And to me what it represented
was the perfect form feng shui

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:15.050 align:middle line:90%
for the setting of the home.

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:15.770 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:16.160 align:middle line:90%
I didn't need--

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:16.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It worked well.

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: --to do anything.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:18.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It worked well.

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.280 align:middle line:90%
Now, what's this?

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: So water to
the Chinese is money.

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:27.190 align:middle line:84%
There's virtual water,
so pathways, roadways,

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:29.210 align:middle line:84%
for example, and then
there's actual water.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And so the flow of water
actually is very important.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
rings on the luo pan

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:35.800 align:middle line:84%
is a way to measure
the flow of water.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.645 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, it's
actually a location down

00:19:38.645 --> 00:19:40.920 align:middle line:90%
in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's showing that water is
flowing away from the space.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.650 align:middle line:84%
So there's somebody on the
receiving end of that water

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:53.740 align:middle line:84%
flow that's benefiting from the
prosperity that it represents.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.172 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:19:55.172 --> 00:19:56.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Getting there.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:57.088 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Getting there.

00:19:57.088 --> 00:20:00.980 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you have a water
fountain in your front yard.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:04.560 align:middle line:84%
Ideally you want the water
flowing towards you, not away

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.217 align:middle line:90%
from you.

00:20:06.217 --> 00:20:07.550 align:middle line:90%
So that would be money flowing--

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:09.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what if you
have a broken water fountain?

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: Then that's broken
money in a very symbolic way.

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:16.240 align:middle line:84%
So if money is to
flow and you're

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.500 align:middle line:84%
wanting the flow of
money in your life,

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.870 align:middle line:90%
what direction is it flowing?

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:21.745 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:20:21.745 --> 00:20:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: So it's looking at form
and using an intuitive sense

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:29.790 align:middle line:84%
to understand what is it
saying and telling us?

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:31.020 align:middle line:10%
Here's another example.

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.020 align:middle line:10%
Stairwell.

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:32.810 align:middle line:90%
Stairways, right?

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:33.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:34.680 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: They say don't align
them with the front door.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:35.900 align:middle line:90%
Well, why?

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.110 align:middle line:84%
Because they represent
virtual water.

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:40.920 align:middle line:84%
If you were to stand at the top
and pour a glass of water down,

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:41.559 align:middle line:90%
it's flowing--

00:20:41.559 --> 00:20:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Out.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: --out.

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:44.190 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:48.320 align:middle line:84%
It takes a lot of energy to
bring the water up, doesn't it?

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:53.070 align:middle line:10%
So ideally, you don't align
a staircase with the door.

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:55.410 align:middle line:10%
It's not good feng shui.

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:57.890 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Next one,
let's take a look at it.

00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: OK, this
is fascinating.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.600 align:middle line:84%
This one is one of
three, so to speak.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:06.460 align:middle line:84%
This is a space-- I ask for a
floor plan when I do feng shui.

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And the client didn't have
one so she drew it up.

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:10.980 align:middle line:90%
And this is what she drew up.

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And when I got there, I went OK,
this doesn't match the space.

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:15.480 align:middle line:90%
Let me look at it.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And so I remeasured
it and redrew

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.009 align:middle line:90%
it, which is the next-- OK.

00:21:20.009 --> 00:21:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:21.260 align:middle line:90%
Totally different, by the way.

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:22.551 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Very different, right?

00:21:22.551 --> 00:21:24.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's very interesting
the perception one has

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:27.100 align:middle line:84%
of their space and the
actual space itself.

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.590 align:middle line:84%
That's why oftentimes
it's easier

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:31.520 align:middle line:84%
to have a professional come
in because they can see what

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.160 align:middle line:84%
we can't see for
ourselves, right?

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:38.474 align:middle line:84%
So then I took that
image and reoriented it.

00:21:38.474 --> 00:21:40.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've kind of
flipped things around.

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:41.889 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: I switched--
but look, it's

00:21:41.889 --> 00:21:44.090 align:middle line:84%
just changing the
orientation from a vertical

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:44.860 align:middle line:90%
to a horizontal.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.596 align:middle line:90%
What do you see, George?

00:21:46.596 --> 00:21:48.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It looks
like a handgun to me.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:49.622 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: You got it.

00:21:49.622 --> 00:21:51.200 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.780 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that good or bad?

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.144 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Well, you tell me.

00:21:55.144 --> 00:21:57.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't think you
want a gun in your place.

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: I wouldn't
want to live in a gun.

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even though I'm
a supporter of guns--

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:01.210 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Or work in one.

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --I think
people need to--

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:02.600 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Fine.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:03.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: -- defend themselves.

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Fine.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.590 align:middle line:84%
But the energetics
of it is there.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And that was the point
of just looking at form.

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.290 align:middle line:90%
It's like looking at the shapes.

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:19.920 align:middle line:84%
We do well in squares
and rectangles, right?

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.410 align:middle line:84%
We enjoy and work
better when we have

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:26.264 align:middle line:84%
the full capacity of the
space available to us.

00:22:26.264 --> 00:22:27.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's this--

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.570 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Oh, this is a fun one.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:30.950 align:middle line:10%
This was actually out
of a newspaper in China

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:34.580 align:middle line:10%
about this gentleman who
just wouldn't move his house.

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:37.750 align:middle line:10%
And I have a friend who
coined the term "dung shui."

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:39.470 align:middle line:10%
so we have feng
shui, which is good,

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:40.740 align:middle line:10%
and then we have dung shui.

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:41.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: This is right
in the middle of a road.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.590 align:middle line:10%
>>JONES: That's a very
good example of dung shui,

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:46.055 align:middle line:10%
what not to do, is
to have this sha.

00:22:46.055 --> 00:22:48.930 align:middle line:84%
It's called sha
qi, so energy can

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:53.530 align:middle line:84%
be classified according
to different qualities.

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And so that would
definitely be what's

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:58.420 align:middle line:84%
called sha qi,
which is damaging--

00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did he do?

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:00.420 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: --and destructive.

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:02.503 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Dump his house
there on the road or what?

00:23:02.503 --> 00:23:04.740 align:middle line:10%
>>JONES: No, he actually
wouldn't move the house,

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.370 align:middle line:10%
and the city couldn't force him.

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:10.860 align:middle line:10%
And he finally decided at
some point the feng shui was

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.350 align:middle line:10%
dung shui, and he
needed to leave.

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:14.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's just a fun
image to show--

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:15.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
where his house was?

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: --the
stubbornness, if you will.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, the city built
the road around him.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The road around him.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.330 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: Yes, because
he wouldn't move.

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:24.670 align:middle line:90%
Here's another dung shui.

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:26.727 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's this
toilet with a door that

00:23:26.727 --> 00:23:28.410 align:middle line:90%
fits over the toilet?

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: It's just bad
form, don't you think?

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:32.170 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you can't get in.

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But the
whole thing is bad.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: It's just
really bad, right.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:36.610 align:middle line:10%
You can't get in,
you can't get out,

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:39.564 align:middle line:10%
and it's just funny what we do.

00:23:39.564 --> 00:23:40.980 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You don't
want to get in.

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:41.860 align:middle line:10%
>>JONES: You don't
want to get in,

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:43.390 align:middle line:10%
and there's certainly
no-- so, OK,

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:45.320 align:middle line:10%
let's just even talk
what we would do.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Like let's say
that was a reality.

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.114 align:middle line:84%
How about if we hung a
curtain and took the door off?

00:23:51.114 --> 00:23:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And then everybody's got to
clear the deck so that there's

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:54.970 align:middle line:90%
privacy on the other side.

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think the whole
concept is off on this one.

00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:57.930 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Dung shui.

00:23:57.930 --> 00:23:58.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, it is.

00:23:58.170 --> 00:23:59.515 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Big time.

00:23:59.515 --> 00:24:01.682 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this
one, our last picture.

00:24:01.682 --> 00:24:02.390 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Ah, yes.

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:03.790 align:middle line:90%
This is actually a client.

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:06.720 align:middle line:84%
It's a gallery in
Asheville, North Carolina.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:11.305 align:middle line:84%
And it's a real
testament to the--

00:24:11.305 --> 00:24:13.150 align:middle line:90%
it's called the Mouth of Qi.

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And so our entrances are
grand-- the grand invitation,

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.300 align:middle line:84%
if you will, to the
external energy,

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:21.550 align:middle line:90%
and you want to beautify them.

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:24.080 align:middle line:84%
You want them seen and
known and recognized.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.089 align:middle line:84%
I mean, have you
ever been to a place,

00:24:26.089 --> 00:24:27.880 align:middle line:84%
and you don't know
where the front door is?

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:28.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh yeah.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.065 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Right.

00:24:29.065 --> 00:24:31.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like the
mouth on the face, right?

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:32.630 align:middle line:90%
We don't want it on the side.

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:33.800 align:middle line:90%
We don't want it unfound.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:34.520 align:middle line:90%
We need it.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.960 align:middle line:84%
We need it to bring in the
nutrients and vitamins that

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.090 align:middle line:84%
are available in
the environment.

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing that
hasn't been done yet that--

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:46.970 align:middle line:84%
because I did this
client's gallery,

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:51.299 align:middle line:84%
is I would love to see
the awning, the awning--

00:24:51.299 --> 00:24:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something.

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: Yeah, so the
beautiful red doors

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:56.010 align:middle line:90%
are very-- they speak to people.

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:58.554 align:middle line:84%
So when they get to the
space, they know where to go.

00:24:58.554 --> 00:24:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kelly,
what would you say

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:03.690 align:middle line:84%
is the largest scope
of what you do?

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:06.020 align:middle line:84%
Changing the
environment of a house?

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:09.550 align:middle line:84%
Working specifically
on an individual?

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:10.340 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: I would say
it's a balance of homes

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:13.152 align:middle line:90%
and businesses.

00:25:13.152 --> 00:25:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes it's
businesses that

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:17.460 align:middle line:90%
are looking to be-- to set up.

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And then often,
because the systems

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:24.190 align:middle line:84%
that I work with, the
other services that I offer

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:29.160 align:middle line:84%
work hand in hand, it allows us
to work at the human and heaven

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:33.190 align:middle line:84%
level to marry and bridge
up with the feng shui.

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:35.500 align:middle line:84%
So we're really-- we're
not just one thing.

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:36.805 align:middle line:90%
We're multidimensional beings.

00:25:36.805 --> 00:25:37.388 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:25:37.388 --> 00:25:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: And so it's
about how can we

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:43.240 align:middle line:84%
work at as many levels of our
being to create this heaven,

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.450 align:middle line:84%
human, Earth alignment
within our beingness

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:47.600 align:middle line:84%
so that we can create
the dynamic life we're

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.375 align:middle line:90%
looking to have.

00:25:48.375 --> 00:25:51.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you found
that interior designers need

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.450 align:middle line:84%
to learn feng shui, and
they just don't know?

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:55.730 align:middle line:90%
They don't get it?

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:58.300 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: Well, here's
how I speak to that.

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:01.790 align:middle line:84%
To me, feng shui is the
precursor to any one thing

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:03.390 align:middle line:90%
you do along the way.

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:06.830 align:middle line:84%
So how do you place the
house on that piece of land?

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Because how you orient it's
going to determine the energy

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:11.880 align:middle line:84%
pattern in it, how you
actually architecturally

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.250 align:middle line:90%
design the space.

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:14.470 align:middle line:90%
So it's a precursor.

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Why are you doing
what you're doing?

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And how can you do it in a
way that the harmony, balance,

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.670 align:middle line:84%
and love a space
can provide you can

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:26.270 align:middle line:84%
be amplified so
you are benefited

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:28.900 align:middle line:84%
by it as the client, as
the one who lives there,

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:30.970 align:middle line:90%
works there, et cetera.

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And so interior designers,
and even people,

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:35.210 align:middle line:90%
it's like, well, I love green.

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, I'm
painting this green.

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:39.180 align:middle line:84%
It's like I'm
using this element.

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:42.250 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, but what
does the space ask for?

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:44.210 align:middle line:84%
So I call it giving
a voice to our space

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:47.460 align:middle line:84%
because our space
has something to say,

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:51.701 align:middle line:84%
and it'll tell us what
it is that will best--

00:26:51.701 --> 00:26:52.825 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Function for them?

00:26:52.825 --> 00:26:53.700 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Function, yeah.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:54.491 align:middle line:90%
That's a good word.

00:26:54.491 --> 00:26:55.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you change colors?

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.060 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: I do.

00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:57.600 align:middle line:90%
Oh sure.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.695 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that's
part of it, too.

00:26:58.695 --> 00:27:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Colors, placement.

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it sounds silly in
a way to people, or they go,

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.070 align:middle line:84%
you know, well,
I understand how.

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:07.550 align:middle line:84%
But the orientation
that we hold in a space

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:10.140 align:middle line:84%
determines the energy
that we are greeting.

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.240 align:middle line:84%
So what is the energy in
front of me, for example.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.380 align:middle line:10%
I don't see it, so I
can't put my finger on it

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:15.600 align:middle line:10%
and say, oh, I see this.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.525 align:middle line:90%
Therefore, it's that.

00:27:16.525 --> 00:27:17.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:17.775 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Right?

00:27:17.775 --> 00:27:19.930 align:middle line:84%
So we're working at
this other level.

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:23.250 align:middle line:84%
So when I look at it, it's
like, well, is it prosperity?

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Is it arguments, conflicts,
and legal problems?

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.010 align:middle line:90%
Is it relationships?

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:32.270 align:middle line:84%
What is that that I'm
greeting at an unseen level?

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And so the placement piece
of it becomes very critical.

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Sleeping in bed at night-- what
is the energy vibration there

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:43.350 align:middle line:84%
that you're soaking in eight
hours, let's say, a night?

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:44.990 align:middle line:90%
And how is it affecting you?

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:49.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was with a client,
and the energy was not good,

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:53.850 align:middle line:84%
and I was surprised nobody
was actually sick yet.

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:55.804 align:middle line:84%
And within a couple
of weeks, there

00:27:55.804 --> 00:27:57.220 align:middle line:84%
was a diagnosis
because they had--

00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:58.345 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They did get sick?

00:27:58.345 --> 00:27:59.011 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Yes.

00:27:59.011 --> 00:27:59.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:01.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
science behind this?

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: It is an
art and a science.

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:04.540 align:middle line:84%
So what they've done
is they understand

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:05.640 align:middle line:90%
the laws of the universe.

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.780 align:middle line:90%
They understand yin and yang.

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:08.196 align:middle line:84%
They understand
the five elements.

00:28:08.196 --> 00:28:10.760 align:middle line:84%
They understand how
it comes together

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:17.170 align:middle line:84%
and how to-- over
time, suggestions,

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:20.640 align:middle line:84%
recommendations have been put
in place and results are shown.

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
had a client fight you?

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Oh sure.

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:24.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
want to do this.

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:24.500 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Oh yes.

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:25.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
not going to do it.

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.640 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Oh yes.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm not moving anything.

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm not changing.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why did you hire me?

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.060 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Exactly.

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:30.419 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what I said.

00:28:30.419 --> 00:28:32.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just like, OK, I
go in with my hands tied

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.450 align:middle line:84%
behind my back,
and it's like, OK.

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, all
right, well, then

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:39.050 align:middle line:84%
we'll do what we can
because it's not about me.

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:44.700 align:middle line:10%
So what I do is I ask four
questions-- can you, can't you,

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.950 align:middle line:10%
will you, won't you?

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:47.597 align:middle line:90%
It's up to you.

00:28:47.597 --> 00:28:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would think if
they wanted to hire you,

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.294 align:middle line:90%
they'd just let you at it.

00:28:52.294 --> 00:28:53.730 align:middle line:90%
Just do your thing.

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:57.825 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: Well, it takes them
and their willingness to-- you

00:28:57.825 --> 00:28:59.910 align:middle line:84%
know, and when I do
feng shui, number one,

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:02.330 align:middle line:84%
it's not about knowing
it was even done.

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:06.919 align:middle line:84%
Number two, it's not
about what I want.

00:29:06.919 --> 00:29:07.710 align:middle line:90%
It's what you want.

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:08.293 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:29:08.293 --> 00:29:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: And it's what
you're willing to do

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:11.480 align:middle line:90%
and what feels most comfortable.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it as simple
as moving the bed?

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: It can be.

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:17.940 align:middle line:84%
It can be as simple
as moving a bed.

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that the most
important room in the house?

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:21.340 align:middle line:90%
The bedroom?

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:25.557 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: Well, if health is to
you, then the answer is yes.

00:29:25.557 --> 00:29:26.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You spend--

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: Some people
it's not important.

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:28.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --seven to
eight hours a day there.

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: I agree.

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:30.890 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:31.420 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:33.830 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's called
a mountain energy

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:38.350 align:middle line:84%
that we actually protect,
try to harness in a bedroom.

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And that mountain
energy is about health,

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:42.500 align:middle line:90%
human relationships.

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And so not only is
it a personal health,

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:48.520 align:middle line:84%
the personal
relationship we have

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.890 align:middle line:84%
with our own physical
beingness and with ourselves,

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:55.290 align:middle line:84%
but it is from that which
we carry out into the world.

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:57.230 align:middle line:90%
And so how do I communicate?

00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:58.310 align:middle line:90%
How do I relate?

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:00.740 align:middle line:10%
Am I, you know,
sleeping irritably,

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:03.990 align:middle line:10%
and therefore, I'm
irritable and not

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:07.210 align:middle line:10%
in a good space emotionally or--

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:10.574 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Time to go home
and change my bedroom.

00:30:10.574 --> 00:30:12.240 align:middle line:84%

very pleasant, George.

>>NOORY: Who would
think that just tapping

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:31.450 align:middle line:84%
into the planet's energy,
this universal energy,

00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:33.420 align:middle line:84%
could change you,
could affect you?

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:36.030 align:middle line:10%
But that's what you
do with feng shui,

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:38.260 align:middle line:10%

Kelly S. Jones does.
