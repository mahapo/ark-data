00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well, welcome to
this edition of Beyond Belief.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.830 align:middle line:10%
Suzanne Giesemann is with
us to discuss mediumship

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.280 align:middle line:10%
for the masses.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.370 align:middle line:10%
The fact that one
doesn't have to be

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.189 align:middle line:10%
born a medium to connect with
those who have passed on.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.270 align:middle line:84%
She is a former Navy
commander-- thank you, ma'am--

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.270 align:middle line:84%
who had an incredible
awakening and now teaches

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.090 align:middle line:84%
the awakened way, blending
science and spirituality.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.240 align:middle line:84%
Welcome, Suzanne, or
should I say Commander?

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZANNE GIESEMANN:
Suzanne is just fine.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.530 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, George.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.863 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nine years Navy for me.

00:00:47.863 --> 00:00:51.110 align:middle line:84%
So I'm trained to
say, yes, ma'am.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Carry on.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How'd you
get into the Navy?

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.790 align:middle line:10%
>>GIESEMANN: I went
right outside of college.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.290 align:middle line:10%
My brother had been
in the Air Force

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.620 align:middle line:10%
since I was five years old.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.638 align:middle line:10%
And I said, that is
a great career path.

00:01:00.638 --> 00:01:01.680 align:middle line:10%
That's what I want to do.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.129 align:middle line:84%
But the Air Force had filled
its quota of women at the time.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, that
Navy looks pretty good.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.370 align:middle line:10%
Let me go for that.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.160 align:middle line:10%
And got commissioned
as an ensign

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.930 align:middle line:10%
and just climbed
through the ranks.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, I was
in for nine years

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.030 align:middle line:84%
and got to be a lieutenant,
almost lieutenant commander

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.530 align:middle line:90%
before I retired.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.120 align:middle line:90%
How many years were you in?

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: 20
years to the day.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You got your 20 years?

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: I did.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.810 align:middle line:90%
Do you miss it?

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: I don't really.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.220 align:middle line:84%
My new work has just
taken over my life

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.750 align:middle line:84%
with a passion and a
sense of reward that

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.740 align:middle line:84%
just can't compare to
the days in the Navy,

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.090 align:middle line:90%
even though that was an honor.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.700 align:middle line:84%
This work that I
do now is an honor

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.410 align:middle line:90%
at a whole different level.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, I was a public
information officer in the Navy.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.375 align:middle line:90%
How about you?

00:01:46.375 --> 00:01:47.750 align:middle line:10%
>>GIESEMANN: I
was what was known

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.990 align:middle line:10%
as a general unrestricted line
officer, which, if you think

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.000 align:middle line:10%
about it, the acronym was GURL.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.103 align:middle line:90%
So we were the GURLs.

00:01:55.103 --> 00:01:57.020 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know what
to do with us when women

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.590 align:middle line:90%
weren't assigned to ships.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.070 align:middle line:10%
So I served nine different
tours all ashore,

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.230 align:middle line:10%
but really interesting tours
in intelligence and training

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.880 align:middle line:10%
and plans and policies.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.620 align:middle line:10%
So very varied tours.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.197 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: All
various assignments?

00:02:12.197 --> 00:02:13.280 align:middle line:10%
>>GIESEMANN: That's right.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.240 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What was your favorite?

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.040 align:middle line:10%
>>GIESEMANN: Oh.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.540 align:middle line:10%
My favorite was when the
Chairman of the Joint

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.040 align:middle line:10%
Chiefs of Staff, the head
of the whole US military,

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.610 align:middle line:10%
an Army officer,
asked me, a girl,

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.700 align:middle line:10%
to be his aide de camp, his
right hand man, so to speak.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You went through
an ominous time with 9/11,

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.520 align:middle line:90%
didn't you?

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Oh.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.055 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As we all did.

00:02:31.055 --> 00:02:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: Yeah, but I
was up close and personal.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.520 align:middle line:84%
I was in the last aircraft in US
airspace with the chairman out

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.070 align:middle line:84%
over the Atlantic
when we got the news

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.220 align:middle line:84%
and turned the aircraft
around, flew over Manhattan

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.720 align:middle line:84%
when all other aircraft
had been grounded.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.880 align:middle line:84%
So those of us on board the
plane saw the burning smoke

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.240 align:middle line:84%
come up with our own eyes,
returned to Washington,

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.270 align:middle line:84%
and went into the
burning Pentagon.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.028 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: Just hours
later, in fact, George,

00:02:58.028 --> 00:03:02.070 align:middle line:84%
I stepped over jet engine
pieces in the grass that day

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.005 align:middle line:84%
before gazing at the hole
in our office building.

00:03:05.005 --> 00:03:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you in shock?

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Oh.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.470 align:middle line:90%
Just stunned.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.390 align:middle line:84%
We had just left
it hours earlier.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest
question was, how

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.910 align:middle line:84%
could those people
who are just like us,

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.870 align:middle line:84%
who are sitting at their
desks hours ago, just be gone?

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.400 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing there.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.640 align:middle line:90%
It was life-changing.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.955 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was frightening.

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: I
guess, frightening

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.580 align:middle line:84%
so much-- frightening
because we didn't

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.790 align:middle line:90%
know what would happen next.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.545 align:middle line:84%
I remember there was-- suddenly
alarms went off the next day.

00:03:33.545 --> 00:03:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And they said, get
out of the building.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.070 align:middle line:90%
It's another attack.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.670 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.660 align:middle line:90%
It was a false alarm.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.010 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, we were all on edge
for quite a while after that.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we have a
picture of that horrible moment.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.810 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.770 align:middle line:84%
What are we looking
at here, Suzanne?

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: That's hours
after the attack, when

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.758 align:middle line:84%
we were taking a look for
ourselves at the impact site.

00:03:54.758 --> 00:03:56.800 align:middle line:84%
That's the Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs in green.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's me standing to
his left just staring--

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In your--

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: --at the remains.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --Navy whites, right?

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.182 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: In my Navy whites.

00:04:04.182 --> 00:04:06.960 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there were firemen off to
the side spraying water on it

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.560 align:middle line:90%
because it was still on fire.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's the chairman's
public affairs officer.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.500 align:middle line:84%
So you would
understand his role.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you feel about
the conspiracy theorists who

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.825 align:middle line:84%
said a plane did not
hit the Pentagon?

00:04:17.825 --> 00:04:19.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: Well,
this is when I

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.020 align:middle line:84%
say I stepped over
the jet engine pieces.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.595 align:middle line:84%
I saw it, so it
definitely happened.

00:04:24.595 --> 00:04:25.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was demolished.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.640 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Oh.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.580 align:middle line:90%
It happened.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.390 align:middle line:90%
It was a plane.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.445 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:04:29.445 --> 00:04:30.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It blew up.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.570 align:middle line:90%
It hit it, blew up.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:32.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Yeah.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There
was nothing there.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Yeah.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What events followed
after that photograph?

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: Well, personally,
I went on a personal search

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.597 align:middle line:84%
to get answers to
those questions

00:04:43.597 --> 00:04:44.680 align:middle line:90%
that we just talked about.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.263 align:middle line:84%
How could people have been there
one moment and gone the next?

00:04:47.263 --> 00:04:48.790 align:middle line:90%
Why do some people die young?

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And I turned to traditional
religion, which I had not

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.450 align:middle line:84%
been raised with any religion,
and it just didn't satisfy me.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.700 align:middle line:84%
So I just decided, having
known a few commanders

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.650 align:middle line:90%
the same rank as I was who--

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.420 align:middle line:84%
one of them was two
weeks' shy of retirement,

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.880 align:middle line:90%
and he was killed that day.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And I said to my husband, Ty,
who was a retired captain,

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.110 align:middle line:90%
I said, life's too short.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.010 align:middle line:90%
We have dreams.

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.570 align:middle line:90%
Let's go live them.

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.860 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to put in
my papers and with 20

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.060 align:middle line:90%
years to the day I retired.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And the next day we set off
sailing in our sailboat.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.770 align:middle line:90%
We sold the house and the cars.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.720 align:middle line:90%
Life was idyllic.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.550 align:middle line:84%
But if the truth be told, I was
literally running away from life

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.360 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't want to
have any part of a world

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.330 align:middle line:84%
where people could harm
each other like that.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.400 align:middle line:84%
9/11 really had that
kind of impact on me.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And I had no coping tools
whatsoever for the grief

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.060 align:middle line:84%
that everybody felt. So I
just ran away, went sailing.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.740 align:middle line:90%
And it was a beautiful life.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.830 align:middle line:84%
We sailed across
the Atlantic Ocean

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.210 align:middle line:84%
and were sailing around
the Mediterranean.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.900 align:middle line:84%
But as I'm sure you
know, we all come here

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.320 align:middle line:90%
to learn certain lessons.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.347 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: Life caught up with
me in a way I couldn't run away

00:05:59.347 --> 00:06:01.320 align:middle line:84%
from anymore when
we got the news--

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.200 align:middle line:84%
while sailing off the
coast of Croatia--

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.450 align:middle line:84%
that Ty's daughter,
my stepdaughter Susan,

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.410 align:middle line:84%
who was a sergeant
in the Marines,

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.440 align:middle line:84%
had been crossing the flight
line to report to duty one

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.460 align:middle line:84%
morning, and out of the
blue, a bolt of lightning--

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.960 align:middle line:90%
wasn't even raining--

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.050 align:middle line:90%
struck her down onto the tarmac.

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: Yeah, they
worked on her for seven hours

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.820 align:middle line:90%
and couldn't save her.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A bolt out of nowhere.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: There was a
storm about 10 miles away.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:31.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.010 align:middle line:90%
Had not even reached there yet.

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And to make matters
worse, George, Susan

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:40.590 align:middle line:84%
was six months pregnant
with our only grandchild.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:41.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How sad.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: It was devastating.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.760 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, I had no
tools to deal with 9/11.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.457 align:middle line:84%
And now I had zero
tools other than--

00:06:47.457 --> 00:06:49.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
learned this phrase when

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.480 align:middle line:84%
you were in the Navy,
but "Life is tough.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.380 align:middle line:84%
When challenges
come, what do you do?

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.550 align:middle line:90%
Suck it up."

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:55.430 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:56.442 align:middle line:90%
That was how we coped.

00:06:56.442 --> 00:06:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what we said.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:58.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Yeah.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.320 align:middle line:84%
That was my sum total of
how to deal with challenges.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But this
is more than that.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.105 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Oh.

00:07:04.105 --> 00:07:07.450 align:middle line:84%
I was literally shaking in
the car going to her funeral

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.760 align:middle line:84%
because I was raised-- don't
show sadness, don't show anger.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to be
strong for my husband,

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.510 align:middle line:90%
but it came out as shaking.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:22.600 align:middle line:84%
But I will tell you that seeing
Susan's body in the coffin

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.360 align:middle line:84%
was a pivotal moment in
my whole life's journey.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How so?

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: Because
when I looked down

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:35.680 align:middle line:84%
at her beautiful body, it was
so different than the last time

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.030 align:middle line:84%
I saw her and any
time I saw her.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And I suddenly knew
that there's something

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:45.190 align:middle line:90%
that enlivens these bodies.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, raised
with no religion,

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:51.040 align:middle line:84%
I just suddenly knew there's
a spirit, a soul, whatever

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.960 align:middle line:90%
you want to call it.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:52.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You knew.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: I just knew it.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You knew.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: And I said, I'm
going to connect with Susan.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know how
I was going to do that.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:03.040 align:middle line:84%
But that very week,
I started sitting

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:08.600 align:middle line:84%
quietly every day saying,
Susan, reveal yourself to me.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.490 align:middle line:90%
Susan, let me sense you.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.703 align:middle line:90%
And that became my new mission.

00:08:13.703 --> 00:08:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that what
led you into mediumship?

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: It absolutely is.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea that's
where it was leading.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:20.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you never
stopped after that.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:23.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Never.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.350 align:middle line:84%
To this day, that
was 2006, I may

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.580 align:middle line:84%
have missed five
days of meditating,

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.400 align:middle line:84%
but that is a-- to me
now-- a sacred practice

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.309 align:middle line:84%
because it's what reminds
me of what I've learned,

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:40.539 align:middle line:84%
that we really are all souls
now, not just when we pass.

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
connect with her?

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: Well, the
funny thing is, George,

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:49.997 align:middle line:84%
it was three full years of daily
"Susan, let me hear from you."

00:08:49.997 --> 00:08:51.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Three full years?

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: Three years till
I heard from her so clearly.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And then since I can connect
with her quite easily.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:00.860 align:middle line:84%
But she came through a couple
of years ago, and she said,

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:03.250 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't supposed
to come through

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:06.610 align:middle line:84%
to you until I did
because you would

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:09.470 align:middle line:90%
have stopped connecting daily.

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.330 align:middle line:84%
You would have said,
mission accomplished.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.630 align:middle line:84%
I now know Susan is still with
us, and that would have been it.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:19.000 align:middle line:84%
But because I sat
every day, I didn't

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.330 align:middle line:84%
realize I was training myself
to achieve expanded states

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.200 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness at will.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.690 align:middle line:84%
I was creating space
in my awareness.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:29.540 align:middle line:90%
I was training myself in focus.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.870 align:middle line:84%
I was starting to have
adventures in consciousness

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:34.940 align:middle line:84%
and connecting with other
beings besides Susan.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And then once that opened up,
there was no turning back.

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When did you
start branching out

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.210 align:middle line:90%
into more mediumship?

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:47.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: That came--
let's see-- after I

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.710 align:middle line:90%
took Ty to see a medium.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's so funny because
it was-- years later,

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.960 align:middle line:84%
he said, Suzanne, you told me
we're going to go see a medium.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yes, dear,
but I didn't have

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:57.860 align:middle line:90%
any idea what a medium was.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And now he's married to one, so
that's how ignorant both of us

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.280 align:middle line:84%
were of the whole
afterlife thing.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:09.430 align:middle line:84%
But that medium brought
through irrefutable evidence

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:11.990 align:middle line:84%
that Susan was right
there in the room with us,

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:16.030 align:middle line:84%
including saying, there's a
little baby boy here with her

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:18.632 align:middle line:84%
who she wants to
introduce to you.

00:10:18.632 --> 00:10:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And she
did not know this?

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: She didn't.

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:24.250 align:middle line:84%
I deliberately didn't give her
our last name, did not tell her

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:25.730 align:middle line:90%
who I wanted to hear from.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And she's tuning in
to this young woman

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:31.090 align:middle line:84%
in a brown uniform
who died suddenly,

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:33.200 align:middle line:84%
giving her a tingly
electrical feeling,

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.060 align:middle line:90%
running up and down her arm.

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.952 align:middle line:84%
But the little baby boy
with her was the clincher.

00:10:38.952 --> 00:10:41.480 align:middle line:84%
I deliberately said, I'm
not going to be gullible.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
believe just anything.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.470 align:middle line:90%
But there was no refuting that.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:47.270 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:48.440 align:middle line:90%
Susan was there.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.760 align:middle line:90%
There was so much more.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:55.070 align:middle line:84%
But at the time, I didn't know
I would one day be a medium,

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:58.130 align:middle line:84%
but I suddenly had to let
the world know this is real.

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:03.930 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote two biographies
of reputable, evidence-based

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:04.730 align:middle line:90%
mediums.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And in writing the books,
one of those mediums

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:11.300 align:middle line:84%
took me into her class and
said, you can do this too.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.860 align:middle line:84%
Come up here to the
front of the room

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.380 align:middle line:84%
and bring through
this spirit who

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.950 align:middle line:90%
allegedly was standing there.

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And that was the first
time, put on the spot,

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.340 align:middle line:84%
that I discerned
information that I

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:22.460 align:middle line:90%
had no idea I couldn't do.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:23.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.395 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What a metamorphosis
for a 20-year Navy veteran.

00:11:26.395 --> 00:11:27.195 align:middle line:90%
My god.

00:11:27.195 --> 00:11:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: Oh, but
it's that Navy background

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:31.460 align:middle line:84%
that caused me-- when
the teacher said,

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:32.540 align:middle line:90%
there's a spirit here.

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:36.670 align:middle line:84%
Suzanne, come up here
and see what you get.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:38.335 align:middle line:84%
Maybe if I hadn't
had that career,

00:11:38.335 --> 00:11:39.710 align:middle line:84%
I would have said,
oh, that's OK.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:40.510 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:43.857 align:middle line:84%
But the Navy officer was like
you put me to that test, can do.

00:11:43.857 --> 00:11:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, ma'am.

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:45.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: --stand up there
in the front of the class.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:48.440 align:middle line:90%
And she says, male or female?

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, George,
I couldn't see any spirit.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.370 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't feel anything.

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:57.290 align:middle line:84%
But I trusted her that
there was a spirit there.

00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:58.740 align:middle line:90%
And I brought through.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Male, 70 years old when he
passed, passed of cancer,

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:04.350 align:middle line:90%
and was an engineer.

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:07.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, I thought I was
pulling data out of the air.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And this woman in the class
raised her hand and she said,

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:11.220 align:middle line:90%
that's my dad.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, that
can't be right.

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:17.850 align:middle line:84%
But then the teacher,
Janet Nohavec, said, yeah,

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:20.470 align:middle line:84%
and his birthday was March
31, and he had a baseball cap

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:21.270 align:middle line:90%
collection.

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:22.530 align:middle line:90%
And the girl said, yeah.

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, you mean there
really is somebody here?

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And Janet said, come on,
Suzanne, push yourself

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:28.800 align:middle line:90%
just a little more.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.280 align:middle line:84%
So I just closed my
eyes, not realizing

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.200 align:middle line:84%
that two years of
sitting quietly,

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.800 align:middle line:84%
trying to commune with
Susan, had allowed me

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:43.940 align:middle line:84%
that spacious awareness to
suddenly hear twinkle toes

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.940 align:middle line:84%
and see in my mind's eye a
pair of black patent leather

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.523 align:middle line:90%
shoes, which I passed on.

00:12:48.523 --> 00:12:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There you go.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: And the girl said,
my dad was a ballroom dancer.

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And my mom always
called him twinkle toes.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.475 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: That
was that moment

00:12:56.475 --> 00:13:00.470 align:middle line:84%
when I said, if I could do
for one other family what

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:03.600 align:middle line:84%
that medium did for our
family, bringing Susan through,

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm all in.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And I said, but I don't
want to feel like I'm

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:08.850 align:middle line:90%
pulling data out of the air.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:11.130 align:middle line:90%
I need to feel you, spirits.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:13.140 align:middle line:90%
I need to really sense you.

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And that has opened
up beautifully.

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:18.637 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Suzanne, were you
a believer in God always?

00:13:18.637 --> 00:13:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Oh, no.

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:20.802 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't an atheist.

00:13:20.802 --> 00:13:22.260 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't know
what to believe.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And our family didn't
talk about religion.

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:31.190 align:middle line:84%
So just by growing up in
society, you hear things,

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:35.930 align:middle line:84%
you pick up certain beliefs but
never really challenged them.

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:38.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I just picked up
your new book, Mediumship.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:39.840 align:middle line:90%
Well done.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Oh, thank you.

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:41.463 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell us about it.

00:13:41.463 --> 00:13:45.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: Well, it's
a primer, an introduction

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.780 align:middle line:84%
to the fact that
we are souls here

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.780 align:middle line:84%
and now that anybody
can learn to make

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.770 align:middle line:84%
the connection with loved
ones across the veil.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.080 align:middle line:90%
That's my passion now.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.150 align:middle line:84%
I do readings still,
not too often,

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:59.150 align:middle line:84%
because, really, I'm all
about teaching others

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:03.360 align:middle line:84%
to do this, not necessarily just
to be mediums for other people,

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.390 align:middle line:84%
but to make connections
with your own loved ones

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:06.240 align:middle line:90%
across the veil.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.650 align:middle line:90%
We all can learn to do that.

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:09.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm the proof of that,
not a born medium,

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:12.540 align:middle line:84%
and have opened up a
beautiful connection.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:16.580 align:middle line:84%
So the book, Mediumship, the
first part is all of the what

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:19.292 align:middle line:90%
and how and why is it possible.

00:14:19.292 --> 00:14:21.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who, what,
why, when, and where.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.125 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Yeah, exactly.

00:14:22.125 --> 00:14:24.120 align:middle line:90%
The middle section is wonderful.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.170 align:middle line:84%
30 stories of connection
across the veil

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:30.030 align:middle line:84%
contributed by other
writers and two of my own,

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:32.780 align:middle line:84%
showing that it's not just
one-on-one readings that

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:34.640 align:middle line:84%
constitutes mediumship
but also what

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.513 align:middle line:84%
we call after-death
communications and signs.

00:14:37.513 --> 00:14:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And then the last
part of the book

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:42.770 align:middle line:84%
are some certain practices
that anybody can do to connect.

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:46.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had two friends over
the last couple of years die.

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:51.690 align:middle line:84%
One was a buddy who was
Greek, born in America.

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Another guy owned
his own limo company

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:57.870 align:middle line:84%
and drove me in Saint
Louis whenever I was there.

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And I had a psychic medium on
my Coast to Coast radio show.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And she said, George,
I got to stop you.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, keep in mind, I don't
talk about this to anybody

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:14.010 align:middle line:90%
like you did with your case.

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:17.880 align:middle line:84%
She said, I see two
people that were

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.920 align:middle line:90%
in your life on the other side.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:21.850 align:middle line:90%
And they're laughing.

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:24.090 align:middle line:90%
They're having a good time.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:29.370 align:middle line:90%
One guy says you owe him money.

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:32.070 align:middle line:84%
That was my limo driver
who would invoice me

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:33.070 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the month.

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Oh my gosh.

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He died the day
before the end of the month

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:40.330 align:middle line:84%
and wasn't able to get his
invoice out for that month.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.070 align:middle line:90%
I still owe him a small check.

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:42.870 align:middle line:90%
He's dead.

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: And
he's just kidding.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.740 align:middle line:84%
This shows you the
humor across the veil

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.240 align:middle line:84%
because he sure
doesn't need it now.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:51.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then what really
got me, after she said,

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:54.110 align:middle line:84%
you owe him money
and he's laughing,

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:57.690 align:middle line:84%
she said, but he's with a
friend of yours who's Greek,

00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:59.660 align:middle line:90%
and he's laughing.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.300 align:middle line:90%
He said you skated.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.440 align:middle line:90%
How do they know this stuff?

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: Because
they're right here.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:09.030 align:middle line:84%
It's like this program is
showing on a certain channel,

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:10.230 align:middle line:90%
a certain frequency.

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And once we pass from this life,
we're at a different frequency.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.570 align:middle line:84%
So all we need to do is
learn to change the channel.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:20.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are the three Es?

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:21.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Oh, gosh.

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:26.550 align:middle line:84%
The three Es are what I call the
keys to living an awakened life.

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:29.420 align:middle line:84%
You educate yourself,
which is what programs

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:30.990 align:middle line:90%
like this help us to do.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Learn all you can
about mediumship.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.870 align:middle line:90%
Read the book.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Listen to people's
near-death experiences

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.910 align:middle line:84%
to open your mind to
the fact that we're

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:39.480 align:middle line:90%
part of a greater reality.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:43.500 align:middle line:84%
The second E is
experience for yourself.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.340 align:middle line:90%
I can sit here.

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.750 align:middle line:84%
I could tell you
stories for days.

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:50.380 align:middle line:84%
But to experience
that for yourself,

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.460 align:middle line:84%
to experience the presence of
a loved one or somebody else's

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.320 align:middle line:84%
loved one, to
discern information

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:58.530 align:middle line:84%
that you couldn't possibly
know using your physical senses

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:00.070 align:middle line:90%
changes things for you.

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:04.543 align:middle line:84%
And then the third E is
engage those beings yourself.

00:17:04.543 --> 00:17:07.210 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you how many people
come up to me and say, Suzanne,

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:09.369 align:middle line:84%
I saw this figure at
the end of my bed.

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:10.480 align:middle line:90%
Who do you think it was?

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.539 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
did you ask them?

00:17:12.539 --> 00:17:15.918 align:middle line:84%
I know people don't
realize that, yeah--

00:17:15.918 --> 00:17:16.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can do that?

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: They're creative.

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:19.390 align:middle line:90%
You can just talk to them.

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give us
one of your stories.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:22.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Oh my gosh.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:26.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can dive into some
of the most recent ones.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Just last week, I gave a reading
to a woman who didn't even

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.352 align:middle line:90%
speak clear English.

00:17:31.352 --> 00:17:33.435 align:middle line:84%
She had to have her son
sit-in on it to translate.

00:17:33.435 --> 00:17:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As the interpreter.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: He was
the interpreter,

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:39.280 align:middle line:84%
which-- the human side says,
oh gosh, a different culture.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.050 align:middle line:84%
How am I going to
be able to do this?

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And I immediately catch
myself and say, no, we

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.460 align:middle line:90%
do this soul to soul.

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:48.520 align:middle line:84%
So I just tuned in to the
channel using intention--

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.070 align:middle line:90%
that's the key--

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.300 align:middle line:84%
and connected with her
husband who had passed,

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:53.470 align:middle line:90%
who was right there.

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And he showed me that he had
passed from a heart issue.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:59.800 align:middle line:84%
I actually feel the physical
symptoms of how people pass.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.420 align:middle line:90%
He palpitated my heart.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.810 align:middle line:84%
He showed me that
he was a merchant.

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him silently,
what did you sell?

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And he showed me what looked
like blankets stacked up.

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:13.780 align:middle line:84%
They were about this big
and white, stacked up.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And I described that, and
the son laughed, and he said,

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:19.155 align:middle line:90%
he ran a newsstand.

00:18:19.155 --> 00:18:20.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were newspapers.

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:21.827 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: They
were newspapers.

00:18:21.827 --> 00:18:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, your dad just
said, clear as day, I never

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:26.200 align:middle line:90%
missed a day.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And he said, he literally
worked 365 days a year.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.400 align:middle line:84%
But the best moment,
George, was when I said,

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:37.300 align:middle line:84%
now your husband's showing
me, like, if he shaved,

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.270 align:middle line:84%
all these little hairs
would be on the counter,

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:40.930 align:middle line:90%
and you would sweep them up.

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And he says, you
have them, the hairs.

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:48.250 align:middle line:84%
This woman, she was very
quiet and demure and shy.

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:52.210 align:middle line:84%
She just-- she went like this,
and she said, I have them.

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:54.630 align:middle line:90%
I asked him to tell you that.

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She saved his shavings.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: She saved
his hair and asked him

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.210 align:middle line:84%
before the reading, talk
about that so I know it's you.

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:04.170 align:middle line:90%
I get the goosebumps.

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:08.767 align:middle line:84%
If I ever lose the
awe of how spirit

00:19:08.767 --> 00:19:10.350 align:middle line:84%
gets their messages
through, then it's

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:11.505 align:middle line:90%
time for me to hang up.

00:19:11.505 --> 00:19:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
you explain this?

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:13.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Oh.

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why does it happen?

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.760 align:middle line:90%
How does it happen?

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: It happens because
we're not only physical beings.

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Look at the body
through a microscope,

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:25.410 align:middle line:84%
and it breaks down into
nonphysical reality, frequencies

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:27.820 align:middle line:84%
that carry energy
and information.

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:31.620 align:middle line:90%
And we are this consciousness.

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:35.050 align:middle line:84%
We are arising from one
field of consciousness.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Call it consciousness
or awareness, the mind.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And so we use that awareness
and intention to simply match

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:49.430 align:middle line:84%
frequencies with a being who's
still here, who's not in a body.

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:50.230 align:middle line:90%
It's stunning.

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:53.230 align:middle line:84%
But when you understand
that it's possible,

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:55.640 align:middle line:84%
the belief opens you
to the awareness.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:56.440 align:middle line:90%
We can do it.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And then you learn to set
aside your normal thoughts

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:04.530 align:middle line:84%
and sensations and
notice what stands out

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:07.030 align:middle line:90%
in response to your intention.

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Commander, who is Wolf.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:11.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Oh my gosh.

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:13.950 align:middle line:84%
Wolf is a young man
named Mike Pasakarnis

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:16.970 align:middle line:84%
who was struck and killed by
lightning like my daughter.

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:17.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:19.420 align:middle line:84%
What are the odds
of this happening?

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:26.160 align:middle line:10%
>>GIESEMANN: Well, Wolf is
such a unique soul because he--

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.960 align:middle line:10%
it's hard to believe, but I've
written a story about him.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.190 align:middle line:10%
It's called Wolf's Message.

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:31.565 align:middle line:10%
And we're actually
in the process

00:20:31.565 --> 00:20:34.320 align:middle line:10%
of filming this documentary
right now because his story has

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.350 align:middle line:10%
to be told.

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:41.650 align:middle line:10%
Because Wolf left irrefutable
proof that we are souls now.

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:44.410 align:middle line:10%
And somebody once
told me, don't ever

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:47.530 align:middle line:10%
tell anybody you have proof of
this because the skeptics will

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:48.800 align:middle line:10%
eat you alive.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.870 align:middle line:90%
I don't go up against skeptics.

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:52.580 align:middle line:90%
I simply provide the evidence.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:54.295 align:middle line:84%
And the evidence
that Wolf left--

00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let it
stand for itself.

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:56.545 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: It does.

00:20:56.545 --> 00:20:59.030 align:middle line:84%
He was sitting at a cafe,
said to his friends,

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:00.500 align:middle line:90%
I have to go now.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And he stood up and walked
away, walked to this tree

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:06.380 align:middle line:84%
in a cemetery in
Plymouth, Massachusetts,

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.080 align:middle line:90%
where he used to meditate.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.430 align:middle line:84%
That's where he was
struck by lightning.

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:13.480 align:middle line:84%
When his family was
let into his apartment,

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.510 align:middle line:84%
they saw a piece of artwork
that had not been on the wall

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.710 align:middle line:84%
two days before because
his dad was there.

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:22.330 align:middle line:84%
It was a poem that
ends with the line,

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:27.380 align:middle line:84%
"It's time for the light
of nature to free my soul."

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.145 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
exactly what happened.

00:21:29.145 --> 00:21:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: And
sitting in front

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.470 align:middle line:84%
of that picture on
the wall was a chair

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:35.230 align:middle line:84%
that he had moved as
if to invite somebody

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:36.950 align:middle line:90%
to sit and look at it.

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And across the wall
from that poem,

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.690 align:middle line:84%
he had cut out his
favorite T-shirt

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:47.690 align:middle line:84%
and tacked it to the wall
with a lightning bolt on it.

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:48.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:50.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: And then
he came back to me.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:50.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --it happened?

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Before it happened.

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:52.700 align:middle line:90%
One day before it happened.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.900 align:middle line:84%
So his soul knew this
was going to happen.

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:59.960 align:middle line:84%
He came back to me in a surprise
visit in the middle of the night

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.540 align:middle line:84%
and gave me all kinds of
evidence about himself.

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Then I did a reading
for his parents.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:08.110 align:middle line:10%
And ultimately, he
led us to a message

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:11.140 align:middle line:10%
that he has for all of humanity,
which is why his story is called

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.320 align:middle line:10%
Wolf's Message.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.005 align:middle line:10%
And I'm just very excited that
I have the honor of sharing it

00:22:15.005 --> 00:22:17.630 align:middle line:10%
through this documentary that's
coming out and through the book

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:18.830 align:middle line:10%
Wolf's Message.

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:22.250 align:middle line:10%
Because people read it, they
open up as they're reading it.

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:24.470 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like the
book is an oracle.

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:28.630 align:middle line:84%
I hear from people all the time
reading this book and saying,

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:29.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm tuning in.

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:30.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm sensing Wolf.

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:31.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm sensing my loved ones.

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:32.840 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing story.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What was his message?

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:37.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: His message
is that we, as a species,

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:40.190 align:middle line:90%
humanity is out of balance.

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:44.260 align:middle line:84%
We're too much in the head
and not enough in the heart.

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:47.320 align:middle line:84%
We're tuning in objectively
but not subjectively

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.490 align:middle line:90%
to our inner world.

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:52.250 align:middle line:84%
When we can balance the two,
that's when we find freedom.

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did the parents
feel about the reading?

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:56.510 align:middle line:90%
Once you did it.

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: Oh my gosh,
they were blown away.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.770 align:middle line:84%
They said, there's no
doubt that's our son.

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:02.210 align:middle line:90%
It's changed their life.

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:04.480 align:middle line:84%
His stepmother is going
through a battle with cancer,

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:08.680 align:middle line:84%
and she's completely at peace
with that, whereas before,

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.420 align:middle line:84%
would have been
knocked off balance.

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:11.200 align:middle line:90%
Balance is one of the words--

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.780 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Yeah.

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:16.960 align:middle line:84%
She was a scientist
and a doctor.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.540 align:middle line:90%
But who can deny that evidence?

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Suzanne, what
is the awakened way?

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.480 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Oh.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:28.510 align:middle line:10%
This is the main teaching that
I distilled from Wolf's message,

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:30.760 align:middle line:10%
really boils down
to three principles

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:32.620 align:middle line:10%
that we're not only human.

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Wolf's message shows that,
that we are souls and human,

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:39.940 align:middle line:84%
that we're part of one big
web connecting all of us

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:44.680 align:middle line:84%
and all that is, and that this
force that connects us really is

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:48.400 align:middle line:84%
love because where there's no
separation, we call that love.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And so the awakened way is you
live your life in accordance

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:57.070 align:middle line:84%
with those beliefs, and you
realize that you are always

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:59.270 align:middle line:90%
connected to guidance.

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:02.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's living a
consciously connected life

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.510 align:middle line:90%
and feeling divinely guided.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.910 align:middle line:84%
I have a whole book
called The Awakened Way,

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:12.400 align:middle line:84%
and it's filled with stories and
evidence but mostly practical

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.410 align:middle line:84%
tools that we can
all use to find

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:16.700 align:middle line:90%
that connection and the peace.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.770 align:middle line:84%
What's the importance of
evidence-based mediumship,

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:22.190 align:middle line:90%
and what is that?

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: Well,
it's very simple.

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:26.685 align:middle line:84%
If Ty and I had gone to
that medium when I said,

00:24:26.685 --> 00:24:28.810 align:middle line:84%
come on, honey, we're going
to go see a medium when

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.270 align:middle line:84%
we wanted to hear from Susan
and she didn't know anything

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:32.260 align:middle line:90%
about us.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.070 align:middle line:90%
If she had said--

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:36.520 align:middle line:84%
looking at our age,
knowing we probably

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.080 align:middle line:84%
have grandparents across
the veil-- if she had said,

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.400 align:middle line:90%
oh, there's an old woman here.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.733 align:middle line:90%
I believe it's your grandmother.

00:24:41.733 --> 00:24:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And she passed when
her heart stopped.

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:47.050 align:middle line:90%
And she loves you so much.

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:51.070 align:middle line:84%
That would not have
changed our lives.

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:53.180 align:middle line:90%
But what she shared with us--

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.880 align:middle line:84%
evidence, verifiable
information about Susan

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:59.470 align:middle line:84%
she couldn't have known
including this little baby boy.

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:01.310 align:middle line:90%
That transformed our lives.

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:04.600 align:middle line:84%
So evidence-based
mediumship requires

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:09.370 align:middle line:84%
that the medium share
information about the client's

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:11.650 align:middle line:90%
loved ones that they don't know.

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:16.180 align:middle line:84%
My teaching for students that
learn this always tells them

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:20.320 align:middle line:84%
that the test of a good reading
is that you leave that session

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:24.110 align:middle line:84%
and you say, oh my god,
that was my loved one.

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:24.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:26.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Yeah.

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:29.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You give us a clip of
an evidence-based mediumship.

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.320 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: OK.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:36.130 align:middle line:90%


00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.090 align:middle line:84%
He's handing you a
gift for some reason.

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:39.370 align:middle line:90%
Now, let me see what it is.

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:42.560 align:middle line:90%


00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.310 align:middle line:90%
Opens it up, and a dove--

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:45.360 align:middle line:90%
oh, I get it.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.160 align:middle line:90%
[GASPS]

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:50.270 align:middle line:84%
Opens it up, and
a dove flies out.

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:53.330 align:middle line:90%
[GASPS] Oh, no, really?

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:55.610 align:middle line:90%
>>TERESA: The doves.

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:56.615 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: I get it.

00:25:56.615 --> 00:25:57.740 align:middle line:90%
>>TERESA: Can you see that?

00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:59.250 align:middle line:90%
With the heart in the middle.

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:00.510 align:middle line:90%
That's him and his brother.

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:02.360 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how could that be?

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.810 align:middle line:90%
I got it on his birthday.

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:07.070 align:middle line:84%
I walked into JCPenney,
and it was just there,

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:08.785 align:middle line:90%
17 days after he died.

00:26:08.785 --> 00:26:10.907 align:middle line:90%


00:26:10.907 --> 00:26:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: Now, that's a
beautiful moment right there.

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:22.820 align:middle line:90%


00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:25.903 align:middle line:84%
>>TERESA: I was hoping this
was going to be the sign.

00:26:25.903 --> 00:26:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: And I
look and I get-- now,

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:29.210 align:middle line:84%
this is another
teaching moment forever

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:33.510 align:middle line:84%
and ever because you have no
idea where he's going with that.

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And instead of just showing me
a dove, he hands that to you

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:38.370 align:middle line:90%
as a gift box.

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:42.530 align:middle line:84%
This is why I report everything
exactly as it comes through.

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:46.950 align:middle line:84%
So you see how beautifully
that came from your son

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:49.735 align:middle line:84%
and not just pulling data
out of the air, right?

00:26:49.735 --> 00:26:52.040 align:middle line:90%
He gave you a gift.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.510 align:middle line:84%
I love you, ma, he
says, clear as day.

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:55.640 align:middle line:90%
Clear as day.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.555 align:middle line:90%
>>TERESA: OK.

00:26:57.555 --> 00:26:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we
elaborate for Suzanne

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:01.170 align:middle line:90%
on that entire experience.

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: Well, this
woman, Teresa, actually

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:05.160 align:middle line:90%
had two sons across the veil.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.403 align:middle line:84%
I had done a reading
for her years earlier,

00:27:07.403 --> 00:27:08.820 align:middle line:84%
and she asked for
another reading.

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:11.910 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize that another
son had passed since then.

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:13.195 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are those odds?

00:27:13.195 --> 00:27:14.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Oh yeah.

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.870 align:middle line:90%
It was tough.

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:18.387 align:middle line:84%
But that's why she had two
doves in that necklace.

00:27:18.387 --> 00:27:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One for each one.

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:21.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: For each one.

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:27.380 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's a real-time,
two-way conversation

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:29.550 align:middle line:84%
with these loved
ones across the veil.

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:31.800 align:middle line:84%
It frustrates me that
I don't see their face,

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.200 align:middle line:84%
but I see gestures
and I see images

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.490 align:middle line:90%
and I hear them talk to me.

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:37.230 align:middle line:90%
And I feel their personality.

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:39.290 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I take
on their gestures

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:41.910 align:middle line:84%
so clearly that the loved
ones look at me and they say,

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:43.080 align:middle line:90%
you look just like him.

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:46.730 align:middle line:84%
Like this one that I have where
I have this woman's grandfather,

00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:48.780 align:middle line:84%
and I say, he's
talking like this.

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:50.610 align:middle line:90%
He's going, hrrmp, hrrmp, hrrmp.

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And she sent me
this photo, and he's

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:54.200 align:middle line:90%
sitting there just like that.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:57.090 align:middle line:84%
It cracks me up because
the reason this works--

00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:59.090 align:middle line:84%
and you asked about
how it's possible-- is

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:02.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm a field of energy, and
so are those in spirit.

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And I invite them
to blend with me.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.720 align:middle line:90%
So we become one.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.580 align:middle line:84%
That's that oneness
I talked about.

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:12.260 align:middle line:84%
So I simply have to report
what's not my stuff.

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:14.863 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
test of good mediumship?

00:28:14.863 --> 00:28:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: Oh,
that's what I told you.

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:20.700 align:middle line:84%
It's that your client says
that was my loved one.

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Not, well, I think
they had them.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.640 align:middle line:84%
I've had plenty of readings
myself with other mediums,

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.350 align:middle line:84%
and you're like, well,
it could have been them,

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:30.030 align:middle line:90%
but that's kind of generic.

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:32.870 align:middle line:84%
So we go for gold nugget
items like that clip

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:33.840 align:middle line:90%
that we just watched.

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.020 align:middle line:84%
They're the things
you just can't deny,

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:37.980 align:middle line:90%
the finding the woman's hair.

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:39.720 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
find that online.

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.540 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to know
those things about the person.

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And you capture their
essence beautifully.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.110 align:middle line:90%
That's a test.

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are three ways
to test this authenticity,

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:49.380 align:middle line:90%
aren't there?

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:50.730 align:middle line:90%
Maybe more?

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:51.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Oh, many ways.

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Some of my favorite
are the things

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.460 align:middle line:84%
that the medium
couldn't possibly know.

00:28:56.460 --> 00:29:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And then for me, it's things
that haven't yet happened.

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:05.640 align:middle line:84%
So that really requires
trust on everybody's mind.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:08.450 align:middle line:84%
For example, one woman
across the veil, her mother

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:09.930 align:middle line:90%
showed me a green plant.

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:11.670 align:middle line:90%
It was very clearly a lily.

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:13.110 align:middle line:90%
I described it-- white flowers.

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:14.485 align:middle line:84%
She said, I don't
recognize that.

00:29:14.485 --> 00:29:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I know I'm
supposed to talk about this.

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:18.360 align:middle line:90%
She's showing it to me.

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, five minutes after
the reading, my phone

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.570 align:middle line:90%
rang, and it was my client.

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:23.988 align:middle line:84%
She said there was a flower
delivered to the house

00:29:23.988 --> 00:29:25.530 align:middle line:84%
while I was in the
middle of reading,

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:27.238 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't want to
answer the doorbell.

00:29:27.238 --> 00:29:28.410 align:middle line:90%
It was a white lily.

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:31.500 align:middle line:84%
Her mom had seen that being
delivered to the front porch.

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:35.070 align:middle line:84%
So things that haven't yet
happened are very good evidence.

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And then I love when a
medium picks up things

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:41.297 align:middle line:84%
that the client doesn't know
but somebody else knows.

00:29:41.297 --> 00:29:42.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And corroborates.

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Right.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:47.400 align:middle line:84%
This shows that I'm not just
reading somebody's mind.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your stepdaughter,
is she always with you now?

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: She
says, we're always

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:55.320 align:middle line:84%
with everybody, all
of us, because we're

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.920 align:middle line:90%
part of that one field.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.650 align:middle line:84%
But it's kind of like we're
sitting on a living room couch,

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:03.190 align:middle line:84%
and maybe your loved one's doing
one thing here in physical form,

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:04.300 align:middle line:90%
and you're doing another.

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:05.470 align:middle line:90%
Somebody's knitting over here.

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:06.270 align:middle line:90%
Somebody's reading.

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:07.420 align:middle line:90%
Somebody's watching TV.

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And then you start paying
attention to each other

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.530 align:middle line:84%
when there's something
to converse about,

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:13.650 align:middle line:84%
but you're not really
aware of their presence

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:15.040 align:middle line:90%
until you need to be.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Our loved ones are living their
own lives in their next reality.

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And yet, all they have to
do is shift their focus.

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.360 align:middle line:90%
And we tune in to each other.

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
miraculous, isn't it?

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: It is.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:31.420 align:middle line:84%
It's life-changing, and that's
what I want everybody to know.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:32.560 align:middle line:90%
This is real.

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.460 align:middle line:90%
You can prove it.

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:36.530 align:middle line:84%
You can put your loved ones to
the test, and they don't mind.

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:40.233 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Suzanne, what are
after-death communications?

00:30:40.233 --> 00:30:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: These are the
ways that those in spirit

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.950 align:middle line:84%
let us know, without
the need of a medium,

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:48.710 align:middle line:84%
that they're around, such
as signs and synchronicities

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:53.350 align:middle line:84%
or snagging your attention
with just the right lyrics that

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:55.510 align:middle line:84%
are playing on the radio
that you need to hear.

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:58.850 align:middle line:84%
The song and the radio could
have been playing for hours.

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:02.170 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly, you're
caught, and you listen.

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's just what you needed
to hear because your loved

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:07.100 align:middle line:90%
ones catch your attention.

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:09.460 align:middle line:84%
So there are many ways
that those across the veil

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:11.930 align:middle line:90%
can communicate after death.

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:16.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, in my case, the
limo driver's name was Johnny.

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking
about that story

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:22.570 align:middle line:84%
that the psychic
had told me that he

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:26.330 align:middle line:84%
was laughing because you owed
him money, that kind of thing.

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:29.260 align:middle line:84%
I turned the radio
on, and a song

00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:31.813 align:middle line:84%
came on that I haven't
heard in 100 years.

00:31:31.813 --> 00:31:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Johnny Be Good.

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:34.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Johnny Guitar.

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:35.110 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Oh, Johnny Guitar.

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.910 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:38.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: (SINGING) Play
it again, my Johnny.

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.162 align:middle line:84%
What are the odds
of that happening?

00:31:40.162 --> 00:31:42.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: 100% when you
understand how this works.

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:43.170 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he send
that song to me?

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:47.565 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: No, he had you
turn the radio on just then,

00:31:47.565 --> 00:31:48.587 align:middle line:90%
knew what was playing.

00:31:48.587 --> 00:31:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He knew
what was coming down.

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:51.840 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Absolutely, yeah.

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:52.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Yeah.

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:54.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it scary?

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:55.260 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Never.

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:57.720 align:middle line:90%
Why would that be scary?

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.936 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, it's weird.

00:31:59.936 --> 00:32:02.385 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: [LAUGHS]
Different but it

00:32:02.385 --> 00:32:04.515 align:middle line:84%
has so much potential
for healing, for comfort.

00:32:04.515 --> 00:32:05.315 align:middle line:90%
For awe.

00:32:05.315 --> 00:32:08.100 align:middle line:90%


00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:13.770 align:middle line:84%
For awakening us, awakening us
to so much potential, so much

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:16.510 align:middle line:90%
possibility, so much wonder.

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:18.040 align:middle line:90%
And if anything, scary.

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.800 align:middle line:84%
That's just an
opportunity to look at it

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.730 align:middle line:84%
and say, why am
I afraid of this?

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:25.110 align:middle line:84%
My guides have given me
several frightening experiences

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:28.420 align:middle line:84%
in the dream state
and in meditation.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And they've, both times,
told me, just look at it.

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And it just flows
right through you.

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the difference
between evidence-based

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:39.590 align:middle line:90%
and messages and mediumship?

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: The
evidence are those things

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:42.520 align:middle line:90%
that we can validate.

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:48.210 align:middle line:84%
Messages sometimes can
be evidential but not

00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:49.180 align:middle line:90%
always provable.

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Perfect example
of a message is--

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.160 align:middle line:84%
it's beautiful here
in the afterlife.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm fine.

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:56.920 align:middle line:90%
Can't validate that.

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.750 align:middle line:90%
But it's a beautiful message.

00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:01.620 align:middle line:84%
But evidence is
factual information

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:03.460 align:middle line:90%
that we can verify here.

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:06.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
know it's not a trick?

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:07.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Don't know.

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:12.300 align:middle line:84%
So the bottom line is
it helpful in healing?

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:13.570 align:middle line:90%
That's all that matters.

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
the golden nugget?

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking about
the casino in Vegas.

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:20.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: A golden nugget is
my term for a piece of evidence

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:24.790 align:middle line:84%
that's so unique and so
specific to a person's loved one

00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:27.940 align:middle line:84%
that it changes their awareness
of the greater reality,

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:30.700 align:middle line:84%
that it just leaves them saying,
oh my god, that's my loved one.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.090 align:middle line:84%
For example, the young man
who showed me a toothpick that

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:34.710 align:middle line:84%
was always hanging
out of his mouth.

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And his mom said, oh
my god, everybody who

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:38.560 align:middle line:90%
knew him knew that toothpick.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.480 align:middle line:90%
That was his signature sign.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't guess that.

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:42.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: You
can't guess that.

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:43.930 align:middle line:90%
You can't know that.

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:47.430 align:middle line:90%
And I remember that woman.

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Everybody at work said,
something's different about you.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.310 align:middle line:90%
Have you changed your meds?

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:53.410 align:middle line:84%
She said, no, I had a
reading with a medium.

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:54.440 align:middle line:90%
My son is my new med.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:55.240 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you baffled
by the compelling evidence

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:00.415 align:middle line:84%
that keeps cropping
up with these stories?

00:34:00.415 --> 00:34:01.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Baffled?

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:02.932 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:34:02.932 --> 00:34:04.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm in awe of it.

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's going to keep
going because, for example,

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:08.920 align:middle line:84%
me, I said to my
guides, you know me,

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:10.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to do this
work unless you give me

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.940 align:middle line:90%
really good evidence.

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you get
it all the time now?

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: Yeah,
not every time.

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:18.000 align:middle line:84%
There are some readings I'll
have to call off because,

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.159 align:middle line:84%
for some reason, and there
are so many variables,

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:23.320 align:middle line:84%
the connection
isn't always there.

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:25.780 align:middle line:84%
But I rate readings kind
of like a cell phone.

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:27.449 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that was a
five-bar connection,

00:34:27.449 --> 00:34:28.900 align:middle line:90%
or that was four bars.

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Three bars is OK, but
anything less than that,

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:34.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to call it
off or maybe postpone.

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.219 align:middle line:84%
And if I don't maintain
four or five bars,

00:34:37.219 --> 00:34:40.159 align:middle line:84%
then I shouldn't
be doing this work.

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:41.360 align:middle line:90%
Same with any medium.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.124 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you glad
you've taken this path?

00:34:44.124 --> 00:34:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: I
tell people it was

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:47.449 align:middle line:84%
such an honor to
serve my country

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:51.170 align:middle line:84%
and especially witnessing
the higher levels as I did.

00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:53.389 align:middle line:84%
I got to fly on Air Force
1 with the president.

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:55.010 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how cool is that?

00:34:55.010 --> 00:35:00.580 align:middle line:84%
But nothing can compare with
the honor of showing people

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:02.260 align:middle line:90%
that love never dies.

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:03.740 align:middle line:90%
I never envisioned that.

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:04.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No regrets?

00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:06.110 align:middle line:90%
You're hesitating.

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: I'm hesitating--

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:06.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --hesitating.

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:07.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN:
--because I don't want

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:08.930 align:middle line:90%
to talk off the top of my head.

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:11.560 align:middle line:84%
I want to make sure I
don't have any regrets.

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.870 align:middle line:84%
My only regret is that
I didn't realize sooner

00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:15.290 align:middle line:90%
how connected we all are.

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:17.410 align:middle line:90%
But no regrets about this work.

00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Perhaps a
different way of learning

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:24.040 align:middle line:84%
would have come your way instead
of the tragedy you went through.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: And yet, I wouldn't
change any of this because I see

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:29.440 align:middle line:90%
it--

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.010 align:middle line:90%
it is all part of a plan.

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Because of my
military background,

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:36.700 align:middle line:84%
people will listen and
give me an ear where

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:39.830 align:middle line:84%
they might have just
dismissed me if I just said,

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:40.630 align:middle line:90%
oh, I'm a medium.

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:42.130 align:middle line:84%
But they hear about
that background,

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:44.360 align:middle line:84%
and they say, OK, I'll give
you a minute of my time.

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:45.980 align:middle line:90%
And then they hear the evidence.

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And so Susan's passing
was devastating for us.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:55.250 align:middle line:84%
But my YouTube videos have
reached 12 million views.

00:35:55.250 --> 00:36:01.370 align:middle line:84%
That's 12 million lives at least
touched by Susan's passing.

00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:03.290 align:middle line:90%
So this is all in her honor.

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And we're definitely
on a mission together.

00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:08.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How old was
when she was struck down?

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: 27.

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:10.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just a kid.

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Yeah.

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.825 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A whole life ahead.

00:36:12.825 --> 00:36:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: Yeah, but she's
still living to the fullest.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She's living
through you now, isn't she?

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Well, she's doing--

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:20.750 align:middle line:84%
she's living fully
across the veil.

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:22.210 align:middle line:90%
That's part of the main message.

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:23.480 align:middle line:90%
They're not lost.

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.070 align:middle line:90%
And they're not dead and gone.

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:28.900 align:middle line:84%
Their life continues fully
and fully aware of what

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:30.290 align:middle line:90%
goes on with us here.

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:32.660 align:middle line:84%
They know about the
birthdays, the graduations,

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:35.162 align:middle line:90%
the new children.

00:36:35.162 --> 00:36:36.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
much time we have,

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:40.755 align:middle line:84%
but I was just reminded
of this, an amazing one.

00:36:40.755 --> 00:36:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Susan just
told you something?

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: No, it was my
guides, reminded me of it.

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:45.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, go ahead, tell me.

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:46.427 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: I had
given a reading

00:36:46.427 --> 00:36:48.860 align:middle line:84%
for a man whose father
crossed the veil,

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:51.235 align:middle line:84%
showed me clinking glasses
and a pregnant wife.

00:36:51.235 --> 00:36:53.110 align:middle line:84%
I said, your dad knows
that you and your wife

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:54.110 align:middle line:90%
are going to have a baby.

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And he says, yeah, does
he know what it is?

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I do, but
I don't want to spoil--

00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:58.910 align:middle line:84%
he knows-- but I don't
want to spoil it.

00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:59.870 align:middle line:90%
He says, we know.

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:00.800 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, it's a boy.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.050 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yeah, it's a boy.

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:05.510 align:middle line:84%
So months later, completely
forgot about that reading.

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:08.000 align:middle line:84%
That man dropped in on me
while I'm riding my bike.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.490 align:middle line:90%
He said, call my son.

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:11.520 align:middle line:90%
They had the baby.

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.320 align:middle line:90%
I know about it.

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:14.440 align:middle line:84%
Let him know that
they named him--

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:16.010 align:middle line:90%
I know they named him after me.

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:18.740 align:middle line:84%
Let them know I know they
put it up on a billboard.

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:20.997 align:middle line:84%
So I stopped the bike, called
this guy who was in my--

00:37:20.997 --> 00:37:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You did not
know about this--

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: No, I didn't know.

00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --until
the spirit told you?

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:25.577 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Absolutely not.

00:37:25.577 --> 00:37:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is my point,
that dad in spirit

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:31.790 align:middle line:84%
knows about the
birth of the child.

00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:33.860 align:middle line:84%
His son was devastated
when dad had passed.

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:35.840 align:middle line:84%
He'll never know about
his grandchildren.

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.580 align:middle line:90%
Well, he knows all about him.

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Everybody in the
spirit world knows

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:43.850 align:middle line:84%
what's going on here because
they're still part of our lives.

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:45.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do they know?

00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: Because they're
tuned in to our channel

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:50.860 align:middle line:84%
much more easily than
we are to theirs.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's truly
remarkable, isn't it?

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: It is.

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:54.740 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever break
down and cry, Commander?

00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:58.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: I do.

00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:59.720 align:middle line:90%
My life isn't perfect, George.

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:02.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have my own
challenges, like everybody.

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:03.800 align:middle line:90%
But now I have tools.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't just suck it up anymore.

00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:08.770 align:middle line:84%
I have these awakened weight
tools that just bring me

00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:10.840 align:middle line:90%
to peace and centering--

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.260 align:middle line:90%
is beautiful.

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:14.150 align:middle line:90%
But I also cry from the emotion.

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:16.930 align:middle line:84%
There are times-- having
not been raised religious

00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:17.810 align:middle line:90%
and praying--

00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:19.220 align:middle line:84%
when I'll just
say to my husband,

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:20.840 align:middle line:84%
I have to go upstairs
and give thanks.

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And I will drop to my knees
for whatever miracle of the day

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:29.920 align:middle line:84%
happened because this world that
I've been blessed to open up to

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:31.700 align:middle line:90%
is so filled with love.

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I want
everybody to find,

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:38.510 align:middle line:84%
that connection that
will bring you to tears.

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:42.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always been told
that reincarnation does not

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:48.230 align:middle line:84%
stop a spirit from communicating
with us once it's moved on.

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:51.107 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like it separates
into two different entities.

00:38:51.107 --> 00:38:52.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: That's right.

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:54.565 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad you brought it up
because it's the number one

00:38:54.565 --> 00:38:56.120 align:middle line:90%
question my students ask me.

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:57.680 align:middle line:84%
People think it's
all or nothing.

00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:00.060 align:middle line:84%
You're this body and this
soul, and when you're gone--

00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --you're gone.

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:01.605 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: That's it.

00:39:01.605 --> 00:39:03.580 align:middle line:84%
If you then become
another life, we

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:05.300 align:middle line:90%
can't connect with who you were.

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Think of it more like
the soul has subsets,

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:10.520 align:middle line:90%
and that's each lifetime.

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And so that lifetime
is still going

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:14.860 align:middle line:84%
to be part of the
higher self, even

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:18.290 align:middle line:84%
if another aspect of that
soul has now reincarnated.

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:21.940 align:middle line:84%
So I, as a medium, could
tune into any of those lives

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:26.300 align:middle line:84%
if it serves the greater good
of the family that's here.

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:30.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you are arguing with
a skeptic about the evidence

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.190 align:middle line:90%
of mediumship--

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:33.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: I wouldn't be.

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:35.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would
you win the argument?

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: I would never
argue with a skeptic anymore.

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:37.740 align:middle line:90%
No way.

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:39.770 align:middle line:84%
I would just stop
and say, I appreciate

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:42.050 align:middle line:84%
and honor where you are
and your belief system now.

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:44.310 align:middle line:84%
If you'd like some evidence,
I'll share it with you.

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:45.710 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:46.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you'd move on?

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: Yeah,
that's where they are.

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:51.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been the most
satisfying aspect of all this

00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:53.330 align:middle line:90%
for you?

00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: I would say
the countless people who

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:02.870 align:middle line:84%
have said that my work
has changed their life

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:05.930 align:middle line:84%
or saved their
life because we're

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:08.600 align:middle line:84%
dealing with people who want
off the planet when a loved

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.010 align:middle line:90%
one passes.

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And we're able to show them
they're still right here

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:16.707 align:middle line:84%
and you can connect
with them yourself.

00:40:16.707 --> 00:40:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's wonderful.

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:18.722 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Yeah.

00:40:18.722 --> 00:40:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are the
critical keys to atonement?

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: Number
one is belief.

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:27.830 align:middle line:84%
You have to examine your BS,
which is your Belief System,

00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:30.690 align:middle line:84%
and say, do I really
believe this is possible?

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:32.990 align:middle line:84%
Do I really believe
there's an afterlife?

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:34.490 align:middle line:84%
In my book The
Awakened Way, we talk

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:36.540 align:middle line:84%
about the practice
of self-inquiry,

00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:40.820 align:middle line:84%
really questioning your beliefs
and so then upgrading it

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:42.870 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, I'm at
least willing to try.

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:44.340 align:middle line:90%
So belief and willingness.

00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
one is the intention

00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:49.560 align:middle line:84%
to make that connection
across the veil.

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:51.630 align:middle line:84%
So belief and
intention are critical.

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And once you are
in that mode, what happens?

00:40:55.470 --> 00:41:00.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: Well, then you
need to have a clear focus.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:04.440 align:middle line:84%
Shut out the outer world
and simply observe.

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:06.860 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, what
bubbles up in awareness

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:10.070 align:middle line:84%
and stands out from
your normal mind.

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we all need
mediums to communicate

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:13.633 align:middle line:90%
with the other side?

00:41:13.633 --> 00:41:14.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: We don't.

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:17.750 align:middle line:84%
If you want a clear
connection and perhaps

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:20.030 align:middle line:84%
a conversation and to hear
things that you may not

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:23.330 align:middle line:84%
be able to tune into, a medium
can be very helpful, especially

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:25.150 align:middle line:90%
in evidence-based medium.

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:28.770 align:middle line:90%
But we can-- oh, yeah.

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:30.910 align:middle line:84%
I am always-- my guides
are always guiding me.

00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:32.160 align:middle line:90%
They said, talk about.

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:33.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tapping you
on the shoulder, right?

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: Just this morning,
my newest assistant on my staff,

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:36.590 align:middle line:90%
Stephanie--

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:37.035 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Call this.

00:41:37.035 --> 00:41:37.835 align:middle line:90%
Tell them this.

00:41:37.835 --> 00:41:39.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Exactly.

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:41.170 align:middle line:84%
She shared with me a
breakthrough that she has.

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Her daughter passed
just a few years ago,

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:46.110 align:middle line:84%
and her other daughter
is in deep grief

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:49.360 align:middle line:84%
because she's not as open to
mediumship as Stephanie is.

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And Stephanie shared
that, in meditation,

00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:55.740 align:middle line:84%
she sensed her daughter, and
she practiced my tool of saying,

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:59.610 align:middle line:84%
Katie, tell me something
about your sister going

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:01.450 align:middle line:90%
on now that I couldn't know.

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And her daughter gave
her three clear things.

00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Stephanie's not a medium,
but she believed and set

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:11.730 align:middle line:84%
the intention of connecting and
wrote down these three things,

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:12.850 align:middle line:90%
called her daughter, who--

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:14.110 align:middle line:90%
I have to tell you.

00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:17.220 align:middle line:84%
She said, my daughter
dropped an F bomb

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:20.243 align:middle line:84%
when she heard what I said
because she was so stunned.

00:42:20.243 --> 00:42:21.160 align:middle line:90%
Mom, how do you know--

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We won't
do that right now.

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: No, no,
no, that's why I--

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:26.900 align:middle line:90%
say other words, right?

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:28.680 align:middle line:90%
But her daughter was so stunned.

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:32.670 align:middle line:84%
Mom, how can you know those
three things about me?

00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And she said, because
your sister told me.

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:36.570 align:middle line:90%
I felt her.

00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And Stephanie is just like I
used to be, just an ordinary--

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.680 align:middle line:84%
walking around, not aware that
we can all make this connection.

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.420 align:middle line:90%
And she's done the training.

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:47.468 align:middle line:90%
She's applying the tools.

00:42:47.468 --> 00:42:49.760 align:middle line:84%
This is what the book Mediumship
and The Awakened Way--

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:53.360 align:middle line:84%
and all of my training is
to lead us to this awareness

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.715 align:middle line:90%
that they're right here.

00:42:54.715 --> 00:42:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Suzanne, what do
you recommend to somebody

00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:01.190 align:middle line:84%
who has lost a loved
one and has this desire

00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:05.602 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with him or her
but doesn't know what to do?

00:43:05.602 --> 00:43:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: Well, first of all,
start talking to them right now.

00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, they already are
talking because they hear you.

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not you're making
a conscious connection,

00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:16.830 align:middle line:90%
talk with them from the heart.

00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:20.790 align:middle line:84%
Say what you would say if you
had the chance face to face.

00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And then I would begin
with my basic practice

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:26.260 align:middle line:84%
that I call the
Sip of the Divine.

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:30.220 align:middle line:84%
You can find it on YouTube under
No More Meditation Excuses.

00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:34.470 align:middle line:84%
Three minutes a day of
sitting and observing how

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:36.670 align:middle line:84%
thoughts and images
arise in your mind.

00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:39.630 align:middle line:90%
Ask one question a day.

00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:42.850 align:middle line:84%
Like I used to say, Susan,
reveal yourself to me.

00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:44.730 align:middle line:84%
Ask one question
of your loved one

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:46.900 align:middle line:84%
and notice if
anything stands out.

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:48.810 align:middle line:90%
That's where you start.

00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Through
your book Mediumship,

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:53.380 align:middle line:84%
can people learn how
to do what you do?

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GIESEMANN: You can
learn the basics,

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:57.220 align:middle line:84%
but then you have
to do the practice.

00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And please don't let anybody
think it might take three years.

00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:03.820 align:middle line:90%
I've had one woman, Patty--

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:06.870 align:middle line:84%
I have a full-length reading
online, actual evidence

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:09.510 align:middle line:84%
of the afterlife, so you
can see the evidence.

00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:13.000 align:middle line:10%
That woman Patty, the mother
of her daughter Lauren,

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.860 align:middle line:10%
had a breakthrough in just two
weeks connecting with Lauren

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:18.520 align:middle line:10%
and got evidence.

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:20.800 align:middle line:10%
It's so easy to think
we're making this up,

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:22.030 align:middle line:10%
but anybody can learn.

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:24.160 align:middle line:84%
We just don't know how
long it's going to take.

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:26.890 align:middle line:84%
So yes, you can learn
practices in the book.

00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:30.540 align:middle line:84%
You can alter your belief system
by reading the beautiful stories

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:31.870 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of it.

00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And then you need to sit and
create the right state of mind

00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:38.950 align:middle line:90%
to have that connection.

00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:41.658 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Suzanne, how can
people track your work?

00:44:41.658 --> 00:44:42.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GIESEMANN: Pretty easy.

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:44.770 align:middle line:10%

>>NOORY: Got to be honest, years
ago, I was a skeptic about this.

00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:02.940 align:middle line:84%
I didn't quite
understand how could

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:07.320 align:middle line:84%
somebody deal with the
other side, the afterlife,

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.240 align:middle line:90%
and be right.

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:12.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm now convinced with
people like Suzanne Giesemann

00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:14.560 align:middle line:90%
that it's the real deal.

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.980 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
Beyond Belief.
