picking up the phone,
tracking someone down--

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:12.599 align:middle line:90%

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.301 align:middle line:84%

you want to interview me?"

remind myself that, yes,

00:02:21.775 --> 00:02:24.644 align:middle line:84%
I'm working for this
mainstream publication

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:28.782 align:middle line:84%
and I sound legitimate to
them when I approach them.

00:02:28.782 --> 00:02:29.950 align:middle line:90%
So they'll respond.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.251 align:middle line:90%

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:41.361 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed Dr. Benjamin
Simon who was the psychiatrist

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:45.098 align:middle line:84%
of the Barney and Betty Hill
abduction case, the first case

00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:47.300 align:middle line:90%
that hit big mainstream media.

all of that just plateau turned

00:02:54.407 --> 00:02:57.177 align:middle line:84%
out to be a movie

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.448 align:middle line:90%
I just loved it.

00:03:01.448 --> 00:03:03.316 align:middle line:84%
But I will always remember
what Benjamin Simon,

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:04.718 align:middle line:90%
the psychiatrist, told me.

00:03:04.718 --> 00:03:06.286 align:middle line:90%
I was 21 years old.

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:08.355 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could find
that tape today.

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:12.359 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him specifically, I
said "Dr. Simon, were they lying

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.328 align:middle line:84%
to you about being
abducted, about these aliens?"

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:17.697 align:middle line:84%
And he said "No,
they weren't lying.

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:19.899 align:middle line:84%
They actually believed
what happened to them."

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:22.369 align:middle line:84%
He said, "George, let
me tell you right now,

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:24.237 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
happened to them.

00:03:24.237 --> 00:03:26.673 align:middle line:84%
I'm the psychiatrist
who hypnotized them

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:29.743 align:middle line:84%
and they told me these
things separately.

00:03:29.743 --> 00:03:31.645 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
happened to them.

00:03:31.645 --> 00:03:34.014 align:middle line:84%
But, to answer that
question again.

00:03:34.014 --> 00:03:37.951 align:middle line:90%
Were they lying, absolutely not.

00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:40.552 align:middle line:84%
Whatever happened to
them, whatever happened

00:03:40.552 --> 00:03:42.989 align:middle line:90%
to them, they believe it did."

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.424 align:middle line:90%
And that was a riveting story.

00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:47.394 align:middle line:90%
And I never forgot that, Lee.

00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:54.334 align:middle line:84%

1979, that was when NBC made

00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:57.437 align:middle line:84%
that movie with James Earl
Jones and Estelle Parsons,

00:03:57.437 --> 00:03:59.372 align:middle line:84%
and it was called
The UFO Incident.

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's right.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: And on the night
that it was aired on NBC,

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.350 align:middle line:84%
the network brought
in Betty Hill

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.753 align:middle line:84%
and Dr. Benjamin Simon
in from New England.

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:16.288 align:middle line:84%
And they invited
me and the three

00:04:16.288 --> 00:04:17.757 align:middle line:90%
of us sat in a screening room.

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:18.858 align:middle line:90%

00:04:18.858 --> 00:04:21.026 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: And we-- and
I sat there with them

00:04:21.026 --> 00:04:23.029 align:middle line:84%
as they watched the
movie for the first time.

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And I kept looking over and
Betty was crying because of--

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.034 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:04:28.034 --> 00:04:28.868 align:middle line:84%
You brought it all
back home again.

00:04:28.868 --> 00:04:30.070 align:middle line:90%
And Barney had passed by then.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.603 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yes.

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:31.137 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:04:31.137 --> 00:04:32.472 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yeah.

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:36.009 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and I was sorry because
in 1975 when I was working

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:40.447 align:middle line:84%
on a UFO documentary record,
that's when I met Betty.

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:41.481 align:middle line:90%
And I gone up to New Hampshire

00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:44.050 align:middle line:84%
and we spent a lot
of time together.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.352 align:middle line:90%
Very few people know.

00:04:45.352 --> 00:04:49.322 align:middle line:84%
One of the things about the
Hill case was on the night

00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:53.793 align:middle line:84%
of their experience,
in September 1961--

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:55.061 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Which happened
in New Hampshire?

00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:57.597 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: It was in New Hampshire,
just a few miles North

00:04:57.597 --> 00:04:59.165 align:middle line:90%
of where I went to college.

00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:00.200 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm from New Hampshire.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.601 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:03.269 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: And so we all knew about
the Barney and Betty Hill story.

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:07.073 align:middle line:84%
But I-- when I was-- I went
to the National Archives

00:05:07.073 --> 00:05:10.944 align:middle line:84%
in Washington when I was doing
some research for my UFO album,

00:05:10.944 --> 00:05:16.549 align:middle line:84%
and I found some old documents
and files, on microfilm.

00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:20.487 align:middle line:84%
That showed that on the
night of their abduction,

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:23.189 align:middle line:84%
the air force base in
Portsmouth, New Hampshire,

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:25.525 align:middle line:84%
further south, Ps
Air Force base.

00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:29.095 align:middle line:84%
They had picked up and
tracked on radar an object

00:05:29.095 --> 00:05:30.964 align:middle line:90%
in the White Mountains.

00:05:30.964 --> 00:05:34.267 align:middle line:84%
And then they also tracked it,
later on, when it was leaving.

00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:35.101 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: How about that?

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:36.102 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: And I printed out the--

00:05:36.102 --> 00:05:37.771 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Yeah, all
during that time span.

00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:38.738 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yeah.

00:05:38.738 --> 00:05:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And so they actually
had something.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.177 align:middle line:84%
So that's like one of the
little pieces of the puzzle

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:45.345 align:middle line:84%
of the Betty and
Barney Hill case.

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:46.613 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: When you were in
that little green room--

00:05:46.613 --> 00:05:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yeah.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.948 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: -- with Betty
and Dr. Simon,

00:05:48.948 --> 00:05:50.382 align:middle line:90%
did he say anything to you?

00:05:50.382 --> 00:05:52.519 align:middle line:84%
Did it echo what I
interviewed him about?

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:53.887 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: He was a very quiet man.

00:05:53.887 --> 00:05:54.854 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: He was.

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:56.022 align:middle line:84%
And then he died
shortly after that?

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:57.056 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yes.

00:05:57.056 --> 00:06:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And he wouldn't just
offer his opinion.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.394 align:middle line:90%
You had to ask--

00:06:01.394 --> 00:06:02.028 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: You have to
pull it out of him.

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:03.263 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yeah.

00:06:03.263 --> 00:06:05.432 align:middle line:84%
And I remember asking pretty
much what you did, like,

00:06:05.432 --> 00:06:06.666 align:middle line:84%
you know, "Did you
believe their story

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:08.601 align:middle line:84%
and is what they went
through credible?"

00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:10.804 align:middle line:84%
And he says "Yes
it was credible."

00:06:10.804 --> 00:06:12.305 align:middle line:84%
Because what I was
trying to get at was

00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:15.508 align:middle line:84%
that he did separate
hypnotic session--

00:06:15.508 --> 00:06:16.342 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Absolutely.

00:06:16.342 --> 00:06:17.177 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: -- regression sessions.

00:06:17.177 --> 00:06:18.011 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: And they both matched.

00:06:18.011 --> 00:06:18.611 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: And they both matched.

00:06:18.611 --> 00:06:19.546 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:20.847 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: And I asked
him about that.

00:06:20.847 --> 00:06:23.783 align:middle line:84%
I said "Is that something
in psychiatry that's common?

00:06:23.783 --> 00:06:27.687 align:middle line:84%
That people who are married
or who love each other,

00:06:27.687 --> 00:06:31.257 align:middle line:84%
will they have shared dreams or
shared nightmares like that?"

00:06:31.257 --> 00:06:34.594 align:middle line:84%
And he says "Very
occasionally, very rarely,

00:06:34.594 --> 00:06:39.666 align:middle line:84%
but nothing to this
extent with the details."

00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:42.168 align:middle line:84%
Because, also, what
happened was when Betty

00:06:42.168 --> 00:06:44.838 align:middle line:84%
and Barney were taken aboard,
whatever this thing was

00:06:44.838 --> 00:06:46.105 align:middle line:90%
that they were taken aboard.

00:06:46.105 --> 00:06:49.309 align:middle line:84%
They were separated and
went to different rooms.

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:50.108 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's right.

00:06:50.108 --> 00:06:51.478 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: So they didn't know--

00:06:51.478 --> 00:06:52.612 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: They didn't know what
the other one was going through.

00:06:52.612 --> 00:06:53.413 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yeah.

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:53.980 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's a great story.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:54.647 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yeah.

00:06:54.647 --> 00:06:56.015 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It really is.

00:06:56.015 --> 00:06:58.518 align:middle line:84%
The United Nations, what are
they doing about the possibility

00:06:58.518 --> 00:07:02.121 align:middle line:90%
of ET visitations or UFOs coming

00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:04.657 align:middle line:84%
down to [inaudible]
or even attacking us?

00:07:04.657 --> 00:07:05.792 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:08.294 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: Well, first of
all, if they're going

00:07:08.294 --> 00:07:10.897 align:middle line:84%
to attack us why
hasn't it happened yet?

00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:11.531 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: True.

00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:12.999 align:middle line:90%
I agree. I agree.

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:16.736 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: You know if people
have been seeing saucer-shaped

00:07:16.736 --> 00:07:19.639 align:middle line:84%
objects since the days when
they were painting them

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:22.342 align:middle line:90%
on cave walls, OK.

00:07:22.342 --> 00:07:24.577 align:middle line:84%
Then why haven't they
come down to eat us?

00:07:24.577 --> 00:07:25.378 align:middle line:90%
What's the problem?

00:07:25.378 --> 00:07:26.713 align:middle line:90%
Here's the main cause.

00:07:26.713 --> 00:07:28.515 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: What if they are and
we just don't know about it?

00:07:28.515 --> 00:07:29.781 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Well--

00:07:29.781 --> 00:07:31.684 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: We have a hundred
thousand, 200,000 people missing

00:07:31.684 --> 00:07:33.686 align:middle line:84%
from this planet
every year, gone.

00:07:33.686 --> 00:07:34.921 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows where they are.

00:07:34.921 --> 00:07:37.824 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: If that-- if
that is a true statistic

00:07:37.824 --> 00:07:41.561 align:middle line:84%
and if the governments of the
planet know this to be true.

00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:44.797 align:middle line:84%
And maybe in their ultimate
wisdom they feel, well,

00:07:44.797 --> 00:07:46.733 align:middle line:84%
we really can't let
the public know

00:07:46.733 --> 00:07:48.201 align:middle line:90%
because this would induce panic.

00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:49.602 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It would.

00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:53.806 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: It would cause problems
with socioeconomic situations--

00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:55.074 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Control.

00:07:55.074 --> 00:07:57.076 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: -- the religion,
who's really in control here?

00:07:57.076 --> 00:07:58.611 align:middle line:90%
Our mutual friend--

00:07:58.611 --> 00:08:00.113 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Does it question God?

00:08:00.113 --> 00:08:01.514 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Right.

00:08:01.514 --> 00:08:05.885 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Nick Pope of the UK who
used to run their UFO office--

00:08:05.885 --> 00:08:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Right, for
the British Ministry.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.354 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: For the Ministry
of Defense.

00:08:08.354 --> 00:08:12.625 align:middle line:84%
Told me that they used to
have a program they call Spin

00:08:12.625 --> 00:08:14.160 align:middle line:90%
and Dirty Tricks.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.162 align:middle line:84%
And I said "What is this
Spin and Dirty Tricks?"

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:17.230 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: What was that?

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.531 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: He said "We
were told that we had

00:08:19.531 --> 00:08:20.934 align:middle line:90%
to do whatever we could

00:08:20.934 --> 00:08:23.803 align:middle line:84%
to debunk all UFO
stories that came across--

00:08:23.803 --> 00:08:24.537 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: All the time.

00:08:24.537 --> 00:08:25.772 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: All the time.

00:08:25.772 --> 00:08:27.640 align:middle line:84%
"We had to make up stuff
that would make it go away."

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.375 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Why
would you do that?"

00:08:29.375 --> 00:08:32.712 align:middle line:84%
And he said "Because
the government,"

00:08:32.712 --> 00:08:34.479 align:middle line:84%
and I suspect the
United States government.

00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:37.950 align:middle line:84%
He would say, "The
government didn't want to get

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:41.054 align:middle line:84%
into a situation where
they had to tell the public

00:08:41.054 --> 00:08:44.891 align:middle line:84%
that there were things
operating in our skies

00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:46.593 align:middle line:90%
that we had no control over."

00:08:46.593 --> 00:08:47.126 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:08:47.126 --> 00:08:47.660 align:middle line:90%
Good or bad.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:48.528 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yeah.

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:49.262 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:08:49.262 --> 00:08:50.096 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yeah.

00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:51.764 align:middle line:90%
Best to keep it all underwater.

00:08:51.764 --> 00:08:53.232 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: So, deny, deny, deny.

00:08:53.232 --> 00:08:54.133 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yeah.

00:08:54.133 --> 00:08:55.201 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I mean--

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:56.369 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Well, remember
the Churchill Memo

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:57.537 align:middle line:90%
from World War II?

00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:59.005 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: Yes, he said
something like what are--

00:08:59.005 --> 00:09:00.573 align:middle line:84%
what's going on with all
these flying saucers?

00:09:00.573 --> 00:09:02.275 align:middle line:84%
I want to know what's
happening with these things.

00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:03.643 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:09:03.643 --> 00:09:06.279 align:middle line:84%
And they told him once, "We
believe we're being visited."

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:08.381 align:middle line:90%
He said "We will not disclose

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:10.783 align:middle line:84%
that because I'm
afraid it will break

00:09:10.783 --> 00:09:14.887 align:middle line:84%
down civilization the way
we know it, and religions."

00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:16.923 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't want to go there.

00:09:16.923 --> 00:09:17.957 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yeah.

00:09:17.957 --> 00:09:21.694 align:middle line:84%
So if it all comes
back to what's going

00:09:21.694 --> 00:09:23.596 align:middle line:90%
on with the United Nations.

00:09:23.596 --> 00:09:27.133 align:middle line:84%
I have to believe that these
are not stupid people running

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:31.738 align:middle line:84%
that show over there that
there has to be some knowledge

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:34.774 align:middle line:84%
of what's happening
from various countries.

00:09:34.774 --> 00:09:39.145 align:middle line:84%
And that there probably is
a behind-the-scenes movement

00:09:39.145 --> 00:09:43.016 align:middle line:84%
to at least put some kind of
preparations together when

00:09:43.016 --> 00:09:45.218 align:middle line:90%
and if it does get out of hand.

00:09:45.218 --> 00:09:45.785 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: True.

00:09:45.785 --> 00:09:46.452 align:middle line:90%
And it could.

00:09:46.452 --> 00:09:47.687 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: And it could.

00:09:47.687 --> 00:09:51.591 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Here's the other thing
that bothers me, George.

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:53.960 align:middle line:84%
People say, well, you
know, "Why aren't--

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.229 align:middle line:84%
why aren't we not
being told about UFOs?"

00:09:56.229 --> 00:09:59.832 align:middle line:84%
My problem is I'm not
blaming the President

00:09:59.832 --> 00:10:02.435 align:middle line:84%
or the United Nations or the
governments of the world,

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:04.637 align:middle line:84%
I put the blame on
their shoulders.

00:10:04.637 --> 00:10:05.972 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Why?

00:10:05.972 --> 00:10:08.708 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: Because if they are
in control over what they do,

00:10:08.708 --> 00:10:12.145 align:middle line:84%
where they go, who they talk to,
who they pick up, whatever it is

00:10:12.145 --> 00:10:17.150 align:middle line:84%
that they do, then whatever
their agenda is of being here--

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:18.451 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And it could
be one of many.

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:19.686 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yes.

00:10:19.686 --> 00:10:25.191 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, apparently,
a mask showing

00:10:25.191 --> 00:10:28.661 align:middle line:84%
of themselves ain't it because
it would've happened before.

00:10:28.661 --> 00:10:35.635 align:middle line:84%
So I blame them for a lot of the
problems that are going on here.

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:38.771 align:middle line:84%
People's lives have been ruined
because they dared to speak

00:10:38.771 --> 00:10:41.040 align:middle line:84%
out about something that
they saw in the sky.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.375 align:middle line:84%
And nobody seems
to care about that.

00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:44.410 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: But maybe there were
[inaudible] enough, Lee,

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.979 align:middle line:84%
because they know if
they publicly came

00:10:46.979 --> 00:10:50.783 align:middle line:84%
down that this planet
would lose it.

00:10:50.783 --> 00:10:52.118 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:10:52.118 --> 00:10:54.587 align:middle line:84%
I would say every coast to
coast listener could handle it.

00:10:54.587 --> 00:10:56.456 align:middle line:84%
I would say people
who read your columns

00:10:56.456 --> 00:10:58.858 align:middle line:84%
in the Huffington
Post could handle it.

00:10:58.858 --> 00:11:02.028 align:middle line:90%
Probably would say, "I knew it."

00:11:02.028 --> 00:11:04.731 align:middle line:84%
But I think the tremendous
majority

00:11:04.731 --> 00:11:10.737 align:middle line:84%
of these seven billion people on
this planet would just lose it.

00:11:10.737 --> 00:11:14.307 align:middle line:84%
And it would destroy
religions even though there's a

00:11:14.307 --> 00:11:15.608 align:middle line:90%
higher power.

00:11:15.608 --> 00:11:18.578 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure if we had a chance
one day to interview ETs--

00:11:18.578 --> 00:11:19.946 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yeah.

00:11:19.946 --> 00:11:21.647 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: -- they would tell us
"We're still searching for God."

00:11:21.647 --> 00:11:22.415 align:middle line:90%
as we are.

00:11:22.415 --> 00:11:23.216 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yeah.

00:11:23.216 --> 00:11:24.417 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: I think that would--

00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:28.321 align:middle line:84%
but I honestly believe
that if ETs publicly came

00:11:28.321 --> 00:11:30.757 align:middle line:84%
down that this planet would
be a different planet,

00:11:30.757 --> 00:11:32.725 align:middle line:84%
might be a better
planet, you know?

00:11:32.725 --> 00:11:33.893 align:middle line:90%
I think we'd all get together

00:11:33.893 --> 00:11:35.762 align:middle line:84%
and say "What are
we fighting for?

00:11:35.762 --> 00:11:39.031 align:middle line:84%
Why are we doing this when
we have brothers and sisters

00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:41.667 align:middle line:84%
out here, probably
all over the place?"

00:11:41.667 --> 00:11:44.003 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason
I think they think

00:11:44.003 --> 00:11:45.571 align:middle line:90%
that this planet would lose it.

00:11:45.571 --> 00:11:48.808 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: Well, here's
another thing to consider.

00:11:48.808 --> 00:11:54.881 align:middle line:84%
How can you and I sit here
and wonder what they think?

00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:59.252 align:middle line:84%
We-- if they're thousands
of years ahead

00:11:59.252 --> 00:12:00.753 align:middle line:90%
of us technologically--

00:12:00.753 --> 00:12:01.821 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Millions.

00:12:01.821 --> 00:12:02.955 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: -- or millions,
then they could be

00:12:02.955 --> 00:12:06.292 align:middle line:84%
so much further advanced
than we are spiritually.

00:12:06.292 --> 00:12:10.763 align:middle line:84%
We have no way of knowing
what their objectives are.

00:12:10.763 --> 00:12:13.699 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Maybe they're
telling us what to say.

00:12:13.699 --> 00:12:14.901 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yeah.

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:16.569 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: They're beaming it
into my head right now.

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:18.971 align:middle line:84%
"Tell Speigel this so
he'll write about it."

00:12:18.971 --> 00:12:20.373 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: Well, I will
write about it anyway.

00:12:20.373 --> 00:12:23.276 align:middle line:84%
[laughs] But, yeah, there
is so much about this

00:12:23.276 --> 00:12:25.878 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't make
sense to people.

00:12:25.878 --> 00:12:29.282 align:middle line:84%
And yet these things are still
doing what they want to do.

00:12:29.282 --> 00:12:33.753 align:middle line:84%
And my experiences at the
UN just confirm that to me.

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:36.088 align:middle line:84%
That there are people at
the UN behind the scenes

00:12:36.088 --> 00:12:38.090 align:middle line:84%
that want this information
to come out,

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:40.560 align:middle line:84%
but as long as there
are powers like in the--

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.296 align:middle line:84%
what happened in
my case in 1978.

00:12:43.296 --> 00:12:46.432 align:middle line:84%
A resolution in front of the
UN that I helped put together,

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:48.601 align:middle line:84%
all the member nations
took a vote,

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:51.170 align:middle line:84%
and in the end it
was the United States

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:53.906 align:middle line:84%
and the then Soviet
Union had vetoed--

00:12:53.906 --> 00:12:55.174 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Vetoed?

00:12:55.174 --> 00:12:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: They didn't want
it to go any further.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.312 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: What does that tell you?

00:12:59.312 --> 00:13:01.848 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: So the resolution
kind of died.

00:13:01.848 --> 00:13:05.651 align:middle line:84%
And then I discovered last year,
during one of those periods

00:13:05.651 --> 00:13:09.889 align:middle line:84%
of time when the UK was
releasing previously classified

00:13:09.889 --> 00:13:11.290 align:middle line:90%
UFO documents.

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.926 align:middle line:84%
And they've released a lot of
them over the last few years.

00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:16.762 align:middle line:84%
The latest batch came out,
and my editor said to me

00:13:16.762 --> 00:13:17.797 align:middle line:90%
"Why don't you do a piece on it

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:19.498 align:middle line:84%
because it's a lot
in your documents?"

00:13:19.498 --> 00:13:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And I started reading
through the documents

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:26.038 align:middle line:84%
and I started coming up on
these pieces that clearly stated

00:13:26.038 --> 00:13:31.177 align:middle line:84%
that in 1978 we here in
the Ministry of Defense,

00:13:31.177 --> 00:13:34.714 align:middle line:84%
we knew that there was a
presentation being put together

00:13:34.714 --> 00:13:35.848 align:middle line:90%
at the United Nations.

00:13:35.848 --> 00:13:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And we did everything
we could to stop it.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:39.785 align:middle line:84%
And I read this and
I went "What?"

00:13:39.785 --> 00:13:41.120 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.923 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: Because that was my
presentation 30 years earlier.

00:13:43.923 --> 00:13:45.291 align:middle line:90%
I went "Wait a minute.

00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:49.128 align:middle line:84%
These documents are saying
that they tried to stop me."

00:13:49.128 --> 00:13:51.163 align:middle line:84%
And I went back to
my editor and I said

00:13:51.163 --> 00:13:53.733 align:middle line:84%
"This has now become
personal with me,"

00:13:53.733 --> 00:13:55.134 align:middle line:84%
because of what I've
just discovered.

00:13:55.134 --> 00:13:56.102 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's right.

00:13:56.102 --> 00:13:56.936 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: And he said,
"Write the story

00:13:56.936 --> 00:13:58.271 align:middle line:90%
but do it in the first person.

00:13:58.271 --> 00:14:00.773 align:middle line:84%
And let the readers know
that this was your thing

00:14:00.773 --> 00:14:02.041 align:middle line:90%
that they were talking about.

00:14:02.041 --> 00:14:05.278 align:middle line:84%
And you go-- you get into
the documents and discover

00:14:05.278 --> 00:14:08.147 align:middle line:84%
that the reason why the
UK tried to stop it was

00:14:08.147 --> 00:14:10.216 align:middle line:90%
because they felt, at that time,

00:14:10.216 --> 00:14:13.719 align:middle line:84%
that if the United Nations
did anything about UFOs,

00:14:13.719 --> 00:14:16.789 align:middle line:84%
it would throw the
reputation and credibility

00:14:16.789 --> 00:14:19.492 align:middle line:90%
of the UN into disrepute."

00:14:19.492 --> 00:14:21.994 align:middle line:90%
Really? They needed UFOs to--

00:14:21.994 --> 00:14:23.129 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:14:23.129 --> 00:14:24.430 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: -- you know, to
do something like that?

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:26.332 align:middle line:90%
But it was amazing.

00:14:26.332 --> 00:14:29.402 align:middle line:84%
And when I questioned our
friend Nick Pope about this

00:14:29.402 --> 00:14:31.871 align:middle line:84%
who had worked for the Ministry
of Defense, he said "Look,

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:33.205 align:middle line:90%
when these documents came out

00:14:33.205 --> 00:14:35.508 align:middle line:84%
and I read them I knew
you were going to call me

00:14:35.508 --> 00:14:36.442 align:middle line:90%
and ask me about this.

00:14:36.442 --> 00:14:37.877 align:middle line:84%
And all that I can
say to you is,

00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:39.645 align:middle line:90%
I'd give you more the specifics.

00:14:39.645 --> 00:14:42.614 align:middle line:84%
Yes we did try to do that
to apparently what was

00:14:42.614 --> 00:14:44.417 align:middle line:90%
your presentation.

00:14:44.417 --> 00:14:48.487 align:middle line:84%
And you have to understand,
Lee, I was just a teenager then

00:14:48.487 --> 00:14:50.022 align:middle line:84%
so I wasn't even working
for the ministry."

00:14:50.022 --> 00:14:51.357 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It wasn't me.

00:14:51.357 --> 00:14:52.558 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: "I wasn't working for
the Ministry of Defense yet,

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:55.928 align:middle line:84%
but I will just say this,
unofficially on behalf

00:14:55.928 --> 00:14:59.031 align:middle line:84%
of the UK government
I'm apologizing to you."

00:14:59.031 --> 00:14:59.832 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Interesting.

00:14:59.832 --> 00:15:00.433 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:15:00.433 --> 00:15:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yeah.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.001 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: One of my
favorite people.

00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:03.135 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yeah.

00:15:03.135 --> 00:15:04.704 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Apollo XIV
astronaut Edgar Mitchell.

00:15:04.704 --> 00:15:05.905 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yeah.

00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:09.041 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Walked on the moon,
and though he tells me,

00:15:09.041 --> 00:15:11.210 align:middle line:84%
"George I never saw
any extraterrestrials."

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:11.711 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Right.

00:15:11.711 --> 00:15:12.678 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:15:12.678 --> 00:15:14.013 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: "I have been
told by people

00:15:14.013 --> 00:15:17.850 align:middle line:84%
in high responsible positions
that we're being visited."

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:19.552 align:middle line:90%
And he believes it.

00:15:19.552 --> 00:15:20.653 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yes.

00:15:20.653 --> 00:15:21.988 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And I don't think
he's being lied to.

00:15:21.988 --> 00:15:23.756 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: No, I don't [inaudible]
you know where he grew up?

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:24.290 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Roswell.

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:24.957 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yes.

00:15:24.957 --> 00:15:25.658 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's right.

00:15:25.658 --> 00:15:26.359 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Of all places.

00:15:26.359 --> 00:15:27.593 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Great spot to be.

00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:31.731 align:middle line:84%
But isn't it fascinating
to get those stories from--

00:15:31.731 --> 00:15:34.433 align:middle line:84%
and why is this that
when you hear the stories

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:36.168 align:middle line:90%
of George Adamski who claim--

00:15:36.168 --> 00:15:37.536 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Oh, yeah.

00:15:37.536 --> 00:15:40.139 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: -- in the '50s and '60s,
he was hauled off to Venus.

00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:41.540 align:middle line:90%
People laughed at that.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:45.978 align:middle line:84%
But when police officers
and astronauts

00:15:45.978 --> 00:15:52.451 align:middle line:84%
and military people guarding
nuclear posts see that,

00:15:52.451 --> 00:15:53.986 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden it's
a different story.

00:15:53.986 --> 00:15:54.653 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yeah.

00:15:54.653 --> 00:15:55.621 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Why is that?

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:56.722 align:middle line:84%
Like we laugh at
the average person.

00:15:56.722 --> 00:15:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: We do.

00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:59.759 align:middle line:84%
And we laugh at the
officials, too.

00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:05.931 align:middle line:84%
Look, how many people laughed
at the late Major Donald Keyhoe?

00:16:05.931 --> 00:16:07.333 align:middle line:84%
You know, he was
a Marine major--

00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:08.367 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Who put together
NICAP, right.

00:16:08.367 --> 00:16:09.335 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Oh, yes.

00:16:09.335 --> 00:16:11.137 align:middle line:84%
And I did one of
the last interviews

00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:14.774 align:middle line:84%
with Keyhoe before he
died for my UFO album--

00:16:14.774 --> 00:16:15.408 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right

00:16:15.408 --> 00:16:16.809 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: -- in '75.

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:21.914 align:middle line:84%
This was a guy who just didn't
care what he-- whose, you know,

00:16:21.914 --> 00:16:25.384 align:middle line:84%
whose ruffles he ruffled,
you know, at that time.

00:16:25.384 --> 00:16:27.486 align:middle line:84%
He just went out there and
said "Look, I've been talking

00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:28.387 align:middle line:90%
with jet fighter pilots.

00:16:28.387 --> 00:16:29.388 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking with the military.

00:16:29.388 --> 00:16:30.589 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking to these people.

00:16:30.589 --> 00:16:32.625 align:middle line:84%
And they're all telling me
that we're being visited

00:16:32.625 --> 00:16:35.227 align:middle line:84%
and it could be a
dangerous situation."

00:16:35.227 --> 00:16:40.066 align:middle line:84%
And I found an old
clip several months ago

00:16:40.066 --> 00:16:43.335 align:middle line:84%
of a TV interview
done with Mike--

00:16:43.335 --> 00:16:46.338 align:middle line:84%
that Mike Wallace
with Donald Keyhoe.

00:16:46.338 --> 00:16:47.406 align:middle line:90%
It's like a six-part interview.

00:16:47.406 --> 00:16:49.008 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Was that for
60 minutes or?

00:16:49.008 --> 00:16:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: No, it was like some
other show, like, you know,

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:53.079 align:middle line:90%
"You hear it now" or something.

00:16:53.079 --> 00:16:54.046 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You want to dare.

00:16:54.046 --> 00:16:55.414 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: It was pre-60 minutes.

00:16:55.414 --> 00:16:56.649 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:16:56.649 --> 00:16:59.418 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: And Wallace was
like all over Keyhoe saying

00:16:59.418 --> 00:17:01.187 align:middle line:84%
"How can you come up with
this kind of information?

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:02.855 align:middle line:84%
How can you try and
make us believe

00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:04.156 align:middle line:90%
that we've being visited?--

00:17:04.156 --> 00:17:04.989 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:17:04.989 --> 00:17:06.358 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: -- Where's the evidence?

00:17:06.358 --> 00:17:07.426 align:middle line:84%
What-- you have to-- you can't
make statements like that."

00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:09.327 align:middle line:84%
And Keyhoe was just
standing his ground.

00:17:09.327 --> 00:17:10.129 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: He stood right in there.

00:17:10.129 --> 00:17:11.529 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: It was amazing how--

00:17:11.529 --> 00:17:17.002 align:middle line:84%
no matter how credible a person
can be about what they've seen,

00:17:17.002 --> 00:17:20.906 align:middle line:84%
there is still always going
to be either a skeptic

00:17:20.906 --> 00:17:24.442 align:middle line:84%
or the debunkers who live
to rip these people apart.

00:17:24.442 --> 00:17:26.579 align:middle line:90%
Skepticism is fine.

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:27.847 align:middle line:90%
It's needed.

00:17:27.847 --> 00:17:30.883 align:middle line:84%
Healthy skepticism is important
on all of these subjects

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:31.817 align:middle line:90%
that you and I deal with.

00:17:31.817 --> 00:17:32.952 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Absolutely.

00:17:32.952 --> 00:17:35.521 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: But it gets to a
point where it becomes--

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:37.990 align:middle line:84%
when it begets to the
point that it's ridicule

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:41.293 align:middle line:84%
and where the people who are
claiming to have experiences--

00:17:41.293 --> 00:17:42.828 align:middle line:84%
this is why a lot of
people don't want to talk

00:17:42.828 --> 00:17:44.997 align:middle line:84%
about their experiences
because they see what happens

00:17:44.997 --> 00:17:46.866 align:middle line:84%
to their friends, and
they'd rather just--

00:17:46.866 --> 00:17:47.633 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: They're laughed
at, ridiculed.

00:17:47.633 --> 00:17:48.767 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: -- just keep quiet.

00:17:48.767 --> 00:17:55.107 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Why are you
interested in channeling?

00:17:55.107 --> 00:18:01.547 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: When I was working on
my UFO album in 1975 I stayed

00:18:01.547 --> 00:18:05.518 align:middle line:84%
at a friend's apartment in Los
Angeles for a couple of days

00:18:05.518 --> 00:18:08.654 align:middle line:84%
and he had this great library
of unexplained phenomenon.

00:18:08.654 --> 00:18:12.391 align:middle line:84%
And one book kind of almost
jumped out of the bookcase.

00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:15.060 align:middle line:90%
It was called "Seth Speaks".

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.061 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Great book.

00:18:16.061 --> 00:18:18.264 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: And I had
never heard of Seth.

00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:20.432 align:middle line:84%
I've never heard of Jane
Roberts, the author of the book

00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:22.568 align:middle line:84%
who turned out to
be a channeler.

00:18:22.568 --> 00:18:28.674 align:middle line:84%
And every page that I turn
to, I'd go to like 340,

00:18:28.674 --> 00:18:31.443 align:middle line:84%
I'd read something or I go to
page 50 and read something.

00:18:31.443 --> 00:18:35.314 align:middle line:84%
Everything that I read that she
was channeling was making sense

00:18:35.314 --> 00:18:36.682 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:18:36.682 --> 00:18:39.752 align:middle line:84%
Nothing seemed like totally out
of the ordinary or weird or,

00:18:39.752 --> 00:18:40.920 align:middle line:90%
you know, this couldn't be.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.321 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:18:42.321 --> 00:18:45.591 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: It was stuff that made
sense and I discovered that she

00:18:45.591 --> 00:18:50.362 align:middle line:84%
and her husband, before they did
"Seth Speaks" for Prentice-Hall,

00:18:50.362 --> 00:18:54.200 align:middle line:84%
they-- they decided to
see about channeling

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.101 align:middle line:84%
because they were
interested in the old Edgar --

00:18:56.101 --> 00:19:01.173 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Cayce stories who was
considered a very famous--

00:19:01.173 --> 00:19:01.907 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: The great prophet.

00:19:01.907 --> 00:19:02.975 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: -- channeler.

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:04.176 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:19:04.176 --> 00:19:06.312 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: And so they decided
to do some experiments

00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:08.781 align:middle line:84%
and they wrote a book
called "The Coming of Seth".

00:19:08.781 --> 00:19:12.585 align:middle line:84%
And in this book they
basically started from scratch

00:19:12.585 --> 00:19:15.521 align:middle line:90%
where they took Ouija board.

00:19:15.521 --> 00:19:19.191 align:middle line:84%
And they decided to see what
would happen on Ouija board--

00:19:19.191 --> 00:19:20.025 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Not a good idea.

00:19:20.025 --> 00:19:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Well, see-- see, that--

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.364 align:middle line:84%
in some cases, I would say
that's a misconception.

00:19:25.364 --> 00:19:29.101 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not-- it's only
a bad idea if you approach it

00:19:29.101 --> 00:19:31.837 align:middle line:90%
from a fear point of view.

00:19:31.837 --> 00:19:34.640 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Well, I just have
always felt that you open

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.276 align:middle line:84%
up a portal whether
you want to or not.

00:19:37.276 --> 00:19:38.677 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yes.

00:19:38.677 --> 00:19:42.248 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but it doesn't necessarily
mean that it's a negative portal

00:19:42.248 --> 00:19:45.851 align:middle line:84%
if the energy you're
putting into it is stronger

00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:46.885 align:middle line:90%
than any negative energy

00:19:46.885 --> 00:19:48.354 align:middle line:84%
that might be trying
to come out of it.

00:19:48.354 --> 00:19:50.589 align:middle line:90%
That's-- and that's my belief.

00:19:50.589 --> 00:19:54.893 align:middle line:84%
Read this book, bought
Ouija board, just to screw

00:19:54.893 --> 00:19:58.197 align:middle line:84%
around a little bit and looking
for people who, you know,

00:19:58.197 --> 00:20:01.433 align:middle line:84%
I might actually get
successful with this.

00:20:01.433 --> 00:20:04.436 align:middle line:84%
And as I was still in the
process of just trying this,

00:20:04.436 --> 00:20:06.205 align:middle line:84%
I'm not getting a
lot of success,

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:09.275 align:middle line:84%
discovered in the apartment
building on the floor

00:20:09.275 --> 00:20:14.346 align:middle line:84%
where I lived in New York
this woman and her husband.

00:20:14.346 --> 00:20:16.148 align:middle line:84%
They used to have a
lot of people going in

00:20:16.148 --> 00:20:17.383 align:middle line:90%
and out of the building.

00:20:17.383 --> 00:20:19.551 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it was because
he was a piano teacher,

00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:21.787 align:middle line:90%
turns out she's a channeler.

00:20:21.787 --> 00:20:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And we met and she brought
me into her apartment.

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:27.126 align:middle line:84%
She showed me all these books,
she had all the Seth books

00:20:27.126 --> 00:20:30.229 align:middle line:84%
and I said, "So you're a
channeler, I mean, really?"

00:20:30.229 --> 00:20:34.099 align:middle line:84%
She said, "Yes, would you
like a demonstration?"

00:20:34.099 --> 00:20:35.567 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And you said,
"Of course".

00:20:35.567 --> 00:20:37.002 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: And I said, "Yeah, sure.

00:20:37.002 --> 00:20:38.170 align:middle line:90%
No problem."

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:39.872 align:middle line:84%
She said she uses
it to help people.

00:20:39.872 --> 00:20:41.674 align:middle line:90%
She never advertised.

00:20:41.674 --> 00:20:43.175 align:middle line:90%
That's a big deal for me.

00:20:43.175 --> 00:20:46.178 align:middle line:84%
When they don't advertise,
I'm more attracted to that.

00:20:46.178 --> 00:20:47.313 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:20:47.313 --> 00:20:48.380 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: I don't' want to
see people who attract

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:49.848 align:middle line:84%
through advertising,
showing their palms,

00:20:49.848 --> 00:20:51.050 align:middle line:84%
then they are [inaudible]
you know?

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:52.284 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's right.

00:20:52.284 --> 00:20:54.887 align:middle line:84%
I pick psychics off a
radio show because of that.

00:20:54.887 --> 00:20:56.522 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: Yeah, it's
like they think

00:20:56.522 --> 00:20:58.057 align:middle line:90%
that they could fool people.

00:20:58.057 --> 00:20:59.258 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:20:59.258 --> 00:21:00.626 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: But they can't fool
everybody all the time.

00:21:00.626 --> 00:21:04.363 align:middle line:84%
So she came over to our
apartment and we sat

00:21:04.363 --> 00:21:06.899 align:middle line:84%
on the floor opposite of
each other legs crossed

00:21:06.899 --> 00:21:08.600 align:middle line:90%
in like a lotus position.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:13.205 align:middle line:84%
And she explained to me what it
was that I was going to see just

00:21:13.205 --> 00:21:14.606 align:middle line:90%
to kind of prepare me.

00:21:14.606 --> 00:21:18.610 align:middle line:84%
She said that when-- when she
goes into this transit state,

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.679 align:middle line:84%
there will be some things
happening with my eyes

00:21:20.679 --> 00:21:22.648 align:middle line:90%
that may unnerve you little bit.

00:21:22.648 --> 00:21:24.917 align:middle line:84%
But, just, you know,
you'll get used to it.

00:21:24.917 --> 00:21:27.953 align:middle line:84%
The voice will change and
once it introduces itself,

00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:30.456 align:middle line:84%
you can ask it whatever
you want about anything.

00:21:30.456 --> 00:21:32.658 align:middle line:84%
So she did these
breathing exercises,

00:21:32.658 --> 00:21:38.464 align:middle line:84%
and as I was watching, her eyes,
which were fully open to me,

00:21:38.464 --> 00:21:41.567 align:middle line:84%
her eyeballs, both of them
went up into the sockets

00:21:41.567 --> 00:21:42.735 align:middle line:90%
and all I saw was white.

00:21:42.735 --> 00:21:44.103 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Which was the white?

00:21:44.103 --> 00:21:44.903 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Only white.

00:21:44.903 --> 00:21:46.271 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:21:46.271 --> 00:21:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: And at the same time
that I was seeing only white,

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.274 align:middle line:90%
her eyelashes were fluttering--

00:21:49.274 --> 00:21:50.376 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Were flipping
like crazy, you know.

00:21:50.376 --> 00:21:51.443 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: Really fast
and I'm thinking,

00:21:51.443 --> 00:21:52.978 align:middle line:90%
"How could anybody do that?"

00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:56.982 align:middle line:84%
And then this male voice came
through her, introduce itself

00:21:56.982 --> 00:21:58.283 align:middle line:90%
as Mika [assumed spelling].

00:21:58.283 --> 00:22:02.388 align:middle line:84%
And said that they, the two
of them, could talk to me

00:22:02.388 --> 00:22:03.455 align:middle line:90%
about anything I want.

00:22:03.455 --> 00:22:05.557 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's a
pleasure to meet me.

00:22:05.557 --> 00:22:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And so the whole time that
I'm talking with Mika,

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:12.431 align:middle line:84%
that eye thing is
still happening.

00:22:12.431 --> 00:22:13.799 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: She's still fluttering.

00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:16.668 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: Yeah, I mean, without
failure, like who can do that?

00:22:16.668 --> 00:22:17.369 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:22:17.369 --> 00:22:19.004 align:middle line:90%
Like she's having a fit.

00:22:19.004 --> 00:22:20.105 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yeah.

00:22:20.105 --> 00:22:21.440 align:middle line:84%
But she seemed very
comfortable, you know?

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.641 align:middle line:90%
He was being very expressive.

00:22:22.641 --> 00:22:25.911 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, during
the session, I started,

00:22:25.911 --> 00:22:27.679 align:middle line:84%
because of the way
my legs were crossed.

00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:31.016 align:middle line:84%
I started getting a really
bad pain in my right knee cap

00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:34.586 align:middle line:84%
which I had had for many years
as an arthritic condition

00:22:34.586 --> 00:22:36.722 align:middle line:84%
that always hit me
when I sat like that.

00:22:36.722 --> 00:22:37.856 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: When you sat like that.

00:22:37.856 --> 00:22:38.957 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yeah.

00:22:38.957 --> 00:22:40.426 align:middle line:84%
So I was just kind of
sitting there and--

00:22:40.426 --> 00:22:41.593 align:middle line:90%
I don't think I was touching it.

00:22:41.593 --> 00:22:42.928 align:middle line:90%
I was trying to ignore it.

00:22:42.928 --> 00:22:45.564 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle of Mika
talking about something about,

00:22:45.564 --> 00:22:47.800 align:middle line:84%
you know, the mysteries of
the universe or the pyramids

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.735 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it was we
were talking about.

00:22:49.735 --> 00:22:53.071 align:middle line:84%
He stopped and he said,
"You have a discomfort

00:22:53.071 --> 00:22:54.239 align:middle line:90%
in one of your joints."

00:22:54.239 --> 00:22:58.177 align:middle line:90%
I went, "Yes, I do."

00:22:58.177 --> 00:23:00.112 align:middle line:90%
And that's all I said.

00:23:00.112 --> 00:23:03.415 align:middle line:84%
And Mika said, "We can
continue with our discussion

00:23:03.415 --> 00:23:07.519 align:middle line:84%
or if you prefer, we can help
you with that right now."

00:23:07.519 --> 00:23:08.487 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "OK--

00:23:08.487 --> 00:23:09.321 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Help me now.

00:23:09.321 --> 00:23:10.989 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: -- that would be nice."

00:23:10.989 --> 00:23:12.758 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "What you
need to me to do?"

00:23:12.758 --> 00:23:17.596 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "We need you to lie
on your stomach in front of us."

00:23:17.596 --> 00:23:19.965 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking,
"Lie on my stomach?"

00:23:19.965 --> 00:23:22.134 align:middle line:90%
He has no idea where my pain is.

00:23:22.134 --> 00:23:23.502 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah, yeah.

00:23:23.502 --> 00:23:25.170 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: I mean, what's he telling
me to lie on my stomach for?

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:27.539 align:middle line:84%
I said, "OK, I'll do it 'cause
I'm not giving anything away."

00:23:27.539 --> 00:23:29.241 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's right.

00:23:29.241 --> 00:23:30.342 align:middle line:90%
You're suspicious already.

00:23:30.342 --> 00:23:31.109 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yeah.

00:23:31.109 --> 00:23:33.045 align:middle line:90%
And so my head was down

00:23:33.045 --> 00:23:35.614 align:middle line:84%
and above my head,
I heard this sound.

00:23:35.614 --> 00:23:37.249 align:middle line:90%
[ Noise ]

00:23:37.249 --> 00:23:37.749 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:23:37.749 --> 00:23:39.017 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: OK?

00:23:39.017 --> 00:23:40.586 align:middle line:84%
And he was-- he was doing
whatever he was doing, OK

00:23:40.586 --> 00:23:42.087 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Whatever the--
whatever is going on.

00:23:42.087 --> 00:23:42.855 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Get ready.

00:23:42.855 --> 00:23:44.189 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: He's getting ready.

00:23:44.189 --> 00:23:46.525 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: And-- and as I was
lying there, all of a sudden,

00:23:46.525 --> 00:23:50.062 align:middle line:84%
both of his-- of his, her hands
were cupped and they went right

00:23:50.062 --> 00:23:51.964 align:middle line:90%
to my right knee cap underneath

00:23:51.964 --> 00:23:53.899 align:middle line:84%
because the kneecap was
now facing the floor.

00:23:53.899 --> 00:23:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.035 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: Just cupped my
kneecap and I went, "Wow,

00:23:57.035 --> 00:23:58.570 align:middle line:90%
how did he figure that out?"

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:03.709 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "While we're
touching you here, envision--

00:24:03.709 --> 00:24:08.213 align:middle line:84%
visualize the color green
surrounding your kneecap

00:24:08.213 --> 00:24:11.350 align:middle line:84%
and make it an intense green,
green is a healing color.

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:12.317 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:24:12.317 --> 00:24:13.886 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: And-- and
this will help you."

00:24:13.886 --> 00:24:15.020 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.922 align:middle line:84%
He only did it for about
a minute and he said,

00:24:16.922 --> 00:24:20.225 align:middle line:84%
"We have taken care of the
situation and if you'd like,

00:24:20.225 --> 00:24:22.161 align:middle line:84%
if it ever comes back,
you can call us."

00:24:22.161 --> 00:24:22.928 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: I like that.

00:24:22.928 --> 00:24:23.762 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: And-- and--

00:24:23.762 --> 00:24:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It was fine ever since?

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:25.931 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: I've never had
the problem since.

00:24:25.931 --> 00:24:27.165 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: I love that.

00:24:27.165 --> 00:24:30.269 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little about Doug
Henning and levitation.

00:24:30.269 --> 00:24:31.904 align:middle line:90%
This fascinates me.

00:24:31.904 --> 00:24:33.839 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: Fascinates
me, too, George.

00:24:33.839 --> 00:24:37.342 align:middle line:84%
For those viewers who aren't
familiar with who Doug was,

00:24:37.342 --> 00:24:41.780 align:middle line:84%
he was one of America's
best, famous, fun magicians.

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:42.915 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yes.

00:24:42.915 --> 00:24:45.684 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: He was a product
of Canada and he arrived

00:24:45.684 --> 00:24:51.023 align:middle line:84%
in the States in the mid 1970s
to do a show on Broadway.

00:24:51.023 --> 00:24:53.358 align:middle line:90%
It was called the "Magic Show."

00:24:53.358 --> 00:24:55.661 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Way before
Copperfield, right?

00:24:55.661 --> 00:24:56.728 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yeah.

00:24:56.728 --> 00:24:58.263 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how much
before Copperfield

00:24:58.263 --> 00:24:59.965 align:middle line:84%
and certainly way
before David Blaine.

00:24:59.965 --> 00:25:01.366 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:25:01.366 --> 00:25:06.305 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: But Doug was doing his
magic and it was a musical

00:25:06.305 --> 00:25:08.941 align:middle line:84%
and he was like a
little pixie of a guy.

00:25:08.941 --> 00:25:10.809 align:middle line:84%
He looked like he
came from outer space.

00:25:10.809 --> 00:25:15.414 align:middle line:84%
He always wore tennis shoes and
multicolored outfits with stars

00:25:15.414 --> 00:25:18.083 align:middle line:84%
and stripes and all
kinds of things.

00:25:18.083 --> 00:25:20.919 align:middle line:84%
And we became friendly because
I worked in a music store

00:25:20.919 --> 00:25:22.888 align:middle line:84%
at that time that was
next to the theater--

00:25:22.888 --> 00:25:23.722 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: OK.

00:25:23.722 --> 00:25:25.123 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: -- where he was on stage.

00:25:25.123 --> 00:25:30.195 align:middle line:84%
And we met through some folks
who knew both of us and turns

00:25:30.195 --> 00:25:36.401 align:middle line:84%
out that he was very
interested in UFOs.

00:25:36.401 --> 00:25:37.669 align:middle line:90%
And so we get together.

00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:41.239 align:middle line:84%
We had some conversations
and I introduced him

00:25:41.239 --> 00:25:42.975 align:middle line:90%
to his girlfriend at that time.

00:25:42.975 --> 00:25:45.377 align:middle line:84%
So that kind of solidified
our friendship.

00:25:45.377 --> 00:25:46.845 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Yeah, that
locked it in for you.

00:25:46.845 --> 00:25:48.747 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: So some friends decided

00:25:48.747 --> 00:25:53.151 align:middle line:84%
to throw me a surprise birthday
party on the upper West side--

00:25:53.151 --> 00:25:55.520 align:middle line:84%
the upper East side of New
York in an apartment building.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.758 align:middle line:84%
An apartment-- just an
apartment with a hallway leading

00:25:59.758 --> 00:26:01.960 align:middle line:84%
to the elevators, not the
kind of place where you can--

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.197 align:middle line:84%
you could set up magic props
and things ahead of time.

00:26:05.197 --> 00:26:09.401 align:middle line:84%
I went to the party
and during the party,

00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:11.670 align:middle line:90%
Doug Henning shows up.

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:13.672 align:middle line:84%
He just finished doing
his show on Broadway

00:26:13.672 --> 00:26:14.906 align:middle line:90%
and wanted to come to my party.

00:26:14.906 --> 00:26:17.709 align:middle line:84%
And he gave me two
gifts that night.

00:26:17.709 --> 00:26:22.748 align:middle line:84%
The first gift was amazing
biography of Houdini and--

00:26:22.748 --> 00:26:23.782 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: I love that, yeah.

00:26:23.782 --> 00:26:25.283 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: -- and that
Doug signed for me.

00:26:25.283 --> 00:26:27.286 align:middle line:84%
And then he said to me
at one point, he said,

00:26:27.286 --> 00:26:31.123 align:middle line:84%
"I have another gift for you
but we need to leave the party

00:26:31.123 --> 00:26:31.923 align:middle line:90%
in order for me to show--

00:26:31.923 --> 00:26:32.557 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Just the two of you?

00:26:32.557 --> 00:26:33.625 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yeah, yeah.

00:26:33.625 --> 00:26:35.327 align:middle line:90%
I said, "OK, I trust you."

00:26:35.327 --> 00:26:36.728 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: All right, sure.

00:26:36.728 --> 00:26:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: And we walked out of my
surprise birthday party leaving

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:39.398 align:middle line:90%
everybody else behind.

00:26:39.398 --> 00:26:40.799 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "Where we going?"

00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:43.735 align:middle line:84%
He said, "We're just going down
the hall beneath the elevators.

00:26:43.735 --> 00:26:45.070 align:middle line:90%
Just on the carpet.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.506 align:middle line:84%
I just need you to be alone
with me for a few minutes."

00:26:47.506 --> 00:26:51.910 align:middle line:84%
He said, "You know, I've been
spending time in Switzerland,

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:54.379 align:middle line:84%
when I'm not doing
a show on Broadway.

00:26:54.379 --> 00:26:58.684 align:middle line:84%
Spending time with the Maharishi
Mahesh Yogi, the Beatles' Yogi."

00:26:58.684 --> 00:26:59.184 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Same guy.

00:26:59.184 --> 00:26:59.718 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: OK.

00:26:59.718 --> 00:27:01.186 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:27:01.186 --> 00:27:03.188 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: "And he's been teaching
me advance forms of meditation."

00:27:03.188 --> 00:27:07.926 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Doug had previously
given me a gift of meditation.

00:27:07.926 --> 00:27:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: OK.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.195 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: He wanted to
buy me, you know,

00:27:10.195 --> 00:27:12.264 align:middle line:84%
how to go to the meditation
place and get my mantra.

00:27:12.264 --> 00:27:13.865 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to turn
me on to meditation.

00:27:13.865 --> 00:27:17.769 align:middle line:84%
So he said, "The Maharishi has
been showing me advance forms

00:27:17.769 --> 00:27:20.806 align:middle line:84%
of meditation and I want to show
you something I'm working on.

00:27:20.806 --> 00:27:22.274 align:middle line:90%
It's levitation."

00:27:22.274 --> 00:27:24.409 align:middle line:90%
Really? OK.

00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:27.612 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And he didn't want
the crowd to see this--

00:27:27.612 --> 00:27:28.313 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yeah.

00:27:28.313 --> 00:27:28.847 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: -- at this time.

00:27:28.847 --> 00:27:29.981 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yeah.

00:27:29.981 --> 00:27:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "OK, what
do you need from me?"

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:33.085 align:middle line:90%
He said, "You just stand there.

00:27:33.085 --> 00:27:36.855 align:middle line:84%
And I can-- so far I can get
to the point where I can--

00:27:36.855 --> 00:27:41.426 align:middle line:84%
I can rise up but I can't come
down slowly and-- and I may--

00:27:41.426 --> 00:27:42.294 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: He could fall.

00:27:42.294 --> 00:27:43.128 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: -- I need
you to catch me.

00:27:43.128 --> 00:27:45.063 align:middle line:90%
I mean, need you to spot me."

00:27:45.063 --> 00:27:45.697 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Fine.

00:27:45.697 --> 00:27:46.398 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:27:46.398 --> 00:27:47.065 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: I'm here for you.

00:27:47.065 --> 00:27:47.699 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:27:47.699 --> 00:27:49.067 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: No problem.

00:27:49.067 --> 00:27:51.436 align:middle line:84%
And he stood in front of me
just few feet in front of me.

00:27:51.436 --> 00:27:52.637 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Nothing around him.

00:27:52.637 --> 00:27:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: No, no, no strings,
no ladders, no mirrors.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.442 align:middle line:84%
You know, just a regular
apartment building.

00:27:57.442 --> 00:27:58.777 align:middle line:90%
It was just him.

00:27:58.777 --> 00:28:01.747 align:middle line:84%
And he-- and he stood in front
of me with his back to me

00:28:01.747 --> 00:28:05.450 align:middle line:84%
and he had his arms down
at his sides with his hands

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:09.621 align:middle line:84%
out like this and he just went
in to this breathing technique.

00:28:09.621 --> 00:28:12.557 align:middle line:84%
And I can-- I can-- I
was almost meditating

00:28:12.557 --> 00:28:14.326 align:middle line:84%
because of what it
sound of like--

00:28:14.326 --> 00:28:15.727 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sure.

00:28:15.727 --> 00:28:17.329 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: -- and he was building up
this energy so he told me later

00:28:17.329 --> 00:28:20.966 align:middle line:84%
of this energy going up like
a wave up and down his body.

00:28:20.966 --> 00:28:25.871 align:middle line:84%
And then as I watched and I
was watching his feet really

00:28:25.871 --> 00:28:28.907 align:middle line:90%
closely, he just rose up.

00:28:28.907 --> 00:28:29.574 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Slowly?

00:28:29.574 --> 00:28:30.976 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Yeah.

00:28:30.976 --> 00:28:33.345 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't like he had one
foot in front of the other foot

00:28:33.345 --> 00:28:36.848 align:middle line:84%
so the front could make it look
he was pretending to rise up

00:28:36.848 --> 00:28:38.283 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Right-- they
were both-- he was--

00:28:38.283 --> 00:28:39.551 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: They were both together.

00:28:39.551 --> 00:28:40.819 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: You could have put
your arms underneath him.

00:28:40.819 --> 00:28:42.120 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: He was just rising up.

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:45.757 align:middle line:84%
Got up at about 6
inches and then he fell.

00:28:45.757 --> 00:28:47.192 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: [inaudible] Like that?

00:28:47.192 --> 00:28:50.195 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: Yeah, yeah, it was
like he came right down.

00:28:50.195 --> 00:28:52.664 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, I went
back into that party.

00:28:52.664 --> 00:28:54.432 align:middle line:90%
I was like a changed person.

00:28:54.432 --> 00:28:55.867 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Did you think it
might've been a trick?

00:28:55.867 --> 00:28:58.036 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Well, I-- I wasn't sure.

00:28:58.036 --> 00:28:59.271 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: He is a magician.

00:28:59.271 --> 00:29:01.973 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: I know and I
told the story to people

00:29:01.973 --> 00:29:03.275 align:middle line:90%
and they say the same thing.

00:29:03.275 --> 00:29:08.346 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the best story
about this was years later

00:29:08.346 --> 00:29:13.251 align:middle line:84%
after Doug had died,
I was in Washington.

00:29:13.251 --> 00:29:16.822 align:middle line:90%
I was doing a story for Omni.

00:29:16.822 --> 00:29:19.958 align:middle line:84%
There was a UFO debate
at Smithsonian,

00:29:19.958 --> 00:29:21.693 align:middle line:90%
Skeptics and Believers.

00:29:21.693 --> 00:29:23.695 align:middle line:90%
And I was there to cover it.

00:29:23.695 --> 00:29:28.333 align:middle line:84%
And after this one debate, all
of us went to dinner and sitting

00:29:28.333 --> 00:29:31.002 align:middle line:84%
on my right was Dr.
J. Allen Hynek,

00:29:31.002 --> 00:29:33.839 align:middle line:84%
sitting on my left
Arch-Skeptic Philip Klass.

00:29:33.839 --> 00:29:34.606 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Oh, yes.

00:29:34.606 --> 00:29:35.874 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: OK.

00:29:35.874 --> 00:29:37.876 align:middle line:84%
And so-- and I was in the
middle and I don't know--

00:29:37.876 --> 00:29:38.910 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:40.178 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: -- how we got
on to this subject

00:29:40.178 --> 00:29:43.248 align:middle line:84%
but I started telling the
story about Doug Henning.

00:29:43.248 --> 00:29:47.786 align:middle line:84%
Relayed the whole story to
Phil Klass and to Allen Hynek.

00:29:47.786 --> 00:29:50.856 align:middle line:84%
And afterwards, Klass,
"Well, you know, Lee,

00:29:50.856 --> 00:29:52.390 align:middle line:90%
Doug Henning is a trickster."

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:53.225 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah, it's right.

00:29:53.225 --> 00:29:54.559 align:middle line:90%
He'll never believe anything.

00:29:54.559 --> 00:29:57.362 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: He's-- and the other
thing is he's always wearing

00:29:57.362 --> 00:30:02.167 align:middle line:84%
these like Keds, sneakers
and a guy like him has--

00:30:02.167 --> 00:30:06.071 align:middle line:84%
had enough money where he
could've had special sneakers

00:30:06.071 --> 00:30:07.205 align:middle line:90%
created for--

00:30:07.205 --> 00:30:08.240 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Like Jets.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.141 align:middle line:84%
>> LS: -- that, he
didn't go that far.

00:30:10.141 --> 00:30:13.378 align:middle line:84%
He said "There could have been
something inside where if he--

00:30:13.378 --> 00:30:16.715 align:middle line:84%
if he maneuvered his
toe in such a way,

00:30:16.715 --> 00:30:18.884 align:middle line:90%
the spring action would happen."

00:30:18.884 --> 00:30:19.818 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Will pop them up--

00:30:19.818 --> 00:30:20.785 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: And it would pop.

00:30:20.785 --> 00:30:21.453 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: -- like spring
heeled Jet.

00:30:21.453 --> 00:30:22.287 align:middle line:90%
We're out of time--

00:30:22.287 --> 00:30:23.622 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: OK.

00:30:23.622 --> 00:30:24.389 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: -- but I want to thank
you for being [inaudible].

00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:25.190 align:middle line:90%
>> LS: Thank you, George.

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:26.524 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's a great story.

00:30:26.524 --> 00:30:29.761 align:middle line:84%
I mean I loved it all, UFOs,
the paranormal, levitation.

00:30:29.761 --> 00:30:32.530 align:middle line:84%

next Beyond Belief.
