00:00:05.264 --> 00:00:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.888 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.888 --> 00:00:10.660 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.460 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.550 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.412 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.412 --> 00:00:27.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ANGELA THOMAS: Hello.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm Angela Thomas, and I'm
a professional psychic and

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.840 align:middle line:90%
tarotist.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And for years, I've been
developing a new methodology

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.560 align:middle line:90%
to approach the tarot.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.790 align:middle line:84%
This new method is called
"Three Dimensional Tarot:

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.540 align:middle line:84%
The Art of Gathering
Information."

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.970 align:middle line:84%
This new approach
allows any individual

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.810 align:middle line:84%
to pull details
out of the cards.

are always lying in the cards.

>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:24.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.580 align:middle line:10%
Pretty exciting stuff,
isn't it, the tarot.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.030 align:middle line:10%
Well, with us is Angela
Thomas, psychic, clairvoyant,

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.140 align:middle line:10%
and an expert in the tarot.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.680 align:middle line:10%
And her upcoming book,
"Three Dimensional Tarot,"

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.140 align:middle line:10%
will tell you everything
you need to know.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.990 align:middle line:84%
How did you get
involved in this?

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well, you know, I've
been reading a long, long time.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.140 align:middle line:10%
And I've worked a long
time on developing

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.040 align:middle line:10%
this particular method.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.050 align:middle line:10%
You know, when you start
out reading tarot, George,

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.800 align:middle line:10%
it's very confusing.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.990 align:middle line:10%
The old approach
is very confusing.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.990 align:middle line:84%
So this is why I developed
three-dimensional tarot.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tarot cards
are very ancient.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.200 align:middle line:90%
How far back do they go?

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Oh, they go way back.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's no
particular date.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.990 align:middle line:84%
Some people say it
was the Egyptians.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.510 align:middle line:84%
Others say it was
coming from China.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.370 align:middle line:84%
So there hasn't been any
particular date or culture

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.935 align:middle line:90%
that we can thank.

00:02:21.935 --> 00:02:25.049 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it start
off as a parlor game,

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.590 align:middle line:84%
or were they dead
serious about this?

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well,
actually, yes and no.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.440 align:middle line:90%
There was a tarock.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.970 align:middle line:84%
Tarock was a way
of doing fortune

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.200 align:middle line:84%
telling while
playing a card game.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.070 align:middle line:84%
But also religious
leaders-- not just

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.880 align:middle line:84%
psychics in the
community or whatever,

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.350 align:middle line:90%
but religious leaders.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Catholic priests--
some Catholic priests--

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.631 align:middle line:84%
in Europe used to use
tarot-- not in front

00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:54.630 align:middle line:84%
of the congregation, mind
you, or their parish--

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Too devilish, right?

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Too devilish.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.751 align:middle line:84%
But certainly did use
the tarot to forecast

00:03:00.751 --> 00:03:02.500 align:middle line:84%
things that were coming
around the corner.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These aren't
really Satanic, are they?

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.120 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: No, they are not.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.510 align:middle line:10%
The intentions-- we
can take a paper cup

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.270 align:middle line:10%
and make it Satanic, right?

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.359 align:middle line:84%
Because the intentions
is what really matters.

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:15.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what drives it.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: But the
tarot just gives you

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.090 align:middle line:84%
symbology, gives you numbers,
gives you information

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.665 align:middle line:90%
that you need to know.

00:03:23.665 --> 00:03:28.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Three Dimensional
Tarot, your upcoming book--

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.100 align:middle line:90%
tell me about that.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, "Three Dimensional
Tarot: The Art

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.410 align:middle line:84%
of Gathering Information"
is a new methodology.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.870 align:middle line:84%
It's a new approach
to the tarot.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.770 align:middle line:84%
It allows one to glean
details from the tarot,

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.050 align:middle line:84%
versus just kind of
getting a feeling.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.690 align:middle line:84%
People want to know details
when they see a tarot reader,

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.870 align:middle line:90%
or when they read themselves.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.500 align:middle line:84%
So it offers locations,
names, unique situations

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.770 align:middle line:84%
that the typical older
approach just doesn't provide.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Brand new.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.590 align:middle line:90%
You're keeping with the times.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.020 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well,
I mean, I've been

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.190 align:middle line:84%
doing-- I've developed
this for a long time.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.245 align:middle line:84%
But yes, this is
a new methodology,

00:04:09.245 --> 00:04:10.120 align:middle line:90%
altogether different.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of our guests
on "Coast to Coast,"

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Art Rosengarten,
expert in the tarot.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And what he does, Angela, is
he'll spread the cards out

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.769 align:middle line:84%
and someone will
call in on the show,

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.990 align:middle line:84%
and he'll pick the cards
for the individual.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.184 align:middle line:90%
And he'll do his thing.

00:04:26.184 --> 00:04:27.850 align:middle line:84%
I always thought the
individual, though,

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.310 align:middle line:84%
had to be the one
to take the card.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: No, not at all.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:31.410 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Because again, a lot
of tarot readers,

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.230 align:middle line:84%
they no longer see
people in person.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, how can you if
you've got 10 people that day

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.630 align:middle line:84%
from all over the world calling
in for their tarot session?

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.590 align:middle line:84%
But no, it's the tarotist
that is important.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.140 align:middle line:84%
It's his or her
energies on that card.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.735 align:middle line:90%
It's his or her interpretation.

00:04:50.735 --> 00:04:51.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.026 align:middle line:84%
And how important is
the interpretation?

00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:55.850 align:middle line:10%
>>THOMAS: Very important,
because here's the thing.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.280 align:middle line:84%
The old way of
tarot that there may

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.830 align:middle line:84%
be 100 different
meanings to one card.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And so a tarotist
has to sort-- what

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.300 align:middle line:90%
does it mean in the situation?

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And some tarotists are
unable to interpret

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.370 align:middle line:84%
the meaning of that
card in that position

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.262 align:middle line:90%
based on that client's question.

00:05:18.262 --> 00:05:20.945 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many of
those are scammers?

00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:24.230 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: How many of
those are scammers?

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.450 align:middle line:84%
There are-- there are a
lot of people out there.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.519 align:middle line:84%
I would say 50-plus
percent are scammers.

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:31.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not as high
as the psychics.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.725 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Not as high
as the psychics, yes.

00:05:32.725 --> 00:05:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
cards in a deck?

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: 78, typically.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Although there are decks
that have 38 in them, or 56.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:44.074 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just give me
an ace and a face card.

00:05:44.074 --> 00:05:44.960 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: So yeah.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you know where
I was headed with that?

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Typical card playing.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Blackjack.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.170 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Blackjack!

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.711 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:05:48.711 --> 00:05:49.850 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I love that game.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:50.975 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why I didn't--

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:52.889 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's do a
couple readings on me.

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:53.930 align:middle line:90%
And then we'll get more--

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Let's do a
couple of readings on you.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:56.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do we do?

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:57.460 align:middle line:90%
Do we shuffle?

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.530 align:middle line:90%
Do I shuffle?

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: You can, or
I can, whichever way.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:01.825 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You tell me.

00:06:01.825 --> 00:06:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well, why don't you
go ahead and do it, George.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.056 align:middle line:90%
You're right in front of me.

00:06:05.056 --> 00:06:07.217 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:06:07.217 --> 00:06:08.425 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing up my sleeve.

00:06:08.425 --> 00:06:12.770 align:middle line:90%


00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:13.390 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:14.660 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: OK.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:20.790 align:middle line:84%
So generally, you can
either read one, three, ten,

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.260 align:middle line:90%
or all 78.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.080 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any
specific questions,

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.580 align:middle line:84%
or you want me to
just give you--

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
you show me first.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:27.940 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: OK.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:33.430 align:middle line:84%
So I typically lay them out in
what's called a Celtic spread.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to do this
rather sloppily because when

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.700 align:middle line:84%
I read the tarot,
I use it as a tool.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.440 align:middle line:84%
So I'm already-- I
already know, George,

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.240 align:middle line:84%
that between right now and
the next four to six months

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.020 align:middle line:84%
that there's something
coming out of the UK for you.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.279 align:middle line:84%
And it's not only
communications from the UK--

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:54.445 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The United Kingdom?

00:06:54.445 --> 00:06:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: The United Kingdom.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.068 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For moi?

00:06:56.068 --> 00:06:56.940 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: For you.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.380 align:middle line:90%
And I know that sounds crazy.

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.790 align:middle line:84%
But not only
communications from the UK,

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.991 align:middle line:84%
but wanting you to
come over to the UK.

00:07:03.991 --> 00:07:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe I'm going
to be on "Britain's Got

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.695 align:middle line:90%
Talent" or something.

00:07:06.695 --> 00:07:07.870 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Well, who knows.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.040 align:middle line:90%
Who knows.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:14.040 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I need to let
you know that not only are

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.990 align:middle line:84%
you of course exploding
in the television

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.980 align:middle line:84%
and radio, your long
career in radio,

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.800 align:middle line:84%
but there is indeed
another opportunity

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.790 align:middle line:84%
coming around the corner for
you in the way of production--

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:28.700 align:middle line:90%
television production.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.900 align:middle line:84%
So I really do
like that for you.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:36.140 align:middle line:90%
In the way of relationships,

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're always wondering
about them, aren't we?

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:42.280 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well, I will just
say that the person that you

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.890 align:middle line:84%
already know in the
relationship house, the back

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:52.380 align:middle line:84%
and forth of it, is
not for you whatsoever.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.960 align:middle line:84%
There is somebody coming
in between right now

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.660 align:middle line:84%
and what I say is the
next 9 to 10 months

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:01.740 align:middle line:84%
who is really your
match, despite how

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:07.070 align:middle line:84%
you feel about the individual
that you already know about.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.865 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Assuming
I know someone.

00:08:08.865 --> 00:08:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well,
assuming so, right?

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to assume.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm just-- I'm
just the messenger.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:16.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm just delivering
you that information.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.760 align:middle line:84%
So you see as I'm going
over this particular format,

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.840 align:middle line:84%
right, I'm just tossing
cards out very nonchalantly.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not reading
card for card for card.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
you know which one

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.090 align:middle line:90%
to pick at any particular time?

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well, I'm using
it as psychic tarot,

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:35.510 align:middle line:84%
whereas a normal
tarotist may go,

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.459 align:middle line:84%
this is the meaning
of this card and this

00:08:37.459 --> 00:08:40.150 align:middle line:84%
is the meaning-- and
so on and so forth.

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:44.310 align:middle line:84%
But it allows you to draw
tremendous details out

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:45.470 align:middle line:90%
of the cards.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:48.760 align:middle line:84%
I like to say, for
example, George,

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.340 align:middle line:84%
that there are positive and
negatives to every card.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.220 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
the devil for a moment.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:54.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The devil?

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.713 align:middle line:10%
>>THOMAS: The devil.

00:08:55.713 --> 00:08:56.840 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: In my life?

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:57.520 align:middle line:10%
>>THOMAS: No.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.550 align:middle line:10%
It's going to show up
in everybody's reading.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:04.670 align:middle line:84%
It depends on what's going on,
where it's showing up, right?

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And so if I look
geographically for that devil,

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:09.817 align:middle line:84%
here we have the
devil showing up--

00:09:09.817 --> 00:09:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right here?

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:11.610 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Right here.

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.620 align:middle line:84%
So geographically, looks
pretty scary, doesn't it?

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:16.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep, it does.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.700 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: But
here's the-- here's

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.750 align:middle line:90%
the positive side about that.

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Big business coming out of
the New York, New Jersey area.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And so communication between
now and the next four weeks

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:34.650 align:middle line:84%
from someone in the New
York City/New Jersey area,

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.410 align:middle line:90%
talking about big business.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And not only talking
about big business,

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:44.163 align:middle line:84%
but big key players, like
C-level people-- CEOs, COOs,

00:09:44.163 --> 00:09:47.790 align:middle line:84%
CFOs-- these type of
big decision-makers

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:50.240 align:middle line:84%
coming to talk to
you about that.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.720 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to have
communication coming in,

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure, through
phone or email,

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:57.750 align:middle line:90%
whatever form of communication.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.240 align:middle line:84%
But I need to let you know
that between right now

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:05.000 align:middle line:84%
and, what I'm going to
say is January of 2015,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000 align:middle line:84%
you will not make one
but at least two trips

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.080 align:middle line:90%
to the New York City area.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.820 align:middle line:84%
Also, I do find you
in DC-- Washington,

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.490 align:middle line:90%
DC for some odd reason.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:19.130 align:middle line:84%
But I don't feel like
you're there for very long.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:23.660 align:middle line:84%
I would say probably for less
than a day in the DC area.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.610 align:middle line:84%
So you see how I'm
reading that for you.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And you might go, you know,
the last thing I want to do

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:34.520 align:middle line:84%
is stop right now and
go to New York City.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:38.000 align:middle line:84%
But I'm letting you know, if you
decide to go to New York City

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.910 align:middle line:84%
at least twice, that we're
talking about big business

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:44.470 align:middle line:84%
and big things that
will enhance not only

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:47.095 align:middle line:84%
your career but your
financial house.

00:10:47.095 --> 00:10:47.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: So you
see how I'm using

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:54.050 align:middle line:90%
that particular information.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.410 align:middle line:84%
So this is three
dimensional tarot.

00:10:56.410 --> 00:11:00.030 align:middle line:84%
I could literally talk to
you for an hour or two just

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.370 align:middle line:90%
on the way I am doing this now.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you doing
this as the psychic

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:06.570 align:middle line:90%
or are you reading the cards?

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.490 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: I am doing
both, because I'm

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.110 align:middle line:84%
using this as a
psychic tarot tool.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:14.050 align:middle line:84%
But if a tarotist, you
know, someone that is just

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:17.930 align:middle line:84%
interpreting the tarot, they
don't need to be psychic.

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Although I must tell you, tarot
is an eye-opener-- a third eye

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:23.390 align:middle line:90%
opener.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And so the more people utilize
cards, just as a reader

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:31.940 align:middle line:84%
or an interpreter, the more that
they'll open up psychically.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.050 align:middle line:84%
But the details
will come into play.

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:37.950 align:middle line:84%
How do I know that the
devil is New York and not,

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:41.100 align:middle line:84%
let's say, Gainesville,
Florida-- an area

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.140 align:middle line:84%
I call a devil
place, by the way,

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.850 align:middle line:84%
in the negative
sense of the word.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:46.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.200 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: So how
did I know that?

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Because I've already drawn
my own interpretation

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:53.760 align:middle line:90%
from that particular card.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also
psychically being led

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.950 align:middle line:90%
to that area of the country.

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now is this devil
card particularly a good or bad

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:04.040 align:middle line:90%
thing?

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:04.873 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: It's both.

00:12:04.873 --> 00:12:06.910 align:middle line:90%
It's positive and it's negative.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.210 align:middle line:84%
So the thing is, so
if I said, OK, well,

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:12.080 align:middle line:84%
what's negative about
that information?

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:16.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's all about,
let's not tell George.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.950 align:middle line:84%
So between right now
and the next four weeks,

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:20.900 align:middle line:84%
you would be going,
why didn't you

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.729 align:middle line:84%
tell me about that
particular situation?

00:12:22.729 --> 00:12:24.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My staff holding back?

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Right, because we
didn't want to stress you out.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:33.180 align:middle line:84%
We didn't want you to make a
decision of to go or not to go.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:38.050 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to kind of keep things
to ourselves for right now.

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:39.410 align:middle line:90%
You see what I'm saying?

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:44.570 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, the devil can be
all types of characteristics.

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:46.185 align:middle line:10%
Can be gamblers,
can be drinkers--

00:12:46.185 --> 00:12:48.060 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The devil
made me do it.

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: The devil
made me do it.

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Could be-- I've done a
lot of missing child cases

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:56.530 align:middle line:90%
that I volunteered for.

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And the devil shows up,
of course negatively,

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:03.610 align:middle line:84%
as one that is a controller,
a manipulator, a psychotic,

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:06.936 align:middle line:84%
a sociopath, a criminal
with a felony history.

00:13:06.936 --> 00:13:07.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:10.730 align:middle line:10%
>>THOMAS: So it's a way
of-- three dimensional tarot

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:15.950 align:middle line:10%
will let that tarotist know
what aspects of that devil

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:19.635 align:middle line:10%
to be looking for, depending
on where it places.

00:13:19.635 --> 00:13:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Angela, how did you
know what pile to hone in on?

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.170 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Well, I don't.

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.012 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm all over the place.

00:13:27.012 --> 00:13:27.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm all over the place.

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:28.995 align:middle line:90%
And if I had a long--

00:13:28.995 --> 00:13:30.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if you
went to this pile?

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:34.100 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: If I
went-- every pile,

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:39.450 align:middle line:84%
as you call it, every placement,
has its own-- traditional tarot

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:44.470 align:middle line:84%
would say, this is the
outcome to George's reading.

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:46.610 align:middle line:84%
This is typically
what we can look for.

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:49.480 align:middle line:84%
So every position, every
card has its own meaning

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:53.615 align:middle line:84%
in that particular house
under the old tarot.

00:13:53.615 --> 00:13:57.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now what about the
deck, and I just pick one card?

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.640 align:middle line:90%
What does that tell you?

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.160 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well one
card-- again, if you--

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:00.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Shall we do that?

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Yes,
let's use the devil.

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:04.610 align:middle line:90%
We've already used the devil.

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And let's just
say that you said,

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.429 align:middle line:84%
Angela-- course,
this is hypothetical

00:14:09.429 --> 00:14:11.095 align:middle line:84%
because I'm just using
it as an example.

00:14:11.095 --> 00:14:12.629 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let me really pick one.

00:14:12.629 --> 00:14:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: OK.

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:13.780 align:middle line:90%
Really pick one.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:14.280 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.550 align:middle line:90%
Really pick one.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.418 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:14:20.418 --> 00:14:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: See what
my psychic brain--

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.310 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: You can pick three
of them, or one of them, or--

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:26.964 align:middle line:90%
This one right here.

00:14:26.964 --> 00:14:27.796 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Love that.

00:14:27.796 --> 00:14:28.440 align:middle line:90%
Love that.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is this?

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:29.610 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: OK.

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:33.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, generally
that particular card

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:34.870 align:middle line:90%
is about agreements.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.640 align:middle line:84%
It's about looking
at real estate.

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:41.050 align:middle line:84%
It's about looking at not
only residential real estate,

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:43.890 align:middle line:84%
but it's also looking at
commercial real estate.

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to say
because of the threes,

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:49.434 align:middle line:84%
between right now and
the next three months,

00:14:49.434 --> 00:14:50.850 align:middle line:84%
you will definitely
be with others

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:53.477 align:middle line:84%
looking at a commercial
piece of property.

00:14:53.477 --> 00:14:54.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gosh, I hope not.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.370 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: But yes, yes.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:57.750 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a wonderful thing.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:01.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that's
going to-- it's not something

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:04.710 align:middle line:84%
that you're having to
commit to that you're

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:06.770 align:middle line:84%
pulling money out
of your pocket.

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:09.810 align:middle line:84%
To, me it's more like
other people's money

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:11.130 align:middle line:90%
sort of situation.

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:12.540 align:middle line:90%
But you are involved.

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:13.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The old OPM.

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.470 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: The OPM.

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:18.770 align:middle line:84%
So on the residential
side, it's about let

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:22.350 align:middle line:84%
me look at a new place
coming into play.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:24.980 align:middle line:10%
And so there's some sort of
living arrangements coming up

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:26.290 align:middle line:10%
for you, by the way.

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:29.270 align:middle line:10%
And I feel like it's somebody
saying, George, can I

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.610 align:middle line:10%
come and be with you for awhile.

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:32.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Again?

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.300 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Well, no, no, no.

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:33.730 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:34.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My kids are there.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.540 align:middle line:90%
They've taken over.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:36.980 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: I'm just saying, look.

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.840 align:middle line:84%
A new living arrangement
is coming in.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.080 align:middle line:84%
So it would be,
George, is it OK if I

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:46.820 align:middle line:84%
stay with you at this particular
location for x amount of time?

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.920 align:middle line:84%
I am going to say, they may
say, it's only for two weeks.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.712 align:middle line:84%
But actually it's going
to be a lot longer.

00:15:51.712 --> 00:15:53.878 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is like helping
a friend or something?

00:15:53.878 --> 00:15:56.004 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Helping a friend
or a family member, yes.

00:15:56.004 --> 00:15:57.753 align:middle line:84%
Certainly you're not
going to take someone

00:15:57.753 --> 00:15:58.840 align:middle line:90%
in off the streets, right?

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.580 align:middle line:90%
So it doesn't take a psychic--

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:02.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --known to
do stuff like that.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Yeah, but it
doesn't take a psychic

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:08.080 align:middle line:84%
to tell you that, logically,
most people wouldn't take

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.540 align:middle line:84%
in somebody and say "come on"
without knowing their history.

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who
originated the tarot?

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.207 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well, again,
it goes back to--

00:16:16.207 --> 00:16:17.623 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and all
the structures?

00:16:17.623 --> 00:16:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: --Egyptian times.

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:22.300 align:middle line:90%
And we don't really quite know.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Some people are very
adamant that, yes,

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:25.830 align:middle line:90%
it was the Egyptians.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:29.140 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it was the Chinese.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.680 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, is there
hasn't been any proof.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.180 align:middle line:84%
We have been going-- we have
found back into the AD times

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:38.860 align:middle line:84%
that tarot was
already cropping up.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Were there all 78 out
there at that time?

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.605 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:16:42.605 --> 00:16:44.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have the graphics
changed over the years?

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Graphics change
over the years, absolutely.

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:52.080 align:middle line:84%
Some of this, this is
a pretty typical deck.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And so whether it
was 500 years ago

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.960 align:middle line:84%
or 300 years ago
or 100 years ago,

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.820 align:middle line:84%
it has a shared
element about it.

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And so this particular deck is
called the Rider-Waite deck,

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:09.150 align:middle line:84%
and you'll see many, many
tarot decks based off

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:10.669 align:middle line:90%
of some of the same symbology.

00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:14.359 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of the 78
cards, does each one

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:15.750 align:middle line:90%
have a separate meaning?

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Has a
multitude of meanings.

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:22.830 align:middle line:84%
So if it's upright or it's a
positive, if it's reversed,

00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:24.300 align:middle line:90%
it's a negative.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:28.280 align:middle line:84%
Or depending on if the card is
terrible card to begin with,

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.170 align:middle line:84%
that reverse might
be a positive thing.

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:33.690 align:middle line:84%
So again, the positioning
of the cards, but

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:35.865 align:middle line:90%
multitudes of meanings.

00:17:35.865 --> 00:17:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the cards that
are enjoined in unison--

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:43.700 align:middle line:84%
let's say three cards--
does that tell you anything

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.250 align:middle line:90%
differently about somebody?

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Well, absolutely.

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:50.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most people will
take a three-card spread

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.810 align:middle line:84%
and say that's a
past, present, future.

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:54.910 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty typical
way to read it.

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:57.290 align:middle line:84%
But I look at it
three-dimensionally,

00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:00.130 align:middle line:84%
and I would say, I'm going
to take those three cards

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:03.390 align:middle line:84%
and draw details out
of those three cards.

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:06.350 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going to go
bother with the past at all.

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:10.290 align:middle line:84%
Unless, of course, it's a
situation coming back around

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:12.500 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
have to deal with.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.090 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, you could
work three cards

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:15.465 align:middle line:84%
and get all kinds
of information.

00:18:15.465 --> 00:18:19.130 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I'm going to pull
three cards out here for you.

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:22.915 align:middle line:84%
And I'll hold them
all up in a second.

00:18:22.915 --> 00:18:25.970 align:middle line:90%


00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:30.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why I picked
the three that I did.

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:32.130 align:middle line:90%
Hold it up.

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:33.882 align:middle line:90%
There they are.

00:18:33.882 --> 00:18:36.172 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Mmm, interesting.

00:18:36.172 --> 00:18:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One with somebody
wrapped up and tied up-- I'm

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:40.870 align:middle line:90%
not into that.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:41.942 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Right, right.

00:18:41.942 --> 00:18:43.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So tell me about this.

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:44.350 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: OK.

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:47.700 align:middle line:10%
So let's put them down here.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.140 align:middle line:84%
So this just tells me,
again, and this kind

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.740 align:middle line:84%
of verifies what I
said about someone

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:55.150 align:middle line:90%
kind of keeping things secret.

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:57.890 align:middle line:84%
But again, between now
and the next four weeks

00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:00.970 align:middle line:84%
you are being
given-- you're privy

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:03.150 align:middle line:90%
to that particular information.

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:08.310 align:middle line:84%
Strong J or G male coming into
play, a bit older than you are,

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:10.530 align:middle line:84%
so maybe considered
an older brother,

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:12.300 align:middle line:90%
an uncle, a fatherly figure.

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Fatherly doesn't
necessarily mean biological.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Could be somebody that is your
adviser, a male particular.

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:24.290 align:middle line:84%
J or G-- there's a
lot of J or G names

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:27.600 align:middle line:84%
out there, typical male
names-- John, for example.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.160 align:middle line:90%
But it could be George, right?

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:33.110 align:middle line:84%
But whatever it
is, it's a soft G.

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:36.280 align:middle line:84%
So it's not going to be
a strong G like a Gary.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:41.320 align:middle line:84%
So it already tells me that
the J or G male is coming in.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And how do you separate which
J or G male I'm talking about?

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, I need to let you know
that this particular J or G

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.640 align:middle line:84%
male has something going
on with their legs.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.510 align:middle line:84%
There's a mobility
problem going on.

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:57.660 align:middle line:84%
So maybe seeing a cane,
a walker, a wheelchair,

00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.827 align:middle line:90%
or something of this nature.

00:19:58.827 --> 00:19:59.868 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This individual?

00:19:59.868 --> 00:20:01.170 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: This individual.

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And it wouldn't surprise
me that this individual has

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:07.430 align:middle line:84%
a son which typically,
back in the day,

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:11.800 align:middle line:84%
you named your first born
son after the father, right?

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:16.810 align:middle line:84%
So has a son with a
shared same last name.

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:19.640 align:middle line:84%
So this particular J
or G male is coming in.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And by the time we get
to the first of the year,

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.130 align:middle line:84%
or first quarter
of the year, then

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:26.980 align:middle line:84%
there's some new things coming
around the corner for you

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:30.070 align:middle line:84%
that this particular
J or G male absolutely

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:32.775 align:middle line:84%
would like to have
you involved in.

00:20:32.775 --> 00:20:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:35.680 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: So right
now kind of keeping

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:39.130 align:middle line:84%
that hush-hush from you,
not only the situation

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:43.810 align:middle line:84%
I explained earlier, but let's
not unroll it out yet to George

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:46.400 align:middle line:90%
until we know more information.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.520 align:middle line:84%
So you see, that's just a
little bit of information

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:54.560 align:middle line:84%
that I was able to
get from three cards.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.470 align:middle line:84%
How long does it take somebody
to learn how to read the tarot?

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:03.390 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: I would say in
the old traditional ways,

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:10.650 align:middle line:84%
it really does take a long
time to navigate through it.

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And in this particular-- this
is a more complex system.

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Anybody, a beginner,
can learn it.

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there instructions
included in the box?

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: They'll
be-- oh, in the box?

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:24.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't make up
these tarot cards.

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.720 align:middle line:84%
You can use any
deck that you want.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And these tarot
cards typically come

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.310 align:middle line:84%
with some sort of
instruction to it,

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:32.620 align:middle line:90%
giving a little bit of meaning.

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:35.829 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they all the
same-- the different boxes?

00:21:35.829 --> 00:21:36.370 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: No.

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:38.260 align:middle line:90%
The tarot are not all the same.

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:41.310 align:middle line:84%
There might be a little
bit different symbology.

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:42.970 align:middle line:10%
But with "Three
Dimensional Tarot:

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:44.870 align:middle line:10%
The Art of Gathering
Information,"

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:49.840 align:middle line:10%
you could use any tarot
deck that you want to.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Because it wouldn't make sense
to try to learn a new deck,

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.880 align:middle line:84%
with the symbology
and the numbers

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:58.280 align:middle line:84%
and the colors and
everything else,

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.500 align:middle line:84%
to try to read
three-dimensionally.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.510 align:middle line:84%
It's take what you
know, or take what

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:04.250 align:middle line:90%
you're most comfortable with.

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:10.430 align:middle line:84%
So an experienced tarotist,
an astrologer, a psychic,

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:15.430 align:middle line:84%
a numerologist-- this system
here is an extraordinary thing.

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:17.695 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
science behind this?

00:22:17.695 --> 00:22:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: I wish I
could say that there

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:21.860 align:middle line:90%
was a science behind this.

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:24.180 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any proof of it.

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:28.350 align:middle line:10%
I mean, even though I'm
involved in science,

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:31.010 align:middle line:10%
the study of
pre-cognition, this has

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:33.660 align:middle line:10%
nothing to do with
that whatsoever.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:36.495 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do kids play with these
like they would a Ouija board?

00:22:36.495 --> 00:22:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: You know, many
children do play with tarot.

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:45.270 align:middle line:84%
and I think that they have to--
I wish that tarot decks would

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:48.127 align:middle line:84%
come with a little
label, a warning label.

00:22:48.127 --> 00:22:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: That these can be
a portal, if used improperly,

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.360 align:middle line:90%
just like a Ouija board.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:01.060 align:middle line:84%
But we don't need tarot
cards or Ouija boards.

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:04.120 align:middle line:90%
We could use a book, a cup.

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And if we're just
out there going,

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:09.940 align:middle line:84%
oh tell me, tell me, tell me--
well, who are you talking to?

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:11.340 align:middle line:90%
Are you asking a spirit?

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:16.380 align:middle line:84%
Are you asking a known,
say, a loved one in spirit?

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:23.350 align:middle line:10%
Are you asking a-- what kind
of entity are you dealing with?

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:27.550 align:middle line:84%
So to me, it doesn't matter
what item that you're using.

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:32.170 align:middle line:84%
You must be very cautious
in these type of things.

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:34.910 align:middle line:84%
If your intention
is to do wrong,

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:37.495 align:middle line:84%
then of course that's the avenue
that you're going to go down.

00:23:37.495 --> 00:23:38.953 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was
my next question.

00:23:38.953 --> 00:23:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Can you use these
for bad purposes?

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:45.095 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well, no, not in spell
casting or anything like that.

00:23:45.095 --> 00:23:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing like that.

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.386 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Nothing like that.

00:23:47.386 --> 00:23:50.280 align:middle line:84%
But we can look at this
in a different degree

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.510 align:middle line:84%
if we wanted to do
something wrong.

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Or if somebody was angry at
the person in front of them

00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:59.750 align:middle line:84%
or the person on the phone,
they could go, OK, well,

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:03.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to really look for
only the negative things.

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:06.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make them
feel uncomfortable.

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If I asked
you for a reading

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:10.740 align:middle line:84%
in a different state
of mind-- let's

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.920 align:middle line:90%
say I was chipper or happy.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.640 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe the next time I
was down, upset, ticked off

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.690 align:middle line:90%
about something.

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Would that change the
outcome of the cards?

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:20.840 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: No.

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.230 align:middle line:90%
No, it would not.

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:24.430 align:middle line:90%
Now if I were upset--

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:25.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You as the reader?

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:29.210 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Me as the reader,
then that can certainly

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:30.910 align:middle line:90%
offset the interpretation.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Because again, each
of those cards,

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:36.200 align:middle line:84%
depending on the
position-- upright,

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.690 align:middle line:84%
reverse, sideways,
whatever the case may be--

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:41.560 align:middle line:90%
has multitudes of meanings.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So I don't want to see
you if you're in a bad mood.

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well, I mean, I
would interpret it differently.

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.270 align:middle line:84%
Just like a psychic-- if
you're going to a psychic,

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:52.580 align:middle line:84%
if the psychic is worried
out of his or her mind

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:56.430 align:middle line:84%
about something, that is going
to be a different reading

00:24:56.430 --> 00:25:00.850 align:middle line:84%
than if they're
skipping around in joy.

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And also their ability to
receive psychic information.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's get back
to the three dimensional

00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:09.770 align:middle line:90%
work of the tarot.

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:13.430 align:middle line:84%
How did you come up
with the concept?

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: I came up with it
because I wanted to know.

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:18.105 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to know.

00:25:18.105 --> 00:25:21.420 align:middle line:84%
Going through the old
traditional approach to it,

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.730 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't giving me the details.

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:26.100 align:middle line:84%
If it was a car, was
that a domestic car

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.150 align:middle line:90%
I needed or was going to get?

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:29.450 align:middle line:90%
Was that a foreign car?

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:32.520 align:middle line:90%


00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.960 align:middle line:84%
If somebody said you're going
to hear from-- the old way is,

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.750 align:middle line:90%
there's a message coming.

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:39.740 align:middle line:90%
Well, really?

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:40.790 align:middle line:90%
Everyone gets a message.

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.831 align:middle line:84%
You don't need a psychic
to tell you that, right,

00:25:42.831 --> 00:25:44.240 align:middle line:90%
or you don't need a tarotist.

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, where's the
message coming from?

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:48.150 align:middle line:90%
Who is it coming from?

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:50.330 align:middle line:90%
What is it about?

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:57.262 align:middle line:84%
And so my own need to know
was why I started this method.

00:25:57.262 --> 00:25:59.850 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What's the upside
of something like that?

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:01.560 align:middle line:10%
>>THOMAS: The upside
is is that you're

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.160 align:middle line:10%
allowed to get all
kinds of details.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.190 align:middle line:90%
The details matter.

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:09.970 align:middle line:84%
If you are a clairvoyant
or clairaudient,

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:13.070 align:middle line:84%
it's just a more powerful
tool for you to use.

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:17.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's a wonderful tool if you
already have those abilities.

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's a wonderful
tool if you're just

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:22.390 align:middle line:84%
starting to read
tarot, because you're

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:26.940 align:middle line:84%
able to also incorporate your
own interpretations into it.

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Not everyone has the
same worldview, right?

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And so we want to take
what he or she has

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:36.410 align:middle line:84%
and incorporate it
into the method.

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Take these to
a party or a restaurant.

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:41.470 align:middle line:84%
People will flock all
around you, won't they?

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Absolutely,
absolutely.

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:47.550 align:middle line:84%
People want to know what's
around the corner for me.

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:52.180 align:middle line:84%
I would like to be able to tell
them what wonderful things are

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:56.310 align:middle line:84%
going on in their lives and
what's coming up-- what things

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:59.092 align:middle line:84%
may be coming around
that they wish to avoid.

00:26:59.092 --> 00:27:01.050 align:middle line:84%
But I will never tell
them what they should do.

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Should these
cards be feared?

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:05.090 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Absolutely not.

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:06.250 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:09.490 align:middle line:84%
The cards have no
power on their own.

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:13.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a magic practitioner.

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:14.720 align:middle line:10%
I'm not a Wiccan.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.500 align:middle line:10%
I'm a Christian.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.900 align:middle line:10%
Actually, I'm a Catholic.

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:20.777 align:middle line:84%
So no, you shouldn't fear
the cards whatsoever.

00:27:20.777 --> 00:27:22.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People want to
get a hold of you, Angela,

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:23.795 align:middle line:90%

I want to teach the masses.

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:43.870 align:middle line:84%
I want them to know how to
do it the proper way, not

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:45.320 align:middle line:90%
a shady way.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.222 align:middle line:84%
Let's do this and
make the industry

00:27:48.222 --> 00:27:49.180 align:middle line:90%
upright and upstanding.

>>NOORY: It could be fun.

00:27:50.317 --> 00:27:51.400 align:middle line:90%
It could be informational.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:51.960 align:middle line:90%
