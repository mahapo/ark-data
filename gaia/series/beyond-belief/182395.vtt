00:00:24.728 --> 00:00:26.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Joshua P. Warren, a
dear friend, with us.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.659 align:middle line:10%
He's been investigating the
paranormal for three decades.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.560 align:middle line:84%
He owns a museum and
laboratories in certain spots

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.770 align:middle line:90%
around the country.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And he is an expert on the
relationship between matter,

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.010 align:middle line:90%
energy, and the paranormal.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.850 align:middle line:90%
Josh, welcome to the program.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSHUA WARREN:
Thank you, George.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.440 align:middle line:90%
Great to be back.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.023 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is always
good to see you,

00:00:47.023 --> 00:00:48.700 align:middle line:84%
whether we do live
shows in Asheville

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.050 align:middle line:84%
or wherever we go, you're
always there for us, my friend.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, thank
you for saying that.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.050 align:middle line:84%
It's been a pleasure to work
with you all these years.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.350 align:middle line:90%
And it is amazing.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.020 align:middle line:90%
We've done it all.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Every kind of media
you can imagine,

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.340 align:middle line:84%
you and I have tackled
it in one way or another.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you've now
relocated to Las Vegas, right?

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:06.908 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: That's right.

00:01:06.908 --> 00:01:08.630 align:middle line:10%
I now have a new
residence in Las Vegas.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.270 align:middle line:10%
Of course, you know my home base
is Asheville, North Carolina.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.690 align:middle line:10%
So I'll always be
traveling back and forth.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.480 align:middle line:10%
But Vegas is a
very special place

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.320 align:middle line:10%
to be right now with all of
these new revelations with UFOs

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.050 align:middle line:10%
and many other paranormal
things to explore.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you kind
of stumbled into something

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.960 align:middle line:84%
in Las Vegas called
a spacetime anomaly.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: It's a
spacetime anomaly or warp.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.670 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this was a very
unexpected discovery

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.560 align:middle line:84%
because I was looking for
an excuse to go to Area 51,

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.940 align:middle line:90%
which is about a two hour drive.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They won't
let you in there.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: No, they won't.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.027 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, a lot of
people make the mistake

00:01:47.027 --> 00:01:49.150 align:middle line:84%
of thinking that Area
51 is like a Disney

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.440 align:middle line:90%
attraction or something.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.580 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.920 align:middle line:84%
It's a bona fide, classified
military installation.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.150 align:middle line:84%
But you can get
fairly close to it.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.940 align:middle line:84%
There's a little town
called Rachel that's

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.200 align:middle line:90%
near it out in the desert.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.510 align:middle line:10%
And there's not
much else around.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.990 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They have sensors
that depict who you are

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.070 align:middle line:10%
and where you are.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Oh, there's no telling
the technology they have.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.800 align:middle line:84%
They say that they can
pick up the chemicals

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.500 align:middle line:90%
that emanate from your sweat.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.210 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: If a mouse
goes by, they know it.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: And so when
you drive up there,

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.010 align:middle line:84%
it's about a two hour
drive, and I'm telling you,

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.620 align:middle line:90%
there is no cell signal.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.300 align:middle line:90%
There are no gas stations.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.760 align:middle line:84%
You're in the middle
of nowhere for a while.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And I recently obtained this
new device called a differential

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.568 align:middle line:90%
time rate meter.

00:02:37.568 --> 00:02:38.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What the heck is that?

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Yeah, I decided I
was going to test this out

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.490 align:middle line:90%
around Area 51.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.990 align:middle line:90%
There is this gentleman.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.130 align:middle line:84%
He is a Silicon Valley
engineer named Ronald Heath.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And he has always been a
big fan of the X-Files.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And there's an early
X-Files episode

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.640 align:middle line:84%
where Mulder takes
two stop watches,

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.620 align:middle line:90%
and he synchronizes them.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And then he leaves
one at his car,

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.640 align:middle line:84%
and he takes the other
to a UFO hot spot.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And later when he compares
them, they're out of sync.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.230 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that something,
when the UFO appeared,

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.080 align:middle line:84%
changed the spacetime
in the area.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Some gravity was warped,
something like that,

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.800 align:middle line:90%
that influenced time.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.460 align:middle line:84%
This inspired Ronald
Heath to duplicate this

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.360 align:middle line:84%
by creating a meter that will
essentially do the same thing.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.510 align:middle line:84%
It's got two chips that
are like two clocks that

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.790 align:middle line:84%
are oscillating at 1 million
Hertz simultaneously.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.490 align:middle line:84%
They're separated
by a 100 foot coil.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And they should always
oscillate at the same rate.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.750 align:middle line:84%
But if there is a
spacetime change,

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.730 align:middle line:84%
then there's a
little display that

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.370 align:middle line:84%
will show you the
amount of the change.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, you know,
people like Bob Lazar

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.400 align:middle line:84%
say that at Area
51, they're working

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.360 align:middle line:84%
on gravity-distorting
technology.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.790 align:middle line:84%
So Ronald asked me if
I'd be the first person

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.690 align:middle line:84%
to take his device out
into the field and test it.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'd be
delighted to and this

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.450 align:middle line:84%
sounds like a great
thing to take to Area 51.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.610 align:middle line:84%
So the funny thing is I went up
to Area 51 and spent the night.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And around Area 51,
everything was pretty normal.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.490 align:middle line:84%
But there is this one
spot, about 20 miles north

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.290 align:middle line:84%
of Vegas, a nondescript spot
just on the side the road.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.910 align:middle line:84%
I was stopping along the way
taking readings as a control.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.003 align:middle line:84%
Because I imagine,
well, it's probably

00:04:37.003 --> 00:04:38.420 align:middle line:84%
going to be normal
the whole time.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And then I get to Area
51 and I get something.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.660 align:middle line:84%
But actually, only this one
spot on the side of the road,

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.140 align:middle line:84%
that I just so happened to stop
at because I had a nice area

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.130 align:middle line:84%
to pull over, I
discovered an anomaly.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.370 align:middle line:84%
Time actually slowed
down at that spot,

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.110 align:middle line:90%
20 microseconds per second.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Now that's a very small
amount, but it's not

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.330 align:middle line:90%
supposed to happen.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.780 align:middle line:90%
Now why is the big question.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, for one thing, I
found out afterward

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.760 align:middle line:84%
that that little spot on the
side of the road in the desert

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.010 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
incredible UFO

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.450 align:middle line:84%
hot spots in the entire country,
where amazing footage of UFOs

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.210 align:middle line:90%
has been filmed.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.090 align:middle line:84%
People have had close
encounters there.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.310 align:middle line:84%
I went out in the
desert with a guy who

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:34.430 align:middle line:84%
actually had a big triangle
over his car for 10 minutes.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And he said he was so close
that he could have probably spit

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.580 align:middle line:90%
and hit thing.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And so he even created a
little model of the UFO

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.730 align:middle line:90%
that was over his head.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.770 align:middle line:84%
So the first
possible explanation

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:54.360 align:middle line:84%
is that this is an area
where the UFOs are visiting.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a hotbed.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: And they
are sometimes using,

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.660 align:middle line:84%
just like in the X-Files,
some kind of gravity spacetime

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.140 align:middle line:84%
warping technology
that tends to leave

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.885 align:middle line:84%
a scar in an area
for a while, perhaps.

00:06:09.885 --> 00:06:11.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's
take a look at you

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.970 align:middle line:84%
in this video
explaining some of this.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.870 align:middle line:90%


00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.730 align:middle line:10%
>>WARREN: Hello, I'm
Joshua P. Warren,

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.000 align:middle line:10%
and I'm on my way to Area
51 for the first time ever.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.130 align:middle line:10%
Of course, Area 51 is the
secret military installation

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.450 align:middle line:10%
here in Nevada.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And on this particular
road trip I'm

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.770 align:middle line:84%
going to be stopping
along the way

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.020 align:middle line:84%
as I get closer and
closer to Area 51

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.240 align:middle line:84%
and taking a variety
of measurements.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.780 align:middle line:84%
My trip to Area 51 yielded
some interesting results.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.250 align:middle line:84%
There was not surprisingly
radio interference

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.680 align:middle line:90%
near the entrance to the base.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And after dark, using
paratemporal night vision

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:57.510 align:middle line:84%
goggles, I captured some
odd objects flying overhead.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:01.080 align:middle line:10%
There are even ancient
petroglyphs around the area

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.230 align:middle line:10%
showing a mysterious
alien-looking figure

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.140 align:middle line:10%
called Pahranagat man.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.600 align:middle line:10%
But the most surprising
result of my trip

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.080 align:middle line:10%
was not documented
at Area 51, but much

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.290 align:middle line:10%
closer to civilization
just north

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:22.410 align:middle line:10%
of Las Vegas between
Interstate 15 and Route 93.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:27.540 align:middle line:84%
I was using a new technology,
a differential time rate

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:34.710 align:middle line:84%
meter, or DT-Meter, created by
California engineer Ron Heath.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.530 align:middle line:10%
This device, this time
rate distortion meter,

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.760 align:middle line:10%
is able to pick up any little
variation in spacetime.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.920 align:middle line:10%
It compares two points.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.860 align:middle line:84%
A sensor with a meter that
are one hundred feet apart

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.540 align:middle line:90%
via a cable.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:52.080 align:middle line:10%
And it's always detecting
the signal that's

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.390 align:middle line:10%
being sent from the
sensor to the meter

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:57.810 align:middle line:10%
and whether or not it's getting
there at a normal rate of time

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.000 align:middle line:10%
or more slowly or more quickly.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.420 align:middle line:10%
We stopped at numerous
places between Vegas

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.150 align:middle line:10%
and Area 51 for tests.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:10.950 align:middle line:10%
The only place we registered
a spacetime anomaly

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:16.740 align:middle line:10%
was just north of Vegas near
the Great Basin Highway.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.890 align:middle line:84%
This reading indicates
that, for a moment,

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:24.240 align:middle line:90%
time slowed by 20 microseconds.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:28.780 align:middle line:10%
That means 20 100
thousandths of a second.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:34.000 align:middle line:84%
This is only supposed to happen
if a black hole approaches.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.100 align:middle line:84%
So what the heck
was happening here?

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:43.510 align:middle line:10%
And for many years, researchers
have filmed strange lights

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:49.350 align:middle line:10%
on the outskirts of Vegas,
often in this same area.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:53.010 align:middle line:10%
Is there a spacetime warp
that occasionally allows

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:57.020 align:middle line:10%
us a glimpse of other realms?

00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.830 align:middle line:84%
My testing of the Vegas
Interstate Time Anomaly,

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:04.830 align:middle line:90%
or VISTA, continues.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Please visit
JoshuaPWarren.com for updates.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Josh, how exactly
does the DT-Meter work, anyway?

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, going
back to that example

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.400 align:middle line:84%
in the X-Files of having to stop
watches, it's just like that.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:25.000 align:middle line:84%
There are two crystal
oscillating chips

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.040 align:middle line:90%
that are identical.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.847 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's why
we saw these two readings?

00:09:28.847 --> 00:09:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well,
basically, the reading

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:34.930 align:middle line:84%
is simply taking any sort of
difference between these two

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:37.810 align:middle line:84%
chips over that
span of 100 feet.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:41.590 align:middle line:84%
In a span of 100 feet, there
shouldn't be a difference

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:44.620 align:middle line:84%
unless something
extraordinary is happening.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And what's even more
amazing is that when

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.320 align:middle line:84%
I discovered this anomaly, it
was picked up by the media.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.470 align:middle line:84%
It became viral, it
went international.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:56.690 align:middle line:84%
It became news all
over the world.

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And there were
people saying, well,

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:02.710 align:middle line:90%
surely this must be a mistake.

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.450 align:middle line:90%
This is not supposed to happen.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:05.530 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what, George.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Since then, another one
has been discovered.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Right here in Colorado,
as a matter of fact.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.290 align:middle line:84%
It was on the History
Channel just recently.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:16.900 align:middle line:84%
At Mesa Verde, a
group of scientists

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.600 align:middle line:84%
who are bona fide rocket
scientists, mind you,

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.540 align:middle line:84%
they went and they discovered
another time anomaly

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.210 align:middle line:84%
using a different
technique with lasers.

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And so I predicted, when I
found this anomaly, that this

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.420 align:middle line:90%
was just the beginning.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.960 align:middle line:84%
That these things are
probably all over the place.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.260 align:middle line:84%
But we haven't been
looking for them properly,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.350 align:middle line:84%
and we also haven't had the
user-friendly tools that we now

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.090 align:middle line:90%
have in order to find them.

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
these anomalies mean?

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:45.580 align:middle line:84%
If you walk into one,
what happens to you?

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:50.408 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, let's say we
have a very short duration,

00:10:50.408 --> 00:10:51.700 align:middle line:90%
like the one that I discovered.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.440 align:middle line:90%
It was less than a second.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:58.750 align:middle line:84%
It may be that when you
experience a very brief time

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.557 align:middle line:90%
anomaly, you have deja vu.

00:11:01.557 --> 00:11:02.890 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're talking about.

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:07.090 align:middle line:84%
You have the sense that
I've seen this before.

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:10.690 align:middle line:84%
That's how it affects the
brain on such a small scale

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.220 align:middle line:84%
during that short
period of time.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:17.140 align:middle line:84%
However, let's expand that,
and let's think about this

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.760 align:middle line:90%
on a more extreme level.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:23.320 align:middle line:84%
You might literally be
able to see into the past.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.800 align:middle line:84%
That is, to see
something like a ghost,

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.093 align:middle line:90%
an imprint from the past.

00:11:28.093 --> 00:11:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or into the future?

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.642 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Possibly into
the future, as well.

00:11:31.642 --> 00:11:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And you know it's interesting,
because sometimes when

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:36.580 align:middle line:84%
people see a ghost,
they don't just

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:42.400 align:middle line:84%
see the figure of the ghost,
they see the entire setting

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.840 align:middle line:90%
from the past.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.050 align:middle line:84%
So you don't just see the
ghost of the old farmer.

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:50.410 align:middle line:84%
You see the ghost of the old
farmer and the old farmhouse.

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And of course, deja vu
being that feeling of knowing

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.150 align:middle line:90%
that you've been there before.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.095 align:middle line:84%
That an event had
already occurred.

00:11:58.095 --> 00:11:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And you just know
it's happening.

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:00.760 align:middle line:90%
You can feel it.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And you say, well, I've been
here with Joshua P. Warren.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.380 align:middle line:90%
I know what he's going to say.

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:06.670 align:middle line:90%
And you say it.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:09.160 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing how that works.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.380 align:middle line:84%
Some psychiatrists
think it could

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.020 align:middle line:90%
be some anomaly with the brain.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:20.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, it seems to be
something that we could sense.

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:22.960 align:middle line:90%
Because what is the brain?

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:28.120 align:middle line:84%
It's basically a bunch of
extremely tiny particles that

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.930 align:middle line:84%
are all exchanging
electricity back and forth

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.970 align:middle line:84%
that would be influenced
by something like this,

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:36.730 align:middle line:90%
however small.

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And so when it comes
to the idea that these

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:45.520 align:middle line:84%
may be strewn all around Earth,
we have to ask ourselves,

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.210 align:middle line:84%
is it possible that
extraterrestrials

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:50.710 align:middle line:84%
or interdimensionals
or whatever you

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:53.920 align:middle line:84%
want to call them
are aware of these

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.227 align:middle line:84%
and actually use
them to navigate?

00:12:57.227 --> 00:12:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And travel?

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Yeah, could
there be some type

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:05.290 align:middle line:84%
of a pattern, a
highway, of these things

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:09.630 align:middle line:84%
that these technologies, these
extraterrestrial technologies,

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:14.950 align:middle line:84%
were to tap into in order
to travel around the planet

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:17.320 align:middle line:90%
more easily?

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And is it possible that the
military is, of course, aware

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.200 align:middle line:90%
of this?

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.325 align:middle line:90%
What are they trying to do?

00:13:22.325 --> 00:13:26.360 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
back-engineer alien technology.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:30.700 align:middle line:84%
We know that from the
admissions with the Pentagon.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, it could
be that in Las Vegas, where

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:39.730 align:middle line:84%
we have Area 51, they're
studying the UFOs

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.860 align:middle line:90%
that are already coming there.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.890 align:middle line:84%
But then they're simultaneously
trying to back-engineer them.

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes these
anomalies might even

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:51.190 align:middle line:84%
be artificially created
by some of the experiments

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:53.350 align:middle line:90%
happening in Nevada.

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.060 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: These
anomalies that you

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:58.450 align:middle line:10%
think may be scattered
all over the planet,

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:03.550 align:middle line:10%
what would they be called if
we also knew what they did?

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:05.340 align:middle line:90%
Would they be time warps?

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:06.140 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: I think spacetime
warp is pretty good.

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:12.060 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are just
calling them a warp.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:16.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think the whole
Bermuda Triangle is a big one.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.720 align:middle line:84%
Brown Mountain, where
the Brown Mountain Lights

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.720 align:middle line:84%
appear in North Carolina,
it's like a miniature Bermuda

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.530 align:middle line:90%
Triangle.

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:25.200 align:middle line:84%
There are places on
this planet where

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:30.120 align:middle line:84%
you have a whole spectrum
of strange phenomena.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:35.360 align:middle line:84%
You go to a spot and people
see ghosts, they see UFOs,

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.640 align:middle line:84%
they report abductions,
they have time slips,

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.270 align:middle line:84%
they have more
psychic experiences.

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And I spent many years
investigating the Bermuda

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:46.590 align:middle line:90%
Triangle.

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
I had to get used

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.180 align:middle line:84%
to when I went to Puerto
Rico to set up my base

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:57.102 align:middle line:84%
there was how time seemed
to be slower than usual.

00:14:57.102 --> 00:14:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could you feel that?

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Yeah, I
was disoriented.

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:03.120 align:middle line:84%
I for years have done a lot
of work in radio, nothing

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.070 align:middle line:84%
compared to you, but
you get to the point

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.990 align:middle line:84%
to where if I were
to say right now,

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:08.790 align:middle line:84%
George, give me
30 seconds, you'd

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:11.160 align:middle line:84%
probably be able to do that
without looking at a clock.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.077 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, I would.

00:15:12.077 --> 00:15:14.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: You have that
inherent sense of timing.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And I've got a pretty good sense
of timing like that, as well.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.590 align:middle line:84%
But when I went down there
to the Bermuda Triangle,

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:21.250 align:middle line:90%
that was out the window.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.030 align:middle line:84%
It completely disoriented me
being in that environment.

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:26.977 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: By the way, you
just had your 30 seconds.

00:15:26.977 --> 00:15:27.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Thank you.

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:28.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just like that.

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:33.320 align:middle line:10%
Well, these anomalies,
how unusual are they?

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.570 align:middle line:84%
They probably have been around
since the beginning of time.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:38.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Yeah, I
would imagine so.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.610 align:middle line:84%
We keep learning more
and more about just how

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:44.860 align:middle line:90%
dynamic Earth is.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:48.570 align:middle line:84%
Even though we're so
egocentric, sometimes we

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:50.580 align:middle line:84%
look out the window and
everything looks calm,

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:55.290 align:middle line:84%
and so we don't realize that,
no, Earth is a chaotic system.

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:59.670 align:middle line:84%
The magnetic pole has been
shifting dramatically recently.

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:00.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And continues to.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:01.560 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Yeah.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And scientists aren't even
certain what's causing that.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same way that
we have atmospheric weather

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.580 align:middle line:84%
and we have cosmic
weather, we may

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:15.690 align:middle line:84%
have what you can almost think
of as interdimensional weather,

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:17.205 align:middle line:90%
or spacetime weather.

00:16:17.205 --> 00:16:19.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you may
have stumbled across it.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: I think I may have.

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're going to
find, certainly over the next 10

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:27.150 align:middle line:84%
years, that this is
much, much more common.

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And what I believe is that
as we map these places where

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:35.430 align:middle line:84%
we discover these
significant anomalies,

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:39.000 align:middle line:84%
we can overlay them with
places where people are having

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.490 align:middle line:84%
unusual and paranormal
experiences,

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:43.260 align:middle line:90%
and we will see them match up.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:47.610 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How widespread are the
anomalies in terms of space?

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:51.090 align:middle line:90%
Are they 200 feet wide, 15 feet?

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:52.163 align:middle line:90%
How big are they?

00:16:52.163 --> 00:16:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, that's
a great question.

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:56.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't really know
exactly how big they are.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.450 align:middle line:90%
This is so fresh.

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.690 align:middle line:84%
I think what we
would have to do is,

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:04.740 align:middle line:84%
instead of using one DT-Meter,
you'd need 10 DT-Meters.

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could you
literally start

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:11.369 align:middle line:84%
the meter, see the anomaly,
walk, and then the anomaly

00:17:11.369 --> 00:17:12.940 align:middle line:90%
goes back to normal?

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And then you could say,
oh, I walked 15 feet,

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.810 align:middle line:90%
that's how big this area is?

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: If you had one that
lasted that long, absolutely.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.849 align:middle line:84%
So far, the only
one that I found

00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:28.319 align:middle line:90%
was a very short brief one.

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:29.845 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So it's not ongoing?

00:17:29.845 --> 00:17:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: No, it's
almost like a ripple.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.545 align:middle line:84%
It's like catching a breeze,
like catching a current.

00:17:34.545 --> 00:17:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that makes it
even tougher, doesn't it?

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.347 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: It certainly does.

00:17:37.347 --> 00:17:39.390 align:middle line:84%
But there may be
places, however,

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:41.700 align:middle line:84%
where it does last
for a longer duration.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.413 align:middle line:84%
I haven't taken this yet to
the Bermuda Triangle and some

00:17:44.413 --> 00:17:45.330 align:middle line:90%
of those other places.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.100 align:middle line:84%
This is all groundbreaking
fresh stuff.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You need to find a
spot that it's on constantly.

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:51.450 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Yes.

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think sometimes
about the story

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.570 align:middle line:84%
of how Benjamin Franklin
discovered the Gulf Stream.

00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:59.370 align:middle line:84%
He'd heard all these
stories about how

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:02.670 align:middle line:84%
that when ships would travel
from Europe to America,

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:05.640 align:middle line:84%
it would take them longer
to get to America than it

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.580 align:middle line:84%
would take a ship to get
from America to Europe.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.300 align:middle line:90%
And nobody knew why.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.600 align:middle line:84%
So as Benjamin Franklin
was traveling to Europe,

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.690 align:middle line:84%
he would dip bottles into
the water once in a while

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:18.210 align:middle line:84%
and measure the
water temperature.

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And doing this over time, he
plotted these little points.

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And eventually he
connected the dots

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:29.160 align:middle line:84%
and it revealed the Gulf Stream,
which of course made navigation

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.290 align:middle line:84%
much easier for those
who realized how

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.400 align:middle line:90%
to work with it and around it.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.670 align:middle line:84%
So I think we're looking at
a similar situation here.

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:41.250 align:middle line:84%
Over time, I and other
researchers, myself and others,

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:44.370 align:middle line:84%
are going to be plotting all
of these different points

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:46.860 align:middle line:84%
around Earth and
eventually we're

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.850 align:middle line:90%
going to connect the dots.

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And then we are going
to see that they're not

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:57.630 align:middle line:84%
only is some kind of an
overall systematic design here,

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:01.260 align:middle line:84%
but there will be areas where
they last longer and are

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.580 align:middle line:90%
more intense.

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And those are going
to be some of our most

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:08.350 align:middle line:90%
revealing paranormal hot spots.

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:09.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You have a colleague.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.930 align:middle line:90%
His name is Patrick Burke.

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:13.270 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look at a
video in a second of what

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:14.620 align:middle line:90%
he captured in Gettysburg.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.360 align:middle line:90%
But tell me about Patrick.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Patrick Burke is
a DC-based investigator.

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:22.600 align:middle line:84%
He's been doing this kind of
research, especially ghost

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.680 align:middle line:90%
research, for decades.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And he captured a
piece of video that I

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:29.710 align:middle line:84%
think beautifully
illustrates what

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:34.630 align:middle line:84%
you might see if you
witness a ghost at one

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:37.810 align:middle line:84%
of these places that
has a time warp.

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:39.520 align:middle line:84%
Because you see,
there's a difference

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:45.360 align:middle line:84%
between a spirit being some kind
of a disembodied conscious soul

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.850 align:middle line:84%
that's interactive, that's
aware, that's unpredictable,

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:50.950 align:middle line:84%
and seeing something
that literally looks

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:53.680 align:middle line:90%
like it's recorded in the past.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.650 align:middle line:84%
It's like watching
a movie on a loop.

00:19:56.650 --> 00:20:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And so he went to the
Gettysburg battlefield,

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:03.040 align:middle line:84%
and he captured this piece of
footage we're about to see.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:06.550 align:middle line:84%
You're going to see several
snapshots from this.

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And what's so interesting
is that in the middle

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:12.430 align:middle line:84%
of the frame, there is
an actual physical human.

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:14.620 align:middle line:90%
That's one of his colleagues.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Now this is being
shot with night shot.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And so you see that the physical
human is actually reflecting

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.600 align:middle line:90%
the infrared illuminator.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.990 align:middle line:84%
But in front of him
is a second figure.

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:29.110 align:middle line:84%
This figure is very
clearly humanoid,

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:31.630 align:middle line:90%
but it's also translucent.

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:33.280 align:middle line:84%
So you can see
it's not reflecting

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.180 align:middle line:90%
the light in the same way.

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:39.610 align:middle line:84%
But the most remarkable thing
is that as this apparition is

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:42.640 align:middle line:84%
walking forward in
the footage, you

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:48.580 align:middle line:84%
see the apparition
lift his leg up

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:53.500 align:middle line:84%
as if he's trying to
go over a short wall.

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is not there.

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Not anymore, but
it was during the Battle

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:00.360 align:middle line:90%
of Gettysburg in 1863.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.800 align:middle line:84%
So we are seeing
an apparition that

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.140 align:middle line:90%
is interacting with the past.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.300 align:middle line:84%
This is the kind
of ghostly imprint

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.400 align:middle line:84%
that we find at
these places where

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.023 align:middle line:90%
we have these spacetime warps.

00:21:11.023 --> 00:21:12.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's look at this.

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:28.240 align:middle line:90%


00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.530 align:middle line:90%
What is that, Josh?

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:31.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: On the right
is the apparition.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.600 align:middle line:84%
In this first frame,
look, his leg is bent,

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.292 align:middle line:90%
and then he walks forward.

00:21:36.292 --> 00:21:37.750 align:middle line:84%
It's that first
frame where you can

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:41.140 align:middle line:84%
see him stepping over
that low wall, where

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:46.790 align:middle line:84%
his leg is bent at this bizarre,
right angle, back at the knee.

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Now that is a
full-bodied apparition

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.860 align:middle line:90%
from the Battle of Gettysburg.

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:55.590 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Was that a Confederate
soldier or a Union soldier?

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:56.390 align:middle line:90%
Who was that?

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:59.570 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: I showed that to our
friend Dr. Bill Forstchen, who

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:02.240 align:middle line:90%
is a great Civil War expert.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And he believes it looks most
like a Confederate soldier.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And there were a
lot of Confederates,

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:12.500 align:middle line:84%
especially at that spot, it's
called the Triangle Field,

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:16.120 align:middle line:90%
that were very savagely killed.

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.560 align:middle line:84%
So that's probably a
Confederate soldier.

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.660 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, we know
Gettysburg is just

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:23.930 align:middle line:10%
loaded with apparitions.

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Now if you were to take
this DT-Meter there,

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:29.030 align:middle line:84%
do you think you
would see a reading?

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:30.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: I do.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:36.120 align:middle line:84%
I think that if we go to a
battlefield location like that,

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:41.600 align:middle line:84%
it may be that the amount
of emotion that was expended

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:47.220 align:middle line:84%
actually has the same effect
on the spacetime environment

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:49.910 align:middle line:90%
that UFO technology may have.

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:53.600 align:middle line:84%
That there may be
multiple ways of creating

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:59.510 align:middle line:84%
these scars that last, these
ripples, at certain points

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:01.190 align:middle line:90%
in spacetime.

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And I find it
interesting, when we

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:05.210 align:middle line:84%
look at the example
of how time relates

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:07.310 align:middle line:84%
to the paranormal
in general, it's

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:09.680 align:middle line:84%
pretty obvious when
you see footage

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.990 align:middle line:84%
like we just watched
that maybe you're looking

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:14.060 align:middle line:90%
at something from the past.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.860 align:middle line:84%
But often, you
hear these stories

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:20.210 align:middle line:84%
about the typical guy driving
his pickup truck down the road

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:22.640 align:middle line:84%
in Texas at 10 o'clock
on a Wednesday night,

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.910 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden here's
the big Spielberg-esque flying

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:27.800 align:middle line:90%
saucer over the highway.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.480 align:middle line:90%
And the truck stops.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.110 align:middle line:90%
It stops working.

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:35.960 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the engine stops working,
and then the thing flies away

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.130 align:middle line:90%
and it starts working again.

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:38.780 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't have to
turn the ignition.

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:41.215 align:middle line:84%
So it's like time was being
paused while he was there.

00:23:41.215 --> 00:23:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like Richard
Dreyfuss in the truck, right?

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:44.420 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: That's right.

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And people talk about
missing time when

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:48.530 align:middle line:90%
they encounter these things.

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:51.830 align:middle line:84%
Time obviously applies to
ESP and psychic phenomena

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:53.780 align:middle line:84%
because we have the
concept of being

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:58.490 align:middle line:84%
able to look into the future,
precognition or postcognition,

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:01.230 align:middle line:90%
being able to see into the past.

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:04.340 align:middle line:84%
So time becomes an
integral component

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:08.270 align:middle line:84%
to all of these things that
we consider paranormal.

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that it has been
so difficult for us to predict

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:17.810 align:middle line:84%
when paranormal things are going
to happen because we haven't

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:20.330 align:middle line:84%
been really looking
at the relationship

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:23.120 align:middle line:84%
between these things
and time the way

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.430 align:middle line:90%
that we are starting to do now.

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As a paranormal
investigator, Josh,

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:29.570 align:middle line:90%
where's this taking you?

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, for
one thing, I now,

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.210 align:middle line:84%
after having done this kind of
research for almost 30 years,

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:40.730 align:middle line:84%
have to go back and
reexamine and reinvestigate

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:42.530 align:middle line:84%
all of these places
that I've already been

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:44.300 align:middle line:90%
to using this new technology.

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.548 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you doubting
things you've done in the past?

00:24:47.548 --> 00:24:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: No, I
don't doubt anything,

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:52.910 align:middle line:84%
but I definitely think that
I can open a whole new window

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:53.870 align:middle line:90%
on these things.

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are there
ghosts attached to this?

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well,
I think that when

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:01.130 align:middle line:84%
you consider that
many of these ghosts

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:06.450 align:middle line:84%
actually are an imprint
that's been recorded,

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:10.940 align:middle line:84%
then these places where time
doesn't function the way it's

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:15.170 align:middle line:84%
supposed to, where our brains
don't process time the way

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:18.230 align:middle line:84%
they're supposed
to, they are truly

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:22.010 align:middle line:84%
like windows that allow us
to see what we would usually

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:23.180 align:middle line:90%
call a ghost.

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:27.650 align:middle line:84%
I think most of the time
when somebody sees a ghost,

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:29.480 align:middle line:84%
they're seeing one
of these imprints.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.520 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very
rare for someone

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:35.300 align:middle line:84%
to have an interaction with some
kind of a disembodied spirit.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.600 align:middle line:84%
That happens, but it's a
different type of thing.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where will
this equipment take you?

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:42.890 align:middle line:90%
What will it open up for you?

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:46.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, so far I
have been investigating

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:48.890 align:middle line:90%
Nevada and California.

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And my plan is to work my
way across the United States.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Finding these spots?

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: And try to find
anomalies wherever I can.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
doing it randomly?

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:02.090 align:middle line:84%
Or do you have some inside
information on spots?

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, I
do ask for people

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:06.470 align:middle line:84%
to contact me if they've had
some type of an experience

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:08.510 align:middle line:84%
that they think applies
to this because I

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:middle line:84%
know it's impossible for me
to investigate everywhere.

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.790 align:middle line:84%
So I'm increasing
my chances by going

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:17.510 align:middle line:84%
to places that already
have some reputation

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:19.040 align:middle line:90%
for paranormal phenomena.

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:22.080 align:middle line:90%
But I also am using controls.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:25.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's just like
on my trip to Area 51.

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:26.690 align:middle line:84%
I was stopping in
the desert once

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:28.910 align:middle line:90%
in a while to get a baseline.

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Because if I only go to places
where paranormal activity is

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:33.350 align:middle line:84%
happening and I don't
have any baseline,

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:35.940 align:middle line:84%
then I'm not going to know the
cause and effect, necessarily.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:39.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if you find
that at all these spots

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:44.420 align:middle line:84%
there are time warp anomalies,
what can you conclude?

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well,
what we can conclude

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:50.220 align:middle line:84%
is that there is this
medium that we're

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.680 align:middle line:84%
all walking around in that
we're not usually that aware of.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.290 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
a fish maybe not

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:58.920 align:middle line:90%
being aware that he's in water.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:03.330 align:middle line:84%
This medium is
spacetime, which is not

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:07.440 align:middle line:84%
something that just affects
phenomena somewhere out

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.940 align:middle line:90%
there in outer space.

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:10.740 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:14.100 align:middle line:84%
This affects things
happening in your bedroom,

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:17.580 align:middle line:84%
in your living room, in your
backyard, in your driveway.

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:21.240 align:middle line:84%
These are things that
you come into contact

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:28.080 align:middle line:84%
with on a daily basis
that actually expose you

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:32.700 align:middle line:90%
to inconsistencies in reality.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And those inconsistencies
in reality

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:37.320 align:middle line:84%
are things that we can
either blow off and say,

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.290 align:middle line:84%
I didn't just see
what I just saw.

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Or we have to
acknowledge that reality

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.880 align:middle line:90%
is a much more fluid thing.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And by understanding how
spacetime anomalies connect

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.870 align:middle line:84%
with paranormal
phenomena, we're going

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:54.720 align:middle line:84%
to understand more
about what's possible

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:55.750 align:middle line:90%
in the human experience.

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This could be
one of the world's biggest

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:03.890 align:middle line:84%
breakthroughs in the
study of the supernatural,

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:08.190 align:middle line:84%
in the study of science,
physics, all of this.

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, in fact,
here's what I've been thinking.

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:17.280 align:middle line:84%
If we can really tell what
creates some of these time

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:21.870 align:middle line:84%
anomalies, then we might be
able to reverse the process

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:25.620 align:middle line:90%
and create a time machine.

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.900 align:middle line:84%
So let's say for
example, physicists

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:34.080 align:middle line:84%
tell us that gravity
and spacetime affects

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.030 align:middle line:90%
the behavior of light.

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:40.230 align:middle line:84%
So is it possible that we
can take light and use that

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:42.937 align:middle line:84%
in order to affect
gravity and spacetime?

00:28:42.937 --> 00:28:45.270 align:middle line:84%
So one of the experiments
that I've been doing in my lab

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:48.870 align:middle line:84%
is taking huge coils
of fiber optic cable

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:51.270 align:middle line:84%
and shooting lasers
through them and trying

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:55.680 align:middle line:84%
to see if I can create the
effect of a spacetime anomaly.

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:59.700 align:middle line:84%
If I can do that, it will
technically be a time machine.

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:01.920 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What is Para-Cymatics?

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.290 align:middle line:10%
>>WARREN: Now this is something
that's also fascinating

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:06.060 align:middle line:10%
because it ties
into the research

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:08.070 align:middle line:10%
that I'm doing in my lab.

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And the idea that when
you discover something

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:13.560 align:middle line:84%
about how nature
works, sometimes you

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:17.580 align:middle line:84%
can reverse that and
create something new.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:18.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which you have.

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.220 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Yes.

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:24.420 align:middle line:10%
The last time we spoke on
this program I was telling you

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:28.680 align:middle line:10%
about this thing I call
Para-Cymatics, which

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:32.820 align:middle line:10%
essentially what I
would do is take tones,

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:37.920 align:middle line:10%
and then I would turn those
tones into patterns in water,

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:42.900 align:middle line:10%
and then turn those patterns
into symbols or sigils.

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And these are little
magical symbols

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:48.780 align:middle line:84%
that can be used for
all kinds of things.

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:51.570 align:middle line:84%
If you want to increase
your odds of seeing a ghost,

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:53.340 align:middle line:84%
if you want to
attract more money,

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.530 align:middle line:84%
if you want to have
more vivid dreams.

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Whatever your goal
is, the idea is

00:29:57.810 --> 00:30:00.930 align:middle line:84%
you take these sigils and
you experiment with them.

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:03.420 align:middle line:84%
I put them on my website,
freely available.

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:05.640 align:middle line:84%
I've talked about
this on your show.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And plenty of people go and
they download these things,

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:11.250 align:middle line:84%
and they tell me
these amazing stories.

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:15.360 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, what if I
take this to the next level?

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:18.240 align:middle line:84%
What I now call
Para-Cymatics 2.0.

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:24.020 align:middle line:84%
If I can take a tone and
turn it into an image,

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:28.172 align:middle line:84%
can I take an image and
turn it into a tone?

00:30:28.172 --> 00:30:29.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take
a look at this.

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:47.580 align:middle line:90%


00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:50.140 align:middle line:84%
So what are we
looking at here, Josh?

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: OK, right now I am
bouncing lasers off of images.

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And the light from
the laser is going

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:03.240 align:middle line:84%
into a photoreceptive
circuit, which

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:08.470 align:middle line:84%
is processed through a
computer to create a tone.

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And that tone is played in
water to give me a pattern.

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And that pattern is
turned into a sigil.

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
like a mad science?

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:18.580 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Yes.

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:21.280 align:middle line:90%


00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:25.750 align:middle line:90%
And I found it amazing.

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:28.930 align:middle line:84%
OK, let me try to
explain it this way.

00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:31.600 align:middle line:84%
You and I may never
get to go back and hear

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:35.230 align:middle line:84%
in person Beethoven conduct
one of his symphonies.

00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Most
likely we will not.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: However, he gave
us the next best thing.

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:45.670 align:middle line:84%
He encoded his music as black
dots on a piece of paper.

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:46.990 align:middle line:90%
Sheet music, right?

00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:48.520 align:middle line:90%
So now we have the sheet music.

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And if we know how to
interpret those dots,

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.410 align:middle line:90%
we get to hear the music.

00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:55.083 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Over and over again.

00:31:55.083 --> 00:31:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Yeah,
and so it occurred

00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:02.510 align:middle line:84%
to me, what if crop circles,
Egyptian hieroglyphs,

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:07.810 align:middle line:84%
the pattern of Stonehenge,
what if these things

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:11.380 align:middle line:84%
which create some type
of striking visual

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:15.370 align:middle line:84%
actually do have
information encoded in them

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:18.190 align:middle line:84%
that we've never
been able to access?

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And so how do we play
the music they create?

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:25.490 align:middle line:84%
So I started taking
pictures of things.

00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are
things that I'll never

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:32.290 align:middle line:84%
be able to go and explore
in person, like star systems

00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:33.820 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:38.300 align:middle line:84%
Pictures of, well, a
picture of anything.

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.550 align:middle line:84%
You can take a picture
of a dollar bill,

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:43.850 align:middle line:84%
you can take a
picture of Earth, you

00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:46.610 align:middle line:84%
can take a picture of
the double helix of DNA,

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:48.312 align:middle line:90%
you take a picture of anything.

00:32:48.312 --> 00:32:49.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And do what with it?

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Using this
process, Para-Cymatics 2.0,

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.310 align:middle line:90%
you can scan it with lasers.

00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm the first person
to ever do anything

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:59.065 align:middle line:90%
like this, to my knowledge.

00:32:59.065 --> 00:33:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You are
a mad scientist.

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: I think that's
a fair assessment.

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:03.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I really do.

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:09.030 align:middle line:84%
But that's how you get
the new breakthroughs.

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:12.780 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be on the fringe
where the wacky stuff is

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:16.110 align:middle line:84%
happening in order to possibly
get something fresh and new.

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:19.950 align:middle line:84%
So by scanning these
different types of images

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:23.610 align:middle line:84%
and getting a tone, you
can listen to the tone

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:25.380 align:middle line:90%
that the pyramids make.

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:29.190 align:middle line:84%
You can listen to the
tone of a $100 bill.

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:31.910 align:middle line:84%
You can listen to the tone
of a picture of George Noory.

00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:34.243 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going to look
at some of that in a minute,

00:33:34.243 --> 00:33:35.670 align:middle line:90%
as a matter of fact.

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And then you can turn
that into a sigil.

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.900 align:middle line:84%
So let me give you
an example of this.

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:41.280 align:middle line:90%
I took a $100 bill.

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.540 align:middle line:90%
This is a true story.

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:45.220 align:middle line:90%
I took a $100 bill.

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:49.380 align:middle line:84%
I scanned it using my
system, Para-Cymatics 2.0.

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:53.440 align:middle line:90%
I got a tone from the $100 bill.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:57.330 align:middle line:84%
I put that tone into the
water and I made a sigil.

00:33:57.330 --> 00:34:00.390 align:middle line:84%
So I have a sigil
of the $100 bill.

00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:04.500 align:middle line:84%
Since I'm in Vegas right now,
I went straight to the casino.

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:07.530 align:middle line:84%
I went to a machine, I put
a $20 bill in the machine.

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And let's
look at a picture

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:11.550 align:middle line:84%
while you're telling
us of this $100 bill.

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: And I won $1,100.

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.739 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now what did that
have to do with winning?

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:19.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: I think
that sigil exposed me

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:22.260 align:middle line:84%
to some kind of
an energy pattern.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:23.764 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right, here it is.

00:34:23.764 --> 00:34:25.139 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: There
is the $100 bill.

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:28.020 align:middle line:84%
We all know what
that looks like.

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:31.469 align:middle line:84%
And you hear that
sound, that tone?

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:33.989 align:middle line:84%
That's the tone, that's
the sound of a $100 bill.

00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does every $100
bill sound the same?

00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:37.162 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Yes.

00:34:37.162 --> 00:34:38.370 align:middle line:90%
And that was the sigil of it.

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:39.862 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if
it was a $50 bill?

00:34:39.862 --> 00:34:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: It would
sound different.

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:42.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.449 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Yes, absolutely.

00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:44.639 align:middle line:90%
Everything sounds unique.

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:47.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So once you have this
tone, what do you do with it?

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, I get
the tone from the bill.

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:53.610 align:middle line:84%
I put it into water,
just tap water.

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:56.250 align:middle line:84%
I see the pattern that
it creates in the water,

00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:59.307 align:middle line:84%
and then I turn that pattern
into the sigil, which

00:34:59.307 --> 00:35:01.140 align:middle line:84%
was that weird looking
black and white thing

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.830 align:middle line:90%
that you saw on screen.

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And so the sigil is
like a little symbol

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:09.060 align:middle line:84%
that represents that tone
and ideally would expose you

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:14.050 align:middle line:84%
to the energy of that
particular image.

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:21.180 align:middle line:84%
So I like to think that
maybe everything in reality

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:23.700 align:middle line:90%
is encoded with some type of--

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:25.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Its own unique code.

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:26.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: That's exactly right.

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's why a lot
of magicians and people

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:35.220 align:middle line:84%
who practice Radionics,
Psionics, they say, all I need

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:39.090 align:middle line:90%
is a picture of the thing.

00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:41.240 align:middle line:84%
This is my dream
house, so I'm going

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.840 align:middle line:84%
to use a picture
of my dream house

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:46.920 align:middle line:84%
from this magazine to
represent this thing that I'm

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.780 align:middle line:90%
tuning my wishing machine for.

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Or if somebody is
practicing voodoo,

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:53.160 align:middle line:84%
they'll get a picture
of the person.

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:57.060 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're practicing
any type of manifestation,

00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:01.230 align:middle line:84%
vision boards, it's common
for you to get a picture.

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And people wonder, well,
does that picture just

00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:05.310 align:middle line:90%
help you with your own focus?

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:06.720 align:middle line:90%
Well, maybe that's part of it.

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:10.350 align:middle line:84%
But maybe there is
another intrinsic quality

00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:12.180 align:middle line:90%
in that image.

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:15.277 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to hear what
the pyramids sound like?

00:36:15.277 --> 00:36:16.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Yeah, I've got a tone
of the pyramids and a sigil

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:20.040 align:middle line:90%
from the pyramids.

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:25.020 align:middle line:84%
So let's say somebody wants
to do pyramid research.

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:27.720 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they'll take that
sigil from the pyramid,

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:30.803 align:middle line:84%
put it on the wall of their
office, put it in their wallet,

00:36:30.803 --> 00:36:33.220 align:middle line:84%
we don't even know what the
pyramids are really all about.

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:35.387 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'll let you explain
what we're looking at.

00:36:35.387 --> 00:36:38.040 align:middle line:10%
>>WARREN: This is a picture of
the Great Pyramids of the Giza

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.660 align:middle line:10%
Plateau.

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:40.710 align:middle line:90%
That's what I scanned.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:43.050 align:middle line:90%
You hear the tone that it made.

00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And that tone
produced this sigil.

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:47.410 align:middle line:90%


00:36:47.410 --> 00:36:49.210 align:middle line:90%
Now that sigil is a pattern.

00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will that
pattern be the same

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:55.220 align:middle line:84%
for all those same
tones, or do they change?

00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:57.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well,
every single image

00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:59.060 align:middle line:90%
creates its own unique tone.

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And every single tone creates
its own unique pattern

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:04.430 align:middle line:84%
and, therefore, its
own unique sigil.

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:07.250 align:middle line:84%
So one of my first challenges
when I started doing this

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:11.030 align:middle line:84%
was figuring out what
point of view to use.

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:16.050 align:middle line:84%
Because it begins with
the subjectivity of that.

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:19.760 align:middle line:84%
Let's be honest, this is
part art and part science.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:23.150 align:middle line:84%
I can't say that this is
all some objective hands-off

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:23.950 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, but
you're the only guy

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:26.450 align:middle line:90%
in the world doing this.

00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Yes.

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:31.190 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, as far as I
know, I invented this.

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And so what I do is I
have to take something

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:40.340 align:middle line:84%
that I find interesting, like,
for example, the pyramids

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:44.390 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, if I'm going
to scan an image of them,

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:47.090 align:middle line:90%
what point of view do I use?

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And in this particular
case, I chose

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:53.060 align:middle line:84%
to use an overhead
bird's eye view.

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have a picture
of me that you've also used.

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:58.460 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: I took a
picture of George Noory,

00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:02.565 align:middle line:84%
I got the tone it created, and
I created a George Noory sigil.

00:38:02.565 --> 00:38:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
tell us about this.

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:05.648 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: OK,
there's your picture.

00:38:05.648 --> 00:38:07.940 align:middle line:84%
I had to convert it
to black and white.

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:09.320 align:middle line:90%
I scanned this with lasers.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.520 align:middle line:90%
Hear this tone?

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:13.970 align:middle line:84%
This is the tone that
your image created.

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
George Noory sigil.

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
email this to you.

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:18.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do I do with it?

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, if you carry
that thing around with you--

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:24.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The sigil?

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:26.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: I think if you carry
your own sigil-- and believe it

00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:29.990 align:middle line:84%
or not, George, you are
the very first person

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:31.970 align:middle line:90%
I've ever done this with.

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:34.730 align:middle line:84%
I've never even
produced my own sigil.

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:37.680 align:middle line:84%
But I thought it'd be a
cool thing to do for you.

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:44.420 align:middle line:84%
I think that if you carry
your own sigil in your pocket

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:46.830 align:middle line:84%
and look at it as
often as possible

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:49.760 align:middle line:84%
that you are probably
going to have the most

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:52.100 align:middle line:90%
incredible synchronicity.

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And, as charismatic as
you are, you will probably

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:57.260 align:middle line:90%
be 10 times more charismatic.

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know exactly
what will happen.

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:01.130 align:middle line:84%
But I think you
will start seeing

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:06.080 align:middle line:84%
magical things materializing
around you like never before.

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:08.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.560 align:middle line:90%
Send it to me.

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Oh, I will.

00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:16.100 align:middle line:84%
You're reinforcing your
own bioenergy in a way

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:20.885 align:middle line:84%
by condensing it into a
particular focused spot.

00:39:20.885 --> 00:39:24.175 align:middle line:90%


00:39:24.175 --> 00:39:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'll be
your experiment.

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:26.350 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: OK.

00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:28.020 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'm going to
send this to you.

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk and see
what happens to you.

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:35.526 align:middle line:84%
But anybody can go to my
website and get these sigils.

00:39:35.526 --> 00:39:37.265 align:middle line:10%
JoshuaPWarren.com.

00:39:37.265 --> 00:39:39.420 align:middle line:10%
Get them for free.

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:41.330 align:middle line:10%
You don't have to
sign up for anything.

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:44.660 align:middle line:84%
I tell you exactly how
to experiment with them.

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And try it out and
see what happens.

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And not a day goes by I
don't get at least one email

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:55.490 align:middle line:84%
from somebody who has had
an amazing experience using

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:56.390 align:middle line:90%
a sigil.

00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:58.760 align:middle line:84%
So now it's pretty cool to
have this whole new batch

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:01.670 align:middle line:84%
of sigils that are coming
from scanning these images.

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:04.167 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You merely
just carry it with you?

00:40:04.167 --> 00:40:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: That's it.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.430 align:middle line:84%
I think you should
probably look at it, also,

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:10.820 align:middle line:90%
at least once or twice a day.

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:12.950 align:middle line:84%
It's good to have
it as a screensaver.

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:14.347 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big is it?

00:40:14.347 --> 00:40:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, the sigil
is just a little symbol.

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:18.190 align:middle line:84%
It can be as big or as
little as you want it to be.

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:19.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what we saw was
just a little tiny thing?

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:21.830 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: That was a
giant close-up of it.

00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:26.320 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, it's like
a postage stamp.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, just look at it.

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:31.550 align:middle line:84%
Or, I tell you what, when I
created the very first money

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:35.840 align:middle line:84%
sigil, people
started emailing me.

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And they were having
so much success

00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:40.640 align:middle line:84%
attracting money, getting
inheritances, and hitting

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:47.630 align:middle line:84%
jackpots, they tattooing the
sigils that I created in my lab

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:48.803 align:middle line:90%
on their bodies.

00:40:48.803 --> 00:40:49.970 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:53.933 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Yeah, and they were
doing that because it works.

00:40:53.933 --> 00:40:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I've got
a few trips coming up,

00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:58.790 align:middle line:84%
so get it to me and
we'll begin the research.

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: I think we
should create a whole bunch

00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:02.370 align:middle line:90%
of different ones.

00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And as much as you
and I both travel,

00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:07.280 align:middle line:84%
we'll experiment with a
lot of different patterns.

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's amazing that
you've been able to do this.

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:12.980 align:middle line:84%
You literally can
change people's lives.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:14.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: That seems
to be happening.

00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:17.690 align:middle line:84%
When you're in my position
and every single day

00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:20.400 align:middle line:84%
you get emails from
people who are saying,

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:24.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm using this technology--

00:41:24.350 --> 00:41:26.630 align:middle line:90%
if we can call it that--

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:31.010 align:middle line:84%
I didn't buy anything from
you, I didn't pay you anything,

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:33.290 align:middle line:90%
you're freely giving this away.

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:38.040 align:middle line:84%
I went and I used it and let me
tell you this incredible thing

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:38.840 align:middle line:90%
that happened.

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And this cannot
be a coincidence.

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:44.790 align:middle line:84%
I really can see, it is
changing people's lives.

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:48.240 align:middle line:10%
And I just got contacted
by a lady yesterday

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:52.248 align:middle line:10%
who hit a Powerball
jackpot using this.

00:41:52.248 --> 00:41:53.790 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You should
patent this thing

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:56.970 align:middle line:10%
before it gets in the hands
of too many other people.

00:41:56.970 --> 00:41:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Part of what I
like is giving things away

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:02.730 align:middle line:84%
freely because I believe
very strongly in karma.

00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:05.160 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But this is your idea.

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.090 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Yes.

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:08.280 align:middle line:84%
But you can't really
protect anything

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.110 align:middle line:90%
on the internet anymore anyway.

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:13.110 align:middle line:90%
So you may as well give it away.

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:15.910 align:middle line:84%
Let people have these
wonderful experiences.

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Let researchers
discover new things.

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Let's benefit from all this
collectively as humans.

00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And then I know that that
will always come back to me

00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:28.560 align:middle line:84%
in a way that's probably
even more rewarding than what

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:30.150 align:middle line:90%
I would get from a patent.

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Joshua,
tie this together

00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:33.810 align:middle line:84%
with what we talked
about earlier.

00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And that was, of course,
things that are going on

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:41.670 align:middle line:84%
with these anomalies out
there in space and time

00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:44.550 align:middle line:84%
with the sigils and
the frequencies.

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:46.470 align:middle line:90%
Where is this all taking you?

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: So ultimately,
this is about exploring

00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:53.970 align:middle line:84%
the relationship between
matter and energy.

00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:57.400 align:middle line:84%
You see, when I began as
a paranormal investigator

00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.440 align:middle line:90%
I was focusing mainly on ghosts.

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, now you sound
like you're into deep science.

00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:05.500 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, what I
found is that eventually,

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:08.670 align:middle line:84%
whether you're looking
at how a ghost manifests

00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:14.280 align:middle line:84%
or how a flying saucer
may traverse space

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:18.240 align:middle line:84%
or you're looking at how the
human consciousness works,

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:22.320 align:middle line:84%
they all are about exploring
the relationship between matter

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:25.350 align:middle line:84%
and energy and what the
limits of that may be.

00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:27.700 align:middle line:90%
What are the possibilities?

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And so whether you're
trying to manifest a ghost

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:36.250 align:middle line:84%
or you're trying to
travel through spacetime,

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:37.990 align:middle line:84%
we're really
talking about trying

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:44.320 align:middle line:84%
to learn how energy changes
from one form to another.

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:48.070 align:middle line:90%
And they call that transduction.

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:50.590 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you
take a quartz crystal

00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:53.050 align:middle line:84%
and you apply electricity
to it, that crystal

00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:55.090 align:middle line:90%
will resonate and vibrate.

00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Or if you put stress
on that crystal,

00:43:57.310 --> 00:43:59.210 align:middle line:90%
it will produce electricity.

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:01.540 align:middle line:84%
The crystal is
that medium that's

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:05.050 align:middle line:84%
transducing and changing
that energy from one form

00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:05.920 align:middle line:90%
to another.

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.260 align:middle line:84%
From electrical power
to mechanical power

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:09.190 align:middle line:90%
and back and forth.

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And so if we understand these
relationships between images

00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:22.780 align:middle line:84%
and tones, between spacetime
and strange human experiences,

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:24.700 align:middle line:84%
then we're going to
have a fuller, more

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:28.270 align:middle line:84%
comprehensive picture of
what this entire thing called

00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:32.980 align:middle line:84%
reality is and how it relates
to the human experience

00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:37.630 align:middle line:84%
so that we can work with
it, we can develop it,

00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:40.330 align:middle line:84%
and we can improve
it to make our lives

00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:43.605 align:middle line:84%
as positive and productive
and abundant as possible.

00:44:43.605 --> 00:44:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That
would be fantastic.

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:47.590 align:middle line:84%
A few years ago,
Josh, you sent me

00:44:47.590 --> 00:44:50.200 align:middle line:84%
what you called a
wishing machine.

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:52.150 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a little
look at this and then

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:55.600 align:middle line:84%
we'll have you explain
how this thing works.

00:44:55.600 --> 00:45:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Imagine a box that
can make your wishes come true.

00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:04.340 align:middle line:90%
Both good ones and bad ones.

00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:07.880 align:middle line:90%
It's a box with simple knobs.

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:11.350 align:middle line:90%
There is an input and an output.

00:45:11.350 --> 00:45:15.310 align:middle line:84%
It may be the holy
grail of technology.

00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:18.130 align:middle line:90%
It's weird in every way.

00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:20.560 align:middle line:90%
A proper name eludes us.

00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:25.000 align:middle line:84%
So we call it simply
the wishing machine.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.780 align:middle line:10%
When I wrote "The Wishing
Machine Workbook,"

00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:30.650 align:middle line:10%
I didn't know what to expect.

00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:33.340 align:middle line:10%
I mean, these are
Radionic printed designs,

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:37.210 align:middle line:10%
and I'd had a great deal of
success using them in my life.

00:45:37.210 --> 00:45:40.240 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't sure how well they
would work for other people.

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And you can imagine
just how impressed

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:47.860 align:middle line:84%
I was after a few
weeks to have received

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:52.480 align:middle line:84%
stacks and stacks
of grateful letters

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:55.180 align:middle line:84%
from people claiming that the
information in "The Wishing

00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:58.420 align:middle line:84%
Machine Workbook" had
improved their lives,

00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:02.060 align:middle line:84%
had improved their finances,
their relationships,

00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:03.400 align:middle line:90%
their health.

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:08.770 align:middle line:10%
And many of the people who
use this, all over the world,

00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:12.410 align:middle line:10%
they said, hey, we want
to take the next step.

00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:16.600 align:middle line:84%
We now want to use a
physical wishing machine.

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:18.790 align:middle line:84%
Now a physical wishing
machine is the type

00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:21.730 align:middle line:84%
that I have used personally
for years and years

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:23.980 align:middle line:84%
to improve things
in my own life.

00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:26.080 align:middle line:90%
Now this is just a wooden box.

00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:29.110 align:middle line:90%
It has nine knobs.

00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:31.720 align:middle line:90%
It has no battery.

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:33.500 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't plug into the wall.

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:36.680 align:middle line:84%
This is not powered by
traditional electricity.

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:39.580 align:middle line:90%
This is a mind-powered machine.

00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:42.190 align:middle line:84%
It's designed with a
very special circuit

00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:46.420 align:middle line:84%
inside to take your
intent, to tune it

00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:50.680 align:middle line:84%
for a particular wish or
desire, and to transmit it.

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:54.700 align:middle line:10%
Here we have a
metal input plate.

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:57.520 align:middle line:10%
And here we have an
output plate, also

00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:00.278 align:middle line:10%
known as a stick plate.

00:47:00.278 --> 00:47:02.320 align:middle line:10%
So the first thing we want
to do is put something

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:07.000 align:middle line:10%
on the input plate to represent
what you want to affect,

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.950 align:middle line:10%
because Radionics
is based on the idea

00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:12.580 align:middle line:10%
that everything in the
universe, every concept,

00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:15.010 align:middle line:10%
every combination
of circumstances,

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:19.630 align:middle line:10%
has its own frequency,
what we call a rate.

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:21.670 align:middle line:84%
So you want to
first find the rate

00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:23.530 align:middle line:90%
for what you want to deal with.

00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:27.640 align:middle line:84%
So let's say, for example,
we have a guy named Joe.

00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And Joe has lost his job and
he doesn't have any money.

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:35.800 align:middle line:84%
The first thing we want to do
is represent the concept of Joe

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:37.030 align:middle line:90%
without money.

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Now you can do that in
many different ways.

00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:42.820 align:middle line:10%
It's similar to creating
a specimen for some type

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:44.140 align:middle line:10%
of a voodoo experiment.

00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:47.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a lot of people
call this technoshamanism.

00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:49.790 align:middle line:84%
But here's one way you
could represent it.

00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:52.870 align:middle line:84%
If we have this piece of
paper, we can write on it, Joe

00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:55.090 align:middle line:90%
without money.

00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And maybe Joe even
signs his name.

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:01.000 align:middle line:10%
And then we might even
take one of Joe's hairs

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.380 align:middle line:10%
and tape that onto it.

00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:04.023 align:middle line:10%
You could put a picture of Joe.

00:48:04.023 --> 00:48:05.440 align:middle line:10%
There are lots of
different things

00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:07.570 align:middle line:10%
that you could do
to represent Joe.

00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:12.020 align:middle line:10%
But this is the concept
of Joe without money.

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:15.000 align:middle line:10%
So we're going to take
this sample, this specimen,

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.860 align:middle line:10%
and we're going to put
it on the input plate.

00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:21.940 align:middle line:84%
Now the next thing we have to
do is find the frequency for Joe

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:23.890 align:middle line:90%
without money.

00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:26.680 align:middle line:10%
Here's where the
knobs come into play.

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:30.430 align:middle line:10%
While we have this
on the input plate,

00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:34.450 align:middle line:10%
you would then gradually
turn the first knob.

00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:37.810 align:middle line:90%
The knob can go from 0 to 10.

00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:43.910 align:middle line:84%
As you turn the knob, you stroke
the output plate, or the stick

00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:44.710 align:middle line:90%
plate.

00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:48.800 align:middle line:84%
Now it's a plastic surface
and it feels rather smooth.

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:51.040 align:middle line:10%
But as you turn this knob,
there will come a point

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.990 align:middle line:10%
when something weird happens.

00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:55.210 align:middle line:10%
All of a sudden
the smooth surface

00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:59.180 align:middle line:10%
will fill sticky, like
it grabs your finger.

00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:01.150 align:middle line:10%
That's why we call
it a stick plate.

00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:02.920 align:middle line:10%
When you get that
sensation, that

00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:06.220 align:middle line:10%
is the subjective
feedback that indicates

00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:10.090 align:middle line:10%
that you have reached the right
frequency, or the right number,

00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:11.200 align:middle line:10%
for this knob.

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:13.400 align:middle line:10%
So let's say that
happened on this knob

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:16.090 align:middle line:10%
when we got to the number 2.

00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:17.920 align:middle line:90%
So now we move to the next knob.

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:19.210 align:middle line:90%
And we do the same thing.

00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:22.390 align:middle line:84%
We turn it clockwise while
stroking the stick plate.

00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And let's say it
sticks at the number 4.

00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Let's say we do the same
thing with the third knob.

00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And this time it
sticks at the number 6.

00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:34.690 align:middle line:90%
And so on.

00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:37.120 align:middle line:84%
You would do this with
each one of the knobs

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:39.370 align:middle line:84%
until you have a
nine-digit number.

00:49:39.370 --> 00:49:45.010 align:middle line:10%
This nine-digit number is the
rate for Joe without money.

00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:48.370 align:middle line:10%
But what we want, however,
is the opposite of that.

00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:52.060 align:middle line:84%
We want the frequency
of Joe with money.

00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:57.790 align:middle line:84%
So what we do is reset the
knobs now to the inverse.

00:49:57.790 --> 00:50:01.570 align:middle line:10%
So you would continue repeating
this with each one of the knobs

00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:07.270 align:middle line:10%
here until you have reset the
knob to its inverse position.

00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:09.220 align:middle line:10%
And then you're done.

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:10.090 align:middle line:10%
That's it.

00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:13.480 align:middle line:10%
You simply take the box
with the specimen on it

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:18.200 align:middle line:10%
and you put it away in a
nice quiet, peaceful place.

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And ideally, what you
desire will come true.

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:26.390 align:middle line:84%
That's how the
wishing machine works.

00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:29.420 align:middle line:10%
I think that these devices,
by some means not fully

00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:33.050 align:middle line:10%
understood, are like a map,
a map for your thoughts

00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:34.670 align:middle line:10%
and for your intentions.

00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:36.650 align:middle line:84%
It allows you to take
your wishes, whatever

00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:40.760 align:middle line:84%
they may be, and focus
them on a particular goal

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:42.690 align:middle line:90%
and get there faster.

00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:45.290 align:middle line:10%
So we're doing this experiment
for a very limited time,

00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:49.430 align:middle line:10%
making these physical wishing
machines available to you.

00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:51.320 align:middle line:90%
I hope that you'll buy one.

00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:53.960 align:middle line:84%
I hope that you will help
us with this experiment.

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:57.860 align:middle line:10%
I think that your feedback
will be fascinating.

00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think this will be a
fantastic introduction for you

00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:05.580 align:middle line:84%
into the vast and wonderful
world of Radionics,

00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:08.090 align:middle line:90%
and I wish you good luck.

00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:09.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does
this thing work?

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:13.580 align:middle line:84%
It's got these little
dials and knobs and stuff.

00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And yet you can wish for
things electronically,

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:19.538 align:middle line:90%
and they happen.

00:51:19.538 --> 00:51:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: It's even
weirder than that

00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:24.290 align:middle line:84%
because some of these wishing
machines don't even plug in

00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:25.370 align:middle line:90%
or have batteries.

00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:29.000 align:middle line:90%


00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.340 align:middle line:84%
We found that when
they plug in, they

00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:35.010 align:middle line:84%
seem to help you manifest
things more quickly.

00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think that may
be because the brain is

00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:40.070 align:middle line:90%
an electrical machine.

00:51:40.070 --> 00:51:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And maybe when there is
an electrical field being

00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:47.810 align:middle line:84%
broadcast, somehow it becomes
an extension of the brain,

00:51:47.810 --> 00:51:49.490 align:middle line:90%
of the mind.

00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:52.610 align:middle line:84%
When people ask, how does
the wishing machine work,

00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:56.240 align:middle line:84%
the short answer
is, we don't know.

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:58.250 align:middle line:90%
But here is my theory on that.

00:51:58.250 --> 00:51:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And who invented it?

00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: The wishing
machine, as we know it,

00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:05.540 align:middle line:84%
was invented by a physician
named Dr. Albert Abrams.

00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And he developed this
in the early 1900s.

00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And he got into
trouble because he

00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:13.120 align:middle line:84%
was a very esteemed
medical doctor,

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:15.530 align:middle line:84%
and he was saying that
this could heal people.

00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:17.810 align:middle line:90%
But he couldn't explain how.

00:52:17.810 --> 00:52:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's not acceptable
in the world of science.

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.720 align:middle line:84%
So for a while it was
dismissed as quackery.

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:26.180 align:middle line:84%
But then other scientists
realized that this doesn't just

00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:30.920 align:middle line:84%
apply to the health
experiments that he was doing.

00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:36.320 align:middle line:84%
You can use these wishing
machines in order to manifest

00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:40.550 align:middle line:84%
and materialize things in
an almost miraculous way.

00:52:40.550 --> 00:52:44.120 align:middle line:84%
My feeling about how
it works is that--

00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Engineers talk about this thing
called sympathetic resonance.

00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:51.440 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
if a man walks

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:57.770 align:middle line:84%
in to a room that's empty
except for two identical pianos

00:52:57.770 --> 00:53:00.920 align:middle line:84%
and he goes up and bangs
a chord on one piano,

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:04.130 align:middle line:84%
the other piano will play that
same cord even though he never

00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:05.720 align:middle line:90%
goes near it.

00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And you can see this if
you go on the internet

00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:09.500 align:middle line:90%
and look at tuning forks.

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Somebody will strike
one tuning fork

00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:13.940 align:middle line:84%
and another one nearby
picks it will start singing.

00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:15.310 align:middle line:90%
That's sympathetic resonance.

00:53:15.310 --> 00:53:18.770 align:middle line:84%
That when you project
something out there,

00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:23.660 align:middle line:84%
it activates a corresponding
signal that comes back to you.

00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
we do this every day

00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:30.530 align:middle line:84%
to a certain extent when we
are sending out something

00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:35.463 align:middle line:84%
into the ether, something
into this spacetime medium,

00:53:35.463 --> 00:53:36.380 align:middle line:90%
through consciousness.

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:40.790 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is, we
get distracted constantly,

00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:45.210 align:middle line:84%
now more than ever with the
invention of the smartphone.

00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:47.840 align:middle line:84%
So you don't get to
stick with a thought

00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:50.690 align:middle line:84%
long enough sometimes for it
to make the kind of impression

00:53:50.690 --> 00:53:52.640 align:middle line:90%
that you want.

00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:57.770 align:middle line:84%
This device, though, the
wishing machine, it does

00:53:57.770 --> 00:54:00.620 align:middle line:84%
have a very strange
circuit that includes

00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:04.400 align:middle line:84%
some very special quartz
crystals, getting back

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:06.200 align:middle line:90%
to the power of quartz.

00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that when
you set an intention

00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:12.080 align:middle line:84%
into a wishing
machine and you go

00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:16.730 align:middle line:84%
through the very simple
process of tuning it, suddenly

00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:21.080 align:middle line:84%
this becomes automated
sympathetic resonance.

00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:23.660 align:middle line:84%
You can put that
thing away and then

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:26.510 align:middle line:84%
you can go figure out what
you're going to have for dinner

00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:29.130 align:middle line:84%
or what time you have to get
up in the morning or whatever.

00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And that thing is sitting
there, continuing to broadcast

00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:37.320 align:middle line:90%
your intent on your behalf.

00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I call it automated
sympathetic resonance.

00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How often does
it work in a positive way?

00:54:44.970 --> 00:54:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, I have
been using them now

00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:49.100 align:middle line:90%
for close to 20 years.

00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:52.090 align:middle line:84%
I actually have about 10 of
them running at any given time.

00:54:52.090 --> 00:54:53.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Simultaneously?

00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Yes, on different
wishes and different projects.

00:54:56.330 --> 00:54:59.580 align:middle line:84%
I see things manifest
every single day using

00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:00.380 align:middle line:90%
a wishing machine.

00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:03.360 align:middle line:84%
You can use it for
anything you want.

00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And the great thing
about a wishing machine

00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:11.060 align:middle line:84%
is that not only does
it work most of the time

00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:13.827 align:middle line:84%
if you use it properly,
within limits.

00:55:13.827 --> 00:55:16.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're not going to
be able to fly like Superman

00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:19.775 align:middle line:84%
or live for 1,000
years or whatever.

00:55:19.775 --> 00:55:22.790 align:middle line:84%
If it can function
within the natural laws,

00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:24.260 align:middle line:84%
then it's something
that you should

00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:27.270 align:middle line:84%
be able to accomplish
with a wishing machine.

00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And when I set these
things up, sometimes I

00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:36.030 align:middle line:84%
use some for long-term goals
and some for short-term goals.

00:55:36.030 --> 00:55:37.887 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example, if
I'm working on a book

00:55:37.887 --> 00:55:39.470 align:middle line:84%
and I want it to be
a success, I might

00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:41.435 align:middle line:90%
set a machine for six months.

00:55:41.435 --> 00:55:43.310 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm going to have
a picnic in two days

00:55:43.310 --> 00:55:45.270 align:middle line:84%
and I want it to
be nice and sunny,

00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:47.120 align:middle line:84%
and I'll set one
for something that's

00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:48.620 align:middle line:84%
going to work a
little more quickly.

00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it only
for positive things?

00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:55.010 align:middle line:84%
What if there's someone who
gets one and wants to put curses

00:55:55.010 --> 00:55:56.180 align:middle line:90%
on people or something?

00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: You can do that.

00:55:58.160 --> 00:55:59.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Will it work?

00:55:59.270 --> 00:56:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Yes.

00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:03.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then there's a
malfunction somewhere.

00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:05.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, you know how
they say about computers,

00:56:05.850 --> 00:56:07.640 align:middle line:90%
garbage in, garbage out.

00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:10.400 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing
with a wishing machine.

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:14.360 align:middle line:84%
It will produce what
you put into it.

00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:18.170 align:middle line:84%
But the good news is, it's
not like some leprechaun

00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:20.510 align:middle line:84%
wish or some monkey's
paw, where you make a wish

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:24.320 align:middle line:84%
and there's always some
pay that you have to make.

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:27.530 align:middle line:90%


00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:29.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not like that.

00:56:29.330 --> 00:56:34.740 align:middle line:84%
It will only be capable of
producing what you put into it.

00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:38.250 align:middle line:84%
So what that means is if
you are an evil person

00:56:38.250 --> 00:56:40.340 align:middle line:84%
and you sit down, and
you're like Darth Vader

00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:46.380 align:middle line:84%
and you use the force for the
dark purposes, you can do it.

00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:48.290 align:middle line:84%
But it would be
foolish to do that.

00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:50.198 align:middle line:84%
Because guess what's
going to happen?

00:56:50.198 --> 00:56:51.740 align:middle line:84%
It's going to come
right back to you.

00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:54.790 align:middle line:90%


00:56:54.790 --> 00:56:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it ultimately is a
way of working with karma.

00:56:58.370 --> 00:57:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
it only makes sense

00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:05.330 align:middle line:84%
to put positive energy into
it because, ultimately,

00:57:05.330 --> 00:57:06.920 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the
day, you're going

00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:09.420 align:middle line:90%
to receive what you put out.

00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And so people, they get
angry, they feel betrayed,

00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:17.120 align:middle line:84%
they want revenge, and
they use wishing machines.

00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And I will caution
against one thing.

00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:22.250 align:middle line:84%
I do know some people who
don't believe in karma.

00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And they think if they
do negative things,

00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:25.790 align:middle line:90%
there's no consequence.

00:57:25.790 --> 00:57:28.280 align:middle line:90%
But I don't believe that.

00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:30.110 align:middle line:84%
I understand that
good and evil are

00:57:30.110 --> 00:57:32.030 align:middle line:84%
subjective things
and different people

00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:33.950 align:middle line:90%
have different opinions of that.

00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:36.212 align:middle line:84%
But still, if you're going
to try to hurt somebody,

00:57:36.212 --> 00:57:37.670 align:middle line:84%
well, you're probably
the one who's

00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:39.110 align:middle line:84%
going to end up being
hurt in the end.

00:57:39.110 --> 00:57:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think so.

00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:41.580 align:middle line:90%
I think that's absolutely true.

00:57:41.580 --> 00:57:43.380 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing apparatus.

00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:46.790 align:middle line:84%
I remember when you first talked
about it on "Coast to Coast"

00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:49.460 align:middle line:84%
and then you sent me one to
experiment and play with.

00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:52.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm still dabbling with
it, by the way, Josh.

00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:54.770 align:middle line:84%
I haven't made any
big specific wish.

00:57:54.770 --> 00:57:57.030 align:middle line:84%
But I'm still trying
to figure it out.

00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:59.450 align:middle line:84%
But you laid it out
pretty well for people,

00:57:59.450 --> 00:58:00.960 align:middle line:90%
and it's well constructed.

00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well,
thank you very much.

00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And I have Dr. Mulder
to thank for that.

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:06.900 align:middle line:84%
He is the best wishing
machine maker in the world.

00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And he's made thousands of them,
they're all over the place.

00:58:10.170 --> 00:58:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And so he and I partnered
up on what we call

00:58:12.590 --> 00:58:14.510 align:middle line:90%
the wishing machine project.

00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:17.330 align:middle line:84%
So I can help educate
people on what

00:58:17.330 --> 00:58:19.400 align:middle line:84%
these things are, and
he's the engineer who

00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:20.870 align:middle line:90%
puts them together.

00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And you know, one
of the great things

00:58:23.090 --> 00:58:28.640 align:middle line:84%
about the wishing
machine is that sometimes

00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:30.590 align:middle line:84%
if you get a wishing
machine and you

00:58:30.590 --> 00:58:33.290 align:middle line:84%
start thinking about
what you want to wish,

00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:37.178 align:middle line:84%
you realize what a
nice life you have.

00:58:37.178 --> 00:58:38.720 align:middle line:84%
That's probably what
happened to you.

00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:41.180 align:middle line:84%
You've got a good life,
and so probably you

00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:43.280 align:middle line:84%
sat down there and
thought, I'm not

00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:45.620 align:middle line:84%
sure I need to
wish for anything.

00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:48.870 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes it helps
you appreciate the things

00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:49.670 align:middle line:90%
you already have.

00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:51.503 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Actually, you
know what I wish for?

00:58:51.503 --> 00:58:53.540 align:middle line:84%
I wish for things
for other people.

00:58:53.540 --> 00:58:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, that could be
a dangerous business, as well.

00:58:57.410 --> 00:59:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because sometimes
you may think that you know

00:59:00.830 --> 00:59:03.650 align:middle line:84%
somebody's circumstances
when you really don't.

00:59:03.650 --> 00:59:05.948 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they're good
things, they're good wishes.

00:59:05.948 --> 00:59:07.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: You just
got to be careful.

00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:08.365 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:59:08.365 --> 00:59:11.510 align:middle line:90%
A warning from Joshua P. Warren.

00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:14.270 align:middle line:84%
If people want the washing
machine, how did they get it?

00:59:14.270 --> 00:59:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: If you go
to JoshuaPWarren.com,

00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:17.970 align:middle line:90%
you'll find links there.

00:59:17.970 --> 00:59:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Or you can just go directly

and you'll find everything
you can imagine there.

00:59:37.850 --> 00:59:40.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Beyond these little
anomalies around the country,

00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:42.560 align:middle line:90%
what else are you working on?

00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, right
now I am in the process

00:59:46.310 --> 00:59:50.540 align:middle line:84%
of building a very special
laboratory in Las Vegas.

00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind
of laboratory?

00:59:52.050 --> 00:59:54.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: It's not only going
to be a functional laboratory,

00:59:54.770 --> 00:59:57.780 align:middle line:84%
but it's also going to
be a show laboratory.

00:59:57.780 --> 00:59:59.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now when I
think of laboratory,

00:59:59.450 --> 01:00:02.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking of beakers and
test tubes and everything else.

01:00:02.650 --> 01:00:04.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: It'll have
all that stuff in it.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:09.515 align:middle line:84%
There will be a lot of
electrodynamic stuff.

01:00:09.515 --> 01:00:10.640 align:middle line:90%
I'll have wishing machines.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:13.160 align:middle line:90%
I have a huge Tesla coil.

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:18.580 align:middle line:84%
I was on national
TV last Halloween,

01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:20.890 align:middle line:84%
shooting lightning
bolts out of this thing.

01:00:20.890 --> 01:00:24.190 align:middle line:84%
Tesla coils, Van de Graff
machines, wimshurst generators,

01:00:24.190 --> 01:00:25.720 align:middle line:90%
Para-Cymatics.

01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:28.930 align:middle line:84%
I have a whole list of
things that I want to do.

01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:30.827 align:middle line:84%
Time travel experiments,
as I was saying.

01:00:30.827 --> 01:00:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this going to be a
visiting laboratory for people?

01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:36.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: I'm going to
open it up maybe about once

01:00:36.430 --> 01:00:39.640 align:middle line:90%
a month for tours.

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And not only just tours, I'm
going to be there in person.

01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:44.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As the mad scientist?

01:00:44.890 --> 01:00:47.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: You get to meet
the mad scientist in person.

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And I will take
you right in there,

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:50.950 align:middle line:84%
and I will spend a
few hours with you

01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:53.290 align:middle line:84%
and I will demonstrate
stuff for you.

01:00:53.290 --> 01:00:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the
things that I talk about

01:00:55.830 --> 01:00:58.840 align:middle line:84%
sound so extraordinary,
people just

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:02.020 align:middle line:90%
have to see it to believe it.

01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I have
witnessed you over the years.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:08.502 align:middle line:84%
What you say and what you
do are the same thing.

01:01:08.502 --> 01:01:09.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: That's right.

01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And I want people to be able
to see that for themselves.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:14.560 align:middle line:84%
I want them to walk in the
door and say, let me show you

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:16.750 align:middle line:90%
how I create this sigil.

01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:18.910 align:middle line:84%
Let me show you the
result that I get

01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:20.580 align:middle line:90%
when I charge up this object.

01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:22.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Look at this
picture of Noory.

01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:23.110 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Yeah.

01:01:23.110 --> 01:01:25.060 align:middle line:90%
And show them how it's done.

01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'll have not only
the lab working there,

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:32.020 align:middle line:84%
I'll have studio
space similar to this

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:37.300 align:middle line:84%
so I can shoot demonstration
videos more easily.

01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:41.080 align:middle line:84%
I'll have a stage, where I
can do presentations, maybe

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:44.530 align:middle line:84%
workshops, classes
from time to time.

01:01:44.530 --> 01:01:49.150 align:middle line:84%
It's going to just be
a center of innovation

01:01:49.150 --> 01:01:53.800 align:middle line:84%
and learning and sharing the
likes of which have probably

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:55.680 align:middle line:90%
never been produced before.

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And so this is one
of my big life goals

01:01:58.450 --> 01:02:02.270 align:middle line:84%
to see if I might be able to get
it done this year or next year,

01:02:02.270 --> 01:02:04.280 align:middle line:84%
at least make some
progress on it.

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:06.970 align:middle line:84%
I think it'll just keep getting
bigger and bigger and bigger

01:02:06.970 --> 01:02:09.670 align:middle line:84%
because I'll just need more
and more space as time goes on.

01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
going to keep

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:11.680 align:middle line:90%
the museum in Asheville going?

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:12.763 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Absolutely, yes.

01:02:12.763 --> 01:02:15.610 align:middle line:84%
The Asheville Mystery Museum is
one of the most popular tourist

01:02:15.610 --> 01:02:17.900 align:middle line:84%
attractions in Asheville,
North Carolina.

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:19.670 align:middle line:84%
We have the haunted
Asheville ghost tours,

01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:22.120 align:middle line:84%
which I believe are
the largest walking

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:24.340 align:middle line:84%
tours in the state of
North Carolina now.

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And so people come
from all over the world

01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:29.350 align:middle line:84%
every year, they take the
haunted Asheville tour,

01:02:29.350 --> 01:02:31.210 align:middle line:90%
they visit the Mystery Museum.

01:02:31.210 --> 01:02:33.730 align:middle line:84%
I've got my lab there where
I can work on things when

01:02:33.730 --> 01:02:34.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm in North Carolina.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:39.010 align:middle line:84%
So I'm in a pretty exciting
spot in my life right now.

01:02:39.010 --> 01:02:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In our final
moments here, Josh,

01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:42.757 align:middle line:84%
give us an update
of Robert the doll.

01:02:42.757 --> 01:02:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: I knew you're
going ask me about Robert.

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:46.673 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I end have the
show without getting

01:02:46.673 --> 01:02:47.980 align:middle line:10%
an update on Robert.

01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: He seems to
be doing very well.

01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:53.830 align:middle line:84%
There was a period
of time when people

01:02:53.830 --> 01:02:58.510 align:middle line:84%
would contact me and tell me
about all these terrible things

01:02:58.510 --> 01:03:01.350 align:middle line:84%
that had happened to them when
they would go to see Robert

01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:02.680 align:middle line:90%
the doll.

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:06.760 align:middle line:84%
But believe it or not, I
think, thanks to people

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:10.930 align:middle line:84%
like yourself and myself
talking about this enough,

01:03:10.930 --> 01:03:16.382 align:middle line:84%
telling people, you'd better
be respectful of this doll.

01:03:16.382 --> 01:03:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you like him,
he'll treat you well.

01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:19.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Say
something nice to him.

01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:22.398 align:middle line:84%
Don't take his picture
without asking permission.

01:03:22.398 --> 01:03:23.940 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't like that
for some reason.

01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Don't belittle him.

01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:27.160 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Not at all.

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.170 align:middle line:84%
I think the message
has finally hit home.

01:03:29.170 --> 01:03:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And now I am
getting to the point

01:03:31.450 --> 01:03:33.760 align:middle line:84%
where I am receiving more
messages from visitors

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:36.910 align:middle line:84%
to Key West who are
saying, I actually

01:03:36.910 --> 01:03:41.855 align:middle line:84%
have had good luck since
I came in into contact

01:03:41.855 --> 01:03:42.730 align:middle line:90%
with Robert the doll.

01:03:42.730 --> 01:03:46.960 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Is he still in the
glass hermetically-sealed box?

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: He is
still well-protected.

01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:52.460 align:middle line:84%
He's over 100 years
old, and he is fragile.

01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:55.870 align:middle line:84%
So they keep him there in the
East Fort Martello Museum,

01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:59.350 align:middle line:90%
and he is the star of the show.

01:03:59.350 --> 01:04:02.488 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's got an interesting
smile on his face, doesn't he?

01:04:02.488 --> 01:04:04.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Kind of
like the Mona Lisa.

01:04:04.030 --> 01:04:05.510 align:middle line:90%
You're not sure exactly.

01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:07.860 align:middle line:84%
Is that a smile, is that
a frown, is that a smirk?

01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:08.660 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:12.580 align:middle line:84%
But I can swear sometimes
it seems to change right

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:13.930 align:middle line:90%
before your eyes.

01:04:13.930 --> 01:04:17.510 align:middle line:84%
When I first met Robert
the doll in person,

01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:21.163 align:middle line:84%
he had a very standoffish
expression on his face.

01:04:21.163 --> 01:04:23.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He didn't know
how to figure you out.

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:23.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Yeah.

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And I came to him, and I
felt silly, but I said,

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:28.810 align:middle line:90%
what the heck?

01:04:28.810 --> 01:04:31.420 align:middle line:90%
I said, I'm Joshua P. Warren.

01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:33.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm from North Carolina.

01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:36.030 align:middle line:84%
I've come here to
do a study, and I'm

01:04:36.030 --> 01:04:37.690 align:middle line:84%
going to get on
"Coast to Coast AM"

01:04:37.690 --> 01:04:40.630 align:middle line:84%
and tell millions of people
about it, and blah, blah, blah.

01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I could have
sworn that turned into a smile

01:04:45.610 --> 01:04:46.810 align:middle line:90%
on his face.

01:04:46.810 --> 01:04:51.467 align:middle line:84%
And since then, he and I
have been best friends.

01:04:51.467 --> 01:04:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would
not mind having him

01:04:53.050 --> 01:04:54.572 align:middle line:90%
in your house at night?

01:04:54.572 --> 01:04:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: No, I'd love
to have Robert the doll.

01:04:56.530 --> 01:05:00.550 align:middle line:84%
I even tried to buy him and
they wouldn't sell him to me.

01:05:00.550 --> 01:05:01.960 align:middle line:90%
He is priceless, yeah.

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And I also find that people
become obsessed with him.

01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:10.850 align:middle line:84%
They become infatuated with
him, and it transcends money.

01:05:10.850 --> 01:05:12.790 align:middle line:90%
So he's where he deserves to be.

01:05:12.790 --> 01:05:15.910 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather see him
in a museum where

01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:18.970 align:middle line:84%
he's cared for,
where also visitors

01:05:18.970 --> 01:05:22.420 align:middle line:84%
from all over the world can
come and see him and have

01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:25.720 align:middle line:84%
their own experience than
to have him locked away

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:27.650 align:middle line:84%
in the prize collection
of some billionaire.

01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does he have a
pet with him, a pet dog?

01:05:29.650 --> 01:05:31.590 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: He's got a lion.

01:05:31.590 --> 01:05:34.390 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's a little
stuffed lion.

01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's always
been with him?

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Yeah.

01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, the little boy
that the doll was made for,

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:45.370 align:middle line:90%
he loved to go to the zoo.

01:05:45.370 --> 01:05:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And his favorite
animal was a lion.

01:05:50.410 --> 01:05:57.148 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, and so when that doll
was being modified for him,

01:05:57.148 --> 01:05:58.690 align:middle line:10%
they put a little
stuffed lion there.

01:05:58.690 --> 01:06:00.700 align:middle line:10%
And then he used to wear
a little sailor outfit.

01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:05.940 align:middle line:10%
So basically, Robert the doll is
kind of like a big voodoo doll.

01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:11.025 align:middle line:84%
He's a big representation
of the kid.

01:06:11.025 --> 01:06:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Josh, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:14.317 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Thank you, George.

01:06:14.317 --> 01:06:17.150 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: He brings us
incredible stories of anomalies,

01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:20.650 align:middle line:10%
of ghosts, of hauntings,
of special tones.

01:06:20.650 --> 01:06:23.650 align:middle line:10%
I can't wait to try out
my sigil and find out

01:06:23.650 --> 01:06:25.600 align:middle line:10%
what's going to happen with me.

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:28.540 align:middle line:84%
I'll let you know on a
future "Beyond Belief" show

01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:29.890 align:middle line:90%
if the luck changes.

01:06:29.890 --> 01:06:32.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and
thanks for watching.

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:38.571 align:middle line:90%
