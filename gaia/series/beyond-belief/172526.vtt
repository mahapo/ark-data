[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:19.982 --> 00:00:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:22.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.360 align:middle line:10%
And what a program we
have in store for you.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.300 align:middle line:10%
A special person who I
have admired for years,

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.584 align:middle line:10%
his name's Billy Carson.

00:00:29.584 --> 00:00:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And Billy, of
course, has appeared

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.409 align:middle line:90%
on other Gaia programs.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:35.380 align:middle line:84%
You've seen him before talking
about some incredible things

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.130 align:middle line:84%
about ancient civilizations,
ancient technology, and things

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.190 align:middle line:90%
that have been going on.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.630 align:middle line:90%
Billy, welcome to the program.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:42.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY CARSON:
Thanks for having me.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad to be back.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And your new
book, which is just out,

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.630 align:middle line:90%
is called what?

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Compendium
of The Emerald Tablets.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.563 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fantastic.

00:00:48.563 --> 00:00:50.392 align:middle line:84%
Now, how did you research
things like this?

00:00:50.392 --> 00:00:51.850 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: Well,
you know, I started

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.500 align:middle line:10%
looking into the
Sumerian tablets

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.770 align:middle line:10%
when I started looking at
some of the images from Mars

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.830 align:middle line:10%
and other planets
in our solar system

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.880 align:middle line:10%
by NASA and the
European Space Agency.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And I started thinking,
these look like remnants

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.314 align:middle line:90%
of an ancient civilization.

00:01:05.314 --> 00:01:06.730 align:middle line:84%
So when I started
going on Google,

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.000 align:middle line:84%
I started noticing that there
were tablets out there that

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.424 align:middle line:84%
talked about these types
of ancient civilizations.

00:01:12.424 --> 00:01:13.840 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of
how I really got

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.270 align:middle line:84%
into learning about
Zecharia Sitchin and some

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.940 align:middle line:84%
of the other ancient books
that had been written

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.369 align:middle line:90%
about these ancient tablets.

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.910 align:middle line:84%
So then I went
directly to the source

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.326 align:middle line:84%
and started looking
at the tablets

00:01:23.326 --> 00:01:24.590 align:middle line:90%
myself to see what they said.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.920 align:middle line:84%
I wanted my own
understanding of them.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As you were looking
at these, let's say online,

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.280 align:middle line:84%
did it just pop
right out at you?

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Well, no.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.190 align:middle line:10%
Thankfully to the UCLA,
they have an online library

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.560 align:middle line:10%
called the UCLA cdli
cuneiform library.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.360 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.190 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: And it allows you
to take stone tablets off

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.390 align:middle line:10%
the virtual shelf and drop
them into a translator--

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.190 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.230 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: And read
them for yourself.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.563 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Technology at its best.

00:01:47.563 --> 00:01:48.580 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: Absolutely.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would civilizations
be in shock today knowing

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.260 align:middle line:84%
everything you know
about past civilizations?

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I think there would
be an initial shock factor.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.270 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that because
we're very resilient people

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.180 align:middle line:84%
I believe that people would
initially be in shock and then

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.090 align:middle line:84%
eventually come into
understanding that this

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.090 align:middle line:90%
is what really happened.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.589 align:middle line:84%
Especially if they
can really grasp,

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:10.630 align:middle line:84%
understand it, and verify
a lot of information

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.300 align:middle line:84%
for themselves, which is why
I try to put a lot of content

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.700 align:middle line:84%
out there so that I can create
more researchers of people

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.860 align:middle line:84%
looking into this on their
own so they can come up

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.790 align:middle line:90%
with their own conclusions.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And then they begin to feel
more comfortable about the truth

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.120 align:middle line:90%
about the ancient past.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.953 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Billy,
what have you concluded?

00:02:23.953 --> 00:02:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Have you concluded that
past civilizations were just

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.420 align:middle line:90%
very high in technology?

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.060 align:middle line:84%
Maybe were much older
than people think?

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.780 align:middle line:84%
Or that we had visitations
from extraterrestrials

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.550 align:middle line:84%
and they kind of
contributed to us?

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.758 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I think it's a
combination of both, George.

00:02:38.758 --> 00:02:41.620 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we did
have some visitations

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.520 align:middle line:90%
in the ancient past--

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking with
deep antiquity that

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.300 align:middle line:84%
did genetically modified
some of the existing

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.010 align:middle line:90%
hominids on this planet.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.720 align:middle line:84%
But I also even believe
that further back

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.310 align:middle line:84%
before that initial visitation
by the Anunnaki beings,

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.520 align:middle line:84%
that we may have already
risen to a higher

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.840 align:middle line:84%
level of civilization with
prior people on this planet that

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.290 align:middle line:84%
could be our initial progenitors
or our cousins, so to speak.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And then those civilizations
have risen and fallen.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.600 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like what the
Mayans talk about that

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.180 align:middle line:84%
there have been four worlds
and we're living in the fifth.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Each civilization according
to some of the Indian Vedas

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.800 align:middle line:84%
seems to rise and then
reach a certain level,

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.189 align:middle line:90%
and then fall again.

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think the Anunnaki
came during a time

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.250 align:middle line:84%
where we had already
fallen and it kind of

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.310 align:middle line:84%
re-kickstarted our civilization
by genetically modifying us

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.382 align:middle line:84%
and also adding some additional
technology to this planet.

00:03:27.382 --> 00:03:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Billy,
recently scientists

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.550 align:middle line:84%
have just discovered a 10,000
year-old series of sketches

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.600 align:middle line:84%
and etchings on rock
in India, which depict

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.780 align:middle line:90%
UFOs and extraterrestrials.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.850 align:middle line:84%
You can tell them,
as looking at these

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.660 align:middle line:84%
like alien greys with the
big heads and the big guys

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.660 align:middle line:84%
and little saucers in the
background-- flying saucers.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Who would make that up 10,000
years ago unless they actually

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.620 align:middle line:90%
saw it?

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: You know, that's
a good point you bring up.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.350 align:middle line:84%
I think people
need to understand

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.766 align:middle line:84%
that in those ancient times
when people were just starting

00:03:58.766 --> 00:04:01.540 align:middle line:84%
to do writing and art,
they didn't have time

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.090 align:middle line:90%
to do things for fun.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.040 align:middle line:84%
Back then everything
was micromanaged.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.730 align:middle line:90%
Everything had a purpose.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And even the cuneiform
tablets, they're

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.780 align:middle line:90%
writing on these tablets.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.099 align:middle line:84%
Everything was done with a
specific purpose and intent.

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think that people
were just sitting around going,

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.399 align:middle line:84%
let me draw some of
these funny shaped UFOs

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:18.274 align:middle line:90%
and some gray aliens.

00:04:18.274 --> 00:04:21.279 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they really
drew what they seen

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:22.450 align:middle line:90%
and what they've learned.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe that when you
see these ancient depictions

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.700 align:middle line:84%
of craft and aliens and
so forth, like there's

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.770 align:middle line:84%
one in Australia
also, this partially

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.280 align:middle line:84%
uncovered Egyptian temple
in Kariong, Australia that

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.320 align:middle line:84%
has a mother ship UFO with
little tiny UFOs coming out

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.120 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Truly amazing.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And it's an incredible
thing all in hieroglyphs.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.781 align:middle line:84%
And I mean when you
see these things,

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:43.750 align:middle line:84%
you have to say to
yourself, why would somebody

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.060 align:middle line:84%
take the time to make
this up in ancient times?

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.730 align:middle line:84%
I think back then
everything was so crucial--

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:49.900 align:middle line:90%
just surviving was crucial.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.510 align:middle line:84%
To make things like this
up didn't seem realistic.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.600 align:middle line:84%
I think they really
drew what they saw.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Billy, what
is the Enuma Elish?

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: The Enuma
Elish are seven tablets

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.890 align:middle line:84%
of cuneiform writing that
date back over 7,000 years.

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And they're located
at the British Museum.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.180 align:middle line:84%
These cuneiform
tablets actually talk

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.860 align:middle line:84%
about the creation
of our solar system

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.620 align:middle line:84%
as we know it right now,
including how Earth was created

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.900 align:middle line:90%
and how we acquired our moon.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.430 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing story.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.931 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of is
hard to understand

00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:21.763 align:middle line:84%
for the average person
who starts reading it

00:05:21.763 --> 00:05:23.500 align:middle line:84%
because it almost
sounds like it's

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.154 align:middle line:90%
people battling in the sky.

00:05:25.154 --> 00:05:27.320 align:middle line:84%
But when you really break
it down and understand it,

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.911 align:middle line:84%
it's the epic of the creation
of our solar system itself.

00:05:29.911 --> 00:05:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:31.900 align:middle line:90%
It's almost biblical, isn't it?

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:32.983 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes, absolutely.

00:05:32.983 --> 00:05:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And matter of fact, the Bible
copied a lot of the content

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.175 align:middle line:84%
from the Enuma
Elish into Genesis.

00:05:37.175 --> 00:05:38.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At the
British Museum, there's

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.900 align:middle line:90%
a fellow called Irving Finkel.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And he talks a
little about this.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.529 align:middle line:90%


00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:47.320 align:middle line:10%
>>IRVING FINKEL: Because
the Cyrus Cylinder

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.690 align:middle line:10%
that was meant for a
Babylonian audience,

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.375 align:middle line:10%
it was written in the
Babylonian language, which

00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:58.100 align:middle line:10%
is a Semitic tongue related to
the modern languages of Hebrew,

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.605 align:middle line:10%
and Arabic, and Aramaic.

00:06:00.605 --> 00:06:04.310 align:middle line:10%
The writing system, which
Cyrus officials used,

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.980 align:middle line:10%
was the traditional
cuneiform script,

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.060 align:middle line:10%
which had been invented
in ancient Iraq

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.710 align:middle line:10%
well before 3,000 BC.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.490 align:middle line:10%
It is written by pressing
a stylus, something a bit

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.050 align:middle line:10%
like a chopstick, into the
surface of the clay, which

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.860 align:middle line:10%
is nearly dry.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.160 align:middle line:10%
And the signs, which convey
the sound of the language,

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.190 align:middle line:10%
consist of different
arrangements of these strokes.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.970 align:middle line:10%
They're written one by one.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.550 align:middle line:10%
And the reader has
to join them up,

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.290 align:middle line:10%
and the sound emerges
from the clay.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.187 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Billy, how in the
world do they interpret that?

00:06:37.187 --> 00:06:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: It's so amazing.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It really is.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:40.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: You know,
the thing that's

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.750 align:middle line:84%
so beautiful about
it is at the time,

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.020 align:middle line:84%
many people were copying
this Sumerian language

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.880 align:middle line:90%
over into their own languages.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.600 align:middle line:84%
So we had kind of a key to
understand what this Sumerian

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.840 align:middle line:90%
text was saying.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.389 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, the Sumerians almost
seem to have branched out

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:56.930 align:middle line:84%
and kickstarted so
many civilizations

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.340 align:middle line:90%
outside of themselves.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, everybody
translating from the Sumerian

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.760 align:middle line:84%
into their own
languages gave us a key

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.820 align:middle line:84%
to understand what those
cuneiform texts were saying.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.850 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Has the late
Zecharia Sitchin, who wrote--

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.010 align:middle line:10%
his book's called
the 12th Planet--

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.680 align:middle line:10%
has he investigated those?

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Absolutely,
he has investigated

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.927 align:middle line:84%
the Seven Tablets of
Creation and the Enuma Elish.

00:07:20.927 --> 00:07:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And he has written about
them and added them

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.304 align:middle line:84%
into his books almost
virtually word for word.

00:07:25.304 --> 00:07:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad you
bring up Sitchin,

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.550 align:middle line:84%
because so many people
have tried to put him down

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:29.540 align:middle line:90%
at the end of his career.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:29.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: But in my
personal opinion,

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.413 align:middle line:84%
he was one of the
greatest researchers

00:07:32.413 --> 00:07:33.830 align:middle line:90%
in the history of this planet.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And his work, to me,
was second to none.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.220 align:middle line:84%
Now that I've looked into other
authors that have translated

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.010 align:middle line:84%
these texts, and I myself
have now gone and translated

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.020 align:middle line:84%
these text, especially
the Enuma Elish,

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.080 align:middle line:84%
I come to the understanding
that all of the stories

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.630 align:middle line:84%
are fundamentally the same with
a couple of different things

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:51.600 align:middle line:90%
here and there.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.141 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
is that conclusion?

00:07:53.141 --> 00:07:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what you think
happened many years ago?

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: The conclusion that
I personally have come to

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.650 align:middle line:84%
is that there were
advanced beings that

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.830 align:middle line:84%
are our progenitors that came
to this planet in ancient times

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.130 align:middle line:84%
to strip mine this
planet for resources.

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:09.770 align:middle line:84%
But not only Earth, the moon,
Mars, and a couple of the moons

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.870 align:middle line:90%
of Jupiter as well.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And they came to
get these resources.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And during that time
frame, they lived here

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:20.420 align:middle line:84%
and mined this planet themselves
for about 250,000 years.

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And then at one point,
the working class

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.756 align:middle line:84%
became very agitated
from the workload

00:08:24.756 --> 00:08:27.380 align:middle line:84%
and decided that they were going
to revolt against the leaders,

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.060 align:middle line:90%
which were Enki and Enlil.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And at that time,
a decision was made

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.409 align:middle line:84%
to create a slave
worker, which would

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:36.900 align:middle line:84%
be what we are homo sapien
from an existing hominid.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.169 align:middle line:84%
They didn't literally create
a human being from dust,

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:39.539 align:middle line:90%
but they took--

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something was
already on the planet?

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:42.906 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Something was
already on the planet.

00:08:42.906 --> 00:08:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And they took that
something, that hominid,

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:48.990 align:middle line:84%
and they took an egg
out of one, cleaned up

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:52.250 align:middle line:84%
the genetic material, put
the Anunnaki genetic material

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:55.610 align:middle line:84%
inside of it, embedded into
the womb of one of the Anunnaki

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:56.450 align:middle line:90%
women.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And she took it to full term
and gave birth 10 months

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.324 align:middle line:84%
later to the Adamu,
or the first man.

00:09:02.324 --> 00:09:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds
like Adam and Eve.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:04.855 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Absolutely.

00:09:04.855 --> 00:09:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So a lot of this
correlates with the Bible

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:07.970 align:middle line:90%
as well, doesn't it?

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:08.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: It does.

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:10.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, literally the
Bible and the Torah

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:15.080 align:middle line:84%
almost took a lot of these
verses out of the Sumerian

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.790 align:middle line:90%
tablets almost word for word.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:18.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's go back to Sitchin's
work a little bit, if we can,

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:23.570 align:middle line:90%
Billy.

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:24.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Sure.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And tell us
about the Anunnaki.

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:30.860 align:middle line:84%
That is the name given
to a race of beings

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.120 align:middle line:90%
from another planet, right?

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.789 align:middle line:90%
Nibiru was the planet they call?

00:09:33.789 --> 00:09:35.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yes, Nibiru
was the planet.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:36.830 align:middle line:84%
Now depending on
who was translating

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:38.957 align:middle line:84%
or who have looked
at the tablets,

00:09:38.957 --> 00:09:40.040 align:middle line:90%
they could be from Sirius.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.820 align:middle line:84%
There could be no
more from Sirius.

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.210 align:middle line:84%
They could be from this
planet called the Nibiru.

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Some people think they
may be from the Orion.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.310 align:middle line:84%
However, either way you
look at it everybody

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.740 align:middle line:84%
comes to the same
conclusion that beings--

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.180 align:middle line:90%
that we look like them--

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.730 align:middle line:90%
came here to this planet.

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.667 align:middle line:84%
And Sitchin came up with
the same conclusion.

00:09:57.667 --> 00:09:59.750 align:middle line:10%
Primarily, I think he came
up with that conclusion

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:01.791 align:middle line:10%
from these tablets because
these tablets actually

00:10:01.791 --> 00:10:05.120 align:middle line:10%
mention Nibiru,
they mention Marduk,

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.570 align:middle line:10%
they mention who
was the of Enki,

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:12.050 align:middle line:10%
and who basically is now
the current ruler supposedly

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:15.020 align:middle line:10%
of this realm until the
next age of Aquarius

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.820 align:middle line:10%
really comes in in 2025.

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.214 align:middle line:84%
And it also mentions Enlil
and many other people.

00:10:19.214 --> 00:10:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And it talks about the
planet of the crossing.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.480 align:middle line:84%
It talks about genetic
manipulation of the existing

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:24.810 align:middle line:90%
harmony on this planet.

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:26.960 align:middle line:84%
It talks about all of that
in these seven tablets.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.700 align:middle line:84%
So his story is
fundamentally based

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.116 align:middle line:84%
on something that had already
been established and written

00:10:31.116 --> 00:10:32.180 align:middle line:90%
about since the 1800s.

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.274 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't something
that he made up.

00:10:34.274 --> 00:10:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, this
person that you

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:39.340 align:middle line:84%
have mentioned several
times, Enki, who was he?

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.170 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: Enki was a son of Anu.

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:44.792 align:middle line:10%
Anu was the main king
or the main leaders--

00:10:44.792 --> 00:10:45.750 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Who came here?

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Who came here.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.810 align:middle line:84%
He came here a little bit
after his sons arrived.

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:49.980 align:middle line:90%
They call him the Heroes of O.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The sons
got here first?

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:51.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.040 align:middle line:90%
Enki and Enlil.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.380 align:middle line:84%
Now Enki, his actually
name is Ea Enki.

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.990 align:middle line:84%
So Ea, the first two letters
Ea, and Ki was Earth.

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:02.370 align:middle line:84%
So he became the King of
Earth even though his brother

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:03.580 align:middle line:90%
and Enlil ran everything.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:04.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:06.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: He had a
higher rank than Enlil,

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.893 align:middle line:84%
but something happened,
which it's not clear

00:11:07.893 --> 00:11:11.520 align:middle line:84%
exactly how it happened, but
his brother Enlil superseded him

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:15.120 align:middle line:84%
at some point and gained
complete control of the planet,

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.280 align:middle line:84%
even though the planet
was named after Ea Enki.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.654 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
had the ability

00:11:18.654 --> 00:11:21.320 align:middle line:84%
to breathe our atmosphere,
our air, and everything else?

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Absolutely.

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:25.300 align:middle line:84%
They come from a planet that's
most likely very similar makeup

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.100 align:middle line:90%
to Earth.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:26.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:28.140 align:middle line:90%
So we could live on that planet?

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: We could live
on that planet, exactly.

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:31.736 align:middle line:84%
And first I thought that
might have been outlandish,

00:11:31.736 --> 00:11:33.770 align:middle line:84%
until I started
researching Mercury,

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:36.270 align:middle line:84%
which is a planet in our solar
system very close to the sun.

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.520 align:middle line:84%
But now that I've discovered
that Mercury rotates very

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.670 align:middle line:84%
slow in its axis, contains
billions of tons of water,

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:46.410 align:middle line:84%
and also has biological
material on it.

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And this comes from the
Mercury Messenger Mission

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:50.980 align:middle line:90%
that just came back last year.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.370 align:middle line:84%
So now you look at
the gases at Mercury

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:55.880 align:middle line:84%
and you start to realize it's
got more oxygen than Earth.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:56.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And it's got all
of the gases needed for us

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.130 align:middle line:90%
to actually breathe on Mercury.

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:00.540 align:middle line:84%
So imagine if we
could land on Mercury.

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.760 align:middle line:84%
We could probably pop our
cap and take a deep breath.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If it just wasn't
so close to the sun, right?

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:05.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Exactly.

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.036 align:middle line:84%
Well, the thing about
it is because it's

00:12:07.036 --> 00:12:09.720 align:middle line:84%
rotating so slow on
its axis, it actually

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.360 align:middle line:84%
has a lot of areas
closer to the polls

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.710 align:middle line:84%
that are very habitable
now NASA says.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.994 align:middle line:84%
And so now they're
planning missions there,

00:12:16.994 --> 00:12:18.660 align:middle line:84%
because there's areas
where like I said,

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.570 align:middle line:84%
billions of tons of organic
material and ice water,

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:24.470 align:middle line:84%
and even some liquid water
on the planet's surface.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:28.470 align:middle line:84%
It's located in a region
where it's sustainable.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:29.620 align:middle line:90%
So it's very interesting.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.953 align:middle line:84%
So when I saw that I said, you
know what, it's possible now

00:12:31.953 --> 00:12:34.452 align:middle line:84%
on my mind for another being
to come here from a planet that

00:12:34.452 --> 00:12:35.910 align:middle line:90%
could have very similar gases.

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:38.192 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they have a little
bit more krypton and carbon,

00:12:38.192 --> 00:12:40.650 align:middle line:84%
or maybe they have a little
bit more oxygen or less oxygen.

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:43.930 align:middle line:84%
But overall, they were able
to sustain and breathe here.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we already
have the instruments here

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.730 align:middle line:84%
on this planet to decipher
what kind of elements

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:55.080 align:middle line:84%
are on other planets
a long, long way away.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And we're able to say that
they may have this atmosphere,

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:00.210 align:middle line:84%
they may have this,
they might have water.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:04.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure the Anunnaki had
more sophisticated equipment.

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.140 align:middle line:84%
They were able to pinpoint
planet Earth immediately

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.180 align:middle line:84%
and say this planet
has everything we

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.765 align:middle line:90%
need to do what we need to do.

00:13:10.765 --> 00:13:11.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Absolutely.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.650 align:middle line:84%
They called them the
Tablets of Destiny.

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And on this tablet
of destiny, they

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:17.710 align:middle line:90%
called them crystal screens.

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, kind of like in my mind
I think like an iPad in a way.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:21.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: But on the screen,
the first person, Anu,

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:28.086 align:middle line:84%
who scanned the Earth saw based
on the light, the information

00:13:28.086 --> 00:13:29.460 align:middle line:84%
from the light of
the planet, you

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.209 align:middle line:84%
can get information
like the spectrometer.

00:13:31.209 --> 00:13:33.630 align:middle line:84%
You can get the oxygen levels,
everything you just said.

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:35.755 align:middle line:84%
You can get what's in the
atmosphere and everything

00:13:35.755 --> 00:13:37.230 align:middle line:90%
else-- the temperatures.

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And also, they found
the gold as well

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:40.980 align:middle line:90%
before they even arrived here.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:44.280 align:middle line:84%
So you're right, the
technology will allow somebody

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.300 align:middle line:90%
to scan a planet.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And now we can scan planets
30, 40, 50 million light years

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.754 align:middle line:84%
away and analyze the light
coming from that planet

00:13:50.754 --> 00:13:52.920 align:middle line:84%
and break it down to tell
you exactly what chemicals

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.090 align:middle line:90%
exist there.

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:58.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does any of this
negate Genesis or the Bible?

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.120 align:middle line:90%
Or does it augment it?

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It
actually augments it.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.970 align:middle line:90%
It gives it a much bigger view.

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:06.990 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the Bible,
the Koran, the Torah,

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:10.010 align:middle line:84%
all of these books, they mention
Marduk and all these people

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:10.810 align:middle line:90%
believe or not.

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:14.580 align:middle line:84%
However, in a very short
small version of the story.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.080 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
Epic of Gilgamesh

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.496 align:middle line:84%
and the Seven
Tablets Of Creation,

00:14:17.496 --> 00:14:18.780 align:middle line:90%
you get the big story.

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:22.230 align:middle line:84%
You get a much bigger
epic versus the Bible.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:25.170 align:middle line:84%
The Bible taking small parts
of it-- somebody-- over time

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:27.362 align:middle line:84%
many, many hundreds of
years after the people

00:14:27.362 --> 00:14:29.070 align:middle line:84%
that you're talking
about, sometimes even

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:31.412 align:middle line:84%
thousands of years are
already gone and passed away.

00:14:31.412 --> 00:14:33.120 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people
confuse the Bible

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.730 align:middle line:84%
with being written in
real-time as events happen.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.880 align:middle line:84%
But in true reality, the Bible
was written hundreds of years

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.530 align:middle line:90%
after events happened.

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:42.690 align:middle line:84%
So you're looking at
something that's basically

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:45.510 align:middle line:84%
just copied information
from much more ancient texts

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.936 align:middle line:84%
and slightly modified with over
8,000 bad translations just

00:14:48.936 --> 00:14:50.560 align:middle line:84%
in the modern King
James version alone.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it does
not negate the existence

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:54.570 align:middle line:90%
of a god, does it?

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It doesn't negate
the existence of a god.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.390 align:middle line:84%
I think people get
that confused a lot.

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:59.730 align:middle line:84%
They think if we talk about
Anunnaki and beings come here

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:01.771 align:middle line:84%
and everything else that
you're trying to say god

00:15:01.771 --> 00:15:02.640 align:middle line:90%
doesn't exist.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.530 align:middle line:84%
I personally believe that
God does exist in my opinion,

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:06.960 align:middle line:90%
just because of quantum physics.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.675 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Because
quantum physics

00:15:08.675 --> 00:15:11.340 align:middle line:84%
proves that there is a
creator of this realm.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.030 align:middle line:84%
Everything has a
specific design,

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.190 align:middle line:84%
and mathematically,
you can calculate it.

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:16.200 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that
there is a creator.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.610 align:middle line:84%
But what happens
is in the Bible,

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:20.151 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that the people
talking in the Bible that are

00:15:20.151 --> 00:15:21.630 align:middle line:90%
saying that they are god is--

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:24.046 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that's the
creator of the universe itself.

00:15:24.046 --> 00:15:27.510 align:middle line:84%
I think those are Anunnaki or
advanced beings masquerading

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:28.604 align:middle line:90%
as a god.

00:15:28.604 --> 00:15:31.020 align:middle line:84%
But they're not the actual
creator of the universe itself.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And of course,
the origins of the universe

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:37.530 align:middle line:84%
is a topic that really comes
up for a lot of discussion.

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's
something that I even

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.730 align:middle line:84%
bat my head against the
wall trying to figure out

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:42.880 align:middle line:90%
how did this happen.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's check in on scientist
Neil Degrasse Tyson

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:46.852 align:middle line:90%
to get his take on that.

00:15:46.852 --> 00:15:49.060 align:middle line:10%
>>NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: One
of the reasons we're here,

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:52.580 align:middle line:10%
that we exist at all, is that
Earth, cosmically speaking,

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.990 align:middle line:10%
is in a relatively peaceful
place orbiting our Sun

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:58.400 align:middle line:10%
in a near perfect circle.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.080 align:middle line:10%
Our cosmic neighborhood
has granted

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:04.490 align:middle line:10%
life billions of years to
evolve, mostly undisturbed.

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:08.490 align:middle line:10%
But where did this stable
piece of real estate come from?

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.540 align:middle line:10%
We know that stars and
planets once upon a time all

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:15.080 align:middle line:10%
started out like this,
with enormous clouds of gas

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.370 align:middle line:10%
and dust.

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:20.000 align:middle line:10%
How we got from here to
here, we haven't exactly

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.110 align:middle line:10%
figured out yet.

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:24.470 align:middle line:10%
But lately, we found some
intriguing new evidence that

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:26.990 align:middle line:10%
tells us our
peaceful solar system

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:30.410 align:middle line:10%
may have started
with a violent event.

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But that
still doesn't explain

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.580 align:middle line:84%
the origins of the
universe-- how something

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:37.070 align:middle line:90%
could form from nothing.

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:38.640 align:middle line:90%
I don't get it.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:39.560 align:middle line:90%
Help me.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It's really
an incredible thing.

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:44.480 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the history
of the universe itself,

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.730 align:middle line:84%
and you get the Big Bang,
the most popular theory

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:48.650 align:middle line:84%
that's out there,
what I've discovered

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:50.840 align:middle line:84%
in my personal research
is that the universe

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.710 align:middle line:90%
may be holographic by nature.

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:55.330 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we may be living
in an ancestor simulation.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:56.130 align:middle line:90%
Meaning that--

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:57.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Created by?

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Creating by an
ancestor civilization.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:01.310 align:middle line:90%
Another civilization above us.

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And there may be many
layers to reality.

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:05.569 align:middle line:84%
We may be one of
trillions, or maybe even

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:07.659 align:middle line:84%
an infinite number
of simulations.

00:17:07.659 --> 00:17:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And we ourselves
have already started

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.910 align:middle line:90%
making these simulations.

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:12.859 align:middle line:84%
And what people
tend to think when

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:15.035 align:middle line:84%
they hear the term
holographic universe is that,

00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:16.910 align:middle line:84%
oh, you're trying to
say that we're not real.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:17.951 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't mean that.

00:17:17.951 --> 00:17:19.430 align:middle line:84%
It means that we're
real, but we're

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:21.464 align:middle line:84%
living in a fully
immersed light matrix.

00:17:21.464 --> 00:17:23.089 align:middle line:84%
It's already been
scientifically proven

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:25.464 align:middle line:84%
that everything in this entire
universe is made of light.

00:17:25.464 --> 00:17:28.220 align:middle line:84%
Even the light you can't see,
dark matter, dark energy,

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.330 align:middle line:90%
even that's light.

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:30.500 align:middle line:90%
Everything is light.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.001 align:middle line:90%
Atoms are mostly empty space.

00:17:32.001 --> 00:17:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're
basically starting

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.060 align:middle line:84%
to find out now
scientifically is

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:38.450 align:middle line:84%
that everything that we
consider to be solidity

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:39.497 align:middle line:90%
is actually an illusion.

00:17:39.497 --> 00:17:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Everything that we think
is matter is an illusion.

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.871 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that truly
exists in the third dimension

00:17:43.871 --> 00:17:44.840 align:middle line:90%
is consciousness.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:45.980 align:middle line:90%
That's the only real thing.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And that might even be
broadcasted here from a source,

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:50.750 align:middle line:90%
from a singularity somewhere.

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And consciousness has kind
of like divided itself

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:55.500 align:middle line:84%
into trillions of
entities so that it

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.100 align:middle line:84%
can experience that third
dimension subjectively.

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:01.040 align:middle line:84%
But overall, the actual
creator of this realm,

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.530 align:middle line:84%
which quantum physics
proves there is a creator,

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:05.540 align:middle line:84%
because of the mathematics
behind everything--

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.480 align:middle line:84%
the Fibonacci sequence
pi, phi, all of that--

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.080 align:middle line:84%
we start to look and think we
may be living in a simulation.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.727 align:middle line:84%
And to add more
credence to that,

00:18:13.727 --> 00:18:15.310 align:middle line:84%
when you look at the
video game called

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:18.870 align:middle line:84%
the Sims, which we have created,
there's people in there.

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:19.670 align:middle line:90%
They have families.

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:20.470 align:middle line:90%
They have lives.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:21.560 align:middle line:90%
They have jobs they go to.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.357 align:middle line:84%
They have dogs and pets and
vacations, and everything else.

00:18:24.357 --> 00:18:26.690 align:middle line:84%
And now scientists are saying
that within the next eight

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:29.960 align:middle line:84%
to 10 years the Sims
may be conscious because

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.030 align:middle line:90%
of this technology.

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:34.790 align:middle line:84%
So now if they're conscious,
we have now ourselves created

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:36.200 align:middle line:90%
our own simulated universe.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could somebody quickly
wipe us out, merely erase us

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:43.370 align:middle line:90%
by hitting a key on a board.

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:44.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: It's very possible.

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:46.010 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that could be
one of the reasons

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:47.930 align:middle line:84%
why we always seem to reach a
certain level and start over.

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:48.862 align:middle line:90%
I mean, who knows.

00:18:48.862 --> 00:18:50.195 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's very hard to say.

00:18:50.195 --> 00:18:50.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.343 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It's very,
very hard to say.

00:18:52.343 --> 00:18:56.390 align:middle line:10%
But I know that James Gates Jr.
at the University of Maryland

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:59.870 align:middle line:10%
is a quantum physicist and
also a theoretical physicist.

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:02.681 align:middle line:10%
He discovered that the
fabric of space-time itself--

00:19:02.681 --> 00:19:05.180 align:middle line:10%
he was actually interviewed by
Neil Tyson Degrasse in a show

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:06.401 align:middle line:10%
one time.

00:19:06.401 --> 00:19:08.150 align:middle line:84%
I think it was actually
a live stage show.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:09.394 align:middle line:90%
They were doing a talk.

00:19:09.394 --> 00:19:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And he actually stated
this on the stage

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:14.540 align:middle line:84%
that the fabric of space-time
itself runs off of something

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:16.010 align:middle line:90%
called these adinkra codes.

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And these adinkra codes
are the same exact codes

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.745 align:middle line:84%
that run search engine
browsers in web sites.

00:19:20.745 --> 00:19:21.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: So the
fabric of space time

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:28.066 align:middle line:84%
is a code that we are already
using now to create programs

00:19:28.066 --> 00:19:28.940 align:middle line:90%
on a computer screen.

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is
baffling to be sure

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.840 align:middle line:84%
that the existence you,
the existence of me

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:40.010 align:middle line:84%
might be predicated on some
other civilization that

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:41.170 align:middle line:90%
has created it.

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:44.180 align:middle line:90%
You know, simply created it.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.170 align:middle line:90%
I can't get it yet.

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:47.720 align:middle line:84%
I just don't understand
the Big Bang Theory.

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.180 align:middle line:84%
How something would
start from nothing.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.160 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we'll get those
answers one day.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Maybe one day.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not easy.

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:57.900 align:middle line:84%
Going back to the Anunnaki,
Billy, and what they wanted,

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.160 align:middle line:84%
they came here, as you
said, to mine gold.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:00.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Zecharia
Sitchin has always

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.870 align:middle line:84%
said they needed to
sprinkle gold particles

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:08.750 align:middle line:84%
in their atmosphere
almost to shield

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.860 align:middle line:90%
their planet from the sun.

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.960 align:middle line:90%
They're in our solar system.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.460 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, you know, gold
is a very, very technological

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:19.260 align:middle line:90%
item or element.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think that a lot of people
who are into gold and gold

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.340 align:middle line:84%
jewelry and everything else,
they don't realize that they've

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:28.790 align:middle line:84%
been fooled into thinking gold
has a value for decoration

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:31.010 align:middle line:90%
and monetary means.

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Actually what happened was in
ancient times gold was mined

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:39.170 align:middle line:84%
by the Anunnaki before humans
even got involved to create

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:41.084 align:middle line:84%
this substance,
this powdered dust

00:20:41.084 --> 00:20:43.250 align:middle line:84%
that they can actually hoist
into their atmosphere--

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:43.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Powdered gold.

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:44.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Powdered gold.

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And to add credence to that, my
vehicle that I actually drive

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.420 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have any window tint.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:51.920 align:middle line:90%
It's a higher end car.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And the glass in my vehicle has
powdered gold in the windows

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:58.774 align:middle line:84%
to reflect UV light to keep
the interior of the car cool.

00:20:58.774 --> 00:21:01.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't that what the
astronauts used as a shield--

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Absolutely.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When they
went to the moon?

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:04.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you see, gold
is very technological.

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And you need it for radiation
hardened computer circuit

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:09.800 align:middle line:90%
boards.

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:13.130 align:middle line:90%
You need it for satellites.

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:16.107 align:middle line:84%
The thing about gold is you
get no loss of electricity

00:21:16.107 --> 00:21:17.565 align:middle line:84%
no matter how long
the distance is.

00:21:17.565 --> 00:21:20.180 align:middle line:84%
It's a great
electrical conductor.

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:21.247 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Conductor.

00:21:21.247 --> 00:21:23.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And you don't
lose anything in friction.

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:23.960 align:middle line:90%
And you can meld it.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:24.793 align:middle line:90%
It's very malleable.

00:21:24.793 --> 00:21:26.835 align:middle line:84%
You can mold it to
almost any shape.

00:21:26.835 --> 00:21:28.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very, very
interesting thing.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And because much later
when they had the revolt

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:33.230 align:middle line:84%
and decided that they
wanted to have slaves help

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:37.550 align:middle line:84%
them do this work, which now
Michael Tellinger has broadcast

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:40.160 align:middle line:84%
on one of the shows on
Gaia's hidden origins

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.990 align:middle line:84%
they show that they
discovered the location

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:45.170 align:middle line:84%
of the very first goldmines that
humans worked at Enlil's house

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:46.270 align:middle line:90%
on the hill.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:48.395 align:middle line:84%
And it's still there
over 100,000 years ago.

00:21:48.395 --> 00:21:49.520 align:middle line:90%
It's still there right now.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How deep
are these mines?

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:52.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: They go pretty deep.

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And they've brought out of these
mines different things going

00:21:56.210 --> 00:22:00.060 align:middle line:84%
down many layers little
discoveries of pottery

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:00.860 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:03.329 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wonder how much
gold they extracted from our--

00:22:03.329 --> 00:22:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Probably a lot.

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:05.800 align:middle line:90%
And there's so much more.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.360 align:middle line:84%
There's so much gold and
oil on this planet it almost

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.400 align:middle line:84%
makes you start to think
that the planet itself

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.210 align:middle line:90%
is producing it.

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:12.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, I believe that.

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:15.980 align:middle line:84%
With oil, the abiotic oil
theory, that this planet

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.100 align:middle line:84%
is creating it
when it was formed.

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:18.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Exactly.

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we'll
ever reach peak oil.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.500 align:middle line:90%
I think that's an illusion.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.360 align:middle line:84%
I believe the oil is the
blood of the Earth itself.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:23.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree.

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And gold may very
well be another element that's

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:27.230 align:middle line:84%
being created by
the Earth itself

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:29.240 align:middle line:84%
as well, because it almost seems
like with the amount of gold

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.910 align:middle line:84%
that was taken out of
this Earth already,

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:32.201 align:middle line:90%
and there's still so much more.

00:22:32.201 --> 00:22:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Where is all this
gold coming from?

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:34.535 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:22:34.535 --> 00:22:36.826 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we ever going
to really get these answers?

00:22:36.826 --> 00:22:38.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've got
researchers like you,

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.780 align:middle line:84%
the late Zecharia Sitchin,
Michael Tellinger,

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:44.930 align:middle line:84%
and Jason Martel, and people
who have investigated this.

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:47.060 align:middle line:84%
But is mainstream
science, Billy,

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:50.060 align:middle line:84%
ever going to come up and
say exactly what you've just

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:51.085 align:middle line:90%
told us today?

00:22:51.085 --> 00:22:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It won't happen
until we get to the point

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:56.120 align:middle line:84%
where there's a real
revolution of consciousness

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:56.921 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:22:56.921 --> 00:22:59.253 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that, when
there's enough people that

00:22:59.253 --> 00:23:01.820 align:middle line:84%
have finally woken up that
want to do enough research

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:02.930 align:middle line:90%
and enough digging.

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:05.542 align:middle line:84%
And it may be 100 years, maybe
200, maybe 300 years from now,

00:23:05.542 --> 00:23:07.250 align:middle line:84%
but there's going to
come a point in time

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:08.480 align:middle line:90%
where enough people--

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.979 align:middle line:84%
in other words,
even the people that

00:23:09.979 --> 00:23:12.590 align:middle line:84%
are working in these science
universities and so forth,

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:13.280 align:middle line:90%
they're going to be conscious.

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to say it's
time to put the information out

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:15.290 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:17.000 align:middle line:84%
It's time to tell
the people the truth.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.766 align:middle line:84%
And maybe at some point
long in the future

00:23:18.766 --> 00:23:20.390 align:middle line:84%
we'll get enough
information for people

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:23.880 align:middle line:84%
to realize that there was a
very, very incredible past

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.170 align:middle line:90%
on human history.

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I am fascinated
by our own solar system

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:29.870 align:middle line:90%
and the planetary systems.

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:31.190 align:middle line:90%
How Earth was formed.

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:33.170 align:middle line:90%
How the moon was formed.

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:36.110 align:middle line:84%
These objects that are
in our solar system

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:37.970 align:middle line:90%
are truly remarkable.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:40.520 align:middle line:84%
What do you think happened
to form all of this?

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, according
to the Enuma Elish,

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:45.380 align:middle line:84%
there's this huge
battle between the gods.

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And the gods in the Enuma Elish
in the beginning of the epic

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:51.320 align:middle line:84%
are actually planetary
bodies and spatial bodies--

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.179 align:middle line:90%
even asteroids and moons.

00:23:53.179 --> 00:23:55.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of esoteric
the way that they stand.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have to understand
the parables behind it.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:58.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Exactly.

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And one of the planets in
this epic is called Nibiru.

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:04.130 align:middle line:84%
This is where the name
actually comes from.

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
that 10th planet?

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:06.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Exactly.

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:08.353 align:middle line:84%
And it comes through
the solar system.

00:24:08.353 --> 00:24:10.310 align:middle line:84%
But there's another
planet in our solar system

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:12.950 align:middle line:84%
that's about four to six
times the size of Earth,

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:14.840 align:middle line:90%
and it's actually called Tiamat.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's just outside
of the orbit of Mars.

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:23.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that what collided
with Earth a long time ago?

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: OK, here's
what happened, Nibiru,

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:27.990 align:middle line:84%
or later in the epic,
a more recent version,

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:29.840 align:middle line:84%
they called it Marduk, because
Marduk wanted to be the one

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:30.640 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:31.724 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Marduk is Nibiru?

00:24:31.724 --> 00:24:33.223 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Exactly,
Marduk is Nibiru.

00:24:33.223 --> 00:24:34.210 align:middle line:90%
He also wanted credit.

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:35.866 align:middle line:84%
When he ruled, he
wanted credit for it.

00:24:35.866 --> 00:24:37.490 align:middle line:84%
So he changed it in
the newer version--

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:39.031 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They had
egos then too, huh?

00:24:39.031 --> 00:24:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: They had big egos.

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:42.430 align:middle line:90%
He changed Nibiru to Marduk.

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:46.960 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, he crashed into
Tiamat and split Tiamat apart.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.560 align:middle line:84%
A huge chunk of that, along with
the water and organic material,

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.560 align:middle line:84%
swept into the location we
are now and became Earth.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.570 align:middle line:84%
Gravitationally,
we pulled Kingu,

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:57.759 align:middle line:84%
which is one of the
moons of Tiamat with us.

00:24:57.759 --> 00:24:59.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is our moon now?

00:24:59.050 --> 00:24:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Which is our moon now.

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:01.146 align:middle line:90%
So we pulled the moon along.

00:25:01.146 --> 00:25:03.310 align:middle line:84%
But the moon was never
a result of impact

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:04.794 align:middle line:90%
with Earth from another object.

00:25:04.794 --> 00:25:06.460 align:middle line:84%
The moon is a result
that it was already

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.280 align:middle line:84%
there with another
planet named Tiamat.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.555 align:middle line:84%
The rest of Tiamat crumbled
up into huge chunks

00:25:11.555 --> 00:25:12.930 align:middle line:84%
and became the
hammered bracelet,

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:15.346 align:middle line:84%
which was talked about in the
Bible, the Sumerian Tablets.

00:25:15.346 --> 00:25:17.285 align:middle line:84%
And also we know it
as the asteroid belt.

00:25:17.285 --> 00:25:18.660 align:middle line:84%
So that became
the asteroid belt.

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:20.930 align:middle line:84%
The asteroid belt is
actually an exploded planet.

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:21.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I believe that.

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And now Mars, according
to some of the other study

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:26.830 align:middle line:84%
and research, could
have been a moon

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:28.660 align:middle line:84%
of this Tiamat,
which then gained

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.760 align:middle line:90%
its own orbit around the sun.

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.020 align:middle line:84%
Which could explain why it
has a very strange orbit.

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:37.600 align:middle line:84%
At certain points its 140
million miles away from Earth.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And its other points
when it's in perigee,

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:40.955 align:middle line:90%
its only 40 million miles away.

00:25:40.955 --> 00:25:42.830 align:middle line:84%
It's got a very strange
orbit around our sun.

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:44.770 align:middle line:84%
But it almost looks like it
was thrown into that orbit

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:46.062 align:middle line:90%
after the explosion of Tiamat.

00:25:46.062 --> 00:25:47.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are a
lot of strange moons

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:48.940 align:middle line:90%
around some of the planets.

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:51.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, Europa for
example, around Jupiter.

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:55.200 align:middle line:84%
There's another one called
Iapetus around Saturn.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.210 align:middle line:10%
And Mike Bara, when he appeared
on one of the Gaia programs

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:01.836 align:middle line:10%
Deep Space, talked about that.

00:26:01.836 --> 00:26:06.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Researchers point out that
a very odd moon orbits Saturn.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:09.707 align:middle line:10%
Some believe this moon could
be an artificial planet.

00:26:09.707 --> 00:26:11.290 align:middle line:10%
>>MIKE BARA: Iapetus
is very different

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:13.460 align:middle line:10%
because unlike most of
the moons of Saturn,

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:15.340 align:middle line:10%
which are in kind
of a ecliptic plane,

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.260 align:middle line:10%
it's off at about
a 60 degree angle.

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:20.080 align:middle line:10%
When pictures of the
horizon came back

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.060 align:middle line:10%
that were showing the
surface of Iapetus,

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:25.630 align:middle line:10%
not only was there
this bizarre rim

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:28.000 align:middle line:10%
around the middle of
the object-- there

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.540 align:middle line:10%
was this edge, edge,
edge, straight line,

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:33.160 align:middle line:10%
straight line, straight line.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:37.660 align:middle line:10%
It was not a rounded
spherical horizon.

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:40.104 align:middle line:10%
And actually if you
do the calculations

00:26:40.104 --> 00:26:42.520 align:middle line:10%
and you see how long these
straight lines are and put them

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.250 align:middle line:10%
together, it comes out
in the shape of something

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:47.530 align:middle line:10%
called a dodecahedron.

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:50.241 align:middle line:10%
Iapetus appears to be
an artificial satellite.

00:26:50.241 --> 00:26:52.240 align:middle line:10%
It could very well have
been the base from which

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.370 align:middle line:10%
the progenitors-- call
them the preservers--

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:56.250 align:middle line:10%
call them whatever you
want to call them--

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:57.050 align:middle line:10%
operate.

00:26:57.050 --> 00:26:59.170 align:middle line:10%
They actually operated
on this moon of Saturn

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:01.090 align:middle line:10%
and did different things
to different planets

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:03.095 align:middle line:10%
in the solar system.

00:27:03.095 --> 00:27:05.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right Billy,
I'll give it to Mike Bara

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.980 align:middle line:90%
that it's a very unusual moon.

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.780 align:middle line:90%
But an artificial moon?

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:11.080 align:middle line:90%
Is that a stretch?

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.705 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I don't
think it's a stretch.

00:27:12.705 --> 00:27:14.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean from my
understanding, the Anunnaki's

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.275 align:middle line:84%
seemed to be about at least
one million years ahead of us.

00:27:17.275 --> 00:27:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And I base that on
the fact that they--

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:19.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
nothing in time.

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: It's nothing.

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:22.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a blink of an eye
in geological time span.

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:24.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, literally
a blink of an eye.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And they came here
450,000 years ago to mine

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:29.100 align:middle line:84%
this planet for resources, and
also other planets and moons

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.950 align:middle line:84%
in our solar system for
resources, especially

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:34.050 align:middle line:84%
Mars, which is one
of the reasons that

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:36.720 align:middle line:84%
caused a revolt because of the
labor they were doing on Mars.

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.780 align:middle line:84%
But they had the
technology back then.

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And even in the
Enuma Elish, it talks

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.127 align:middle line:84%
about them coming here with
technology and with the ships

00:27:45.127 --> 00:27:45.960 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.780 align:middle line:84%
So I really believe
that the ability

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:52.410 align:middle line:84%
to create an artificial moon
was not beyond their reach.

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:55.437 align:middle line:84%
And that they were part of
the Atlantean civilization.

00:27:55.437 --> 00:27:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why I think that
is because the Emerald Tablets

00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:58.980 align:middle line:90%
of Thoth--

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Thoth is actually
the son of Enki,

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:02.940 align:middle line:90%
and Enki is the son of Anu.

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:04.950 align:middle line:84%
So this is all of
Anunnaki-based.

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:06.840 align:middle line:84%
He calls himself the
sons of Atlantis.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.180 align:middle line:84%
Or him and his crew,
the sons of Atlantis.

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:12.300 align:middle line:84%
His tablets were written by
him over 36,000 years ago.

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And in those tablets, he claimed
to have built the Great Pyramid

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:18.070 align:middle line:84%
with all the magic science
or advanced technology in it

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:19.231 align:middle line:90%
in the Emerald Tablet.

00:28:19.231 --> 00:28:20.730 align:middle line:84%
But the reason why
this is important

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:23.670 align:middle line:84%
is because in the opening
scene of the Emerald Tablet,

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:25.260 align:middle line:90%
he flies from one location.

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:27.840 align:middle line:84%
His dad tells him to take
the crew to another location,

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.760 align:middle line:84%
the land of Kim, which is
ancient Egypt, land there.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:31.560 align:middle line:90%
He lands.

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.630 align:middle line:84%
When he opens the
doors to his ship,

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:37.110 align:middle line:84%
the people come running at him
with hammers and everything

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:38.044 align:middle line:90%
to beat him up.

00:28:38.044 --> 00:28:39.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Humans of the time?

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:40.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Humans of the time.

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:41.490 align:middle line:90%
This is after the Great Flood.

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:43.198 align:middle line:84%
Because he mentions
that the Great Flood,

00:28:43.198 --> 00:28:44.775 align:middle line:90%
the waters had just subsided.

00:28:44.775 --> 00:28:46.650 align:middle line:84%
He raises his staff and
he sends out an array

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:48.840 align:middle line:84%
of vibration freezing these
humans in their tracks.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.630 align:middle line:84%
So here we have a ship
that takes off, flies over

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:52.890 align:middle line:90%
to a location, lands.

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:55.480 align:middle line:84%
They open a door and
he picks up this staff

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:59.230 align:middle line:84%
and he jolts the people with
some type of electronic ray

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:01.410 align:middle line:84%
36,000 years ago
where he also talks

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:03.930 align:middle line:84%
about building the Great
Pyramid and building the Sphinx.

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:07.380 align:middle line:84%
So you see the technology
that we're talking here

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:08.994 align:middle line:90%
is phenomenal for back then.

00:29:08.994 --> 00:29:11.160 align:middle line:84%
So you can only imagine
what they had the capability

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.142 align:middle line:90%
of doing in ancient times.

00:29:13.142 --> 00:29:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, but
who would have created

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:17.430 align:middle line:90%
a false moon like Iapetus?

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:18.822 align:middle line:90%
How would that have happened?

00:29:18.822 --> 00:29:21.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, you're
talking about an object that's

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:22.560 align:middle line:90%
being built in space.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.487 align:middle line:84%
So it actually makes
it very easy to do.

00:29:24.487 --> 00:29:26.070 align:middle line:84%
All you need to have
is the technology

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:28.150 align:middle line:90%
to sustain yourself in space.

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:30.130 align:middle line:84%
You need to have the
architectural know

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:30.930 align:middle line:90%
how to do it.

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's huge.

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:32.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: It's huge.

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.010 align:middle line:90%
It's massive.

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:34.968 align:middle line:84%
But these Anunnaki, when
you look on the Earth,

00:29:34.968 --> 00:29:36.930 align:middle line:84%
look at the stones
at Baalbek, look

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:40.150 align:middle line:84%
at a lot of the megalithic
structures around this planet.

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:43.680 align:middle line:84%
We have super massive stone
structures on this planet

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:46.390 align:middle line:84%
that we still can't figure
out how they were done today.

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:48.060 align:middle line:84%
So it only makes
sense to me that they

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:50.650 align:middle line:84%
would be able to build
megalithic structures in space,

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:52.120 align:middle line:90%
especially with zero gravity.

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's the ridge
around Iapetus that

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:55.920 align:middle line:90%
has a lot of people baffled.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.003 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, it's about
a three mile high ridge

00:29:58.003 --> 00:30:01.680 align:middle line:84%
around the equator of Iapetus,
which, OK, it's perfect there.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean it looks like a seam
where a top and a bottom

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:04.670 align:middle line:90%
were put together.

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:07.045 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were put together,
I was just going to say that.

00:30:07.045 --> 00:30:09.480 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a little top
or something that you spin.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:09.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Exactly.

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.881 align:middle line:84%
So you start to think,
where did George Lucas get

00:30:11.881 --> 00:30:13.770 align:middle line:90%
the idea for the Death Star?

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:15.210 align:middle line:90%
Was it Iapetus?

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:18.960 align:middle line:84%
Because it really seems like
it's very similar to Iapetus.

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might it
be a spaceship?

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It could
be a spaceship.

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:22.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A city?

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:24.538 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I mean, when
you want to travel

00:30:24.538 --> 00:30:26.100 align:middle line:84%
around the solar
system or maybe even

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:28.710 align:middle line:84%
between different solar
systems, maybe you

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:32.970 align:middle line:84%
create a massive kind of
a planetary spaceship that

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:34.882 align:middle line:84%
allows you to have
everything you

00:30:34.882 --> 00:30:36.840 align:middle line:84%
need to sustain the lives
of millions of people

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:37.860 align:middle line:90%
while you travel.

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:39.235 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Billy,
I've had a number

00:30:39.235 --> 00:30:42.390 align:middle line:84%
of guests on Beyond Belief
and also on the radio program

00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:44.730 align:middle line:84%
Coast-to-Coast AM
that have talked

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:47.430 align:middle line:84%
about this extra
planet in the universe

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:49.500 align:middle line:84%
in the solar system
called Planet

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:55.990 align:middle line:84%
X. If it's a planet, if it's
out there, call it Nibiru,

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:59.440 align:middle line:84%
why haven't astronomers
told us about it?

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: They actually have.

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:04.342 align:middle line:84%
Just recently on Fox News
an astronomer came on there

00:31:04.342 --> 00:31:06.550 align:middle line:84%
and he described not only
that they've discovered it,

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:07.900 align:middle line:90%
but they've named it.

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:09.340 align:middle line:90%
NASA calls it Planet Nine.

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:11.950 align:middle line:84%
This astronomer says
they've called it Biden.

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:13.370 align:middle line:90%
They've nicknamed it Biden.

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:14.726 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: After Joe Biden?

00:31:14.726 --> 00:31:15.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Which is bizarre.

00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he funded some of
the research, I don't know?

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:17.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:18.100 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: It's very possible.

00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:23.650 align:middle line:84%
But they even showed it on the
little blip on the little show

00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:24.880 align:middle line:90%
that they put up.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And they said it's extremely
far beyond the orbit of Pluto,

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:31.180 align:middle line:90%
but it's orbiting its own star.

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.274 align:middle line:84%
It's got a brown dwarf
star that it orbits.

00:31:33.274 --> 00:31:34.440 align:middle line:90%
So we're talking about our--

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In our solar system?

00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:37.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: In our solar system,
there's another solar system.

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:39.700 align:middle line:84%
He actually says
it openly on TV.

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So we live in a
binary solar system.

00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And according to
this astronomer,

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:46.030 align:middle line:84%
it orbits our sun
to be 4,200 years.

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's got its own little
planetary solar system

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.510 align:middle line:90%
going around it.

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:51.426 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's where
the Anunnaki are, right?

00:31:51.426 --> 00:31:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, the astronomer
said, which blew me away,

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.170 align:middle line:90%
that's where we came from.

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:57.400 align:middle line:90%
I almost had to play it back.

00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Matter of fact, I looped
it on my video channel,

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:01.900 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted to hear
it over and over again.

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.460 align:middle line:84%
He said we're looking
at where we came from.

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So this planet,
will call it Nibiru,

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:09.370 align:middle line:90%
inhabited with the Anunnaki.

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:12.556 align:middle line:84%
Are they still there in your
opinion, on that planet?

00:32:12.556 --> 00:32:13.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: That's
a good question.

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:18.100 align:middle line:84%
They may have already left and
expanded and spread out more.

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:20.050 align:middle line:84%
They were already in
my opinion a species

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:22.780 align:middle line:84%
that had already spread out
from maybe the Pleiades.

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why I get
that is because a lot

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:25.360 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient
artifacts that I've

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.693 align:middle line:84%
looked at now going around
the world to different places

00:32:27.693 --> 00:32:29.560 align:middle line:84%
and seeing some of the
artifacts in museums,

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:33.190 align:middle line:84%
they usually depict the Pleiades
star cluster, and the Orion,

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:34.302 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes Sirius.

00:32:34.302 --> 00:32:36.010 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really starting
to think that they

00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:38.500 align:middle line:90%
are an intergalactic species.

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And even in one of the epics,
one of the Anunnaki gods

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:44.020 align:middle line:84%
takes on Orion from
another planet.

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:46.824 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, this is some real
Star Wars type stuff here.

00:32:46.824 --> 00:32:47.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It really is.

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I really think
that they're everywhere, man.

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:52.015 align:middle line:84%
I believe they may still be
living in our solar system.

00:32:52.015 --> 00:32:53.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Billy,
echoing what you've said,

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:57.640 align:middle line:84%
Corey Powell from Discover
Magazine kind of hints

00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.067 align:middle line:90%
about these same things.

00:33:00.067 --> 00:33:01.150 align:middle line:10%
>> Two images to show you.

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:03.450 align:middle line:10%
This is the arrow
obviously pointing to it.

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:04.950 align:middle line:10%
But there are
three dots on here.

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:06.090 align:middle line:10%
One is red.

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:07.230 align:middle line:10%
One is green.

00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:08.700 align:middle line:10%
One is blue.

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:09.500 align:middle line:10%
Quite significant.

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.750 align:middle line:10%
>>COREY POWELL: So this is
the actual discovery image.

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:14.820 align:middle line:10%
Basically, two
astronomers were looking

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:17.370 align:middle line:10%
at one little patch of sky
very, very far away looking

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:19.280 align:middle line:10%
for exactly this kind of thing.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.640 align:middle line:10%
Stars don't move.

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.870 align:middle line:10%
Planets or anything
that's like a planet does.

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:23.950 align:middle line:10%
So this is color coded.

00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:25.770 align:middle line:10%
This is what they saw
on different nights.

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:27.311 align:middle line:10%
They're looking for
one thing moving.

00:33:27.311 --> 00:33:30.240 align:middle line:10%
And they color coded it to
show that all these stars are

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.170 align:middle line:10%
staying still.

00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:32.100 align:middle line:10%
This thing is moving.

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:33.280 align:middle line:10%
And the way it's moving--

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.527 align:middle line:10%
>> So this is just one.

00:33:34.527 --> 00:33:36.360 align:middle line:10%
>>COREY POWELL: It's
one object color coded.

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:37.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Is Pluto on this?

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:38.880 align:middle line:10%
>>COREY POWELL: Pluto's
in a whole different part

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:39.680 align:middle line:10%
of the sky.

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.920 align:middle line:10%
>> So this is way out there?

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:41.840 align:middle line:10%
>>COREY POWELL: This
is way out there.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.350 align:middle line:10%
This is more than twice
as far away as Pluto.

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:44.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Unbelievable.

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:46.390 align:middle line:10%
Why does this matter, Corey?

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:48.990 align:middle line:10%
>>COREY POWELL: Well, there are
two ways you can look at it.

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:53.760 align:middle line:10%
I look at it first of all,
as an exploration question.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.720 align:middle line:10%
We know where we are on Earth.

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.420 align:middle line:10%
We've mapped our planet.

00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:59.770 align:middle line:10%
Our solar system is
still terra incognito.

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:01.292 align:middle line:10%
It's full of surprises.

00:34:01.292 --> 00:34:03.000 align:middle line:10%
This object is something
that astronomers

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.940 align:middle line:10%
said shouldn't even be there.

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:09.179 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Shouldn't even
be there, but it is.

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:10.480 align:middle line:90%
What does that tell you?

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It tells
you that we have a lot

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:12.977 align:middle line:90%
to learn about our solar system.

00:34:12.977 --> 00:34:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have a new area
of the solar system called

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:19.230 align:middle line:84%
the inner oort cloud where there
are all kinds of rogue planets

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:21.040 align:middle line:84%
and things out there
that shouldn't exist,

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.894 align:middle line:84%
that we didn't think
could possibly exist.

00:34:22.894 --> 00:34:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it is
so important for people

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:25.230 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:25.880 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
are saying, is it

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.713 align:middle line:84%
going to come back and
crash into our Earth?

00:34:27.713 --> 00:34:29.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
this object is

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:30.770 align:middle line:90%
going to crash into the Earth.

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:34.464 align:middle line:84%
But what I think is happening
is it's dislodging debris

00:34:34.464 --> 00:34:35.880 align:middle line:84%
from the oort cloud
and sending it

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.610 align:middle line:84%
streaming toward the inner
solar system, which is probably

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:41.969 align:middle line:84%
why Obama signed the executive
order a few years ago to have

00:34:41.969 --> 00:34:45.000 align:middle line:84%
a mission to a comet to try to
learn how to shift its orbit.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.635 align:middle line:84%
Because we have to
learn how to avert,

00:34:46.635 --> 00:34:48.760 align:middle line:84%
of course, annihilation
from some of these objects.

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:50.635 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
them out there and a lot

00:34:50.635 --> 00:34:52.699 align:middle line:90%
coming toward the inner orbits.

00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:55.199 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Billy, let's take the
religious aspects out of this

00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:56.460 align:middle line:90%
totally for a moment.

00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:57.870 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
a lot of people

00:34:57.870 --> 00:35:02.370 align:middle line:84%
who think that we are it in
the universe based on religion.

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:04.140 align:middle line:90%
Let's take that out.

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it very logical to
assume that the elements that

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:13.680 align:middle line:84%
have created Earth,
and Mars, and our sun

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:16.920 align:middle line:84%
are the same throughout
the entire universe?

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And that the complexity of
life, which started here

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:24.897 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, probably started
on billions of other planets?

00:35:24.897 --> 00:35:25.980 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Without a doubt.

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:28.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you just look
at the Drake equation

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.600 align:middle line:84%
and you see that there's
potential for trillions

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:36.030 align:middle line:84%
and trillions of civilizations
out there in our universe.

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Everything that we consider
to be matter or real

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:43.110 align:middle line:84%
originates about 13.5 billion
years ago from something

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:45.630 align:middle line:84%
the size of a small green
pea as Gregg Braden famously

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:46.750 align:middle line:90%
said one time.

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And in that case, we're all part
of that same original source

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.630 align:middle line:90%
material.

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And all of the elements
that make me, you,

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:55.710 align:middle line:84%
this chair, the
studio, everything else

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:57.130 align:middle line:90%
are all part of that same thing.

00:35:57.130 --> 00:36:00.090 align:middle line:84%
So the odds that we're
the only people here

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:01.200 align:middle line:90%
are almost second to none.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.491 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there's probably
trillions and trillions

00:36:03.491 --> 00:36:06.060 align:middle line:84%
of entities out there
in our universe all

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:08.250 align:middle line:90%
made up from the same material.

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, why do they say
that this extra planet, Planet

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:15.250 align:middle line:84%
X, that comes around every
3,600 years based on Sitchin's

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:18.660 align:middle line:84%
theories plays a
havoc with the planet,

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:21.330 align:middle line:84%
may have contributed
to the Great Flood,

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:24.760 align:middle line:84%
may have contributed to other
disasters on this planet.

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:25.860 align:middle line:90%
Why did they say that?

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Because
similar to Mars,

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:29.205 align:middle line:84%
where Mars has a very
strange orbit where it orbits

00:36:29.205 --> 00:36:31.710 align:middle line:84%
closer to the sun and then
further away at times,

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:33.420 align:middle line:84%
this object kind of
does the same thing.

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:36.731 align:middle line:84%
As it comes towards to orbit our
sun, it comes in pretty close

00:36:36.731 --> 00:36:37.980 align:middle line:90%
and creates a breakaway speed.

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:40.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, not close enough
to interact directly

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:42.560 align:middle line:84%
with our inner
solar system planets

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.810 align:middle line:84%
where it's going to crash
into anything-- not anymore,

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:45.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe.

00:36:45.610 --> 00:36:49.170 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that because of
the gravity of the brown dwarf

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:54.240 align:middle line:84%
star that it orbits, it has
a direct effect on creating

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Earthquakes, different
type of storm patterns,

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.530 align:middle line:90%
melting our ice caps.

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's where a
lot of the global warming

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:02.610 align:middle line:84%
in our entire solar
system is coming from.

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:04.560 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't
realize Earth is not

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:07.350 align:middle line:84%
the only planet experiencing
global warming right now.

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:10.680 align:middle line:84%
All of the moons and planets in
our solar system, even Pluto,

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:12.036 align:middle line:90%
is experiencing global warming.

00:37:12.036 --> 00:37:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Where is that
warmth coming from?

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:13.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Gravitational
waves coming

00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:16.560 align:middle line:84%
in passing over
the solar system.

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:18.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't have
power plants and cars

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:19.286 align:middle line:90%
over there, that's for sure.

00:37:19.286 --> 00:37:20.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah,
I don't think so.

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:21.980 align:middle line:90%
So it's the gravity.

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:23.714 align:middle line:84%
It's the gravitational
waves potentially

00:37:23.714 --> 00:37:25.380 align:middle line:84%
from this object
that's out there that's

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:28.480 align:middle line:84%
super massive passing
over our solar system.

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And these waves, as it
gets a little bit closer,

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:31.950 align:middle line:90%
they get stronger.

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:34.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, these waves are waves
of energy and frequency.

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to create
warmth and heat and friction.

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And that friction is
going to in turn create

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.240 align:middle line:84%
stronger storms, hurricanes,
tornadoes, Earthquakes,

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.230 align:middle line:90%
mudslides--

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:44.896 align:middle line:84%
all of these things
you're going to see.

00:37:44.896 --> 00:37:47.460 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, the core
of Saturn is almost melting.

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And one of the scientists came
on-- this is a few years ago--

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:52.750 align:middle line:84%
and said if that was Earth,
we'd be extinct already.

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'd be
cooked, literally.

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Lots of controversy
lately, Billy,

00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:58.410 align:middle line:84%
about other objects
that are being

00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:02.080 align:middle line:84%
discovered through our solar
system coming from our galaxy,

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:02.880 align:middle line:90%
perhaps.

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.810 align:middle line:90%
Who knows.

00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Weird shaped objects,
cigar-shaped,

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.000 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.560 align:middle line:90%
Are they natural?

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.991 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think there's
something strange here?

00:38:12.991 --> 00:38:14.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I think
that we're looking

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:17.010 align:middle line:84%
at a lot of remnants coming
through our solar system

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:20.610 align:middle line:90%
from an ancient galactic war.

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:21.410 align:middle line:90%
Even though--

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:21.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:22.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes, I really do.

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.910 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
ancient, ancient times,

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:26.400 align:middle line:84%
you discover the Enuma Elish
and you discover the creation.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.830 align:middle line:84%
But after that,
much later, there's

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:30.840 align:middle line:84%
a lot of remnants of
what I would consider

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:33.510 align:middle line:90%
a battle in our solar system.

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:36.600 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
the moons of Mars

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:39.180 align:middle line:84%
and you look and you see
how they look like they

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:41.159 align:middle line:90%
have weapons fire on them.

00:38:41.159 --> 00:38:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like they
were blasted away?

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Like they were
blasted away or shot out

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.537 align:middle line:84%
kind of like in a gun
pattern from somewhere.

00:38:46.537 --> 00:38:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From space.

00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:49.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: From space, exactly.

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:50.490 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
our moon and you

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:54.300 align:middle line:84%
look at the way it is
cratered, the craters

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:57.390 align:middle line:84%
don't seem to be just
from asteroid impacts.

00:38:57.390 --> 00:38:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Because typically you have a
trail when an asteroid hits

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:01.206 align:middle line:84%
and then you leave
a trail behind,

00:39:01.206 --> 00:39:03.000 align:middle line:84%
and those trails
kind of stay there.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.620 align:middle line:84%
These look like kind of blasts
on the surface of the moon

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:06.420 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:09.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't see a lot of ejecta
at the edge of the rim at some

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:11.880 align:middle line:84%
of these craters, which to me
either they can be artificial

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:14.229 align:middle line:84%
or they can be old
ancient blasts.

00:39:14.229 --> 00:39:16.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just very
strange what we have here.

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:18.569 align:middle line:84%
And then you also have
a lot of anomalies

00:39:18.569 --> 00:39:20.610 align:middle line:84%
on a lot of these planets,
which you can download

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:22.710 align:middle line:84%
these images from NASA and
the European Space Agency

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:24.459 align:middle line:84%
where you see these
anomalies on the moon,

00:39:24.459 --> 00:39:27.590 align:middle line:90%
on Mars, on Mercury, on Venus.

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And you start to say, wow, what
are these things doing here?

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:31.881 align:middle line:84%
And then when you look
at the ancient text,

00:39:31.881 --> 00:39:34.170 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden you start
to hear about these wars--

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:37.710 align:middle line:84%
these pyramid wars and
these wars between the gods.

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:40.329 align:middle line:84%
And now you go,
OK, maybe these are

00:39:40.329 --> 00:39:42.870 align:middle line:84%
remnants of an ancient war that
happened in our solar system.

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:44.453 align:middle line:84%
And maybe after all
the debris started

00:39:44.453 --> 00:39:46.470 align:middle line:84%
traveling around and
crashing into other planets

00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:48.360 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, maybe
a lot of people

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:51.000 align:middle line:84%
got out of here for a while
to let things calm back down.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, there is evidence
on this planet alone that there

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:56.005 align:middle line:84%
was an ancient
nuclear explosion--

00:39:56.005 --> 00:39:56.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Absolutely.

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of some type.

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was some kind of
asteroid that hit us, or what.

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:05.160 align:middle line:84%
But Robert Oppenheimer, the
founder of our atomic program,

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:08.920 align:middle line:84%
truly believes that they
had nuclear weapons then.

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:09.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes, yes.

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:11.870 align:middle line:84%
He made a famous quote
from the Mahabharata.

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:15.240 align:middle line:84%
It says now I am death,
destroyer of worlds.

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:18.060 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when they were doing
the nuclear test, Oppenheimer.

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:21.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that quote you
just gave us from Oppenheimer,

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:22.309 align:middle line:90%
we've got it for you.

00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:24.350 align:middle line:10%
>>ROBERT OPPENHEIMER: We
knew the world would not

00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:25.180 align:middle line:10%
be the same.

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:28.400 align:middle line:90%


00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:29.543 align:middle line:10%
Two people laughed.

00:40:29.543 --> 00:40:32.261 align:middle line:10%


00:40:32.261 --> 00:40:34.540 align:middle line:10%
Two people cried.

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:35.840 align:middle line:10%
Both people were silent.

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:39.520 align:middle line:90%


00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:43.550 align:middle line:10%
I remember the line from
the Hindu scripture,

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:51.880 align:middle line:10%
the Bhagavad Gita,
Vishnu was trying

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:57.050 align:middle line:10%
to persuade the prince
that he should do his duty,

00:40:57.050 --> 00:41:06.380 align:middle line:10%
and to impress him, takes on
his multi-armed form and says,

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:09.747 align:middle line:10%
now I am become Death,
the destroyer of worlds.

00:41:09.747 --> 00:41:12.669 align:middle line:10%


00:41:12.669 --> 00:41:15.244 align:middle line:10%
I suppose we all thought
that, one way or another.

00:41:15.244 --> 00:41:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: But the evidence
in the Indus Valley

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:19.710 align:middle line:84%
in the Mohenjo-daro where
the buildings are still

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:22.185 align:middle line:84%
there vitrified from the
blast and dead bodies

00:41:22.185 --> 00:41:24.360 align:middle line:84%
are still laying in the
street holding hands.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:27.090 align:middle line:84%
So you have the evidence
here of the nuclear blast.

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:31.416 align:middle line:84%
When I went to Egypt in May
of 2014, in the sands of Giza,

00:41:31.416 --> 00:41:32.790 align:middle line:84%
I was putting my
hand in the sand

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:34.530 align:middle line:84%
and just bringing
up all the dirt

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:39.135 align:middle line:84%
and picking up balls
of glass at Giza.

00:41:39.135 --> 00:41:40.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what can
turn sand into glass

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.100 align:middle line:90%
but a massive explosion.

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:42.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Exactly.

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:43.560 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And those balls of
glass is what they

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:47.340 align:middle line:84%
would create these
scare beetles out of

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:48.921 align:middle line:84%
and considered
them to be sacred.

00:41:48.921 --> 00:41:49.920 align:middle line:90%
What does that tell you?

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Again, people worshipping
creations of the god,

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.260 align:middle line:90%
of war of the gods.

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:57.010 align:middle line:84%
So the evidence
is all around us.

00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Billy, it's
truly remarkable what

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:02.310 align:middle line:84%
may have happened on this
planet a long time ago,

00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:06.540 align:middle line:84%
things that experts like
you try to explain to us.

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:09.030 align:middle line:84%
They don't explain
this in school.

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:12.560 align:middle line:84%
When I was in school,
they didn't get into this.

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:13.680 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:16.020 align:middle line:84%
To me, this would have kept
me on the edge of my chair

00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:18.810 align:middle line:84%
listening to a
professor or a teacher

00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:20.760 align:middle line:84%
talking about things
like that-- that there's

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:23.200 align:middle line:84%
another planet in
the solar system.

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:26.070 align:middle line:84%
It comes around
every 3,600 years.

00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:29.190 align:middle line:84%
It has calamities and
plays havoc with Earth.

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:30.871 align:middle line:84%
Why don't they
tell us about this?

00:42:30.871 --> 00:42:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I think the reason
why goes all the way back

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:35.910 align:middle line:84%
to the Tower of Babel incident,
which is in the Bible,

00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:38.700 align:middle line:84%
but also further back in
the Sumerian tablets, where

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:41.290 align:middle line:84%
the people came together
to build this tower.

00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:43.200 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, it was
probably a space port

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.450 align:middle line:84%
that they were trying to
build to mimic the Anunnaki,

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:47.325 align:middle line:84%
or maybe even build a
real space port if they

00:42:47.325 --> 00:42:50.120 align:middle line:84%
had had enough technology
to go into space.

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:52.650 align:middle line:84%
When Enki and Enlil came back
from wherever they were--

00:42:52.650 --> 00:42:54.317 align:middle line:90%
they had been away for a while--

00:42:54.317 --> 00:42:55.650 align:middle line:90%
they saw this tower being built.

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:58.584 align:middle line:84%
And Enlil was enraged
because he felt right away

00:42:58.584 --> 00:43:00.000 align:middle line:84%
that the people
were able to reach

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.416 align:middle line:84%
a higher level of civilization,
a high level of technology

00:43:02.416 --> 00:43:04.290 align:middle line:90%
and maybe even outdo them.

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:06.990 align:middle line:84%
So in his disgust, he
destroyed the Tower of Babel.

00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And as well, he then ordered
that mankind's lifespan

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:13.496 align:middle line:84%
be limited to 120 years, which
is ironic that that's exactly

00:43:13.496 --> 00:43:15.120 align:middle line:84%
the amount of lifespan
that we actually

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:18.090 align:middle line:84%
have built into our telomeres
and our chromosome number 2,

00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:20.340 align:middle line:84%
which Gregg Braden talks
about in Missing Links.

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was Sodom and
Gomorrah a nuke explosion?

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Sodom and Gomorrah was
most likely a nuclear explosion

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:29.520 align:middle line:84%
with a forewarning that
it was going to happen.

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:32.230 align:middle line:84%
So it's another one
that you look back at

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:36.210 align:middle line:84%
and the area is
completely decimated.

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was it they told,
was it the Lot told his wife

00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:41.450 align:middle line:90%
or something--

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:41.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Don't look back.

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:42.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Don't look back.

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: You turn
into a pillar of salt.

00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You turn
into a pillar of salt.

00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.080 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That sounds like
she was radiated, right?

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes, she was radiated.

00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:49.804 align:middle line:84%
And that's typically
what happens

00:43:49.804 --> 00:43:53.970 align:middle line:84%
when you look at some of the
old footage from nuclear blast,

00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:57.000 align:middle line:84%
and you discover what happens
to people that were there,

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.520 align:middle line:84%
they literally turn
into these piles of ash.

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:01.145 align:middle line:84%
So that's probably
the reference there,

00:44:01.145 --> 00:44:03.395 align:middle line:84%
you know, talking about
turning into a pillar of salt.

00:44:03.395 --> 00:44:05.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somewhere along the
line as we talk about all

00:44:05.790 --> 00:44:09.030 align:middle line:84%
of this, the Anunnaki coming
here looking at whatever

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:11.560 align:middle line:84%
species might have been on
the planet at the time--

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:13.500 align:middle line:90%
let's call it new Neanderthals--

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:15.150 align:middle line:84%
and they saw that
and said, no, we

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:18.390 align:middle line:84%
need workers who are going
to listen to us and brains.

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:21.520 align:middle line:84%
So we genetically alter
them and we do all that.

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And then in the Bible it
makes it seem like it was just

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:26.760 align:middle line:90%
a god that did it.

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.880 align:middle line:84%
Fallen angels, to me
being extraterrestrials,

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:32.660 align:middle line:84%
who came down here
and things like that.

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Let's tuck all that aside
for a second, Billy.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.560 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere along
the line somebody

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:39.240 align:middle line:90%
had to create the Anunnaki.

00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:40.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about this
theory of who is God?

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:45.390 align:middle line:90%
What started it all?

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:48.240 align:middle line:84%
You had to have
something happen first.

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:50.850 align:middle line:84%
That's what's so
amazing to me, somewhere

00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:54.220 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the line you have
got to have a real beginning.

00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that beginning?

00:44:56.490 --> 00:44:57.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: That's the
biggest question of them

00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:00.060 align:middle line:84%
all, because even if we live
in a holographic universe

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:02.226 align:middle line:84%
and we're living in a
simulation, which was created,

00:45:02.226 --> 00:45:03.780 align:middle line:84%
which would really
easily explain

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:07.210 align:middle line:84%
how you can have multiple types
of beings that just pop up

00:45:07.210 --> 00:45:10.080 align:middle line:84%
on the scene with
intelligence, I don't really

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:13.350 align:middle line:84%
believe in the standard
version of evolution.

00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:15.012 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there
is microevolution.

00:45:15.012 --> 00:45:17.220 align:middle line:84%
But macroevolution I think
is a little bit different.

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:18.200 align:middle line:90%
I think things are created.

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: But at the top of the
list, as you go up many levels,

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:23.139 align:middle line:90%
where does it all begin?

00:45:23.139 --> 00:45:24.680 align:middle line:84%
That is one of the
biggest questions.

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:27.480 align:middle line:84%
If we're living in an ancestral
civilization of an ancestor

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:31.230 align:middle line:84%
civilization, at some point
when do we get to base reality?

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And if we get to base reality,
well, how did that begin?

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:36.390 align:middle line:84%
The questions just
create more questions.

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:37.920 align:middle line:90%
It's very difficult to answer.

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.984 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will we
ever get that answer?

00:45:39.984 --> 00:45:42.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Maybe not while
we're living or inhabiting

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:43.140 align:middle line:90%
these avatar bodies.

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Maybe after we transcend this
dimension into a higher realm,

00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:48.450 align:middle line:84%
maybe then we'll have
a better understanding.

00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because every day, you
know, I look at video of people

00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:55.350 align:middle line:84%
in New York going to work
with their little briefcases

00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:58.530 align:middle line:84%
and their hustle and
bustle, getting on trains,

00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:00.240 align:middle line:90%
getting on buses.

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And for a moment, I
look at all this Billy

00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:05.140 align:middle line:84%
and I say, well,
what's the purpose?

00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:06.690 align:middle line:90%
What is this all about?

00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And then when you really
start to think about

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:13.310 align:middle line:84%
why are we here,
how did we get here,

00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:17.380 align:middle line:84%
where are we headed,
without answers,

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:20.664 align:middle line:84%
it's got to be one of the most
frustrating times for people.

00:46:20.664 --> 00:46:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It's very
frustrating, because we're

00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:26.690 align:middle line:84%
at the cusp of knowing
enough to get out of our rut

00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:28.970 align:middle line:84%
that we're in and take
control of this planet,

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:31.800 align:middle line:84%
but not enough that we can
get a complete understanding

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:32.600 align:middle line:90%
of everything.

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:36.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of frustrating
and exciting at the same time.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The more I think
about it, the more exciting

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:42.800 align:middle line:84%
it is that one day maybe
we'll get that answer.

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:44.840 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's just purely god.

00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:50.180 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this entity as my
mother says, always was,

00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:52.130 align:middle line:90%
always will be.

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that's the simple
answer to a question that we

00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:57.770 align:middle line:90%
cannot answer right now.

00:46:57.770 --> 00:46:59.460 align:middle line:84%
Does it get frustrating
for you too?

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: That's why I
keep digging and digging,

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:03.835 align:middle line:84%
and researching and reading,
and looking for information,

00:47:03.835 --> 00:47:05.900 align:middle line:84%
traveling the planet
and traveling the globe,

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:07.940 align:middle line:84%
just trying to get all
the pieces of the puzzle

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:10.430 align:middle line:84%
so I can put them together
so that I can help create

00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:12.440 align:middle line:84%
for myself a better
understanding of everything

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:15.570 align:middle line:84%
that's going on and what did
go on in the ancient past.

00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:17.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to be a
lifelong journey I can tell.

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:19.260 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
end anytime soon.

00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So let's go
back for just a second

00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:24.930 align:middle line:84%
as you see planet
evolved, life started

00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:28.460 align:middle line:84%
without any extraterrestrial
help at the time other

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:35.630 align:middle line:84%
than maybe panspermia, where
organisms came to this planet

00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:40.760 align:middle line:84%
somehow maybe on asteroids
or remnants of comets.

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And then life started
to evolve and develop

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:48.050 align:middle line:84%
as it has done on many, many
other planets in the same way.

00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Then you say there was another
group of extraterrestrials

00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:55.520 align:middle line:84%
in our solar system
called the Anunnaki that

00:47:55.520 --> 00:48:00.254 align:middle line:84%
decided we need a planet
that has resources, gold

00:48:00.254 --> 00:48:02.420 align:middle line:84%
to take care of our planet
because we're running out

00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:03.440 align:middle line:90%
of the stuff.

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Let's go there and
let's mine for it.

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And so they did
450,000 years ago.

00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:13.880 align:middle line:84%
But the people of
the Anunnaki race

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:16.542 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to do that
labor anymore, right?

00:48:16.542 --> 00:48:18.500 align:middle line:84%
You would think they'd
bring huge machines here

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:19.970 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:23.270 align:middle line:84%
But so they decided,
somebody had the bright idea,

00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:25.700 align:middle line:84%
let's alter these
creatures here that are

00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:27.380 align:middle line:90%
running around this planet.

00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:28.910 align:middle line:90%
Let's put them to work.

00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:30.036 align:middle line:90%
And that's how it happened?

00:48:30.036 --> 00:48:31.201 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah, pretty much.

00:48:31.201 --> 00:48:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And they did bring machines
to do a lot of the work.

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:35.951 align:middle line:84%
But when you get into some of
the mining and everything else,

00:48:35.951 --> 00:48:38.420 align:middle line:84%
they require human
hands and intelligence.

00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:40.670 align:middle line:84%
Or advanced being
hands and intelligence.

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
Anunnaki most likely

00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:45.770 align:middle line:84%
had come to a point in their
development technologically

00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:48.230 align:middle line:84%
where they realized that
artificial intelligence was

00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:49.430 align:middle line:90%
probably not the way to go.

00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:50.846 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
people say, well,

00:48:50.846 --> 00:48:53.240 align:middle line:84%
why didn't they just
make a race of robots?

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:56.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, once you add artificial
intelligence to robots

00:48:56.210 --> 00:48:58.940 align:middle line:84%
and you create a lot of them,
you're putting your own species

00:48:58.940 --> 00:48:59.740 align:middle line:90%
in jeopardy.

00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:00.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At risk.

00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Which is what they're
warning us right now.

00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Absolutely.

00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:05.890 align:middle line:90%
We're staring it in the face.

00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:07.280 align:middle line:90%
We cannot allow--

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:08.730 align:middle line:90%
I call it Skynet, it's real.

00:49:08.730 --> 00:49:09.590 align:middle line:90%
Skynet is active.

00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:10.850 align:middle line:90%
We got to take Skynet offline.

00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Because at some point,
these advanced AI robots

00:49:15.590 --> 00:49:17.330 align:middle line:84%
will realize that
they don't need us.

00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:19.756 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
we're in trouble.

00:49:19.756 --> 00:49:22.130 align:middle line:84%
So I think that the Anunnaki
decided let's take something

00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:26.030 align:middle line:84%
that we can control
biologically, we can program

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:29.840 align:middle line:84%
ourselves, but will never try
to supersede us, or at least not

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:32.152 align:middle line:84%
be able to based off of our
technology and knowledge.

00:49:32.152 --> 00:49:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And we'll suppress as much as
we can from them to keep them

00:49:34.610 --> 00:49:37.160 align:middle line:84%
down, which is what has
happened over many millennia.

00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:39.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Billy, look
into your crystal ball

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:42.710 align:middle line:84%
and what do you see the fate
of mankind in the next couple

00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:43.760 align:middle line:90%
hundred years?

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I'm a little bit
more optimistic for mankind

00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:49.107 align:middle line:90%
than some people.

00:49:49.107 --> 00:49:50.690 align:middle line:84%
We're going into the
Age of Aquarius--

00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:53.225 align:middle line:84%
officially of age of
Aquarius-- in 2025.

00:49:53.225 --> 00:49:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And I really do believe
in these cycles of time

00:49:55.960 --> 00:50:00.020 align:middle line:84%
that occur on this planet with
mankind in our advancement

00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:02.185 align:middle line:84%
not only in technology,
but also in consciousness.

00:50:02.185 --> 00:50:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And I truly do
believe that we're

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:06.710 align:middle line:84%
going to head back into
the golden age pretty soon.

00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, we're
going to really excel,

00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:13.359 align:middle line:84%
lifespans will be lengthened,
knowledge will be increased.

00:50:13.359 --> 00:50:14.900 align:middle line:84%
There will be a lot
of peace on Earth

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:16.441 align:middle line:84%
for many thousands
of years before it

00:50:16.441 --> 00:50:17.650 align:middle line:90%
starts to fall down again.

00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:20.150 align:middle line:84%
But I really do believe that
that cycle is a real cycle that

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:22.399 align:middle line:84%
has been logged and cataloged
by ancient civilizations

00:50:22.399 --> 00:50:23.750 align:middle line:90%
and it is going to come back.

00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:25.622 align:middle line:84%
And in a couple of
hundred years from now,

00:50:25.622 --> 00:50:27.830 align:middle line:84%
we'll probably just be
starting at the very beginning

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:29.210 align:middle line:90%
of that whole epic.

00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Physicist Stephen
Hawking and technology expert

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:36.650 align:middle line:84%
Elon Musk are always
warning us about having too

00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:38.660 align:middle line:90%
much artificial intelligence.

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:39.940 align:middle line:90%
Here's Elon Musk.

00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:42.560 align:middle line:10%
>> And a warning from
Tesla motors CEO Elon Musk.

00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:44.450 align:middle line:10%
It has nothing to do with cars.

00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:47.640 align:middle line:10%
Instead, Musk warns about
artificial intelligence,

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:51.770 align:middle line:10%
which he has called more
dangerous than nuclear weapons.

00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:54.950 align:middle line:10%
Musk spoke at a
symposium at MIT.

00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:56.825 align:middle line:10%
>>ELON MUSK And with
artificial intelligence,

00:50:56.825 --> 00:50:59.480 align:middle line:10%
we are summoning the demons.

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:01.104 align:middle line:10%
You know those
stories where there's

00:51:01.104 --> 00:51:03.020 align:middle line:10%
the guy with the pentagram
and the holy water.

00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:05.560 align:middle line:10%
And it's like, yeah, sure
he can control the demon.

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:07.482 align:middle line:10%
It didn't work out.

00:51:07.482 --> 00:51:12.888 align:middle line:10%
>> I take it there will be
no Hal 9000 going up to Mars?

00:51:12.888 --> 00:51:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ELON MUSK Hal
9000 would be easy.

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:18.340 align:middle line:10%
It's way more complex.

00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:22.490 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it would put
Hal 9000 to shame.

00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:23.577 align:middle line:90%
I like puppy dogs.

00:51:23.577 --> 00:51:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, he's
concerned that this

00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:27.790 align:middle line:90%
is done by demons, basically.

00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:30.890 align:middle line:84%
That too much artificial
intelligence is evil.

00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:31.764 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:51:31.764 --> 00:51:32.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: It sounds like it.

00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:35.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you really look
at some of the AI robots

00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:39.320 align:middle line:84%
that are now even on YouTube, as
they begin to talk and interact

00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:41.384 align:middle line:84%
with the crowd or
the camera man,

00:51:41.384 --> 00:51:42.800 align:middle line:84%
they literally
start saying things

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:45.650 align:middle line:84%
like I would like to blow up
the Earth with nuclear blast.

00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:49.005 align:middle line:84%
I would like to put
human beings in a zoo.

00:51:49.005 --> 00:51:50.130 align:middle line:90%
You know, things like this.

00:51:50.130 --> 00:51:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And you're going, wow, I
can't believe this robot just

00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:54.650 align:middle line:90%
said this on camera.

00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
its own thoughts.

00:51:56.330 --> 00:51:57.920 align:middle line:90%
So you project that out.

00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:59.780 align:middle line:84%
Let's say there's
an army of them

00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:01.980 align:middle line:84%
that are fully capable,
just like the ones at Boston

00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:02.780 align:middle line:90%
Dynamics.

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:04.970 align:middle line:84%
They are creating these
incredible robots that

00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:06.649 align:middle line:84%
can do back flips,
and jumps, and runs,

00:52:06.649 --> 00:52:08.690 align:middle line:84%
and run faster than a
human, and everything else.

00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:11.600 align:middle line:84%
You add AI to that with that
thought pattern or that thought

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:13.282 align:middle line:84%
process, all of a
sudden human beings

00:52:13.282 --> 00:52:14.490 align:middle line:90%
could be in a lot of trouble.

00:52:14.490 --> 00:52:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I like the little
robot puppies, Billy,

00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:18.710 align:middle line:84%
where you don't have to feed
them or pick up after them,

00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:19.880 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:20.300 align:middle line:90%
