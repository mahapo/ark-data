>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.750 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Linda Backman back
with us, a psychologist

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.560 align:middle line:10%
and regression therapist.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.810 align:middle line:10%
She's been in practice
for 45 years and in 1997

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.660 align:middle line:10%
founded the Mystery School,
The Ravenheart Center.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.750 align:middle line:10%
She has a new book out
called Soul Design.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.590 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.920 align:middle line:90%
Linda.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.510 align:middle line:84%
It's always a
pleasure seeing you.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.843 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA BACKMAN: Thank you,
George It's good to be here.

00:00:41.843 --> 00:00:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you go
from a PhD in psychology

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.130 align:middle line:90%
to past life regressionist?

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Yes, that's
a great question.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.830 align:middle line:10%
I had a colleague die in
1993, a very close colleague.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.530 align:middle line:10%
And I wasn't into any of
this soul level regression

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.830 align:middle line:10%
kind of work.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.380 align:middle line:10%
He started talking to me
from the other side, which

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.110 align:middle line:10%
was completely
surprising to me, and he

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.450 align:middle line:10%
began to show me
scenes of past lives

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.440 align:middle line:10%
intuitively in my mind's eye.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, now
what do I do with this?

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So he started
you on this journey.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And I learned over the
course of many years

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.550 align:middle line:84%
that he and I had shared
many lives together,

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.410 align:middle line:84%
and that there was a
reason why his passing was

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.360 align:middle line:84%
an opportunity for me,
and not that-- obviously,

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.910 align:middle line:84%
his passing was
horribly difficult

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.600 align:middle line:90%
for his family and friends.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: But it was an
opportunity for me to decide,

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.710 align:middle line:84%
was I brave enough back then to
change the direction of my work?

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do we reincarnate
in the first place, Linda?

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: That's
a simple answer,

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.080 align:middle line:84%
which is an important
one, to grow and evolve,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.340 align:middle line:84%
to learn and gain wisdom
and gain a broader

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.660 align:middle line:90%
perspective and way of life.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I always thought
when I was younger

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.250 align:middle line:84%
that regression and
reincarnation dealt

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.560 align:middle line:90%
with getting closer to heaven.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.020 align:middle line:84%
The more you died,
the better you

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.180 align:middle line:84%
got until you got to
that heavenly point.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.100 align:middle line:90%
How close was I to being right?

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: In many ways,
close, because the more lives

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.130 align:middle line:84%
we have and the free
will choices that we make

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.700 align:middle line:84%
relate to are we
evolving quickly

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.920 align:middle line:84%
through one lifetime
or five lifetimes,

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.580 align:middle line:84%
or are we dragging our feet
based on our free will choices?

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about
Soul Design, the new book.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.370 align:middle line:10%
>>BACKMAN: Yeah, Soul Design
is kind of fun in a way.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.060 align:middle line:10%
The notion of Soul
Design was, I'm sure,

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.690 align:middle line:10%
dropped into my brain,
George, through my own guides.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And so Soul Design is,
who are we as a soul?

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.330 align:middle line:90%
What are our past lives?

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.610 align:middle line:84%
How does that
contribute to our soul?

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.040 align:middle line:84%
Where are we in our
soul's evolution?

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.960 align:middle line:90%
Where do we come from?

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.460 align:middle line:84%
What's our specific origin that
relates to our soul design?

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.090 align:middle line:84%
There are three types of
souls that come to Earth.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.720 align:middle line:90%
And what's our purpose?

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.490 align:middle line:84%
What are we working
on in current life?

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.590 align:middle line:90%
How does all that fit together?

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.720 align:middle line:90%
That's Soul Design.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we comprised of
these three different kinds

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.680 align:middle line:90%
of souls or just one?

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: We are
one type of soul.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Humanity is comprised of three
different types of souls,

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.500 align:middle line:84%
but each of us is
a type of soul,

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.510 align:middle line:84%
and that's an immortal soul
type, an immortal soul quality

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.770 align:middle line:90%
and where we come from.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What determines
what soul we get?

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: It's kind of funny.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.910 align:middle line:84%
I often say to people, or
periodically say to people,

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.590 align:middle line:84%
certain things can be above our
pay grade or above my pay grade.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.290 align:middle line:84%
I think that's determined
at a higher level.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.870 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
determined at what we

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.680 align:middle line:90%
might call the level of source.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.800 align:middle line:84%
Are we an Earth-based
soul or are

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.140 align:middle line:90%
we one of the two other types?

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Soul essence
psychology is what?

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: So soul essence
is related to soul design.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.240 align:middle line:90%
Our soul has an essence.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.970 align:middle line:84%
What's the immortal
nature of our soul?

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.400 align:middle line:90%
What have we learned so far?

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And soul essence
psychology is a term

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:20.290 align:middle line:84%
that came to me to be used in
a more formal psychological way

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:26.050 align:middle line:84%
to understand we have, each
of us, a particular soul

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.230 align:middle line:84%
essence based on
our soul experience.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we all designed
for Earth-bound life?

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: We are not all
designed for Earth-bound.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We are not.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Correct.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.130 align:middle line:84%
So some of us as souls, I'm an
example of an Earth-based soul.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes people think
I'm saying Earth-bound soul.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.710 align:middle line:84%
That's a different
spiritual term.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.460 align:middle line:84%
An Earth-based soul is designed
to primarily incarnate on Earth.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.850 align:middle line:84%
There are two other types of
souls that may come to Earth

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.960 align:middle line:84%
but aren't designed
primarily to--

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.080 align:middle line:84%
they don't originate in
the frequency of Earth

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.720 align:middle line:84%
and aren't designed
necessarily to come to Earth.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would that be
an interplanetary soul?

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: One of those
is an interplanetary soul.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:12.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what's the other?

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: The other is
an angelic soul, or what

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.920 align:middle line:90%
I call an angelic realm soul.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we
get a pick at all?

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: My guess is no.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.860 align:middle line:90%
My hunch is no.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:23.930 align:middle line:90%
We don't pick.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.720 align:middle line:84%
There's a higher
wisdom that picks,

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.650 align:middle line:84%
what does the universe need
and what does humanity need?

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we hear
a lot about source.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.510 align:middle line:90%
To me, that's God.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.900 align:middle line:90%
What about you?

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I say to
people, choose the term

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.960 align:middle line:90%
you're comfortable with.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.020 align:middle line:90%
Source, God, great spirit.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.620 align:middle line:84%
There's an Eastern
term, the Manu, which--

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.450 align:middle line:84%
so we're talking about a
guidance system, a group wisdom.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.190 align:middle line:84%
But yes, God and source
can be synonymous terms.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now the interplanetary
soul is created by what?

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.590 align:middle line:90%
What puts that together?

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: The interplanetary
soul is created outside of Earth

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.770 align:middle line:84%
as a soul that primarily
grows and evolves

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.190 align:middle line:84%
somewhere other than Earth,
a planet, a star system,

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.100 align:middle line:90%
inter-dimensional space.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.480 align:middle line:90%
There are spacecraft.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.890 align:middle line:84%
I have worked with many
clients that spontaneously

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.260 align:middle line:84%
find themselves during the
regression on a spacecraft.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.960 align:middle line:90%
They can describe their role.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.550 align:middle line:84%
They can describe the
actual interior structure

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.530 align:middle line:90%
of the spacecraft.

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, the angelic
souls would be what?

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: The angelic
souls serve source directly.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.700 align:middle line:84%
An angelic soul is
part of the realm

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.920 align:middle line:84%
that we would say serves
God, serves the divine,

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.760 align:middle line:90%
whatever term we want to use.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.820 align:middle line:84%
There's a-- I like to
call it a cadre of souls.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.340 align:middle line:84%
There's a group of souls that
make up the angelic realm who

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.960 align:middle line:90%
are ambassadors of sorts.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And so that means they carry
pure love and compassion energy.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And if they come to Earth, they
bring that wisdom to Earth.

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a true
difference between the three?

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.180 align:middle line:90%
It may relate to--

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.630 align:middle line:84%
an Earth-based soul tends to
be more comfortable on Earth

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:24.340 align:middle line:84%
because they've
been here hundreds,

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.080 align:middle line:90%
if not 1,000 or more times.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.670 align:middle line:84%
So an Earth-based soul has
familiarity with the human body,

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.300 align:middle line:90%
with the--

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.760 align:middle line:84%
as an example,
sometimes if I'm working

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.580 align:middle line:84%
with an interplanetary
soul in my client

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.150 align:middle line:84%
work, interplanetary
souls, I've heard them say,

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.080 align:middle line:90%
sometimes I forget to eat.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.420 align:middle line:84%
I start off in the
morning, I eat breakfast,

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.180 align:middle line:84%
and then it's eight
o'clock at night

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.820 align:middle line:84%
and I forgot to eat because
they're interplanetary

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.850 align:middle line:84%
and some interplanetary
souls don't

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:56.280 align:middle line:84%
need to nourish
their bodies the way

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.540 align:middle line:90%
we humans nourish our bodies.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.975 align:middle line:84%
An Earth-based soul doesn't
tend to forget to eat.

00:08:01.975 --> 00:08:02.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:05.430 align:middle line:90%
Do they interchange at all?

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Meaning
can you change?

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:08.160 align:middle line:90%
Can you be-- can you--

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One to the other.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: My
understanding is no.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:16.620 align:middle line:84%
If you're created as one, that
is your immortal soul type.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Until you die.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Until you
finish your soul's journey.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.270 align:middle line:84%
So if you're an
interplanetary soul,

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.240 align:middle line:84%
you're created as an
interplanetary soul.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.679 align:middle line:84%
Your home location
is somewhere outside

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:36.460 align:middle line:90%
of the frequency of Earth.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.559 align:middle line:90%
You may incarnate on Earth.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:40.480 align:middle line:90%
You may not incarnate on Earth.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.830 align:middle line:84%
So you are basically
immortal and permanent

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.970 align:middle line:90%
as an interplanetary soul.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
goal of every soul,

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.540 align:middle line:90%
to reach that heavenly state?

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've got these three
different kinds of souls.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.090 align:middle line:90%
What's the end game for them?

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:57.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yeah.

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:59.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, again, that's
a great question.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.550 align:middle line:90%
That the end game is--

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:05.020 align:middle line:84%
I often say to my clients,
because my clients

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:08.650 align:middle line:84%
are incarnate on Earth, no
matter which of the three types,

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:13.360 align:middle line:84%
their goal is to advance,
to evolve humanity.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.675 align:middle line:84%
We often think
there's an end game,

00:09:15.675 --> 00:09:17.740 align:middle line:84%
like we're going to
reach a place of what

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.870 align:middle line:90%
we might call nirvana.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:24.140 align:middle line:84%
Our soul, at the level
of soul or higher self,

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:28.930 align:middle line:84%
has a role and responsibility
to help coordinate the greater

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:31.180 align:middle line:90%
spiritual realm.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the soul we have
from the moment of conception

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:37.150 align:middle line:90%
or birth?

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: We are a soul from
the time our soul is conceived.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:45.730 align:middle line:84%
So we are a soul whether
we're incarnate on Earth

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:48.540 align:middle line:84%
or whether we're not
incarnate on Earth.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's out there
in the ether somewhere.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:52.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:56.470 align:middle line:84%
So when we incarnate,
we bring a slice,

00:09:56.470 --> 00:10:00.300 align:middle line:84%
we bring a holographic
portion of our soul energy

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.850 align:middle line:84%
into our body to
be alive on Earth.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:07.410 align:middle line:84%
The remainder of our soul, no
matter which of the three types

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.760 align:middle line:90%
we are, is our higher self.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.250 align:middle line:84%
Our higher self resides in
the greater celestial realm

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:16.800 align:middle line:90%
where we come from as a soul.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happens when
we die, physically die?

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yeah.

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:24.210 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
we die is that once

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:27.060 align:middle line:84%
the body, once the
cardiopulmonary functions

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:32.740 align:middle line:84%
ceasefire in our physical body,
our soul energy, that fractal,

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:36.700 align:middle line:84%
that holographic slice of
soul operates on autopilot.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.670 align:middle line:84%
It automatically
steps out of the body.

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:43.170 align:middle line:84%
Many times, if people have been
with a loved one who has just

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:45.660 align:middle line:84%
passed, they can
feel, they can almost

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:50.060 align:middle line:84%
sense the vacancy of
the body once the soul

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.280 align:middle line:84%
is out of that body that's
no longer functioning.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:58.580 align:middle line:84%
That slice of soul basically
elevates from third dimension

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.770 align:middle line:84%
through fourth
dimension, returns

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:02.930 align:middle line:84%
back to what we call
fifth dimension,

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:07.830 align:middle line:84%
or the spiritual realm, and back
to where we come from as a soul.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it the soul
that makes up the person

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:14.090 align:middle line:84%
or is it the person
that makes up the soul?

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: That's a
beautiful question.

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.050 align:middle line:90%
The truth is, it's both.

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:19.220 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Combination.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Yeah, it's a
mixture, because as a human,

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:28.700 align:middle line:84%
we have a personality that's
held in our human brain, that's

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:32.160 align:middle line:84%
held in the gray matter
of our human brain.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:37.610 align:middle line:84%
That's blended with
the type of soul we are

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:40.380 align:middle line:84%
and the experiences
our soul has had.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:41.880 align:middle line:90%
So we're a blend.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You did a
regression with a woman

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.180 align:middle line:90%
that was quite revealing.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:49.805 align:middle line:84%
Let's listen to some of it and
then I'll have you explain it.

00:11:49.805 --> 00:11:51.420 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:55.710 align:middle line:84%
- So just like this
is a story or a movie.

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:59.110 align:middle line:10%
Let the scene begin to progress.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:02.310 align:middle line:10%
What happens next?

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:03.400 align:middle line:10%
- There's a coach.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.640 align:middle line:10%
There's a man.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.930 align:middle line:10%
He has a top hat
and a big mustache.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.610 align:middle line:10%
I get into the
carriage with him.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.180 align:middle line:10%
- And what are you
feeling right now?

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.320 align:middle line:10%
- Sad.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.140 align:middle line:10%
So sad.

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:18.940 align:middle line:10%
- OK.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:22.020 align:middle line:10%
And what are you sad about?

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.400 align:middle line:10%
- My life has been determined.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.200 align:middle line:10%
- I see.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.750 align:middle line:10%
- And now I am
going away with him.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:30.190 align:middle line:10%
And I can't fix that.

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:31.780 align:middle line:10%
I can't change it.

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:32.880 align:middle line:10%
I have no--

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.020 align:middle line:10%
I have no voice.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.020 align:middle line:10%
- What happens next?

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.450 align:middle line:10%
- I'm outside and
I have children,

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.790 align:middle line:10%
and they're outside playing.

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:46.720 align:middle line:10%
And I'm watching them
play and I'm so happy.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.550 align:middle line:10%
- How many children do you have?

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:49.350 align:middle line:10%
- Two.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:50.470 align:middle line:10%
Two boys.

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:53.940 align:middle line:10%
One little blond boy
and one brunette.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:57.700 align:middle line:10%
- And so let this
scene just play out.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:01.650 align:middle line:10%
What else happens?

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:03.610 align:middle line:10%
- One of them dies.

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:06.150 align:middle line:10%
It was an accident.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.460 align:middle line:10%
They were just playing.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:13.320 align:middle line:10%
- They were playing and what
happened when they were playing?

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.370 align:middle line:10%
- I think he--

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:17.490 align:middle line:10%
I think he drowned in the water.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:19.210 align:middle line:10%
He drowned in the water.

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.240 align:middle line:10%
I think he drowned in the water.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.960 align:middle line:10%
- He drowned in the water.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.550 align:middle line:10%
And where is your
other boy right now?

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:28.020 align:middle line:10%
- He's with me.

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.240 align:middle line:10%
He's with me.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.490 align:middle line:10%
And I am angry.

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.180 align:middle line:10%
- Tell me about the anger.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.090 align:middle line:10%
What are you angry about?

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:44.860 align:middle line:10%
- Everything and everyone,
because they made me come here.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.500 align:middle line:10%
Because I didn't have a voice.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:51.290 align:middle line:10%
If I had never been here,
this would never happened.

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:53.260 align:middle line:10%
And I have to bury him--

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.140 align:middle line:10%
I have to bury him in my yard.

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:59.120 align:middle line:10%
I had to do a grave in my yard.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.940 align:middle line:10%
There was nowhere to go.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.460 align:middle line:10%
- And do you think your
husband is coming back?

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.960 align:middle line:10%
- No, he's not coming back.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.100 align:middle line:10%
I'm all alone.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.430 align:middle line:10%
Just me and my boy.

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:10.580 align:middle line:10%
We're close.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:14.730 align:middle line:10%
We're close, but then I'm angry.

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:15.530 align:middle line:10%
- What do you do?

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:17.500 align:middle line:10%
- And I start drinking.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.370 align:middle line:10%
- You start drinking.

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:20.230 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:21.250 align:middle line:10%
Tell me more.

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:23.140 align:middle line:10%
- I start drinking.

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:24.290 align:middle line:10%
- You start drinking.

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:29.170 align:middle line:10%
- Because I don't know what
to do and I'm so angry.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:33.640 align:middle line:84%
- And what happens as
you start drinking?

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:37.870 align:middle line:10%
- It all just gets worse
and worse and worse

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:41.050 align:middle line:10%
and worse and worse.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:44.480 align:middle line:10%
And soon my boy grows
up and he leaves me

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.540 align:middle line:10%
and he doesn't want
to have anything

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:51.100 align:middle line:10%
to do with me because I
was not a good mother.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.210 align:middle line:10%
I was not kind.

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.990 align:middle line:10%
I was not available.

00:14:55.990 --> 00:15:00.516 align:middle line:10%
I was so sad and angry.

00:15:00.516 --> 00:15:01.480 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Linda, that's an
emotional piece of audio.

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Absolutely.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did we just hear?

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:11.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: So what we heard
is direct regression content.

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.540 align:middle line:84%
I never know what's going to
come forward in a regression.

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:18.410 align:middle line:84%
I work with the client
with what comes forward.

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.610 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a woman
who's experiencing--

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:24.770 align:middle line:84%
it's a common theme,
I find, George,

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:27.310 align:middle line:84%
that I work with a
fair number of clients

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:30.860 align:middle line:84%
who live during an era of
time where, for some reason,

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.210 align:middle line:90%
they had no rights.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:34.270 align:middle line:84%
There was an era
of time when women

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:38.510 align:middle line:84%
couldn't own land, where women
were told who they would marry.

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And so this is showing one of
those themes on our planet.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.500 align:middle line:90%
And so she had no voice.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And rather than
standing up for herself,

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:55.010 align:middle line:84%
she basically let herself
cave in to the trauma

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:56.600 align:middle line:90%
and the lack of power that--

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.657 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She acquiesced.

00:15:57.657 --> 00:15:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: She acquiesced.

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.890 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was she aware of
what she was saying to you?

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:05.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:06.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.060 align:middle line:84%
Clients are aware of what's
happening in the regression.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.950 align:middle line:90%
They're not so tuned out.

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they're relaxed, but they
are aware of what's going on.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:19.260 align:middle line:84%
What we're seeing is a perfect
example of what we call karma.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:23.580 align:middle line:84%
So when we come into the
human body, we have free will.

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:26.250 align:middle line:90%
We choose how we behave.

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is an
example of a client.

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:33.660 align:middle line:84%
She caved in to being angry
about her life circumstances.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And as you heard
from the client,

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:42.720 align:middle line:84%
she was an uncommitted mother,
uncommitted to being a mom.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.650 align:middle line:84%
So she's going through
a horrible trauma

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:50.900 align:middle line:84%
of the accidental death
and passing of her child.

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:55.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did her past life
echo her current life?

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:57.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:05.329 align:middle line:84%
And that's the beauty, in a
way, of how we advance as a soul

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:09.240 align:middle line:84%
and how we can make the
choice to, we might say,

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:14.400 align:middle line:84%
clean up past behavior that
wasn't the most useful behavior.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.720 align:middle line:84%
So as you heard from
her, in the past life,

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.490 align:middle line:84%
she becomes so immersed
in her depression

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:27.380 align:middle line:84%
and traumatic feelings
that she begins

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:34.190 align:middle line:84%
to imbibe too much alcoholic
beverage and, again, caves

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:35.760 align:middle line:90%
into her emotions.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.940 align:middle line:84%
Our guides would wish that
we honor our emotions,

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.330 align:middle line:84%
acknowledge our
emotions, and not

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:45.197 align:middle line:84%
let them basically
ruin our life.

00:17:45.197 --> 00:17:47.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was it like for
you as a therapist, Linda,

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:52.230 align:middle line:84%
to just hear her break
down the way she did?

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:53.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's something,
George, for me,

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.860 align:middle line:84%
I was a conventional
therapist for many years

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.850 align:middle line:90%
before I fell into this work.

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:03.430 align:middle line:84%
But when I train
people in regression,

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:06.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't require them to be
a conventional therapist.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.910 align:middle line:90%
I train them to--

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:12.370 align:middle line:84%
the feelings need
to be expressed.

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:18.570 align:middle line:84%
The feelings have to be
owned and overtly cathartic.

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And then, rather than
becoming lost in our feelings,

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:26.100 align:middle line:84%
then we need to take steps
to move forward and deal

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.990 align:middle line:84%
with our feelings and find
other ways of behaving.

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:31.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's sort of
a 2-step process.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:36.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you let the
client hear herself on tape?

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Again,
wonderful question.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:39.770 align:middle line:90%
I record all regressions.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:41.690 align:middle line:84%
The client receives
the recording.

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And I strongly encourage
them to go back and listen

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:49.310 align:middle line:84%
to step by step, what came
forward in the regression?

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:52.430 align:middle line:84%
Because then it benefits
my client's soul evolution.

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:54.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, did
she say, that's not me.

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:59.060 align:middle line:84%
That person is breaking
down and crying and sobbing.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yeah.

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:01.580 align:middle line:90%
She did not say that.

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:07.180 align:middle line:84%
She realizes that what
happened in the past life led

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:12.100 align:middle line:84%
her to become despondent,
again, led her to drink too much

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:16.430 align:middle line:84%
and let her emotions
overtake her.

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that past life
affected her current life.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: And it's directly
related to her current life.

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what made her
come to you in the first place?

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: What made her
come to me in the first place

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:32.710 align:middle line:84%
is that in current
life, she was dealing

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:36.550 align:middle line:84%
with the death of a child
in her current life.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And I want listeners to know,
this doesn't always happen.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Just because we've had a loss
of a child in a past life,

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:45.160 align:middle line:84%
that does not
automatically mean we're

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.980 align:middle line:84%
going to experience
that in current life.

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:51.460 align:middle line:84%
But what this client
regression exhibits

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:56.270 align:middle line:84%
is that sometimes soul
evolution is not always easy.

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And when we face
our emotions, when

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:02.680 align:middle line:84%
we face what happened
and then move forward

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:06.050 align:middle line:84%
to accept that we can
continue to evolve and grow,

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:10.130 align:middle line:84%
then we're benefiting from
what happened in the past

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:13.030 align:middle line:84%
and we're benefiting-- we're
benefiting from the revelation

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:14.630 align:middle line:90%
of what happened in the past.

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what
you're saying is

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:21.220 align:middle line:84%
there are past episodes
contributed to helping

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.000 align:middle line:90%
solve her current problems.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:23.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Exactly.

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:24.770 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:26.645 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how does
she become aware of it?

00:20:26.645 --> 00:20:27.500 align:middle line:90%
Through you?

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:28.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Right.

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.950 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there are many ways.

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Regression is not the only way
to become aware of past lives,

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.940 align:middle line:84%
and we can certainly
talk about that.

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:38.360 align:middle line:10%
But learning about
our past lives

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:43.340 align:middle line:10%
helps us to understand what
we need to change and work on

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.980 align:middle line:10%
in our present life and
helps us move forward

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.340 align:middle line:10%
in our present life.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The drinking
she did in her past life,

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.510 align:middle line:84%
was she drinking in
her current life too?

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: So yes.

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:59.390 align:middle line:84%
In her current life, she had had
a child die in her current life

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:03.260 align:middle line:84%
and she had resorted
to drinking.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:07.050 align:middle line:84%
We all have spiritual guides
as well as a higher self.

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Her spiritual guides
and her higher self

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:14.570 align:middle line:84%
brought forward this past
life to help her make changes

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:17.240 align:middle line:90%
in her current life.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.370 align:middle line:84%
Following this
regression-- I've continued

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:21.170 align:middle line:84%
to have contact
with this client,

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:25.040 align:middle line:84%
following her regression,
she stopped drinking

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:29.150 align:middle line:84%
and realized it was not the
answer to the emotions she

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:30.710 align:middle line:90%
was experiencing.

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the past
life, her son died.

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:35.520 align:middle line:90%
He drowned.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.070 align:middle line:90%
It was an accident.

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:40.370 align:middle line:90%
Why did that happen?

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:43.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I think bottom
line is accidents happen.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:46.130 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I don't think
his drowning was necessarily

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:48.530 align:middle line:90%
planned at the soul level.

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:54.170 align:middle line:84%
It can be purely an accident,
but it's what do we do about?

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:57.120 align:middle line:84%
How do we cope with
and how do we face?

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.100 align:middle line:90%
We all have trauma in our life.

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:04.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- if people say to me
they don't have any trauma, I,

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:10.440 align:middle line:84%
in a caring way, say, I think we
all have some degree of trauma,

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.030 align:middle line:90%
some more, some less.

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:16.190 align:middle line:84%
It's how we deal with that that
leads to our soul evolution.

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:18.718 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was the boy careless?

00:22:18.718 --> 00:22:20.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: The boy that
drowned in the past life.

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:21.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: My sense, George,
is that the mom blamed herself.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:29.850 align:middle line:84%
Whether she was
careless, that did not

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:34.110 align:middle line:84%
surface in the regression,
but she blamed herself

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:37.890 align:middle line:84%
in the past life for
the passing of her son.

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what led
her to cave in to her emotions.

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In Soul Design, you
talk about the grieving process,

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:47.230 align:middle line:90%
two steps.

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:48.190 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: So I think about
grieving from a human standpoint

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:53.890 align:middle line:84%
and grieving from
a soul standpoint.

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:55.770 align:middle line:84%
So grieving from
a human standpoint

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:59.200 align:middle line:84%
means I feel
miserable, I feel sad,

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:03.010 align:middle line:84%
I miss the person
who has passed.

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:05.190 align:middle line:90%
I wish it hadn't happened.

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Coulda, shoulda,
woulda kind of things

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:11.640 align:middle line:84%
that are all normal
aspects of human grief.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:16.390 align:middle line:84%
The other aspect of grief
is the soul is immortal.

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:19.180 align:middle line:84%
The soul of our child,
the soul of our friend,

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:24.450 align:middle line:84%
the soul of our grandparent,
or whoever, is accessible to us

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:29.800 align:middle line:84%
and remains present even though
their body no longer exists.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And so spiritual
grieving, in my opinion,

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:37.030 align:middle line:84%
needs to sit alongside
human grieving.

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Linda,
what is a soul pod?

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: So a soul pod means
that when our soul is created,

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:47.970 align:middle line:84%
we belong to a group
of souls, we belong to,

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:50.650 align:middle line:84%
call it a soul
cluster, a soul family.

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:54.930 align:middle line:84%
I like to call it a pod so that
everyone doesn't think, well,

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:58.080 align:middle line:84%
people I know from my soul
pod in my current life are not

00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.980 align:middle line:90%
necessarily my family members.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:04.770 align:middle line:84%
So we reincarnate
repetitively more

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:08.340 align:middle line:84%
often with the members
of our soul pod.

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:13.312 align:middle line:84%
And so we have familiar souls,
you might say, in our soul pod.

00:24:13.312 --> 00:24:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they different from
those three souls we just talked

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:16.820 align:middle line:90%
about?

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:19.030 align:middle line:90%


00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:19.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yeah.

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:22.120 align:middle line:84%
Again, that's an
important distinction.

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:25.680 align:middle line:84%
If we're an Earth-based soul,
all the souls on our soul pod

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.890 align:middle line:90%
are Earth-based.

00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:29.780 align:middle line:84%
If we're interplanetary,
they're all interplanetary.

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:32.390 align:middle line:84%
If we're angelic,
they're all angelic.

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:35.360 align:middle line:84%
We do relate, because
people ask me this a lot.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.360 align:middle line:84%
So, Linda, if I'm
an Earth-based soul

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.280 align:middle line:84%
and my child is an
interplanetary soul,

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.640 align:middle line:84%
does that mean I won't ever
have a life again with my child?

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.170 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is no.

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:46.810 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
you won't ever have

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:48.890 align:middle line:90%
a life again with your child.

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:51.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there good
souls and bad souls?

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: There's good
behavior and bad behavior.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:59.110 align:middle line:84%
But no, I don't think there
are good souls and bad souls.

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can you fix a soul?

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Yes, through
repetitive incarnation.

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:06.950 align:middle line:90%
That's why we keep coming back.

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:10.040 align:middle line:84%
So no matter what our
choices were in past lives,

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:13.430 align:middle line:84%
we can have future lives
and behave differently.

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And that, if we want
to use the word fix,

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:20.060 align:middle line:84%
that resolves the
past life karma.

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does our higher
self mean to you, Linda?

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:25.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: So we all have a
higher self when we're in body.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Linda's higher self
is my soul energy

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:33.380 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't bring
into my human body.

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.710 align:middle line:84%
I've been told many
times in regression

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:38.170 align:middle line:84%
that the reason we
don't bring, or one

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:40.840 align:middle line:84%
of the reasons we don't
bring 100% of our soul energy

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.000 align:middle line:84%
into our body, is
because it would blow

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.370 align:middle line:90%
the circuits of the human body.

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How so?

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Because
our soul is energy.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.530 align:middle line:90%
Our soul is pure energy.

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:53.810 align:middle line:90%
Consciousness is energy.

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:58.120 align:middle line:84%
So two reasons we don't
bring all of our soul energy

00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.000 align:middle line:90%
into our body.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.220 align:middle line:84%
One is what I just said,
that our human body couldn't

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:06.440 align:middle line:90%
manage 100% of our soul energy.

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:10.730 align:middle line:84%
The other, and equally, if not
more probably equally important,

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:13.610 align:middle line:84%
is our higher self
is one of our guides.

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Our higher self, our soul
energy in the spiritual realm

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:21.170 align:middle line:84%
serves as one of our
spiritual guides.

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does
that soul communicate?

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Through intuition,
through various ways

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:32.690 align:middle line:84%
of intuition, from dreams
to clairvoyance to emotions

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:36.290 align:middle line:84%
to just what I might
call cognitive download

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:40.670 align:middle line:90%
or just a left brain knowing.

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That intuition,
would that be called somatic?

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Sometimes our
intuition is somatic.

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which would be what?

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Which would be
a symptom in your body.

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:57.120 align:middle line:84%
So here's an example that
happened to me some years ago.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.480 align:middle line:84%
For a period of time,
probably more than a

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:04.680 align:middle line:84%
year, I felt like occasionally
there was someone behind me.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.745 align:middle line:84%
There was truly
no one behind me,

00:27:06.745 --> 00:27:08.120 align:middle line:84%
but I felt like
there was someone

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:12.390 align:middle line:84%
behind me putting
their hand gently

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:14.700 align:middle line:90%
on my left shoulder blade.

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And I would sense
that periodically.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.240 align:middle line:84%
It took me a while
to figure out it

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.220 align:middle line:84%
was one of my guides
trying to get my attention.

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And once I realized
what the signal was,

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:30.180 align:middle line:84%
what the somatic signal
was, I never felt it again

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:33.280 align:middle line:84%
because I started tuning
into my guide more often.

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:34.785 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
guides do we have?

00:27:34.785 --> 00:27:36.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: If
you're Earth-based,

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.590 align:middle line:84%
you usually have
a team of guides.

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:42.280 align:middle line:84%
If you're interplanetary
or you're angelic,

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:45.960 align:middle line:90%
you often have a guide.

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that different
from your guardian angel?

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Actually not.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.590 align:middle line:84%
I often use that
term synonymously.

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:59.160 align:middle line:84%
Guardian angel, spiritual
guide, friend and support system

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.220 align:middle line:84%
from the spiritual realm,
all the same thing.

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With each
soul type, does

00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:07.560 align:middle line:84%
it have a different
guide attached to it?

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Yes, and
that's an important piece

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.380 align:middle line:90%
that shows up in regression.

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:13.830 align:middle line:84%
If you're an
Earth-based soul, you

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:15.310 align:middle line:90%
tend to have a team of guides.

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:17.550 align:middle line:84%
You have a lead
guide and usually

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:20.520 align:middle line:90%
one or two additional guides.

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:24.550 align:middle line:84%
If you're an interplanetary
or an angelic soul,

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:29.620 align:middle line:84%
often your higher self is
your only and primary guide.

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
interplanetary souls

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:37.180 align:middle line:84%
and angelic souls are always
highly advanced souls.

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I learned
this because these

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:40.510 align:middle line:90%
are souls on Earth.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:44.970 align:middle line:84%
So the higher self often
guides an interplanetary soul

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:47.255 align:middle line:90%
and an angelic soul.

00:28:47.255 --> 00:28:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There
was a song we used

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:50.970 align:middle line:84%
to sing in Catholic
school called

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:54.150 align:middle line:90%
Angels We Have Heard on High.

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Does that tie into something
we're talking about,

00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:02.100 align:middle line:84%
in that are these archangels
assisting our souls?

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:02.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:05.860 align:middle line:84%
So I've learned a lot
about the angelic realm.

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:10.270 align:middle line:84%
My new book has a lot of client
material from angelic clients.

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:14.290 align:middle line:84%
So the angelic
realm serves source,

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:16.120 align:middle line:90%
as we have already talked about.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:19.650 align:middle line:84%
The leaders of the angelic
realm are the archangels.

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And so Angels We
Have Heard on High

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:26.140 align:middle line:84%
simply indicates
that these are highly

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:29.800 align:middle line:84%
evolved souls that
serve a high purpose

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.990 align:middle line:84%
and work with a high
energy called source.

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is Earth's
Interplanetary Council.

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: So there's an
interplanetary council

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:43.900 align:middle line:84%
with representative souls
from various celestial bodies

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:46.820 align:middle line:90%
that are interplanetary souls.

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:50.470 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like-- it's almost
like we think about the United

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:53.950 align:middle line:84%
States House of Representatives,
where each of those members

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:56.900 align:middle line:84%
comes from a different
district or a different state.

00:29:56.900 --> 00:30:00.520 align:middle line:84%
So the Interplanetary
Council is made up

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:05.590 align:middle line:84%
of Earth-based souls and
interplanetary souls that

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:11.440 align:middle line:84%
work together to serve humanity,
to aid humanity's evolution.

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does free will
have a play in this?

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Free will always
has a play when we're on Earth.

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:19.240 align:middle line:84%
So when we're in body
on Earth, no matter

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:24.370 align:middle line:84%
what our life plan was, we make
free will choices in regard

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:25.730 align:middle line:90%
to our behavior.

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a unique
quality of coming to Earth,

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:30.800 align:middle line:84%
is that we always
have free will.

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Must we
have a regression

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:36.230 align:middle line:84%
in order to determine
what our past life was?

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: A lot of
us, myself included,

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:42.910 align:middle line:84%
I gradually learned how to begin
to understand my own past lives

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:47.120 align:middle line:84%
from things like
interests in eras of time,

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.910 align:middle line:84%
interests in cultures
of the world,

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:53.360 align:middle line:84%
studying a particular
time in history,

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:56.930 align:middle line:84%
and studying particular figures
during that time in history.

00:30:56.930 --> 00:30:59.900 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't necessarily
mean we were those figures,

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:02.300 align:middle line:84%
but it means we had
some connection.

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:08.120 align:middle line:84%
So letting ourself tap into
skills from past lives,

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:12.340 align:middle line:84%
interests from past lives,
relationships from past lives

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:17.660 align:middle line:84%
can surface past life
information without regression.

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does the way you
conduct your life determine what

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:23.150 align:middle line:90%
your past life might have been?

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:24.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:28.460 align:middle line:84%
The circumstances that
come forward in our life

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:35.160 align:middle line:84%
often relate to people,
experiences, traumas,

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:38.370 align:middle line:90%
learnings from past life.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:42.050 align:middle line:84%
That is why I created
the notion of Soul Design

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:48.750 align:middle line:84%
so that we understand what's our
makeup beyond just current life?

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:50.400 align:middle line:90%
What are our past lives?

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.500 align:middle line:90%
What type of soul are we?

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:55.730 align:middle line:84%
What's the purpose of intention
of our current life that

00:31:55.730 --> 00:32:00.870 align:middle line:84%
makes up the design of
our soul in present life?

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:03.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many past
lives can we have, Linda?

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: My understanding
is we can have hundreds,

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:07.860 align:middle line:90%
if not 1,000 or more past lives.

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my God.

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean that the
person is not evolving

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:14.750 align:middle line:90%
if they have that many?

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:16.280 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: It can mean that.

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:20.270 align:middle line:84%
If we're not working
on the issues

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:23.730 align:middle line:84%
that our soul and our
guides wish us to work on,

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:27.660 align:middle line:84%
then that means we're going to
come back again and work on it.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:30.170 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand,
a more advanced soul

00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:34.440 align:middle line:84%
can still keep incarnating
to aid humanity,

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.400 align:middle line:84%
and that more advanced soul
may have had many, many lives

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:41.580 align:middle line:84%
to gain a significant amount
of wisdom and perspective.

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we carry any of
our wisdoms from our past lives

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.960 align:middle line:90%
to our next life?

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: We always do.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.370 align:middle line:84%
If we allow ourselves
to trust our wisdom,

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:53.540 align:middle line:84%
yes, we're bringing our
learning from past lives

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.650 align:middle line:90%
forward into our current life.

00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:58.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That is
dramatic, isn't it?

00:32:58.250 --> 00:32:59.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Important.

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do souls incarnate
throughout the universe or just

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.670 align:middle line:90%
on good old planet Earth?

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Souls
incarnate all over what

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:11.070 align:middle line:84%
I call the celestial
realm, the universe.

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:15.570 align:middle line:84%
There is intelligent life in
places where we don't even know

00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:17.860 align:middle line:90%
the names of those locations.

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:21.610 align:middle line:84%
It's not always Pleiades,
Arcturus, Sirius.

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:25.360 align:middle line:84%
It's many, many locations
in the universe.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What determines
that location?

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Who
you are as a soul.

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:32.260 align:middle line:84%
If you're an
interplanetary soul,

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:37.890 align:middle line:84%
you have a home location
somewhere in the universe.

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How much
of our soul energy

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:42.270 align:middle line:84%
do we bring into
our current body?

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Usually it depends
on the complexity of our life

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:50.640 align:middle line:84%
contract, but usually
we bring somewhere

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:58.080 align:middle line:84%
from 20% to maybe 35% of our
soul energy into our human body.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you're a horrible
person in a past life,

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:06.180 align:middle line:84%
are you going to be a horrible
person in a current life?

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:08.020 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Not necessarily.

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:12.600 align:middle line:84%
If you're a horrible person in a
past life, what your guides hope

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.030 align:middle line:84%
you'll choose to do
in a subsequent life

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:22.860 align:middle line:84%
is to balance, to not make those
unhealthy, horrible choices.

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.989 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can a soul
end up as a soul

00:34:24.989 --> 00:34:28.020 align:middle line:84%
of an animal or an
extraterrestrial,

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:30.690 align:middle line:90%
or something else?

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:33.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: So certain animals--

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:35.380 align:middle line:90%
it's a complicated answer.

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:37.420 align:middle line:84%
My understanding
from regression,

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:41.100 align:middle line:84%
from multiple, multiple
regressions I've guided,

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:46.449 align:middle line:84%
the soul of cetaceans, the soul
of dolphins, whales, porpoises,

00:34:46.449 --> 00:34:50.940 align:middle line:84%
that intelligent water mammal, I
have worked with clients that, I

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:57.520 align:middle line:84%
think, in fact, were in the
past the soul of a cetacean.

00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:00.760 align:middle line:90%
But typically no.

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:04.440 align:middle line:84%
The soul of a horse, the soul
of a cat, the soul of a dog

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:07.650 align:middle line:84%
is a soul, but not
the type of soul that

00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:10.260 align:middle line:90%
incarnates in the human body.

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:12.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Bible
looks at suicide

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:16.960 align:middle line:84%
as something bad,
something evil.

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.910 align:middle line:90%
How do you look at it?

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, I
can tell you what

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:23.230 align:middle line:84%
I've learned from
regression, and that

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:30.170 align:middle line:84%
is that suicide is almost a
case by case circumstance.

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I work with a
client who, in the regression,

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:36.590 align:middle line:84%
goes to a past life where
they took their life.

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:39.980 align:middle line:84%
They ended their life in the
past life through suicide.

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:43.340 align:middle line:84%
There are times when
that past life is over

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:46.270 align:middle line:84%
and then I'm working with
the client at the soul level

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:49.420 align:middle line:84%
that the guides
say, we would have

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:53.510 align:middle line:84%
preferred you hadn't taken
your life in that past life.

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:58.300 align:middle line:84%
We want you to make different
choices in current life.

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:00.590 align:middle line:84%
But there are other
times, George,

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:03.970 align:middle line:84%
when the choice of
suicide is completely

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:06.860 align:middle line:84%
understood by the
client's guides,

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:11.060 align:middle line:84%
and that the guides realize
there were some very

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:13.230 align:middle line:90%
extenuating circumstances.

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:16.700 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line, what I want
to be sure listeners hear,

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:23.910 align:middle line:84%
is that suicide is not a
permanent negative black mark,

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:28.800 align:middle line:84%
permanent, horrendous
choice that that soul made.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:32.280 align:middle line:84%
That that soul can balance
that in future lives.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why can
they balance it,

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:36.510 align:middle line:84%
and why is it not looked
at as something bad?

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Because
there are times

00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:44.750 align:middle line:84%
when life circumstances are
so complex and stressful

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:49.170 align:middle line:84%
that the spiritual
realm, to a degree,

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:52.350 align:middle line:90%
accepts the choice of suicide.

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:55.550 align:middle line:84%
They would simply
prefer that maybe there

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:57.090 align:middle line:90%
was another alternative.

00:36:57.090 --> 00:37:01.820 align:middle line:84%
But it's not like an
unresolvable action

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:04.880 align:middle line:90%
that the person makes.

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:07.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I keep thinking
of Robin Williams.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:10.370 align:middle line:90%
Great actor, great comedian.

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:15.410 align:middle line:84%
Took his own life because he had
internal demons within himself.

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:19.372 align:middle line:84%
He could not cope
with it anymore.

00:37:19.372 --> 00:37:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Might he have killed
himself in a past life?

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: He might
have, but I think

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:27.150 align:middle line:84%
it's also-- yes, I think
that's totally possible.

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps there are cases
where we repeat suicide

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:37.550 align:middle line:84%
in more than one
life and then guides

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:42.990 align:middle line:84%
would encourage us in the
future to not do that again.

00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:47.270 align:middle line:84%
But I have heard many
times in regression,

00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:49.340 align:middle line:84%
using Robin Williams
as an example,

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:56.210 align:middle line:84%
that the level of stress, the
level of trauma that someone

00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:59.600 align:middle line:84%
is going through leads
to spiritual guides

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:02.970 align:middle line:84%
understanding why the
decision of suicide was made

00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:08.700 align:middle line:84%
and it's not a horrific, again,
unresolvable resolvable issue

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:10.030 align:middle line:90%
that can't be balanced.

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we determine, Linda,
what of those three past souls

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:17.310 align:middle line:90%
we are or were?

00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:20.530 align:middle line:84%
Do we make up our
own minds about that?

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:22.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: No, I think
that's determined,

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:25.270 align:middle line:90%
George, at a higher level.

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:28.570 align:middle line:84%
It's determined when
our soul is conceived.

00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:30.670 align:middle line:90%
But we don't make that choice.

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:34.860 align:middle line:84%
Because when that determination
of which type of soul we are

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:40.620 align:middle line:84%
is made, we are not yet
evolved to the point as a soul

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:43.320 align:middle line:84%
that we're able to
make that decision.

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:48.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who steps in
and says, this soul

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:50.140 align:middle line:90%
is going to take this direction.

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:51.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yeah, good question.

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:58.210 align:middle line:84%
Source, a higher
perspective, a higher wisdom.

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:03.540 align:middle line:84%
The universe has a
system of coordination

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:08.830 align:middle line:84%
that does not necessarily fit
with a particular religion,

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:12.610 align:middle line:84%
but does fit with the
notion of God, source.

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:16.590 align:middle line:84%
So a higher wisdom
is encouraging

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:21.040 align:middle line:84%
our universe, and specifically
humanity, to grow and evolve.

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some people that are
born with gifts, musically

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:29.130 align:middle line:84%
inclined, professionally
sports inclined, they've just

00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:33.510 align:middle line:84%
got these innate abilities that
parents say, where did this

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:35.370 align:middle line:90%
come from?

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:37.000 align:middle line:90%
Where does it come from?

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Sometimes past lives.

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes skills, an artistic
skill, for example, someone--

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:46.290 align:middle line:84%
I can think of people
I've worked with who

00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:49.210 align:middle line:90%
have phenomenal artistic skill.

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:51.520 align:middle line:84%
They may not make
their living using it,

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.150 align:middle line:84%
but we often then tap
into their past lives

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:59.380 align:middle line:84%
and discover they were capably
artistic in a past life.

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a committee
of souls that determines

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:06.130 align:middle line:90%
what soul goes into what body?

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Yes, that's
determined by spiritual guides.

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: That's determined
by the more evolved

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:17.960 align:middle line:84%
we are as a soul, the more
we contribute to that plan.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
happened to free will?

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, that's
a piece of free will.

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:24.160 align:middle line:84%
In other words, when
we're planning a life

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:29.140 align:middle line:84%
before a life begins, we
basically sit down and almost--

00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:31.600 align:middle line:84%
think about it in a
human way at a conference

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.370 align:middle line:90%
table with our guides.

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And the more evolved
we are as a soul,

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:39.790 align:middle line:84%
our guides may say, OK,
George, OK, Linda, you're

00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:41.390 align:middle line:90%
going to incarnate again.

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:44.090 align:middle line:84%
So we're planning your
upcoming incarnation.

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:45.650 align:middle line:90%
What do you want to work on?

00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:48.590 align:middle line:84%
What do you think needs to
be balanced from the past?

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:51.260 align:middle line:84%
How do you want to
assist humanity?

00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:53.660 align:middle line:84%
What do you want
your life to look at?

00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:57.410 align:middle line:90%
And so it's a conferencing.

00:40:57.410 --> 00:41:02.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a discussion and decision
making jointly with our guides.

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Archangels and the
higher authority of an archangel

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:08.758 align:middle line:90%
comes from where?

00:41:08.758 --> 00:41:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: It comes from
source, comes from the divine,

00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:12.880 align:middle line:90%
comes from God.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:15.320 align:middle line:90%
And I have come across--

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:16.880 align:middle line:90%
maybe this will be helpful.

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Many times in regression
I'm seeking to understand,

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:22.430 align:middle line:90%
so what is the divine?

00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:25.160 align:middle line:90%
What does source mean?

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:28.600 align:middle line:84%
My understanding at this point,
from repetitive regressions,

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.510 align:middle line:90%
is that source is a group of--

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:38.930 align:middle line:84%
it's a group soul of more than
one soul that is highly evolved,

00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:42.580 align:middle line:84%
that seeks source that
guides humanity, that

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:46.570 align:middle line:84%
seeks to guide our
human world to higher

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:52.150 align:middle line:84%
levels of appropriate
behavior, evolution, equality

00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:56.900 align:middle line:84%
of all people, equal
treatment of animals, plants.

00:41:56.900 --> 00:42:01.745 align:middle line:84%
So source is a group soul
based on my understanding.

00:42:01.745 --> 00:42:03.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how does
an individual determine

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:05.390 align:middle line:90%
what kind of soul they have?

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:07.710 align:middle line:84%
By going to a
regressionist like you?

00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:08.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Almost always when I
guide a regression,

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:14.130 align:middle line:84%
the client will learn,
are they Earth-based?

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:15.690 align:middle line:90%
Are they interplanetary?

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:16.860 align:middle line:90%
Are they angelic?

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
a true difference?

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Yes, there's
a difference in what

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:23.910 align:middle line:90%
I call gifts and skills.

00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:27.920 align:middle line:10%
So there's a difference in
often an interplanetary soul

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:32.090 align:middle line:10%
and an angelic soul, because
they don't come to Earth over

00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:33.300 align:middle line:10%
and over and over.

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:36.690 align:middle line:10%
They often have a harder
time being in body on Earth

00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:40.460 align:middle line:10%
and need to accept themselves
and understand why they're

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:43.850 align:middle line:10%
different, why they're
unique, and understand

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:48.980 align:middle line:10%
physical issues they might have,
allergies, dietary issues that

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:52.250 align:middle line:10%
stem from being--

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:54.750 align:middle line:10%
stem from not being Earth-based.

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:58.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If we have dreams
of different planets,

00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:02.510 align:middle line:84%
does that mean we may have
been an interplanetary soul?

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Yes,
that does mean that.

00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:07.100 align:middle line:84%
And often, since
you're asking that,

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:11.490 align:middle line:84%
often when I meet a new client
and before I guide regression,

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:14.130 align:middle line:84%
the client says things to
me during the interview.

00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:18.920 align:middle line:84%
The client may say, if they're
interplanetary, they may say,

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:23.480 align:middle line:84%
Linda, as a child, every time it
was night time, even as a three

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:25.200 align:middle line:84%
and a four and a
five-year-old child,

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:27.590 align:middle line:84%
I would stare out the
window at the night sky

00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:30.180 align:middle line:90%
and wish I was out there.

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:34.190 align:middle line:84%
An Earth-based soul doesn't
usually tell me that.

00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:36.568 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Linda, thanks for
being on Beyond Belief.

00:43:36.568 --> 00:43:37.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: My pleasure, George.

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:39.885 align:middle line:84%
It's been wonderful to
be here with you again.

00:43:39.885 --> 00:43:41.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't know
what kind of soul I am,

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.930 align:middle line:84%
but I suspect I'm an
interplanetary soul because I've

00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:49.260 align:middle line:84%
been fascinated all my life
with the stars in the heavens.

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:51.980 align:middle line:84%
I may do a session one
day with Linda Backman

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:53.850 align:middle line:90%
and find out for sure.

00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
Beyond Belief.
