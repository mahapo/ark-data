00:00:24.298 --> 00:00:26.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.650 align:middle line:10%
And this program will be a very
heart warming program for you.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.100 align:middle line:10%
After a four year battle with
that dreaded disease, cancer,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.010 align:middle line:10%
Anita Moorjani fell
into a coma and was

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.780 align:middle line:10%
given just days to live.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.600 align:middle line:84%
As her doctors gathered
to try to revive her,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.027 align:middle line:84%
something magnificent
happened to her

00:00:44.027 --> 00:00:45.860 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to have
her tell that story.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Anita, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ANITA MOORJANI:
Thank you so much.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go
back a little bit,

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.530 align:middle line:84%
if it's not too painful for
you, to tell us what happened.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.080 align:middle line:84%
How did doctors
diagnose your cancer

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.900 align:middle line:84%
and then how did
you react to them?

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: So I was
dealing with lymphoma.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.640 align:middle line:84%
It started with just a
lump on my neck and over--

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.920 align:middle line:84%
and it was diagnosed
as lymphoma.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.950 align:middle line:84%
At the time they diagnosed
it, it was stage two.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.560 align:middle line:10%
But over a period
of four years, I

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.150 align:middle line:10%
tried many different
modalities to try and heal it.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.950 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.410 align:middle line:10%
>>MOORJANI: At first I was
against the chemotherapy

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.780 align:middle line:10%
and I wanted to go
for alternative.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.230 align:middle line:10%
But the doctors kept pushing
me towards chemotherapy.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.410 align:middle line:84%
But everything I
tried wasn't working.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was so afraid
of this cancer.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.000 align:middle line:90%
I feared cancer.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.840 align:middle line:84%
I feared-- I feared the
treatments for cancer.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.160 align:middle line:90%
And I feared death.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.060 align:middle line:84%
So I was living in this
constant state of fear.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.940 align:middle line:84%
As I was trying all the
alternative modalities,

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.780 align:middle line:84%
I was really paranoid
about what I was eating,

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.830 align:middle line:84%
and what I was ingesting,
and what I was doing.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:53.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: It was like
a really fearful time.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And it felt as though things
would work for a little while

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.930 align:middle line:90%
and then it wouldn't work.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.020 align:middle line:90%
And so the cancer progressed.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And it started in
2002, and by 2005, I

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.190 align:middle line:84%
decided I'll go for
the chemotherapy.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And so when they
did the test on me,

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.340 align:middle line:90%
they said that it's too late.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.650 align:middle line:84%
Even for the chemotherapy,
it's too late.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, gosh.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: And they gave
me the chemotherapy anyway.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.410 align:middle line:84%
But what most people said was
that this is just going to--

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.270 align:middle line:90%
your body can't even handle it.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.560 align:middle line:90%
It's too weak.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.400 align:middle line:84%
What ended up happening, though,
is that I went into a coma.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.410 align:middle line:84%
But I just want to
describe at this point,

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.580 align:middle line:90%
this was February 2006--

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: And the condition
of my physical body.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.140 align:middle line:84%
What had started out
as a lump on my neck,

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.110 align:middle line:84%
now, because it had
spread and metastasized

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.160 align:middle line:84%
throughout my lymphatic system,
I had tumors, some of them

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.337 align:middle line:90%
the size of golf balls--

00:02:53.337 --> 00:02:54.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my God.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: From the base of
my skull, all around my neck,

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.330 align:middle line:90%
under my arms.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was in your
blood system, wasn't it?

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:01.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.160 align:middle line:90%
It was everywhere.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.350 align:middle line:90%
It was in my--

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.650 align:middle line:84%
and the tumors were in my
chest and in all the way

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:07.550 align:middle line:90%
down to my abdomen.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.350 align:middle line:90%
All around.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they
all malignant?

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: All malignant.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.712 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, also, my
lungs were filled with fluid.

00:03:16.712 --> 00:03:18.170 align:middle line:84%
They would develop
fluid, which had

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.415 align:middle line:84%
to be drained every
two to three weeks,

00:03:20.415 --> 00:03:22.040 align:middle line:84%
and then they would
fill up with fluid.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or you'd get pneumonia.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.555 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:03:23.555 --> 00:03:24.847 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or that would get you.

00:03:24.847 --> 00:03:28.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: And I was breathing
with the aid of oxygen

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.870 align:middle line:84%
because I was, like, out
of breath all the time.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.930 align:middle line:84%
My body stopped
absorbing nutrition,

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.190 align:middle line:90%
so I weighed about 85 pounds.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: I was
like a skeleton.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.273 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So you were near death?

00:03:41.273 --> 00:03:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: I was
literally near death

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.370 align:middle line:84%
even before I went
into the coma.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.080 align:middle line:90%
And I was--

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.010 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't walk.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.800 align:middle line:84%
So my mobility came in
the form of a wheelchair.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.920 align:middle line:84%
When I would lie down,
I would choke because

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.300 align:middle line:90%
of the fluid in my lungs.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my God.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: And so on
February 2, I went into a coma

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.970 align:middle line:90%
because my organs shut down.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.530 align:middle line:84%
That was when the doctors
actually said to my family

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.550 align:middle line:84%
that I won't even make
it through the night.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:09.550 align:middle line:90%
They said I won't even--

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You won't even revive?

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: I won't even
revive from the coma.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.020 align:middle line:84%
I won't even make it
through the night.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.260 align:middle line:84%
But unbeknownst to
everyone around me,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.050 align:middle line:84%
while I was in the
coma, that was when

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.650 align:middle line:90%
I felt that I had left my body.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
that experience.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: So what
happened was that--

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you aware
you were in a coma?

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: I was aware that--

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.020 align:middle line:84%
I actually was aware that I
was dying, but not immediately.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.970 align:middle line:84%
I started to actually feel
like the pain was gone.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened
is literally the night

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.070 align:middle line:84%
before I went into a
coma, I was feeling

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.788 align:middle line:84%
in so much pain, so much
discomfort, so much fear.

00:04:53.788 --> 00:04:54.830 align:middle line:90%
Because I couldn't sleep.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.740 align:middle line:84%
If I slept, I
would start choking

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.740 align:middle line:90%
and it would wake me up.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.698 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's horrible.

00:04:58.698 --> 00:05:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: It
was just horrible.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And then, I had been
fighting for four years.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.980 align:middle line:90%
Fighting the cancer.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.450 align:middle line:90%
Fighting to stay alive.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.790 align:middle line:84%
But I had reached a point
where it felt like this

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.570 align:middle line:90%
wasn't worth fighting for.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.720 align:middle line:84%
I knew death couldn't
be worse than this.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.490 align:middle line:84%
So I felt as though
I just surrendered.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:15.290 align:middle line:90%
I just gave up.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:16.090 align:middle line:90%
I surrendered.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.790 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, take me.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:18.590 align:middle line:90%
Literally, I--

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:19.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You were ready to go?

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: I was ready to go.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.110 align:middle line:84%
I said it's not worth
living like this.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.660 align:middle line:90%
I was ready to go.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.990 align:middle line:84%
I fell asleep when
I surrendered.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.760 align:middle line:84%
But I think from sleep
I went into this coma.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I know
I went into the coma

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.320 align:middle line:84%
was because that's
when I left my body.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So when you're in
this out of body experience--

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Your body's in a coma?

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're floating above.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.230 align:middle line:90%
Are you looking at that body?

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.030 align:middle line:90%
I could see that body.

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it didn't feel
like I was an entity.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.700 align:middle line:90%
It felt like I was bigger.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:56.225 align:middle line:84%
And it was like I had 360
degree peripheral vision.

00:05:56.225 --> 00:05:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you think you
were dead at that point?

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: I did.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You did.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: I thought my
physical body was dead.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.300 align:middle line:90%
I could see my body.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.285 align:middle line:84%
I could see my family,
my mom, my husband.

00:06:06.285 --> 00:06:07.410 align:middle line:90%
I could see them gathered--

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:07.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gathered around you--

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.475 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Gathered around.

00:06:08.475 --> 00:06:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Crying and
everything else?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Crying.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:10.410 align:middle line:90%
And the doctors.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And I heard the doctors
tell my husband that--

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.317 align:middle line:84%
that she-- that her
organs have now shut down

00:06:17.317 --> 00:06:18.900 align:middle line:84%
and she's not going
to come out of it.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, you were dying.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yeah.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were-- the dying
process is under way for you.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.888 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the doctors
were making clear to my family.

00:06:25.888 --> 00:06:27.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long were
you in this coma type?

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: About 30 hours.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of human hours.

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Human hours.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:33.373 align:middle line:90%
It was 30 human hours.

00:06:33.373 --> 00:06:35.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our dear
friend, Raymond Moody,

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.610 align:middle line:84%
who is an expert researcher
on near-death experiences,

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.792 align:middle line:84%
was on the Gaia
series, "Legacy."

00:06:40.792 --> 00:06:42.120 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.920 align:middle line:10%
>>RAYMOND MOODY:
Near-death experiences

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.940 align:middle line:10%
are a common pattern
of conscious experience

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.600 align:middle line:10%
that occurs to people who
are on the verge of death.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.630 align:middle line:10%
For example, in a
cardiac arrest from which

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.060 align:middle line:10%
they are resuscitated.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.480 align:middle line:10%
And basically, they
consist of elements that

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.850 align:middle line:10%
are common all over the world.

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:06.160 align:middle line:10%
Not every person has
all of the elements.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.670 align:middle line:10%
But among the things
that people say

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:12.900 align:middle line:10%
are that they hear the doctors
say something like, oh, my god.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.010 align:middle line:10%
He's dead.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.380 align:middle line:10%
Or we've lost her.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.020 align:middle line:10%
Which is very surprising
to them because they

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:23.820 align:middle line:10%
say that I have never felt
so alive as when I heard

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.820 align:middle line:10%
that doctor say I was dead.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.400 align:middle line:10%
Because from their
point of view,

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.370 align:middle line:10%
they feel that they
distance themselves

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.710 align:middle line:10%
from their physical
body and they

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.020 align:middle line:10%
watch the scene of
the resuscitation

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.200 align:middle line:10%
typically from the
point of view above it.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.590 align:middle line:10%
As this progresses, they
eventually wake up to the fact

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:47.220 align:middle line:10%
that, oh, this must be
something to do with death.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.520 align:middle line:10%
And at that point, they enter
into states of consciousness

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.790 align:middle line:10%
that, no matter how
articulate they may be,

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:55.950 align:middle line:10%
they say there are
no words for it.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:08:00.420 align:middle line:10%
That it's ineffable
or indescribable.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:04.650 align:middle line:10%
They go through a passageway
into a beautiful light.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.810 align:middle line:10%
They feel comfort,
peace, and joy.

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:10.980 align:middle line:10%
They meet relatives and friends
of theirs who have died.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.710 align:middle line:10%
And they go through
panoramic memory,

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:16.110 align:middle line:10%
in which everything
they've ever done

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:17.850 align:middle line:10%
is displayed around
them in a sort

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:21.450 align:middle line:10%
of holographic
three-dimensional panorama.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:24.510 align:middle line:10%
And they come back
from these experiences

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.360 align:middle line:10%
with a total new take
on life, thinking

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.420 align:middle line:10%
that the most important thing
we can do while we're here

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.580 align:middle line:10%
is to learn how to love.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.640 align:middle line:10%
And saying that they have
no more fear of death

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.490 align:middle line:10%
because they feel that
death is just a transition

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:41.307 align:middle line:10%
into some other reality.

00:08:41.307 --> 00:08:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that what
happened to you Anita?

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:43.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yeah.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.900 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing when I hear that.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.040 align:middle line:90%
I think, wow.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You get chills?

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: I get chills
because it's like, wow, somebody

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:51.560 align:middle line:90%
understands me.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And I've met Raymond
Moody and it was--

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:54.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great guy.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yeah.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.040 align:middle line:90%
He's such a great guy.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:01.740 align:middle line:84%
But when I was out of my body,
I felt so free and light,

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.170 align:middle line:84%
and all the pain was gone,
and the fear was gone.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:06.960 align:middle line:90%
It just felt amazing.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And I felt powerful
and magnificent.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And I could see my physical
body lying on the bed,

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.550 align:middle line:84%
and my physical body looked
so small and insignificant

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:18.900 align:middle line:90%
compared to how I was feeling.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
were in this state,

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.940 align:middle line:84%
did you notice other
entities around you

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:24.960 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that?

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:25.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.340 align:middle line:84%
I felt I was greeted
by other entities who--

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.140 align:middle line:84%
it felt like they were there
to help me to cross over.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't recognize all
of them, but one of them

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:38.670 align:middle line:84%
was my dad who had passed
away 10 years prior to that.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And it was really amazing
connecting with my dad.

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Because when I was
growing up, I had

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.060 align:middle line:84%
a very turbulent
relationship with my dad.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:51.030 align:middle line:84%
But here on the other
side, all I felt from him

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.010 align:middle line:90%
was pure, unconditional love.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dramatic.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yeah.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In that
state, these 30 hours

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.810 align:middle line:84%
that you were in,
what did you learn

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:01.160 align:middle line:90%
when you finally came back?

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And tell me about that
experience being rammed back

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.000 align:middle line:90%
into your body.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.600 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.610 align:middle line:90%
Somebody call you?

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:08.460 align:middle line:90%
Somebody send you?

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:09.260 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: My dad sent
me back from that side.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.550 align:middle line:90%
He told me it wasn't my time.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.100 align:middle line:90%
He said that I still had gift--

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.570 align:middle line:90%
I had things to do.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.000 align:middle line:84%
He said I had not
completed my purpose

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.148 align:middle line:90%
and I needed to go back.

00:10:21.148 --> 00:10:22.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah, interesting.

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: But I didn't want
to come back because it was so--

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's bliss, isn't it?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: I mean, it
was bliss and my body

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.430 align:middle line:90%
was dying of cancer.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who wants to be
put back into that, right?

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Exactly.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:36.770 align:middle line:84%
But that's when I started
to learn the lessons.

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:41.660 align:middle line:84%
I realized that we are
much more powerful than we

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.310 align:middle line:90%
have been led to believe.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.520 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like it's been
conditioned out of us when

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.080 align:middle line:90%
we're in the physical.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And I realized my dad--
it was like my dad wanted

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.560 align:middle line:84%
me to know that now that you
know the truth of who you

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:58.760 align:middle line:84%
really are, you need to go back
and live your life fearlessly

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.950 align:middle line:84%
and your body will
heal dramatically.

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So when you come
back into this stage four

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.480 align:middle line:90%
cancer-riddened body--

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yeah.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:07.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did you feel?

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And did you come out
of the coma at all?

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.083 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: So I
came out of the coma,

00:11:11.083 --> 00:11:13.010 align:middle line:84%
literally I started
coming out of the coma.

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:17.670 align:middle line:84%
What it felt like in
linear or human time,

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:23.930 align:middle line:84%
it felt like that as soon as I
made the decision to come back,

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:27.680 align:middle line:84%
it felt like I came out of the
coma within minutes after that.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.890 align:middle line:90%
And as I came out--

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:29.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But still
with stage four cancer?

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:31.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Still with
stage four cancer.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.690 align:middle line:90%
So my body was critical.

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:36.710 align:middle line:84%
But as I opened my eyes,
and my family was there,

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:40.130 align:middle line:84%
and my brother had
flown in from India

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:43.990 align:middle line:84%
because he heard I was
dying, and so he codified.

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.847 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:11:44.847 --> 00:11:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Exactly.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.610 align:middle line:90%
So he was there.

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And I just started
saying to my family,

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.720 align:middle line:90%
I said, I'm not going to die.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.780 align:middle line:90%
It's not my time.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:52.580 align:middle line:90%
Dad is here.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:53.780 align:middle line:90%
Dad told me.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.270 align:middle line:84%
They all thought
I was delirious.

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:57.800 align:middle line:90%
And so they called the doctor.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor said, yes, she's
just-- it's just the drugs.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.910 align:middle line:90%
It's messing with her mind.

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She's close to going.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: She's
close to going.

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:06.070 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:10.550 align:middle line:84%
So he made sure to not
let my family raise

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:13.833 align:middle line:84%
their hopes because he was
so sure that I was dying.

00:12:13.833 --> 00:12:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you already
proved them wrong on one thing.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:18.320 align:middle line:84%
When they said you'd never
come out of the coma.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:18.635 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Exactly.

00:12:18.635 --> 00:12:19.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you'd be dead.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.100 align:middle line:84%
You were still alive and
you came out of the coma.

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.558 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: I came
out of the coma,

00:12:23.558 --> 00:12:25.530 align:middle line:84%
but he was still there
saying, she's delirious.

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:26.330 align:middle line:90%
She's delirious.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.610 align:middle line:90%
She's still critical.

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:33.110 align:middle line:84%
But what blew him away, was
then I said to this doctor,

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:36.080 align:middle line:84%
I said, didn't you take
fluid out of my lungs

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.370 align:middle line:90%
at 5:00 this morning?

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:38.930 align:middle line:90%
Aren't you the one who did that?

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:40.430 align:middle line:90%
And he said, how do you know?

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:41.930 align:middle line:90%
You were in a coma.

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:44.607 align:middle line:84%
I was able to see and hear
everything that was going--

00:12:44.607 --> 00:12:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As Raymond
Moody pointed out.

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:46.445 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yeah.

00:12:46.445 --> 00:12:47.737 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You feel those things.

00:12:47.737 --> 00:12:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: And as I started
to like recall, tell them.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:53.120 align:middle line:84%
Tell everyone the
conversations that

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.260 align:middle line:84%
were taking place, that's
when they started to realize

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.230 align:middle line:90%
something had happened.

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:02.930 align:middle line:84%
But what happened is
that after four days,

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:04.370 align:middle line:90%
I was wanting to sit up.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.745 align:middle line:84%
I was wanting to take out
the tubes that were in me.

00:13:06.745 --> 00:13:08.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
feeling better?

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.495 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: I was
feeling better.

00:13:09.495 --> 00:13:10.412 align:middle line:90%
I was still very weak.

00:13:10.412 --> 00:13:11.212 align:middle line:90%
I still--

00:13:11.212 --> 00:13:12.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And still stage four?

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: So in four
days, they took tests.

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:18.620 align:middle line:84%
Actually, by the fifth
day, they took tests

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:22.190 align:middle line:84%
and they found that the
tumors had shrunk by 60%.

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.278 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In four days?

00:13:23.278 --> 00:13:24.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: In four days.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.540 align:middle line:90%
And they could not explain it.

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:30.393 align:middle line:84%
The doctor who was
treating me was blown away.

00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:32.810 align:middle line:84%
He said, I don't even know
what to write in your medical--

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They've never
seen anything like this.

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: They
thought they'd made

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.170 align:middle line:90%
a mistake with the records.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:39.440 align:middle line:84%
They thought they had brought
the wrong medical records

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.157 align:middle line:90%
to compare.

00:13:41.157 --> 00:13:42.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
think the mistake was

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:45.320 align:middle line:84%
made on the first time when
they called you stage four

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.488 align:middle line:84%
or on the second time when
they said it was gone?

00:13:47.488 --> 00:13:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Well,
actually, what happened--

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:49.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In remission.

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:52.345 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: So what happened
was that when-- they send me

00:13:52.345 --> 00:13:54.710 align:middle line:90%
to the lab, to the radiologist.

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And so the radiologist doesn't
have a relationship with me

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:00.110 align:middle line:90%
and he's just taking the test.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's just
looking at numbers.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.555 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: And he's
just looking at numbers.

00:14:02.555 --> 00:14:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And he's-- and I could hear him
calling my oncologist and said,

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:08.448 align:middle line:84%
have you sent me
the right records?

00:14:08.448 --> 00:14:09.248 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:14:09.248 --> 00:14:11.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Because when
he made the comparison,

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:12.480 align:middle line:90%
he said this is not--

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is not
a stage four person.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Exactly.

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And were
you alert then?

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:18.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: I was alert.

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:23.480 align:middle line:84%
I was-- and over the days,
over the next three weeks,

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.610 align:middle line:84%
my work was to build
up my physical stamina.

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Because I now had to build my
strength up and my muscles up

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:30.470 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:32.012 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Anita, did
you know what was

00:14:32.012 --> 00:14:33.810 align:middle line:90%
happening to you at this point?

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:37.580 align:middle line:84%
The fact that the cancer was
going away, was in remission.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.120 align:middle line:90%
You were getting better.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Were you aware that
you were doing this?

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:42.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Because what
actually happened is

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:48.710 align:middle line:84%
that as soon as I came out
of the near-death state,

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:54.630 align:middle line:84%
I understood that cancer is not
a physical disease of the body.

00:14:54.630 --> 00:15:00.060 align:middle line:84%
It was, for me, it was a
disease from the level of my,

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.400 align:middle line:84%
I guess, from my soul
and my consciousness,

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:06.930 align:middle line:84%
where I had never allowed
myself to express myself.

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:10.650 align:middle line:84%
I'd never known how
smart our bodies were.

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:11.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dramatic.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:12.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yeah.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And so now I knew that
I was already healed,

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.510 align:middle line:84%
but my body just
had to catch up.

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dr. Randy Veitenheimer
was on "The Quantum Effect",

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:25.110 align:middle line:84%
the Gaia show, talking
about the aspects of death.

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:26.555 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:26.555 --> 00:15:28.430 align:middle line:10%
>>RANDY VEITENHEIMER:
Your physical existence

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:33.530 align:middle line:10%
is a form of the formless in
Chinese philosophy and Taoism.

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:36.240 align:middle line:10%
Your death is the loss
of the physical form,

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:40.400 align:middle line:10%
but not the essence of
you, which is life itself,

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.590 align:middle line:10%
our being.

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:46.760 align:middle line:10%
Life is an expanding
state of awareness.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:51.690 align:middle line:10%
Death is an evolving
expression of growth.

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:56.630 align:middle line:10%
Both are marked by emergence,
life into physical awareness,

00:15:56.630 --> 00:16:01.060 align:middle line:10%
and death into universal
or infinite awareness.

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:04.720 align:middle line:10%
Life is an imminent
state of being.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.810 align:middle line:10%
Death is a transcended
state of being.

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:09.610 align:middle line:10%
So it is zero reality.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:19.210 align:middle line:90%


00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:22.410 align:middle line:10%
So we go from a transcendent
non-physical state

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:27.000 align:middle line:10%
of being-ness,
basically essence,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.250 align:middle line:10%
to an imminent and present
state of existence physicality.

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:36.940 align:middle line:10%
And then we go back to a
transcendent non-physical state

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:37.740 align:middle line:10%
of being.

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:40.460 align:middle line:10%


00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:45.790 align:middle line:10%
You are always in a state of
being and a state of beginning.

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:48.118 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't change.

00:16:48.118 --> 00:16:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
of what he just said, Anita?

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:52.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Oh,
it rings so true.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It does.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: It does, totally.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.806 align:middle line:90%
And it's beautiful to see--

00:16:56.806 --> 00:17:02.260 align:middle line:84%
to see things like that
kind of endorse or that

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.890 align:middle line:84%
say what I'm trying to say,
and he puts it very elegantly.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:10.029 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now today, what would
you say about your cancer?

00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:10.829 align:middle line:90%
Gone?

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:12.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Gone.

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 100%?

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.240 align:middle line:84%
Because five weeks
after I came out

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.550 align:middle line:84%
of the near-death
experience, the doctors

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:21.970 align:middle line:84%
tried to do every test
possible because they

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:23.589 align:middle line:90%
couldn't believe it was gone.

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:25.030 align:middle line:90%
They could find no trace of it.

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:28.270 align:middle line:84%
They even said, cancer
doesn't disappear like that.

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:30.550 align:middle line:84%
We got to keep looking
till we find it.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:34.600 align:middle line:84%
But five weeks after the
NDE, they sent me home

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.460 align:middle line:90%
to live my life cancer-free.

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:41.320 align:middle line:84%
That was in March of
2006 and today it's 2019.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did they say?

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:45.700 align:middle line:84%
What did they think
when they realized

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:47.980 align:middle line:84%
that you've gone
from a stage four

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:51.050 align:middle line:90%
to zero in a matter of weeks?

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: So there was
a lot of mixed reactions.

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:57.010 align:middle line:84%
Most of them were really
shocked and blown away

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:59.270 align:middle line:84%
and didn't know
what to make of it.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they
arguing with each other?

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:01.987 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: They were.

00:18:01.987 --> 00:18:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You gave us the
wrong report or something?

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: They
were wondering even

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:07.600 align:middle line:90%
like when they first staged it.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.060 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, even
the staging of it,

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.200 align:middle line:90%
it was a progression.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.870 align:middle line:84%
I had had so many
tests in the four

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:16.670 align:middle line:90%
years since being diagnosed.

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:18.310 align:middle line:84%
So they couldn't
argue with that.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:20.470 align:middle line:84%
There were different
doctors that had treated me.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:22.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they all
said the same thing.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: And they'd
all said the same thing.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
doctors, my oncologist

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:31.030 align:middle line:84%
at that time, I shared
with him that I had the NDE

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:32.950 align:middle line:90%
and he completely believed me.

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:34.600 align:middle line:90%
He said, you're not the only--

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.630 align:middle line:84%
you're not the first person I've
heard something like this from.

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:40.030 align:middle line:90%
What was interesting was that--

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:43.210 align:middle line:84%
then, because people
started talking about me

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:45.870 align:middle line:84%
and I became a little
bit of talk of the--

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:47.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A little
myth and legend?

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.320 align:middle line:84%
A bit of a legend in
the city where I lived.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And so then newspaper came
and did an interview on me,

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:55.750 align:middle line:90%
a journalist interviewed me.

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And then she said to me,
would your oncologist

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.310 align:middle line:84%
back you up if I
interviewed your oncologist?

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:02.410 align:middle line:90%
And I said, sure, he will.

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:03.593 align:middle line:90%
He completely believed me.

00:19:03.593 --> 00:19:04.510 align:middle line:90%
He knew what happened.

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:04.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: But when she
interviewed my oncologist,

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.770 align:middle line:90%
he didn't completely back me up.

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:10.570 align:middle line:90%
He sort of--

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was afraid
of public ridicule.

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: He was afraid
of public ridicule.

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:15.820 align:middle line:84%
Since then, people
have said to me

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:18.400 align:middle line:84%
that if he was
seen as a quack, he

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.998 align:middle line:84%
would have had his license,
his medical license, revoked.

00:19:20.998 --> 00:19:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was
his excuse, though?

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:23.410 align:middle line:90%
What did he say?

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:24.660 align:middle line:90%
He had to admit it was gone.

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:26.327 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Oh, he
admitted it was gone.

00:19:26.327 --> 00:19:29.410 align:middle line:84%
He admitted it was a
spontaneous remission

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:31.540 align:middle line:84%
and that I was
lucky to be alive.

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:35.650 align:middle line:84%
But the-- everything
I attributed it to,

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:37.600 align:middle line:90%
he said it was my mind.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:41.330 align:middle line:84%
He didn't think that I had
experienced what I experienced.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's saying that
there's a medical reason why

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:45.920 align:middle line:90%
your body fought this off.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:46.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It doesn't
happen in every case.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:48.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:49.842 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But it happened.

00:19:49.842 --> 00:19:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that you had
a near-death experience,

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.860 align:middle line:84%
and it's something mystical
that helped heal you--

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:55.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:56.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He wasn't
going to go there.

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:58.557 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: He wasn't
going to go there.

00:19:58.557 --> 00:20:01.840 align:middle line:84%
Even though he could not
explain how it disappeared.

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Other oncologists who were
not related to my case,

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:07.540 align:middle line:84%
who later studied
my medical records,

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:10.030 align:middle line:84%
said that whichever
way they look at it,

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:11.410 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't be alive.

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:14.590 align:middle line:84%
Because there was no way
those billions of cancer cells

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:16.198 align:middle line:84%
could have left my
body so quickly.

00:20:16.198 --> 00:20:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have
any idea how you

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:19.450 align:middle line:90%
got this in the first place?

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: How
I got the cancer?

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:22.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I do.

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:26.320 align:middle line:10%
I feel that-- so it goes
a little bit to a lot

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.240 align:middle line:10%
of the things that
I learned while,

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:32.440 align:middle line:10%
or what I realized in that
state of being in the NDE,

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.020 align:middle line:10%
I realized that actually--

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:38.280 align:middle line:10%
I think all of us, but
certainly a lot of us,

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.160 align:middle line:10%
we're actually not just five
sensory physical beings.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.690 align:middle line:90%
We are more than that.

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:47.430 align:middle line:84%
We are-- I'll call it
six sensory beings,

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:49.180 align:middle line:84%
for want of a better
term, because there's

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.320 align:middle line:90%
no language to describe this.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.790 align:middle line:84%
But we know our soul
comes here with a calling

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:57.100 align:middle line:84%
and we know there's
something more to life

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.070 align:middle line:84%
than just this physical
life, this world we live in,

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.740 align:middle line:84%
this competitiveness
dog-eat-dog world.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.810 align:middle line:84%
Actually, internally, our soul
knows there's something more.

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:06.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure does.

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: But we suppress it.

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Because we're afraid
that if we explore it,

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:15.620 align:middle line:84%
we're termed as being crazy
or woo-woo or whatever.

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:18.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, I always knew there
was something more,

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:20.290 align:middle line:90%
but I always suppressed it.

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:24.460 align:middle line:84%
What I realized was that
because I had always

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:28.750 align:middle line:84%
suppressed who I
am, I had literally

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:30.010 align:middle line:90%
suppressed my own soul.

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:31.900 align:middle line:90%
But with me, it was--

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not everybody
gets cancer.

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:36.070 align:middle line:84%
But with me, there was a
lot more going on than that.

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
it was because--

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:42.020 align:middle line:84%
in my case, to do with,
maybe, my culture,

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:43.880 align:middle line:90%
with being an Indian woman.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.860 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
gender disparity.

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:48.800 align:middle line:90%
I had always made myself small.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.230 align:middle line:90%
I had always dimmed my light.

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- in the culture
I grew up in, a woman's--

00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:01.490 align:middle line:84%
a woman's worth, her value,
is dependent on how valuable

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:04.850 align:middle line:84%
she is to the men in her
community, in her life.

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:07.110 align:middle line:84%
So the smaller
you make yourself,

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:08.840 align:middle line:90%
the more you are rewarded.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And so I had always wanted
to do and be something more.

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:16.650 align:middle line:84%
I'd always wanted to be
independent, but I could--

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:19.490 align:middle line:90%
I'd always had to squash myself.

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And so it was a lifetime
of suppressing myself,

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:27.090 align:middle line:84%
and being a people
pleaser, and a doormat.

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And it was only when I
was on the other side

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.880 align:middle line:84%
that I realized I wasn't
supposed to do that.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.920 align:middle line:90%
That I have a lot to share.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.958 align:middle line:84%
That I'm supposed to
shine my light brightly.

00:22:35.958 --> 00:22:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got a
great story to tell people.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.660 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
caused the remission?

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:42.830 align:middle line:90%
Now that you look back.

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:47.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: The realization
that actually we are, all of us,

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.030 align:middle line:84%
are more powerful than
we realize, including me.

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:53.390 align:middle line:84%
I had made myself so
small and insignificant

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:58.040 align:middle line:84%
to the point of being invisible
that my body was crying out

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.440 align:middle line:84%
and that's why it
manifested disease.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't listen to it so
it kept manifesting disease.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:08.300 align:middle line:84%
But all of us are stronger and
more powerful than we believe.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:12.650 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are capable
of more than we have

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:14.270 align:middle line:90%
been conditioned to believe.

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:17.930 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like-- it feels to
me, this is just my opinion--

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:20.990 align:middle line:84%
it feels like we've
been dumbed down.

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And I know doctors are great
and the doctors I've dealt with

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:30.740 align:middle line:84%
were wonderful people, but I
think that our medical paradigm

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:34.370 align:middle line:84%
has dumbed down what our bodies
are actually capable of doing

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:37.520 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't take into
consideration that we're not

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.140 align:middle line:90%
just--

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.990 align:middle line:84%
we're not just three
dimensional physical bodies.

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:43.940 align:middle line:90%
We are a lot more than that.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And what determines
our health is actually

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:53.450 align:middle line:84%
more than just your
medical condition.

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:55.700 align:middle line:90%
It's your soul, your calling.

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.890 align:middle line:90%
It's your reason for living.

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:02.660 align:middle line:84%
The more passion you have for
life, the healthier you are.

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
your doctors are saying

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:08.510 align:middle line:84%
behind closed doors now,
or at a dinner table

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:09.908 align:middle line:90%
with friends, about you?

00:24:09.908 --> 00:24:11.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Oh, they
know it happened

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:13.140 align:middle line:90%
and they're questioning things.

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:15.770 align:middle line:84%
I had one of the doctors
who was treating me,

00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:18.770 align:middle line:84%
not the one that threw me
under the bus in the interview,

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:22.140 align:middle line:84%
but another one who was
treating me all the way through.

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:25.040 align:middle line:84%
He contacted me several
months ago and he said,

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:29.180 align:middle line:84%
I just need to tell you that
ever since your experience,

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.250 align:middle line:90%
I have never--

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:34.140 align:middle line:84%
he said it is completely
changed the way that I

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:34.940 align:middle line:90%
practice medicine.

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.095 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: And
he said, however,

00:24:37.095 --> 00:24:40.760 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't ready to completely
embrace it at that time

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.220 align:middle line:84%
because I would have
to throw out everything

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.960 align:middle line:90%
I learned in medical school.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:49.130 align:middle line:84%
He said he actually went through
a traumatic time of his own

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:52.670 align:middle line:90%
trying to reconcile everything.

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:56.450 align:middle line:84%
Because once he saw my
experience, you know,

00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:58.700 align:middle line:84%
it kind of opened
his eyes or his mind,

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.340 align:middle line:84%
he started seeing more
and more things like that.

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sadly, Anita,
not everybody gets healed.

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:08.240 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody has a
success story that you had.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.860 align:middle line:90%
Why you and not them?

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:12.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: So the first
thing I want to say

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:17.520 align:middle line:90%
is that death is not a failure.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:21.680 align:middle line:84%
People who pass on, if it's
their time, it's their time.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.340 align:middle line:84%
But also maybe at the
time, even if they

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.260 align:middle line:84%
get a glimpse of
the other side, I

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:29.570 align:middle line:84%
don't blame them for
wanting to stay there.

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:32.150 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean they don't
love the people here enough

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:34.850 align:middle line:84%
to not come back,
but it could mean

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:37.220 align:middle line:84%
that they can complete
their purpose in a bigger

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:41.620 align:middle line:84%
way from that state, that
state of transcendence,

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.000 align:middle line:84%
because death is a
state of transcendence.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.360 align:middle line:84%
If people have lost a
loved one, maybe they're

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:50.450 align:middle line:84%
the ones who are the lucky
ones, and me, who got sent back,

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:51.690 align:middle line:90%
maybe I'm the unlucky one.

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:52.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: And maybe they're
more transcended than I am.

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:56.360 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they've completed
their work here.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we all
have this ability

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:00.090 align:middle line:90%
to heal ourselves from within?

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:01.160 align:middle line:90%
In your opinion?

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: In my
opinion, I believe we do.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.290 align:middle line:84%
Unless it's our time
to pass, or unless we

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:10.020 align:middle line:84%
want to go over there because we
feel we can do more from there.

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:12.290 align:middle line:84%
But I think that if
we still have work

00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:14.090 align:middle line:90%
to do here, yes, absolutely.

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:18.350 align:middle line:84%
I believe our bodies are
far, far more powerful

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:20.592 align:middle line:84%
and has this really
strong ability

00:26:20.592 --> 00:26:22.550 align:middle line:84%
to heal more so than
we've been led to believe.

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:24.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dr. Joe
Dispenza of course,

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.170 align:middle line:84%
is an expert on this
area of self-healing

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:30.710 align:middle line:84%
and I had a chance to interview
him on "Beyond Belief."

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:33.020 align:middle line:10%
>>JOE DISPENZER: Can
you teach your body

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:36.080 align:middle line:10%
emotionally what that
future is going to feel

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.770 align:middle line:10%
like before it's made manifest?

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:40.020 align:middle line:10%
That means you can't
wait for your healing

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.030 align:middle line:10%
to feel gratitude and wholeness.

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:43.800 align:middle line:10%
You can't wait for
your wealth to feel

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.000 align:middle line:10%
abundance and worthiness.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.670 align:middle line:10%
You can't-- you can't wait for
the mystical moment to feel

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:48.470 align:middle line:10%
awe.

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:50.940 align:middle line:10%
That's the old model of
reality of cause and effect.

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:52.830 align:middle line:10%
That's Newtonian physics.

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:55.350 align:middle line:10%
But the new model of reality,
the quantum model of reality,

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:56.530 align:middle line:10%
is about causing an effect.

00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:59.072 align:middle line:10%
Which means the moment you start
feeling gratitude and whole,

00:26:59.072 --> 00:27:00.450 align:middle line:10%
your healing begins.

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:02.940 align:middle line:10%
The moment you start
feeling worthy and abundant,

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:04.380 align:middle line:10%
you're generating wealth.

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.390 align:middle line:10%
The moment you're
in awe of life,

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:08.730 align:middle line:10%
you're going to have
a mystical experience.

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:12.060 align:middle line:10%
So then, your body is
your unconscious mind.

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:15.570 align:middle line:10%
It does not know the difference
between an actual experience

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:18.240 align:middle line:10%
in your life that creates
an emotion and an emotion

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.350 align:middle line:10%
that you can create
by thought alone.

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:23.430 align:middle line:10%
So the body is believing it's
living in that future reality

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:24.690 align:middle line:10%
in the present moment.

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:26.190 align:middle line:10%
And what's the
significance of that?

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:28.980 align:middle line:10%
As I said, the latest
research in genetics

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.985 align:middle line:10%
says genes don't create disease.

00:27:31.985 --> 00:27:33.360 align:middle line:10%
It's the environment
that signals

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.850 align:middle line:10%
the gene that creates change.

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:38.520 align:middle line:10%
Well, if the end product of an
experience in the environment

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:42.405 align:middle line:10%
is an emotion, the moment you
embrace an elevated emotion,

00:27:42.405 --> 00:27:44.530 align:middle line:10%
you're signaling the gene
ahead of the environment.

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:45.840 align:middle line:10%
And what do genes do?

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:46.980 align:middle line:10%
Genes make proteins.

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.810 align:middle line:10%
And what are proteins
responsible for?

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:50.970 align:middle line:10%
The structure and
function of your body.

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:53.940 align:middle line:10%
And the expression of proteins
is the expression of life.

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:56.700 align:middle line:10%
And if you keep knocking on
that genetic door over and over

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.310 align:middle line:10%
again, you're going to
begin to up-regulate

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:00.950 align:middle line:10%
the genes for health,
and you're going

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:03.265 align:middle line:10%
to down-regulate the
genes for disease,

00:28:03.265 --> 00:28:05.640 align:middle line:10%
and all of a sudden you're
going to wake up in your dream

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.680 align:middle line:10%
and realize that you're
a different person.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:11.970 align:middle line:10%
And the personality now that had
the disease is no longer you.

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you a person
who would supplement and take

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:16.450 align:middle line:84%
vitamins, and minerals,
and things like that?

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:17.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:20.170 align:middle line:90%
I was someone who was paranoid.

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:24.540 align:middle line:84%
I truly believed that my
body needed intervention all

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:26.550 align:middle line:90%
the time to keep it healthy.

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And if I missed a
dose of supplements,

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:30.420 align:middle line:90%
I would get paranoid.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:31.050 align:middle line:90%
That's the person I used to be.

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:32.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm the same way.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:32.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yeah.

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a regimen
for me every morning.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.875 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: But the message
we're sending our bodies when

00:28:36.875 --> 00:28:39.810 align:middle line:84%
we're like that, we're sending
a message that my body isn't

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:42.990 align:middle line:84%
capable of being healthy
without me constantly

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:46.228 align:middle line:84%
being rigorous about
staying on top of my health.

00:28:46.228 --> 00:28:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, look at
your body as a car, Anita.

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And you may have
a beautiful car,

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.770 align:middle line:84%
but if you run it
into the ground,

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:54.390 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to
do you any good.

00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:55.500 align:middle line:90%
So you maintain it.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:56.520 align:middle line:90%
You take care of it.

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:57.690 align:middle line:90%
You change the oil.

00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:59.310 align:middle line:90%
You change the air filter.

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:01.260 align:middle line:90%
You tune it up once in a while.

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the same
way with the mental condition

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:07.170 align:middle line:84%
of your body and
supplementation.

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:10.950 align:middle line:84%
It's not a matter of you should
heal yourself without it.

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:14.400 align:middle line:84%
I think it just enhances
your ability to do that.

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.197 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: I agree
to a certain extent.

00:29:17.197 --> 00:29:18.030 align:middle line:90%
Because I actually--

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't throw
me under the bus.

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:20.460 align:middle line:90%
Not like the doctor did to you.

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:21.953 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:29:21.953 --> 00:29:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: I'm going
to agree with you.

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And yet I'm going to offer
you an alternative and see.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.795 align:middle line:84%
I agree that we need
to maintain our bodies.

00:29:30.795 --> 00:29:31.920 align:middle line:90%
We need to take care of it.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.570 align:middle line:90%
We need to love and cherish it.

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Because our body
is actually here

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:39.570 align:middle line:84%
as a channel for our higher
self, or soul, or divine,

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:40.930 align:middle line:90%
or whatever we want to call it.

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:41.730 align:middle line:90%
So it's a channel.

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:43.440 align:middle line:84%
You want to take
care of this channel.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:47.670 align:middle line:84%
But here's where we go
a little bit overboard.

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:50.860 align:middle line:84%
We become paranoid
about our health.

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:51.660 align:middle line:90%
That's not healthy.

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Some people do.

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:53.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Some people do.

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:56.440 align:middle line:84%
But as a culture, we've
started to become that way.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.080 align:middle line:90%
If you look at--

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:03.030 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the media, or
if you look at the internet,

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:05.940 align:middle line:84%
if you research
anything, you find all

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:07.680 align:middle line:90%
this contradicting information.

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And the way it's written, the
way it's presented to you,

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.290 align:middle line:84%
is presented in a
very fearful way.

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:15.750 align:middle line:84%
If you don't do this,
you're going to get cancer.

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:17.020 align:middle line:90%
This causes cancer.

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:18.330 align:middle line:90%
That causes cancer.

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:20.370 align:middle line:84%
So you have to take
all these supplements.

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:23.310 align:middle line:90%
That was me before I got cancer.

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:28.080 align:middle line:84%
I was doing everything I
could to prevent cancer,

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.670 align:middle line:90%
but where was my focus?

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:31.860 align:middle line:90%
My focus was on disease.

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:35.340 align:middle line:84%
My focus was not on living
life and maintaining

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:39.000 align:middle line:84%
my body from a place of
love and passion for life.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yet you cured
yourself, and I'm not

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:46.830 align:middle line:84%
sure you actually knew what you
were doing to cure yourself.

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying this
derogatorily, at all.

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:50.678 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Oh, I understand.

00:30:50.678 --> 00:30:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you came out of
the coma, your life changed.

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:54.690 align:middle line:90%
Your body changed.

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:57.210 align:middle line:90%
The cancer started going away.

00:30:57.210 --> 00:30:59.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you
consciously understood,

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:02.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to just think
about this and heal myself.

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:03.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: No.

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:04.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This just
happened for you.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.092 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: It did just happen.

00:31:06.092 --> 00:31:08.350 align:middle line:84%
In all fairness,
it did just happen.

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:11.640 align:middle line:84%
But if I were to
reverse engineer it,

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:16.470 align:middle line:84%
I can compare the person that
I used to be before the cancer

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:18.762 align:middle line:84%
to the person I became after
the near-death experience.

00:31:18.762 --> 00:31:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
a big difference?

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:21.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Huge difference.

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:22.920 align:middle line:90%
Huge difference.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:27.420 align:middle line:84%
The person I used to be was
a fearful, paranoid person

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:30.120 align:middle line:84%
who gave my power
away to everybody.

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:33.630 align:middle line:84%
The person that came out of
the near-death experience

00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:34.980 align:middle line:90%
was someone who knew.

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And even though it sounds like
I healed my cancer myself,

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:43.070 align:middle line:84%
it's not this physical
body that healed it.

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:46.540 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I am much
more than my physical body.

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if
you had helpers?

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:51.140 align:middle line:90%
What if you had guardian angels?

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:51.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: I did.

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:54.232 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: People that were
mystical from the other side?

00:31:54.232 --> 00:31:55.032 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:31:55.032 --> 00:31:56.322 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who did this for you?

00:31:56.322 --> 00:31:57.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: That's
highly possible.

00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:03.680 align:middle line:84%
But again, I also believe
and, in fact, it is the case.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.990 align:middle line:84%
I was definitely helped by
the people on the other side.

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:10.830 align:middle line:84%
But everybody has access to
people on the other side.

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:13.040 align:middle line:84%
But we have not
allowed ourselves

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:15.593 align:middle line:90%
to tap into our intuition.

00:32:15.593 --> 00:32:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I
was going to say,

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:20.060 align:middle line:84%
how can we do what
you did without having

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:21.500 align:middle line:90%
to die to get there?

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: And that's
a great question.

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I
share my story is

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:28.490 align:middle line:84%
because I want people
to be able to do this

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:30.230 align:middle line:90%
without having to die.

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
ways I tell people

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:36.200 align:middle line:84%
is to know that you are
actually a channel for something

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.400 align:middle line:90%
far greater.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.660 align:middle line:84%
You are not just
a physical body.

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:41.480 align:middle line:90%
You're something so much more.

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Your physical body is
literally like just the tip

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.350 align:middle line:90%
of an iceberg.

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:49.280 align:middle line:84%
So just like an iceberg, the
tip that you can see is only 10%

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.480 align:middle line:90%
of the iceberg.

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.660 align:middle line:84%
Your physical body is
only 10% of who you are.

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:56.750 align:middle line:84%
You need to get to
know the other 90%.

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And when you get to
know the other 90%,

00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:03.410 align:middle line:84%
you allow that to actually
channel through you.

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And when you get
to know that 90%,

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:08.600 align:middle line:84%
that's when you start to take
care of your physical body

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:12.690 align:middle line:84%
from the inside out as opposed
to from the outside in.

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:16.610 align:middle line:84%
So when you research
information,

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:20.900 align:middle line:84%
when you're in tune with all
of you, it's like the higher--

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:25.260 align:middle line:84%
your intuition decides what's
right for you and what's not.

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:29.300 align:middle line:84%
But as I mentioned, it
seems to me after the NDE,

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:33.200 align:middle line:84%
it feels like everything
I was before was

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:37.880 align:middle line:84%
a dumbed down version of who
I potentially could have been.

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:40.370 align:middle line:84%
The near-death
experience, it's not

00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:44.210 align:middle line:84%
like I became someone
I'm not capable of being.

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:48.500 align:middle line:84%
It showed me what I
am capable of being

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:51.800 align:middle line:84%
and I was born
with this capacity.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.650 align:middle line:84%
But it was-- it was
conditioned out of me.

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:56.870 align:middle line:90%
That's what it feels like.

00:33:56.870 --> 00:34:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could you teach
somebody how to do this or must

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:02.480 align:middle line:90%
they experience something?

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: I would be able
to share with them everything

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:08.900 align:middle line:84%
from my reverse engineered
perspective, which

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:13.580 align:middle line:84%
is what I try to do, and
when I speak on in my videos,

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:15.949 align:middle line:90%
and what I wrote in my book.

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
have felt helped by it.

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:23.300 align:middle line:84%
They felt that it gives them
more confidence in their body.

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.909 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the
biggest things that I

00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:29.780 align:middle line:90%
want people to know is that--

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:32.659 align:middle line:84%
is that fear, like
when we feel fear,

00:34:32.659 --> 00:34:34.520 align:middle line:84%
when we feel fear
of our illness,

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:37.219 align:middle line:84%
and we feel fear of
not having enough,

00:34:37.219 --> 00:34:39.830 align:middle line:84%
and the stress, and
the anger, all of this

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:42.824 align:middle line:84%
contributes to actually
suppressing your immune system.

00:34:42.824 --> 00:34:43.949 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course it does.

00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:45.050 align:middle line:90%
It's stress.

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:46.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: It's stress.

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:48.590 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is
that when you get

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:53.610 align:middle line:84%
a diagnosis of a scary
illness, it adds to the stress.

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:56.480 align:middle line:84%
So what I try and do with
people is I teach them

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.940 align:middle line:90%
how to alleviate that stress.

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.100 align:middle line:84%
When we alleviate
the stress and when

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:03.650 align:middle line:84%
we alleviate the fear--
and that's a process.

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:05.690 align:middle line:84%
That's the process
we try and work with

00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:08.870 align:middle line:84%
and I encourage medical
doctors, healers, teachers,

00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:13.190 align:middle line:84%
to help people to alleviate that
stress because that frees up

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:15.380 align:middle line:90%
their immune system.

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:18.660 align:middle line:84%
When your immune system
is not in survival mode,

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:20.480 align:middle line:90%
you go into creative mode.

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:23.450 align:middle line:84%
That's when you're most in
touch with your intuition.

00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Must you be a
believer in the ability

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:28.500 align:middle line:90%
to do this for it to work?

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:29.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.610 align:middle line:84%
It definitely helps
if you are a believer.

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:36.140 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's OK to
be a healthy skeptic,

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:39.780 align:middle line:84%
but it's but you need to
be an open healthy skeptic.

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:44.120 align:middle line:84%
But if you are a total
non-believer, debunker,

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:45.260 align:middle line:90%
who only believes in--

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:45.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A negative.

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:47.288 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Material,
and negative,

00:35:47.288 --> 00:35:49.490 align:middle line:84%
and only believes in
the material world,

00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:51.498 align:middle line:84%
then it would be very
hard for this to work.

00:35:51.498 --> 00:35:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We used to have
a producer in St. Louis,

00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Anita, who, when I was doing
my "Night Hawk" local show,

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:02.450 align:middle line:84%
and every day he'd walk in with
a black cloud over his head.

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:05.990 align:middle line:84%
He'd go, this is going to
be a lousy day for me today.

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:08.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, before the
day even started.

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say Howard, what
are you talking about?

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:12.680 align:middle line:90%
He says, I just can feel it.

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:13.730 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:14.810 align:middle line:90%
He had a lousy day.

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:16.018 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Of course he did.

00:36:16.018 --> 00:36:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think he
brought it onto himself.

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:22.610 align:middle line:84%
How many people bring these
diseases onto themselves?

00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: I think
a lot of people do.

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:27.740 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, I
don't want them to feel

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:30.380 align:middle line:84%
it's their fault.
It's not their fault.

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:32.150 align:middle line:84%
But even though it's
not your fault--

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:33.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe not directly.

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:34.482 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Not directly.

00:36:34.482 --> 00:36:37.070 align:middle line:84%
But when you become aware
that you're bringing it

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:39.820 align:middle line:84%
onto yourself and how you're
bringing it onto yourself,

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:42.760 align:middle line:84%
that's when you can really
be on the road to healing.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And so if I had to
explain-- and again,

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:48.760 align:middle line:84%
words are not enough
to do this justice.

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:52.550 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to use words that
may sound a little bit woo-woo.

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:54.490 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, if you
imagine and this

00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:57.830 align:middle line:84%
is how I understood it when
I was on the other side,

00:36:57.830 --> 00:36:59.870 align:middle line:90%
we're not just physical bodies.

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:03.130 align:middle line:84%
So if you imagine that we
are actually energy bodies

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:06.880 align:middle line:84%
or energy beings, being
expressed through the physical.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:10.660 align:middle line:84%
But what actually matters is
the energy, not the physical.

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:12.370 align:middle line:90%
That's the more important part.

00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:15.790 align:middle line:84%
If your energy is weak,
your physical body is weak.

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:19.180 align:middle line:84%
If your energy is strong,
your physical body is strong.

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:23.650 align:middle line:84%
So the more you do
things that energetically

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:28.780 align:middle line:84%
make you feel big and powerful,
your body will reflect it.

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're someone who
is shining bright as an energy,

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:37.900 align:middle line:84%
if you are someone who knows
I am here as a powerful being,

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.310 align:middle line:90%
good things happen to me.

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And when you feel,
like if you're in love,

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:43.460 align:middle line:90%
your energy is big.

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:44.260 align:middle line:90%
When you feel--

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:46.997 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like an aura
that just is expanding.

00:37:46.997 --> 00:37:47.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Exactly.

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:50.200 align:middle line:90%
It's like an aura expanding.

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And if you feel that you're
destined for good things,

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:56.090 align:middle line:84%
then your energy
expands accordingly.

00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:58.030 align:middle line:84%
If you know you're
powerful, your energy

00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:59.590 align:middle line:90%
expands accordingly.

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:02.140 align:middle line:84%
That energy is what
feeds your body.

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:04.450 align:middle line:84%
That is what fuels
it and gives it

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:07.750 align:middle line:84%
that health and vibrancy
that actually then does

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:09.670 align:middle line:90%
bring good things onto you.

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:12.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you remember the
"Star Trek" television series?

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Doctor Bones
would have this apparatus

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:20.000 align:middle line:84%
that he'd wave over some sick
person, then they'd be fine.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yeah.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.467 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't that
a little bit of what

00:38:22.467 --> 00:38:25.180 align:middle line:84%
you've done by
taking your energy,

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:28.520 align:middle line:84%
focusing it on certain parts
of your body, and curing it?

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:29.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yes.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And although I'll admit,
just like you said,

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:33.820 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that's
what I was doing

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:36.220 align:middle line:84%
and it's more in
hindsight, but yes.

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And to me, I really feel
that medicine of the future

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:42.880 align:middle line:84%
really needs to go more in
the direction of measuring

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:46.510 align:middle line:84%
our energy and seeing where
we can expand or increase

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:50.740 align:middle line:84%
our energy, or helping
us to do things that

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:54.310 align:middle line:84%
expand our energy because
that is what will actually

00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:55.670 align:middle line:90%
heal our bodies.

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I think
the route that you

00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:02.322 align:middle line:84%
took, the chemotherapy,
possibly radiation too as well?

00:39:02.322 --> 00:39:03.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: I only had chemo.

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:05.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just the chemo.

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.310 align:middle line:84%
I think that was the
smart thing to do,

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:10.900 align:middle line:84%
but I would do it in combination
with many of the things we've

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:12.190 align:middle line:90%
been talking about tonight.

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:15.580 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Eben Alexander had
a near-death experience

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:17.058 align:middle line:90%
and came back to talk about it.

00:39:17.058 --> 00:39:19.600 align:middle line:10%
>>EBEN ALEXANDER: I came from
my journey to see the hardships

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.640 align:middle line:10%
and difficulties,
illness and injury,

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:24.970 align:middle line:10%
are actually the
steppingstones for our growth.

00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:28.540 align:middle line:10%
It's what leads us into
kind of remembering

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:31.510 align:middle line:10%
the connectedness, the
love of that creative force

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:33.700 align:middle line:10%
for the creation,
which is basically

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:36.850 align:middle line:10%
our relationship with our
very conscious awareness

00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:39.760 align:middle line:10%
and with that God force at
the core of the universe

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:42.935 align:middle line:10%
that so many have
come to realize.

00:39:42.935 --> 00:39:44.560 align:middle line:10%
Not just through
near-death experiences

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:47.290 align:middle line:10%
and other spiritually
transformative experiences,

00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:51.640 align:middle line:10%
but cultivating that through
a program of meditation

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:55.640 align:middle line:10%
with a purpose of trying to
learn more about who am I?

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:56.780 align:middle line:10%
Why am I here?

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:58.000 align:middle line:10%
Where is this all going?

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.250 align:middle line:10%
How can I influence the outcome?

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:03.550 align:middle line:10%
And each and every one of
us plays a tremendous role.

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:06.850 align:middle line:10%
In fact, it's one thing that I
try and portray to every soul

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:11.890 align:middle line:10%
that I encounter, is
everyone is important.

00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:14.350 align:middle line:10%
There is no soul that
is unimportant in this.

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:17.710 align:middle line:10%
And that includes a lot of the
naysayers and the doubters,

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:23.200 align:middle line:10%
because they actually present
a very important viewpoint.

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:27.070 align:middle line:10%
And from my point of view,
as I often say in my talks,

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:30.520 align:middle line:10%
the best ally in this
journey of deep discovery

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.770 align:middle line:10%
of trying to understand
the nature of consciousness

00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:37.570 align:middle line:10%
and existence, is a true
open-minded skepticism.

00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:40.958 align:middle line:10%
Doubt everything right
down to ground level.

00:40:40.958 --> 00:40:42.250 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But have an open mind.

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:44.740 align:middle line:10%
>>ALEXANDER: But have
a very open mind.

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Looking at people
like Eben Alexander,

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:50.560 align:middle line:84%
and you could be up there
on one of our next shows

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:53.890 align:middle line:84%
as a clip, what do you
do to tell somebody this

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:56.290 align:middle line:90%
is what I did and I'm here?

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:57.430 align:middle line:90%
What do you tell them?

00:40:57.430 --> 00:41:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: I would tell them
that it's really important

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:03.790 align:middle line:90%
to actually value who you are.

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:07.600 align:middle line:84%
It's really important to allow
yourself to be who you are,

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:11.590 align:middle line:84%
be your authentic self,
express yourself fearlessly.

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And it is it's
actually also really

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:17.530 align:middle line:84%
important to listen
to your intuition

00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:20.530 align:middle line:84%
and to know that you
are much, much more

00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:22.900 align:middle line:90%
than just this physical being.

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And I would also ask people
to work through any fears

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:28.990 align:middle line:90%
or stresses to heal that.

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Healing the fear of
illness is actually

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:35.423 align:middle line:84%
more important than
healing the illness itself.

00:41:35.423 --> 00:41:37.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was going say are,
you afraid of dying anymore?

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:38.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: No.

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:39.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm not afraid of dying.

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're not in a hurry.

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:41.450 align:middle line:90%
There's no rush.

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:42.617 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: There's no rush.

00:41:42.617 --> 00:41:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't encourage
people to go early,

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:46.060 align:middle line:90%
but I'm not afraid of it.

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:47.890 align:middle line:84%
They have nothing
to be afraid of.

00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And when we heal
our fear of dying,

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:52.630 align:middle line:84%
we actually heal
our fear of living.

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:55.565 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you look forward
if that happens again?

00:41:55.565 --> 00:41:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: To death?

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To the other side?

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: You know
what's interesting is

00:42:00.370 --> 00:42:04.360 align:middle line:84%
that I love my life now, more
than I did before the NDE.

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:05.650 align:middle line:90%
I love it so much.

00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:06.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You appreciate
it more, don't you?

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: I
appreciate it more.

00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And so on the one
hand, I actually

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.660 align:middle line:84%
look forward to every single
day in my life so much.

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:17.140 align:middle line:84%
But I don't worry
about death at all.

00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:17.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm fine.

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:20.145 align:middle line:84%
When the day comes, I know
I'll go with no regrets.

00:42:20.145 --> 00:42:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think of somebody,

00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Anita, who just hates
people, and hates life,

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.520 align:middle line:90%
hates their own life?

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:27.460 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that sad?

00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:28.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: That's very sad.

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:31.300 align:middle line:84%
I feel that they're
missing out on something.

00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And I do feel that if
somebody feels that way,

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:37.810 align:middle line:84%
I feel that it's their
loss, but I would try--

00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:41.920 align:middle line:84%
I would if I was passing them
by, I would give them a hug,

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:44.770 align:middle line:84%
or say hello, or try
and cheer them up.

00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:48.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And those on the other
side, what do they want for us?

00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:51.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: They
actually want us to--

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:54.970 align:middle line:84%
they want us to love more,
more than anything else.

00:42:54.970 --> 00:42:57.580 align:middle line:84%
There's one thing that's
really lacking in our planet.

00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:00.250 align:middle line:90%
And love, it sounds--

00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:01.720 align:middle line:90%
it's an overused word.

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:03.100 align:middle line:90%
It's really overused.

00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And what Raymond Moody said
about not having the language,

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:08.740 align:middle line:90%
that is so true.

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Because there is something
that's so ineffable

00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:17.030 align:middle line:84%
that I felt on the other
side and it was so strong,

00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:20.230 align:middle line:84%
and I understood that
we could have it here.

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that we're
so able to have it,

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:28.570 align:middle line:84%
but yet there's a
lot of people here

00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:31.690 align:middle line:84%
that are trying to take
it away all the time.

00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And it feels like
that all the time.

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And whenever, very often when
we try to share our experience,

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:41.770 align:middle line:84%
it feels like there's people
who are trying to take it away.

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And like Eben Alexander
said about skeptics,

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:50.980 align:middle line:84%
skeptics have been great for me,
just like he said, because it's

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:54.250 align:middle line:90%
made me stronger in my message.

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
you like viewers

00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:59.900 align:middle line:84%
who are watching this program
right now to take away

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:01.520 align:middle line:90%
from this show?

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:04.250 align:middle line:10%
>>MOORJANI: I would like
viewers to know that they

00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:05.960 align:middle line:10%
don't have anything to fear.

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:08.150 align:middle line:10%
But the main thing
is that I would

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:12.320 align:middle line:10%
like them to know that they need
to relax, and have more fun,

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.270 align:middle line:10%
and find more joy in life.

00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:15.890 align:middle line:10%
They need to laugh more.

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:18.300 align:middle line:84%
We've become a culture
or a race of people who

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.540 align:middle line:90%
forgotten how to enjoy life.

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:22.170 align:middle line:90%
We've forgotten how to have fun.

00:44:22.170 --> 00:44:23.990 align:middle line:90%
We've forgotten how to laugh.

00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:26.430 align:middle line:84%
That's actually more
important than anything.

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And laughing and having
fun and finding your joy

00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:32.510 align:middle line:84%
is actually the best
medicine, even for illness.

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's an old saying,
laughter is the best medicine.

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:35.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yeah.

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:36.260 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:36.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's true.

00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:38.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: It is so true.

00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:39.860 align:middle line:90%
It's been overstated.

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:43.393 align:middle line:84%
It sounds cliche, but it's
actually really, really true.

00:44:43.393 --> 00:44:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Anita, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:46.520 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: Thank you so
much for having me on.

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:49.417 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There you go.

00:44:49.417 --> 00:44:55.550 align:middle line:84%
A remarkable subject, a cancer
victim who was in stage four,

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:57.050 align:middle line:90%
and came to remission.

00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:58.940 align:middle line:90%
And she's here to talk about it.

00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:02.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:05.560 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:08.000 align:middle line:90%
