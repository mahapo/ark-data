00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.910 align:middle line:90%
[BACKGROUND MUSIC]

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:19.989 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:21.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief".

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.300 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory,
and I am still amazed

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.874 align:middle line:10%
at the caliber of guests we
bring you on "Beyond Belief".

00:00:26.874 --> 00:00:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And we've got that
with you today.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.580 align:middle line:84%
Georgina Cannon, noted author,
"The Third Circle Protocol"

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.780 align:middle line:90%
is her latest book.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.769 align:middle line:84%
She's a hypnotist, a
past life regressionist.

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And today on the
program, we're going

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.590 align:middle line:84%
to talk with you about life
after death, relationships,

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.390 align:middle line:90%
and maybe--

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.110 align:middle line:84%
time permitting-- she
will hypnotize me,

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.340 align:middle line:90%
and we'll see what happens.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.360 align:middle line:90%
Is that a possibility?

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.500 align:middle line:90%
You really can do that?

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGINA CANNON:
Maybe, we'll see.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We'll see what happens.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: We'll
see what happens.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.070 align:middle line:90%
It'll be fun.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What-- what is
a hypnotist and past life

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.670 align:middle line:90%
regressionist, anyway?

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.140 align:middle line:10%
>>CANNON: A
hypnotist is a person

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.550 align:middle line:10%
who is able to facilitate
others and themselves

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.030 align:middle line:10%
into a state of hypnosis,
which is like an altered state.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.330 align:middle line:10%
It's the zone, if you like.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.020 align:middle line:84%
It's the alpha brainwaves, the
same brain waves as meditation

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.530 align:middle line:84%
that bypasses the conscious
mind to access the subconscious.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.864 align:middle line:84%
Subconscious, as you
know, is our blueprint.

00:01:15.864 --> 00:01:17.280 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going
to make change,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.230 align:middle line:84%
you need to get
into the blueprint.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.760 align:middle line:90%
And that's what hypnosis does.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And being a
past life regressionist?

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: I use it to
get into past lives.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Past lives are a
wonderful tool so that we

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.640 align:middle line:90%
can learn to better this life.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.930 align:middle line:90%
I believe it's only a tool.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.280 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe it's woo-woo.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.200 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a tool that we
use to understand who we are,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.680 align:middle line:84%
and how we are, and the patterns
we bring in with us that

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.630 align:middle line:90%
help us live this life fully.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you convinced
that the past lives

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.510 align:middle line:84%
that you pick up from people
after you put them under

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.650 align:middle line:90%
are real?

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Or are they making
these things up?

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: I don't believe
you can make up emotions.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And most-- I would say
80% of the past lives

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.490 align:middle line:84%
include some emotion of some
sort-- either joy or sadness,

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.850 align:middle line:84%
fear, sorrow, you
can't make that up.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And they're so impactful
that they make a difference.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.620 align:middle line:84%
When someone comes back into
today, they say, oh my god.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.410 align:middle line:84%
Now I know why I
have a fear of water.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.455 align:middle line:84%
Or now I know why I keep
choosing people like I do.

00:02:19.455 --> 00:02:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or, I have
this mole on my face.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Yeah, or
scar on my back.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chances are,
that carries through.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.585 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Yeah,
yeah, Yeah, yeah.

00:02:24.585 --> 00:02:27.120 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How many past lives
can an individual have?

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: In my case,
probably eight or nine.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.570 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sure there's many
more, I'm sure there is.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they could be lives
that last full term, right?

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.320 align:middle line:84%
80, 85 years old, or
they could be-- maybe

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.624 align:middle line:84%
they died early in birth,
or who knows, right?

00:02:42.624 --> 00:02:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: And they can also
come from other planets,

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.624 align:middle line:90%
but not necessarily.

00:02:45.624 --> 00:02:46.456 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:02:46.456 --> 00:02:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Oh, yes.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.740 align:middle line:84%
They don't necessarily
come from this planet.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
convinced that it's real,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.630 align:middle line:90%
that past lives are real?

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: You know, the media
asks me that all the time.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.410 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, it's the information
that you get that matters.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's a metaphor
that your brain is giving

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.180 align:middle line:84%
you to give you information and
understanding about your life,

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.090 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the
most important thing.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:16.480 align:middle line:84%
So whether you were the Queen of
Sheba, or King Henry the VIII,

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.040 align:middle line:84%
or a farmer, then you
learned about the value

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.960 align:middle line:90%
of family or trustworthiness--

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --or a
poolboy like I was.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.905 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: [LAUGHING] Are
we talking this life,

00:03:27.905 --> 00:03:28.705 align:middle line:90%
or a previous life?

00:03:28.705 --> 00:03:29.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Previous
life, not this life.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.480 align:middle line:84%
This life, I was
never a poolboy.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: It doesn't matter.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.090 align:middle line:84%
It's what you learn
from it that matters.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you convinced
that there is life after death?

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.220 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we're
part of nature.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.690 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we
recycle, if you like.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.080 align:middle line:84%
It's the original
recycling program.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a case
where a friend of mine

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.240 align:middle line:84%
died in a motorcycle
accident, Georgina.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.040 align:middle line:90%
And I went to the funeral.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.630 align:middle line:90%
I hate those places.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.040 align:middle line:90%
I just don't like them.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.660 align:middle line:90%
But we were there.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.270 align:middle line:84%
The casket was open and
everybody was looking at him.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And I had just seen
him a week before that.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.490 align:middle line:90%
And he was very much alive.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And now, there's this
cadaver lying in this casket,

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.950 align:middle line:90%
stiff as a board.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason, it hit
me that that's it for him.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.050 align:middle line:90%
It's over.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.459 align:middle line:84%
There's no life after
death, and he's in this box,

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.269 align:middle line:90%
and his life is done.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very cold, stark,
very uneasy feeling that I had.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.200 align:middle line:90%
It lasted just a few minutes.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And then, I snapped out
of it again and realized

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.340 align:middle line:90%
that there is life after death.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.810 align:middle line:84%
There's more to this existence
than we can even imagine.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.640 align:middle line:90%
And I felt OK again.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.330 align:middle line:10%
But to believe that life
after death does not exist

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.810 align:middle line:10%
is a very cold feeling.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Well, people
who work in hospitals

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.930 align:middle line:84%
who see people
dying, they actually

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.700 align:middle line:90%
feel the soul leave the body.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.500 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've had
stories about it.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yeah, as you know.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.595 align:middle line:84%
It's even been
photographed, I believe.

00:05:02.595 --> 00:05:04.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The body
has even lost weight

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.230 align:middle line:90%
after death, which is weird.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yeah, yeah.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.750 align:middle line:90%
And understandable.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.090 align:middle line:84%
We're no different
than a flower that dies

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.400 align:middle line:84%
and the seed goes into
the earth and grows again.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.745 align:middle line:90%
It's all the same.

00:05:17.745 --> 00:05:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our old
friend, Deepak Chopra,

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.340 align:middle line:84%
was interviewed on CNN
about life after death.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.550 align:middle line:90%


00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.300 align:middle line:10%
>>KYRA PHILLIPS: So is
there life after death?

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DEEPAK CHOPRA: Is
there life after death?

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:32.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.190 align:middle line:84%
I think you have to understand,
though, who is surviving.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.740 align:middle line:90%


00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:40.850 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.480 align:middle line:10%
If you're the formless
void that is constantly

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.780 align:middle line:10%
experiencing yourself
as form, yes,

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.420 align:middle line:10%
your memories, your desires--

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.020 align:middle line:10%
your karma, shall we call it--

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.520 align:middle line:10%
and don't get
fooled by this word.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Karma just is
input/output, right?

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:04.040 align:middle line:84%
If I eat a banana, my body
responds in a certain way.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.440 align:middle line:84%
If I have coffee, I
respond in a certain way.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.640 align:middle line:84%
If I ingest a toxin, it
responds in a certain way.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.730 align:middle line:84%
If I am subject to
anger or hostility,

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.190 align:middle line:90%
it responds to a certain way.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.940 align:middle line:90%
So it's input, and it's output.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.380 align:middle line:90%
That's all karma is.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.640 align:middle line:84%
The input and output that
your consciousness experiences

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.880 align:middle line:90%
creates memories and desires.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And these memories and desires,
and the sum of input and output

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:36.170 align:middle line:84%
we call karma, is what recycles
like a spiral in the direction

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:37.940 align:middle line:90%
of higher consciousness.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:46.160 align:middle line:84%
The ultimate goal is being one
with our source, with our God.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So he really didn't
explain too much about life

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.610 align:middle line:84%
after death, which
the interviewer looked

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:53.850 align:middle line:90%
a little baffled by that.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.594 align:middle line:90%
So I'll ask you.

00:06:55.594 --> 00:06:57.260 align:middle line:84%
How do you think, and
why do you believe

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.940 align:middle line:90%
there is life after death?

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: I believe that
we are more than this--

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.280 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.870 align:middle line:90%


00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.560 align:middle line:84%
If we were just this, we
would live differently.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.780 align:middle line:84%
We would interact with
each other differently.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.530 align:middle line:84%
We would interact with
the earth differently.

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:23.600 align:middle line:84%
We would not have a
consciousness of a higher self.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.900 align:middle line:84%
When we meditate or when we
go into an altered state,

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.270 align:middle line:84%
we reach part of
ourselves that has

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.060 align:middle line:90%
nothing to do with the body.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:37.469 align:middle line:84%
And even those people who have
had near-death experiences--

00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:39.260 align:middle line:84%
and you know them very
well, because you've

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.080 align:middle line:90%
interviewed many.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.080 align:middle line:84%
If we didn't have
a life after death,

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.490 align:middle line:90%
that wouldn't be explained.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's some scientists
who say it's just chemistry

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:52.010 align:middle line:90%
that happens in the brain.

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:53.600 align:middle line:90%
That's been disproven.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.560 align:middle line:90%
That is beyond that.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And some say
religions do it to force

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.220 align:middle line:90%
us to be under their control.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.255 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's a whole other--

00:08:01.255 --> 00:08:02.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a
different argument.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: That's a
whole other thing.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, I mean, Deepak is one of
my heroes, as a matter of fact.

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:13.540 align:middle line:84%
But the thing about karma
is very interesting.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:17.650 align:middle line:84%
Karma, I believe,
is like a library.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And I always suggest to
my clients and my students

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:26.410 align:middle line:84%
that we use it as a
study hall, not a home.

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:28.840 align:middle line:90%
So don't blame karma.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.580 align:middle line:84%
Don't blame your
mother for things.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.030 align:middle line:90%
Don't blame your boss.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.220 align:middle line:90%
Don't blame karma.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Blame yourself.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Well, not
even blame, but own it.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.490 align:middle line:84%
If karma gives you a hand
of cards to play with-- you

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:42.005 align:middle line:84%
come into this world
dealt with karma.

00:08:42.005 --> 00:08:43.130 align:middle line:90%
You've got a hand of cards.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.450 align:middle line:84%
How you play those
cards is up to you.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.360 align:middle line:84%
That's, in my mind,
what karma is.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's a gift
that you're given,

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.530 align:middle line:84%
and if you use it
to your benefit

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:57.970 align:middle line:84%
to learn from, to overcome, if
necessary, then you'll grow.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.757 align:middle line:84%
If you don't, then you become
a victim instead of a hero.

00:09:00.757 --> 00:09:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sometimes
you're dealt a blackjack.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:04.180 align:middle line:10%
Other times, you're not.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:04.980 align:middle line:90%
It all depends.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:05.938 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: That's right.

00:09:05.938 --> 00:09:10.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What determines
that shuffle of the cards?

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:12.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Previous lives,
what you brought in with you.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:13.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That can affect that?

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: It can affect that.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:16.143 align:middle line:90%
And then, what you do with them.

00:09:16.143 --> 00:09:20.260 align:middle line:84%
So if you come into this life
into an unfortunate family,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:24.220 align:middle line:84%
or live an early life that's
particularly hard or difficult,

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:25.990 align:middle line:90%
you're born into--

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:28.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't know--
Afghanistan, Sudan,

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.070 align:middle line:90%
you understand starvation.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.919 align:middle line:90%
You understand deprivation.

00:09:31.919 --> 00:09:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you put into
certain regions of the planet

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:35.740 align:middle line:90%
because of things like that?

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.774 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: I think we
choose at some point

00:09:37.774 --> 00:09:39.190 align:middle line:84%
before we come to
this life, where

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:42.770 align:middle line:84%
we're going to go because of
the lesson we need to learn.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't learn
it, we come back again.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:46.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did I pick my parents?

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.070 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I did a
great job doing that.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:50.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Well done.

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.076 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
wonderful people.

00:09:52.076 --> 00:09:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: [LAUGHING]
That's great.

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.150 align:middle line:90%
No, we pick our parents.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:58.120 align:middle line:84%
We pick our parents so
we can learn from them

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.130 align:middle line:90%
and grow from that.

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.170 align:middle line:84%
Even if they're
unfortunate parents,

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.570 align:middle line:84%
then we learn to
not be a victim.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your view of karma,
are there victims, pro and con?

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: I'm not
sure what that means.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:16.490 align:middle line:84%
People come in with
really bad karma.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:18.320 align:middle line:84%
But what they do with
it is up to them.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what is bad karma?

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Bad karma is if you
come in to a life where you

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:28.010 align:middle line:84%
have a situation
of deprivation--

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:31.190 align:middle line:90%
either emotional or physical--

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:34.190 align:middle line:84%
where you are starving,
or you're beaten,

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:37.880 align:middle line:84%
or you're born into a family
of addicts, or you are

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.080 align:middle line:84%
disregarded like
you don't matter.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.740 align:middle line:84%
So what you do with
that is up to you.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can you overcome that?

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Well, yes, because you
find yourself and you overcome

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.540 align:middle line:90%
it, if you so choose.

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:52.080 align:middle line:84%
So you can either become
a victim or a hero.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And I help people who
find themselves victimized

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:58.400 align:middle line:90%
to find the hero in them.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody
has a hero in them.

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:04.100 align:middle line:84%
So I help them find their
way through and make

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.950 align:middle line:90%
life valuable and worthwhile.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:08.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is there a hell?

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.160 align:middle line:90%
Is there a heaven?

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: We make our
own heaven and hell.

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:16.940 align:middle line:84%
I think our view of our
world decides whether we

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.220 align:middle line:90%
have a heaven or hell.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:24.110 align:middle line:84%
There are people who are
faced with the same situation.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:28.700 align:middle line:84%
We'll make the best of it and
some people will sink into it.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:32.240 align:middle line:84%
In my book, I talk about
somebody walking through a park

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.030 align:middle line:84%
and seeing a couple kissing
on the grass, and they say,

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:36.610 align:middle line:90%
oh, get a room.

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And somebody else
will walk past them

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:39.980 align:middle line:90%
and say, oh, isn't that lovely?

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.570 align:middle line:84%
It depends on, I
think, the embrace

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:45.662 align:middle line:90%
and the way it's being done.

00:11:45.662 --> 00:11:46.870 align:middle line:90%
That has a lot to do with it.

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Oh, maybe, and
the perception, yeah--

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:50.170 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:53.321 align:middle line:84%
How we see our life
makes it heaven or hell.

00:11:53.321 --> 00:11:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
convinced that reincarnation

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.199 align:middle line:90%
is the real deal?

00:11:56.199 --> 00:11:57.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: I am convinced.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.615 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just with
the past lives

00:11:58.615 --> 00:12:00.060 align:middle line:84%
you people have
regressed, right?

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: I'm convinced.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.680 align:middle line:84%
There's been enough
research done.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.100 align:middle line:90%
As you know, I did--

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Extensive research.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: --with the CBC.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:11.310 align:middle line:90%
And they did extensive research.

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And they took the
person back to the place

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.040 align:middle line:84%
where they had
reincarnated from.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.660 align:middle line:90%
And they were deeply moved.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.310 align:middle line:90%
They recognized it.

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:21.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why do we reincarnate?

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:22.860 align:middle line:90%
What's the purpose?

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: To learn, the
soul to grow, develop.

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:27.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To become
heavenly, basically?

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: To move upward
toward the light, if you like.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:37.020 align:middle line:84%
As we encourage ourselves to
learn and grow from a soul

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:44.400 align:middle line:84%
perspective, be kinder, be
more humane, spread more light,

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:48.050 align:middle line:90%
develop more humanity--

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:49.767 align:middle line:84%
and I use the word
humanity because I

00:12:49.767 --> 00:12:51.350 align:middle line:84%
can't think of another
word right now,

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:54.420 align:middle line:84%
but it's to do with interacting
with nature as it is,

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.220 align:middle line:90%
as we know it.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.803 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I'm
convinced, Georgina,

00:12:56.803 --> 00:13:00.860 align:middle line:84%
that the mere fact that you and
I are talking about this right

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.670 align:middle line:84%
now has elevated us to a
certain level, that we're

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:07.940 align:middle line:84%
getting really close
to that perfection

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.250 align:middle line:90%
or that heavenly existence.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:12.560 align:middle line:84%
The fact that you would
talk about reincarnation

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.740 align:middle line:84%
and bring it up, I think that
elevates you, doesn't it?

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.350 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to somebody
who has no idea

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:19.850 align:middle line:90%
what we're talking about.

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:21.540 align:middle line:90%
They've got more lives to go.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.420 align:middle line:90%
Am I right?

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Maybe.

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:28.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm more inclined to
see myself as a teacher.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.030 align:middle line:84%
That's my thumbprint
from life between lives.

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:33.970 align:middle line:84%
That's my soul thumbprint,
to be a teacher.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:38.080 align:middle line:84%
So when I talk about it, I'm
trying to enlighten others.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.310 align:middle line:90%
So is that what you're saying?

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:42.609 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the
fact that we are--

00:13:42.609 --> 00:13:43.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: --even discussing it.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --discussing it, means
we're at a higher level than

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.740 align:middle line:90%
somebody who isn't.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:48.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:52.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if
reincarnation for me,

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:57.370 align:middle line:84%
for example, may be one or
two more lives, so be it.

00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:00.720 align:middle line:84%
But for that person who
just doesn't get this,

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.670 align:middle line:84%
they might have five or
six more to go, right?

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:03.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes, yes.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does everybody
eventually get

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:06.280 align:middle line:90%
to that high level?

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: One hopes.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:08.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm not God.

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:09.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.120 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.250 align:middle line:84%
But one hopes that
that's the whole idea,

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:17.830 align:middle line:84%
is to evolve to become more
of a light giver and carrier,

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:21.490 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to move closer
to whatever we call God.

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The fact that
we are who we are today--

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.950 align:middle line:84%
I want to use you
as an example--

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:31.030 align:middle line:84%
tells me that either you've
had many lives because you're

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.430 align:middle line:84%
at this higher
level now, or is it

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:38.680 align:middle line:84%
conceivable that you
could be born into a life

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:42.670 align:middle line:84%
and be so evolved
naturally that maybe you

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:44.530 align:middle line:84%
haven't had a lot of
reincarnated lives,

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:46.480 align:middle line:90%
but you start at a higher level.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.991 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:14:47.991 --> 00:14:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Definitely possible.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:53.120 align:middle line:84%
There are people like
Gandhi, for instance.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:53.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.980 align:middle line:84%
What we don't know is how
many lives he had to get

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.177 align:middle line:90%
to the point here was at.

00:14:58.177 --> 00:14:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: That's true, we don't.

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:02.170 align:middle line:90%
We don't, and we haven't asked.

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:03.582 align:middle line:90%
We could do that.

00:15:03.582 --> 00:15:04.540 align:middle line:90%
Now, there's a thought.

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:05.765 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is a thought.

00:15:05.765 --> 00:15:07.390 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: That will
be my next project.

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or someone like him
could have evolved instantly--

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:10.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and been
at a high level.

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:12.445 align:middle line:90%
That's possible too.

00:15:12.445 --> 00:15:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: See, part of me
believes I've been a walk-in.

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:18.310 align:middle line:84%
So that's a whole different
level of walk-ins.

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are walk-ins?

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Walk-ins
are old souls that

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:25.550 align:middle line:90%
have a job to do, a purpose.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason, at that
time, they don't have a body.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:32.410 align:middle line:84%
So there's a soul contract
between that old soul

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:34.840 align:middle line:84%
and a soul in a
current body that

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.210 align:middle line:84%
has done what it's supposed
to do in this body,

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:38.980 align:middle line:84%
and is ready to
make the exchange.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And the exchange is usually
done either with an accident--

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:46.760 align:middle line:84%
where, like that, the soul
leaves and another one comes

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:47.560 align:middle line:90%
in--

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:51.200 align:middle line:84%
or through surgery, where
they think the person's dead,

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.990 align:middle line:90%
then they come back again.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
soul exchange happens.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's always interesting,
because it's a major life

00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:58.900 align:middle line:90%
change.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:15:59.830 align:middle line:90%
And people notice it.

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:03.130 align:middle line:84%
They say, oh, Sam had a
terrible heart attack.

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And when he recovered, my god,
he's like a different person--

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:06.880 align:middle line:90%
totally different.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is a walk-in
like possession?

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:14.290 align:middle line:10%
>>CANNON: No, because it
replaces, it doesn't add to.

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A demon,
or a possession--

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.266 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: And I
do spirit release.

00:16:17.266 --> 00:16:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you do exorcisms,
that's in addition to.

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:20.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: That's different.

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:21.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A walk-in
just replaces?

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Replaces.

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.750 align:middle line:90%


00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:28.210 align:middle line:84%
An attachment literally attaches
to the aura or to the person

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:29.440 align:middle line:90%
and sucks the energy from.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.180 align:middle line:90%
It's very different.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:34.340 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And with a walk-in,
do they stay forever?

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:35.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:36.598 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
walk out again.

00:16:36.598 --> 00:16:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: No.

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.580 align:middle line:90%
They're not a temporary visitor.

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:39.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And this could
happen to anybody?

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes, yes.

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
wouldn't it be baffling

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:48.130 align:middle line:84%
to have somebody who's
totally different than what

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:49.090 align:middle line:90%
they were yesterday?

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:50.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes, it is baffling.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does that happen a lot?

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: It happens--

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:55.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't know because
there's no numbers on it.

00:16:55.470 --> 00:17:00.250 align:middle line:84%
But I've met a couple, and
I believe I am one too.

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:03.180 align:middle line:84%
I was in the corporate
world for many years

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:06.150 align:middle line:90%
and had a car accident.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And my life totally
changed after that.

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.040 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't terribly hurt.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:16.160 align:middle line:84%
I just had a bit of a scar
up here, and was shaken up.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.410 align:middle line:84%
But my life and my perspective
changed drastically.

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:21.119 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
glad who walked in?

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:22.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes, very.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.235 align:middle line:90%
I'm grateful.

00:17:23.235 --> 00:17:24.359 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's been amazing.

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:26.050 align:middle line:84%
You've worked with
a lot of clients

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:29.394 align:middle line:84%
on past life regressions over
at least a couple decades.

00:17:29.394 --> 00:17:31.060 align:middle line:84%
There was a special
produced, of course,

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:34.500 align:middle line:90%
by the CBC in Canada about you.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.960 align:middle line:90%
>> What happens after we die?

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.730 align:middle line:90%
Everyone wants to know.

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:42.070 align:middle line:90%
Could we have been here before?

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.577 align:middle line:90%
Will we be here again?

00:17:43.577 --> 00:17:47.690 align:middle line:90%
>> 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:50.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Some people try to find
answers by undergoing a special

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:54.490 align:middle line:84%
kind of hypnosis to look
for memories of past lives.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:56.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Just let it
unfold, like a movie.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.282 align:middle line:84%
Just tell me what
you see or perceive.

00:17:59.282 --> 00:18:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm in France.

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:01.720 align:middle line:90%
>> In Scotland.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Like a gold rush
thing happening.

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:07.820 align:middle line:84%
>> All you need to do is
call it up and imagine it.

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Georgina Cannon is the
director of the Ontario

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:11.900 align:middle line:90%
Hypnosis Center.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>> I guess I'm being sacrificed.

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm male.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.607 align:middle line:90%
>> I would say, I'm the queen.

00:18:16.607 --> 00:18:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>> I feel white.

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:21.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who were those people?

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:22.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: I had no idea.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.800 align:middle line:84%
The CBC wanted to keep
it absolutely clean.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:29.100 align:middle line:84%
So they brought in 34
people I'd never met before,

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.710 align:middle line:84%
and over three weeks,
I regressed them back.

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And out of those
34, I think it was

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:39.300 align:middle line:90%
10 or 12 had verifiable lives.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And out of those 10 or
12, they chose three

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:43.880 align:middle line:90%
that made good television.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:46.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: I'd never
met them before.

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.240 align:middle line:84%
They came from
all walks of life.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.940 align:middle line:84%
One woman even spoke
a foreign language

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.560 align:middle line:84%
that she didn't
know in this life,

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.726 align:middle line:90%
and I certainly didn't know.

00:18:53.726 --> 00:18:54.680 align:middle line:90%
She spoke Hindi.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Yeah, it
was quite something.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been for you
when you've past life regressed

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.090 align:middle line:84%
people, to be one of the most
astounding stories you've

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:09.864 align:middle line:84%
come across of a life that
just boggled your mind?

00:19:09.864 --> 00:19:11.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: There
are two, actually.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.540 align:middle line:84%
One that they showed
on the CBC, where

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:21.440 align:middle line:84%
she was a silk trader
going from China to India

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.880 align:middle line:90%
into a tiny village.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And then, she eventually
ended up in a monastery.

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:28.942 align:middle line:84%
And they took her to that
monastery in real life.

00:19:28.942 --> 00:19:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --in the show.

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: --in the show.

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And the producer told
me-- they had a producer,

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:36.860 align:middle line:84%
the camera person,
and the client--

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:38.030 align:middle line:90%
went into the monastery.

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And the elder in the
monastery came out and said,

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:41.600 align:middle line:90%
welcome home, my child.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.950 align:middle line:90%
They recognized each other.

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:44.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's funny.

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:46.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: They both cried.

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:48.830 align:middle line:84%
The elder in the
monastery had cried.

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:51.950 align:middle line:84%
The other one was not
quite a past life,

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:55.940 align:middle line:84%
but she came in asking if I
could help her with a memory.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.430 align:middle line:84%
She had found herself,
when she was 17,

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:02.210 align:middle line:84%
about sitting on a bench
in a park in Toronto

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:05.354 align:middle line:84%
without a name or any
knowing who she was.

00:20:05.354 --> 00:20:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This had
happened to her?

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Just something
had happened to her.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:10.400 align:middle line:84%
She was bruised, and
scratched, and everything.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.682 align:middle line:84%
And a woman took her in
and they phoned the police.

00:20:13.682 --> 00:20:15.140 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't find
out who she was.

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Cut of a very long story
short, she was now 60-some odd,

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:20.520 align:middle line:90%
married-- happily married--

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.370 align:middle line:84%
and her husband was
the only one that

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:25.232 align:middle line:84%
knew that she didn't
have an identity.

00:20:25.232 --> 00:20:26.690 align:middle line:84%
She was going into
surgery, and she

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:29.900 align:middle line:84%
wanted to find out if she
could find out who she was.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even at the age
of 60, she still really

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.200 align:middle line:90%
didn't know who she was?

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: They
contacted Interpol.

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:36.650 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't do
a computer search,

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:38.170 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't have
anything to look for.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:38.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And she had no--

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Nothing.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --memory to go from.

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: So she couldn't travel
because she had no papers.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:43.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who was she?

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:43.790 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: That's it.

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:47.604 align:middle line:90%
So I took her back.

00:20:47.604 --> 00:20:49.520 align:middle line:84%
I said, we're going to
do something different.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:53.607 align:middle line:84%
I took her into the womb and
beyond the womb of her mother.

00:20:53.607 --> 00:20:54.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Going back?

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Going
back beyond the womb

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.910 align:middle line:84%
to the time she made a
decision to come into the womb.

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And when she got into the womb,
she said, I know who I am.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:03.600 align:middle line:90%
I know who I am.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And she'd got the
name of her father.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And she got the name of a couple
of her sisters, I think it was.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.230 align:middle line:90%
And she woke herself up--

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:11.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:12.613 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: --ran out
of the clinic room

00:21:12.613 --> 00:21:14.270 align:middle line:84%
and said, John, John,
John, John, John!

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:14.900 align:middle line:90%
I've got a name.

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm so-and-so.

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yeah.

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:18.590 align:middle line:90%
So they ran off, literally.

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:22.049 align:middle line:84%
And a week later, I got
an email from her saying,

00:21:22.049 --> 00:21:23.840 align:middle line:84%
I thought you'd like
to see this, Georgina.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.000 align:middle line:90%
We went online with a name.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And there was an
email that said,

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:30.110 align:middle line:84%
I think you're the sister
we've been looking for years.

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:31.642 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:21:31.642 --> 00:21:33.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: So it totally
changed her life.

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did she explain what
happened to her, how she merely

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.470 align:middle line:84%
forgot who she was
and disappeared?

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: She said that
she also found out that she

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.330 align:middle line:90%
couldn't have children.

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:46.880 align:middle line:90%
She'd had a hysterectomy at 17.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:50.410 align:middle line:84%
So they had come from a
very dysfunctional family

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:56.480 align:middle line:84%
of addicts, and put
out to foster parents.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.810 align:middle line:90%
And they all split up.

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't know
where each other was.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And she
had no recollection?

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:02.633 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: No recollection.

00:22:02.633 --> 00:22:05.497 align:middle line:84%
And when she finally
met her and her sister,

00:22:05.497 --> 00:22:06.580 align:middle line:90%
they looked like bookends.

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.870 align:middle line:90%
It was very, very cute.

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:11.180 align:middle line:84%
She wouldn't tell me too
much, said it was too painful.

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:13.240 align:middle line:84%
She just wanted to live
in the now and the future.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.656 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, she didn't want
to go back, even though she

00:22:15.656 --> 00:22:16.640 align:middle line:90%
remembered everything.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: She didn't.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.730 align:middle line:90%
And so the family filled her in.

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:21.870 align:middle line:84%
So now, she's got
this whole new family.

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And every time she
travels anywhere,

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:25.000 align:middle line:90%
she sends me an email.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I'm sure they
showed her pictures of her

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:31.140 align:middle line:84%
as a little girl, saying, there
you are, standing next to me.

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:32.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: That's right.

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a remark--

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:36.080 align:middle line:84%
there was some kind of
trauma, I would guess,

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.940 align:middle line:84%
that forced her to forget
everything in her childhood.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And she's sitting there
bruised up on that park bench.

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:44.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: And she'd come
from North Carolina.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.575 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: So ended
up in Toronto.

00:22:46.575 --> 00:22:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a great story.

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:51.440 align:middle line:84%
But that would be frustrating
to not know your background.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.027 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: It would
be frightening.

00:22:53.027 --> 00:22:54.860 align:middle line:84%
It would be frightening
to know who you are.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.900 align:middle line:90%
And her husband just adored her.

00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:00.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were very, very
close together as a couple.

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does everybody have
the ability to be regressed?

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: If want to
be, if they allow.

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they
fight it sometimes?

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.589 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: They're frightened.

00:23:12.589 --> 00:23:14.380 align:middle line:84%
Or they feel they're
going to lose control.

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are they
afraid of who they were?

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:17.651 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Some people
are frightened.

00:23:17.651 --> 00:23:21.152 align:middle line:84%
They say, supposing, I was a
guard in a concentration camp.

00:23:21.152 --> 00:23:22.110 align:middle line:90%
That would be terrible.

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:24.712 align:middle line:84%
Or supposing I was a
slave driver, you know.

00:23:24.712 --> 00:23:26.670 align:middle line:84%
I was one of those people
that imported slaves.

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:29.450 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't want to know that.

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:30.976 align:middle line:84%
And I said yes,
but that was then.

00:23:30.976 --> 00:23:32.850 align:middle line:84%
You now here in this
life have an opportunity

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:34.440 align:middle line:90%
to make up for that.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We all think
we have past lives.

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:37.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But is it
conceivable we don't, somebody

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.380 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have one?

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:41.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Is it conceivable?

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:44.730 align:middle line:84%
I think what is conceivable
is that they don't have

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:46.530 align:middle line:90%
a past life on this planet.

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:48.540 align:middle line:84%
They might have a past
life on other planets, so

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:50.335 align:middle line:90%
other dimensions.

00:23:50.335 --> 00:23:53.170 align:middle line:84%
Because there are dimensions
as well as other planets.

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:58.830 align:middle line:84%
So what we call a past
life is really soul journey

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:01.650 align:middle line:84%
from one life to another
on this planet in life

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:03.040 align:middle line:90%
as we know it here.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you think here would
be very rare if somebody didn't

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:08.310 align:middle line:90%
have a direct past life at all.

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes, it would be rare.

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:11.140 align:middle line:90%
It would be rare.

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Georgina, there's
a case of a woman who

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:14.640 align:middle line:90%
had some kind of trauma.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:15.870 align:middle line:90%
She went to sleep.

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:18.780 align:middle line:84%
She woke up and she's speaking
in a British accent all

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:19.650 align:middle line:90%
of a sudden.

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:21.460 align:middle line:90%
She never had that before.

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, doctors diagnosed
her of having some kind

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:26.340 align:middle line:90%
of foreign tongue syndrome.

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:27.750 align:middle line:90%
But how bizarre is that?

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:28.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: It's very bizarre.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.170 align:middle line:84%
All I can think of,
she might have heard it

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:34.440 align:middle line:84%
at some point in her life and
it went into a subconscious.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And she-- because of the
accident-- recalled it.

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:39.070 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea
what that could be.

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:41.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's
take a little look.

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:45.000 align:middle line:10%
>>MICHELLE MEYERS: September
17, 2011 was the first time.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.140 align:middle line:10%
And I was like,
oh, OK, something's

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:50.140 align:middle line:10%
really wrong with me,
is all I'm thinking.

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:53.799 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, imagine going to sleep
American and waking up British.

00:24:53.799 --> 00:24:56.340 align:middle line:10%
Happened to a valley woman who's
never even left the country.

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:57.140 align:middle line:10%
>> This is crazy.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.040 align:middle line:84%
Only ABC15's Jason
Valentine sat down

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.100 align:middle line:84%
with her tonight to explain
this really bizarre and rare

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.800 align:middle line:90%
medical reality.

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:08.070 align:middle line:10%
>>MEYERS: Everyone
only sees Mary Poppins.

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:09.360 align:middle line:10%
Oh, here is Mary Poppins.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.210 align:middle line:10%
>>JASON VALENTINE: Not a British
nanny, this former Texas beauty

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:14.040 align:middle line:10%
queen has never left the USA.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.790 align:middle line:10%
>>MEYERS: Who would
do this for attention?

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:16.320 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.403 align:middle line:10%
>>VALENTINE: Three times,
Michelle Meyers has gone

00:25:18.403 --> 00:25:19.890 align:middle line:10%
to sleep with
blinding headaches,

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:21.660 align:middle line:10%
waking up with
different accents--

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:23.970 align:middle line:10%
Irish, Australian, and British--

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:25.230 align:middle line:10%
for the past couple of years.

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:27.600 align:middle line:10%
>>MEYERS: They send in a
psychiatrist at the hospital.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.430 align:middle line:10%
They make sure
you're not a loon.

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:31.230 align:middle line:10%
>>VALENTINE: Not
crazy, not faking it,

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:34.170 align:middle line:10%
she was diagnosed with
foreign accent syndrome--

00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:36.300 align:middle line:10%
a rare condition that
usually accompanies

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:39.582 align:middle line:10%
a stroke, neurological damage,
or underlying health issue.

00:25:39.582 --> 00:25:41.040 align:middle line:10%
>>MEYERS: When I
was a little girl,

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.554 align:middle line:10%

And it's an interesting and
exciting time for the client.

begin to really see their soul.

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:52.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Things would be better.

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: We're going to.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would females
take us into war?

00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:58.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: I don't think so.

00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:01.470 align:middle line:90%
I could be wrong.

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:02.270 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:04.853 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm trying to think of
female leaders that we've had.

00:32:04.853 --> 00:32:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Because females care
more about their children.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.480 align:middle line:90%
They care more about family.

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:11.970 align:middle line:84%
They care more about life
than they do territory.

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's an interesting
thing you bring up.

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:15.262 align:middle line:90%
It's a very strange paradox.

00:32:15.262 --> 00:32:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Yeah, I didn't want
to sound sort of-- you know--

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, I know.

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: But I really think
that women care more about war

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:27.230 align:middle line:84%
as the reason you send
your children off to kill

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:30.920 align:middle line:84%
and be killed That's
not inbred that way.

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about "The
Third Circle Protocol",

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:33.940 align:middle line:90%
that new book.

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: "The Third Circle"
is about relationships,

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:39.140 align:middle line:84%
the unspoken
contract that we all

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:42.410 align:middle line:84%
have first with ourselves,
and then with each other.

00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:43.670 align:middle line:90%
You and I have a contract.

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:47.420 align:middle line:84%
You have expectations of me,
I have expectations of you.

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's not
spoken, generally,

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:54.540 align:middle line:84%
between lovers, employees
and employers, teenagers.

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:57.477 align:middle line:84%
Teenagers love this
protocol, by the way,

00:32:57.477 --> 00:32:59.060 align:middle line:84%
because it gives
them power to develop

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:00.320 align:middle line:90%
a contract with their parents.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are teenagers even
developing relationships

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:03.320 align:middle line:90%
anymore?

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:04.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Well, they have one
whether they like it or not

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:05.810 align:middle line:90%
with their parents.

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:07.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, that's true.

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: So it's based on what
you absolutely need in every

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:12.080 align:middle line:84%
relationship--
what do you want--

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.790 align:middle line:84%
and what are you
prepared to give.

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:14.850 align:middle line:90%
What are your values?

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:16.380 align:middle line:90%
What are your priorities?

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:17.510 align:middle line:90%
So really understand them.

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And it gets back
to the core of what

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:22.292 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about before, of
totally understanding yourself.

00:33:22.292 --> 00:33:23.750 align:middle line:84%
When you really
understand yourself

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:25.940 align:middle line:84%
and what your motivation
is, then you're

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.670 align:middle line:84%
prepared to have a
relationship with your best

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:30.460 align:middle line:90%
self with other people.

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it make
you a better person?

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:33.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:35.187 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it absolutely does.

00:33:35.187 --> 00:33:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:38.870 align:middle line:84%
An interview with Gaia's
"Open Minds", an expert

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:42.590 align:middle line:84%
talked about the
possibility of decoding

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:46.120 align:middle line:84%
through numerology
contacts with other lives.

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:48.737 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, what happens
when you have people--

00:33:48.737 --> 00:33:51.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've all been through
probably, most of these phases,

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:55.080 align:middle line:84%
where you just fall just
obsessively madly in love.

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.780 align:middle line:90%
But it's really not--

00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:58.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's only
there to teach you,

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.160 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily
there to please you.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:04.100 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about what is
kind of the dynamics of that?

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I call these kind of
cauldron-type relationships,

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:10.949 align:middle line:84%
where it's like we
can't help ourselves.

00:34:10.949 --> 00:34:13.460 align:middle line:84%
We get pulled in usually
by one or two karmic--

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:15.920 align:middle line:90%
or also Goloks, for example--

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.210 align:middle line:90%
if I had a talent--

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:20.239 align:middle line:84%
8, which is about grounding--
and you had a goal 8,

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:22.739 align:middle line:84%
we'd be drawn together
to help ground you.

00:34:22.739 --> 00:34:26.139 align:middle line:84%
And the more locks you
have in the overlay charts,

00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:27.859 align:middle line:90%
the tighter the energy is.

00:34:27.859 --> 00:34:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's very hard to
escape, because you're just

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:32.540 align:middle line:84%
magnetically bolted
to each other.

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
then is that you're

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:36.679 align:middle line:90%
doing what I call a karma.

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:38.350 align:middle line:90%
And part of us feels--

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:40.280 align:middle line:90%
I know this is not good for me.

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.145 align:middle line:90%
In fact, what am I doing here?

00:34:42.145 --> 00:34:44.545 align:middle line:84%
And I've had clients say to
me, I walked down the aisle.

00:34:44.545 --> 00:34:45.920 align:middle line:84%
I knew I shouldn't
be doing this,

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:46.950 align:middle line:90%
but I couldn't help myself.

00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:47.440 align:middle line:90%
>> I've done that.

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:48.240 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.520 align:middle line:90%
>> It's like, what happened?

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And then, 5, 10 years
later, two kids.

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:54.440 align:middle line:90%
I can't do this anymore.

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.690 align:middle line:90%
It's killing me.

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:57.602 align:middle line:84%
But I've grown enormously
in the process.

00:34:57.602 --> 00:34:58.403 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:34:58.403 --> 00:34:59.202 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:34:59.202 --> 00:35:00.530 align:middle line:90%
>> So this is what creates it.

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's all
pre-plannedness It's

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:04.900 align:middle line:84%
a pre-contractual,
pre-birth arrangement.

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:07.663 align:middle line:84%
And there's actually often
nothing you can do about it.

00:35:07.663 --> 00:35:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I don't
know if I agree with that.

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:11.193 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: I don't agree with it.

00:35:11.193 --> 00:35:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's he saying, that
go with your gut instinct only?

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.490 align:middle line:90%
Or what?

00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:18.989 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Well, what I heard
was that it's all pre-planned.

00:35:18.989 --> 00:35:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Already
charted out for you.

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:21.905 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: And You
have no choice.

00:35:21.905 --> 00:35:23.804 align:middle line:84%
And I absolutely
don't agree with that.

00:35:23.804 --> 00:35:25.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, I think we
have free choice, too.

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:29.530 align:middle line:84%
I think we have the ability
to control our own destiny.

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Cards may be dealt
to us, but you

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:33.366 align:middle line:84%
have to shuffle them
a different way.

00:35:33.366 --> 00:35:34.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Absolutely.

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And you have to make use of
what you know about yourself

00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:42.580 align:middle line:84%
to really live your life in the
best way you can for yourself,

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:44.410 align:middle line:90%
and for humanity, I believe.

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:47.920 align:middle line:90%
Kindness is a tenet.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:54.160 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Why don't we teach
relationships, reincarnation,

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:56.150 align:middle line:10%
and things like that in schools?

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:58.560 align:middle line:84%
These are subjects
that are taboo.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:35:59.360 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: They've
started a little bit.

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:03.250 align:middle line:84%
Some schools are
teaching meditation

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:05.030 align:middle line:90%
to kids, even little kids.

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's important.

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:07.546 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: And
that's the beginning

00:36:07.546 --> 00:36:09.970 align:middle line:84%
of teaching them
self-awareness, of teaching them

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:14.740 align:middle line:84%
to be their best self, and
calming themselves and using

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:17.410 align:middle line:84%
their aptitudes in
a way that's best

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:19.967 align:middle line:90%
for them and for each other.

00:36:19.967 --> 00:36:20.800 align:middle line:90%
That's an awareness.

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.370 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's a beginning.

00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:23.680 align:middle line:90%
And hopefully, it will grow.

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:26.140 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: There is a yoga
school near my studio

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:28.840 align:middle line:10%
in Los Angeles that started
up in business about

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:30.500 align:middle line:10%
seven months ago.

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:33.940 align:middle line:10%
And I can tell by
the parking lot

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:36.760 align:middle line:10%
that it's growing
by leaps and bounds,

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.560 align:middle line:10%
because more and more people
are beginning to experience

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:41.490 align:middle line:10%
meditation through yoga.

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's absolutely
huge right now.

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:45.562 align:middle line:84%
It's starting to
catch on, isn't it?

00:36:45.562 --> 00:36:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: It is, it is.

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.170 align:middle line:90%
It's starting to catch on.

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:52.840 align:middle line:84%
I just wish they would teach
hypnosis, self-hypnosis

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:55.480 align:middle line:84%
through all schools
so that all kids could

00:36:55.480 --> 00:37:00.610 align:middle line:84%
learn to have self-esteem,
self value, and focus.

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:03.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you call
this self-hypnosis?

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:06.310 align:middle line:90%
You're driving your car.

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And you get from
point A to point

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:11.950 align:middle line:84%
B, which may be 25
minutes, and you

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:13.450 align:middle line:90%
have no idea how you got there.

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:14.408 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: That's right.

00:37:14.408 --> 00:37:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You just
go, whoa, whoa.

00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:18.019 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're in full
control of your car.

00:37:18.019 --> 00:37:19.810 align:middle line:84%
If some car had pulled
out in front of you,

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:21.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you'd brake
and everything else.

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:25.900 align:middle line:84%
But you do not recall how
you got from point A to B.

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:29.350 align:middle line:84%
You have this gap in this
whole driving distance.

00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:30.520 align:middle line:90%
What is that called?

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:33.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: It's called
hypnosis, life trance.

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:35.230 align:middle line:84%
We live in life
trance all the time.

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:38.260 align:middle line:84%
Adam Crabtree wrote a
book called "Trance Zero",

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.840 align:middle line:84%
in which he says, we
all live in trance.

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's our job as
clinical hypnotists

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:45.310 align:middle line:84%
to change one
trance for another.

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:47.890 align:middle line:84%
90% of what we do
every day, George, is

00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:49.270 align:middle line:90%
what we did yesterday--

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:50.530 align:middle line:90%
90%.

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And for those of us
who are creative,

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:54.550 align:middle line:84%
we think, oh, that's
a little unfortunate.

00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:56.300 align:middle line:84%
I thought we were more
creative than that.

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:59.580 align:middle line:90%
But in truth, 90% is automatic.

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:02.700 align:middle line:84%
If it's automatic, it comes
from the subconscious.

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:05.230 align:middle line:84%
If it comes from the
subconscious, it's trance.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:07.210 align:middle line:90%
It's habit, it's pattern.

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:13.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What amount of people
want hypnosis and come to you,

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.580 align:middle line:84%
but what's the reason
they come to you?

00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:19.180 align:middle line:84%
What's that catalyst
that gets them to say,

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:20.606 align:middle line:90%
I've got to get hypnotized?

00:38:20.606 --> 00:38:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Usually, they come
because they say, I'm stuck.

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:24.200 align:middle line:90%
I can't seem to move forward.

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:26.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --want to stop
smoking or stop drinking?

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:28.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Not anymore.

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:30.680 align:middle line:90%
Smoking has slowed down.

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.150 align:middle line:90%
Less people are smoking.

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:34.370 align:middle line:90%
Stress is a big one.

00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:36.060 align:middle line:84%
But they come and
they say, I'm stuck.

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:36.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm stuck in life.

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:38.690 align:middle line:84%
I can't seem to get
satisfaction out

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:41.870 align:middle line:84%
of anything-- my relationships,
my job, anything.

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:42.950 align:middle line:90%
I need clarity.

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:45.260 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What will hypnosis do?

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Usually, find out
the reason why they're stuck.

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:49.550 align:middle line:90%
Because we do regression back.

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:54.132 align:middle line:84%
I ask them what major
emotions they carry.

00:38:54.132 --> 00:38:55.340 align:middle line:90%
How much anger do they carry.

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:59.770 align:middle line:84%
How much fear, how much low
self-esteem, how much anxiety.

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And I measure it so that
they can see the difference.

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.280 align:middle line:90%
And then, we work on that.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And they find that
they loosen up.

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Because if they're
operating life

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:10.190 align:middle line:84%
through what I call
a dirty window,

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:13.010 align:middle line:84%
if they're operating life
through anger, or sadness,

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:17.130 align:middle line:84%
or grief, or low self-esteem,
then they can't move forward.

00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:20.360 align:middle line:84%
My goal is to help people find
their magnificence, that's

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:21.380 align:middle line:90%
my goal.

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And I use hypnosis to
help them get there.

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always been told
that you cannot force someone

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:30.420 align:middle line:84%
to do something they don't
want to do under hypnosis.

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:31.310 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:32.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes, absolutely.

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then where do we get
these Manchurian Candidates,

00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:36.940 align:middle line:84%
or so-called rumors
of these people

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:40.150 align:middle line:84%
who have been mind
washed to do things

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:41.570 align:middle line:90%
beyond what they want to do?

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:43.132 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: It's usually chemical.

00:39:43.132 --> 00:39:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They induce
them with chemicals?

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yeah, usually.

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But they can do this.

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:48.136 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Through chemicals.

00:39:48.136 --> 00:39:49.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Through chemicals.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.570 align:middle line:90%
So if Sirhan Sirhan--

00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:53.990 align:middle line:84%
the apparent assassin
of Robert F Kennedy--

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:57.330 align:middle line:84%
claims that he can't
remember what he did,

00:39:57.330 --> 00:40:01.340 align:middle line:84%
yet he was clearly there and may
have been the only assassin--

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:03.890 align:middle line:84%
but there may have been
others, it's possible--

00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:06.500 align:middle line:84%
but the fact that he
can't recollect it

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:10.010 align:middle line:84%
and he's telling the
truth tells you what?

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: It tells me that his
neuroplasticity was shut down

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:14.570 align:middle line:90%
somehow.

00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:16.220 align:middle line:84%
His neural pathways
were shut down.

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somebody could
have done that to him.

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:18.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yeah.

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:19.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.720 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of scary.

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Oh, it's scary if
you allow yourself to go there.

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.920 align:middle line:84%
That's why I believe
that everyone

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.900 align:middle line:84%
should be taking charge
of their own brainwaves

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:31.812 align:middle line:90%
in their own brain.

of your own brain waves,

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:39.210 align:middle line:84%
let's take a few moments and
have you try to hypnotize me.

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:41.370 align:middle line:90%
There's no specific reason.

00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:42.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't necessarily want--

00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:44.780 align:middle line:84%
or, do you want to
past life regress me?

00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:46.500 align:middle line:90%
What do you prefer?

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: First of
all, I think it's

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:52.020 align:middle line:84%
important to understand that
all hypnosis is self-hypnosis.

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:55.830 align:middle line:84%
So you have to allow it
and to want it to happen.

00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:58.910 align:middle line:84%
If you're agreeable to that,
then we'll see where we go.

you want revealed?

take a deep breath?

00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:20.032 align:middle line:90%
Relax back into your chair.

unplanned, folks.

>>CANNON: Relax back
into your chair.

Take a deep breath,
and close your eyes.

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And know that at any time, you
can move your legs if you wish.

You can move your arms.

That's right.

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And just begin to
follow your breathing

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:44.900 align:middle line:84%
and notice the coolness
of the in-breath,

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:48.520 align:middle line:84%

the out breath.

90% of the time.

If you need to move your
legs or feet, that's OK too.

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Feel as though your arms are
getting heavy, loose, limp.

00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:17.030 align:middle line:90%


00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:21.270 align:middle line:84%
Every third out breath takes
you down twice as deeply,

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:22.530 align:middle line:90%
automatically.

00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This could
put you to sleep.

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Easily.

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:30.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a good idea, have
a good night's sleep.

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you going
to ask me things?

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.750 align:middle line:90%
Or do I just blurt them out?

00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: I'm going
to ask you things.

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:40.450 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if you can
imagine a line that

00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:45.070 align:middle line:84%
stretches from your past, to
your present, to your future.

00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:47.650 align:middle line:84%
This could be in front
of you, or behind you,

00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:50.600 align:middle line:90%
and in front of you.

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And right where we are
today on that line,

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:55.270 align:middle line:90%
put a big flag that says, today.

00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:56.160 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine that?

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hmm.

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:57.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Good.

00:44:57.810 --> 00:45:00.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, I wonder if you can lift
yourself up above that line,

00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:04.910 align:middle line:84%
as if you're on the back of
a magic bird or a carpet.

00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And drift back, and back,
and back, and back, and back.

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.437 align:middle line:90%
And come on down on that line.

00:45:11.437 --> 00:45:14.570 align:middle line:90%


00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And find yourself in
the womb of your mother.

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine, it's
a dark, warm place

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:25.540 align:middle line:90%
with the sound of the heartbeat.

00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:28.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm sucking my thumb.

00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: You can feel the
rhythm of the heart around you,

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:37.360 align:middle line:84%
gentle movements and sounds,
the rhythm of the heartbeat

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.940 align:middle line:90%
all around you.

00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder if you can feel
any emotion while you're

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:48.640 align:middle line:90%
in the womb from your mother.

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:49.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I hear voices.

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:50.938 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Good.

00:45:50.938 --> 00:45:52.280 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I hear voices of her
talking to, I guess, my father.

00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:00.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: OK.

00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And how do you
feel in this place?

00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm getting anxious
to see who's talking.

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: OK, so feel
yourself now going and growing

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:15.650 align:middle line:90%
towards birthing.

00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And you come into the
world a brand new baby

00:46:17.810 --> 00:46:22.310 align:middle line:84%
filled with joy and curiosity,
which is your birthright.

00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:27.013 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The doctor is saying,
look how much hair he has.

00:46:27.013 --> 00:46:30.190 align:middle line:90%


00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Can you hear
your mother's voice?

00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, no, not yet.

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:37.677 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: OK.

00:46:37.677 --> 00:46:39.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they're
all in this room.

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:41.840 align:middle line:90%
There's commotion.

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:42.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: OK.

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:45.010 align:middle line:84%
How does that feel for
you coming into the world?

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's cold.

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:47.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yeah.

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:50.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's cold.

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Move yourself
along from that moment,

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:59.710 align:middle line:84%
along the line to about the
age of 2, a little toddler.

00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:02.600 align:middle line:84%
Cute little boy, very
curious, very bright.

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:05.820 align:middle line:90%


00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Everything's new
for the first time.

00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:11.710 align:middle line:90%
So much fun, 2 years old.

00:47:11.710 --> 00:47:17.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't have a
care in the world, nothing.

00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:18.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: What do you feel?

00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:19.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fun.

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:20.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Fun.

00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:21.970 align:middle line:90%
good.

00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:24.140 align:middle line:90%
Can you hear laughing?

00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:26.250 align:middle line:90%
Do you smell or feel?

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm just
enjoying things.

00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:30.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Enjoying things, OK.

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:36.670 align:middle line:84%
So move along the timeline
now towards the age of four.

00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:40.120 align:middle line:84%
No longer a toddler, but
a little boy, a very cute

00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:49.898 align:middle line:84%
little kid, beginning to develop
a personality, 4 years old.

00:47:49.898 --> 00:47:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm sitting
down with crayons,

00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:57.830 align:middle line:90%
and I'm just sketching things.

00:47:57.830 --> 00:48:00.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Anybody with you?

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think my father's
sitting across the table.

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:08.010 align:middle line:90%
And I'm making animal pictures.

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:09.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: What
colors are you using?

00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:10.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Orange--

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:11.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Orange.

00:48:11.770 --> 00:48:12.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --and red.

00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:16.440 align:middle line:90%


00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:17.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: What are the animals?

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dogs.

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Dogs, cool.

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:22.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 4 years old, I think.

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yeah, OK.

00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And let's move forward now along
the timeline, two the age of 6.

00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you're at school,
knew people in your life--

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:40.230 align:middle line:84%
friends, teachers, expectations
differently, 6 years old.

00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:44.870 align:middle line:90%


00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Tell me where you
are at 6 years old.

00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:48.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm lost.

00:48:48.830 --> 00:48:53.640 align:middle line:84%
I can't find my way home
from school, and I'm crying.

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And so some kid who said that
he lives next to me said,

00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:01.240 align:middle line:90%
I know where you live.

00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:04.650 align:middle line:90%
And so he's bringing me home.

00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:07.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: What are
you wearing, George?

00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just a t-shirt
and corduroys, blue.

00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Are you
carrying anything?

00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:16.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:19.640 align:middle line:84%
But he found my street,
which was really only two

00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:20.780 align:middle line:90%
blocks from the school.

00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:23.564 align:middle line:90%


00:49:23.564 --> 00:49:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And my mother apologizing,
because she was late to come

00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:28.452 align:middle line:90%
get me.

00:49:28.452 --> 00:49:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: And what did
she do when she saw you?

00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:32.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, a big hug.

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:32.990 align:middle line:90%
I was crying.

00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:35.304 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yeah, yeah.

00:49:35.304 --> 00:49:36.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because
I was lost, maybe

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:39.360 align:middle line:84%
crying because I
found my way home.

00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:41.681 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: And how does it
feel to be lost like that?

00:49:41.681 --> 00:49:42.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was scary.

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:45.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yeah, yeah.

00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I was
only two blocks away.

00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:50.140 align:middle line:90%
I really wasn't lost.

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Does that happen
anywhere else in your life,

00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:53.446 align:middle line:90%
where you're--

00:49:53.446 --> 00:49:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, and
I stayed friends

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:56.617 align:middle line:84%
with the little kid
who found me for years.

00:49:56.617 --> 00:49:57.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: What's his name?

00:49:57.700 --> 00:49:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Reggie.

00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:02.176 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Reggie, yeah.

00:50:02.176 --> 00:50:03.810 align:middle line:90%
And Reggie lives next door?

00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He did.

00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:05.568 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: He did, yeah.

00:50:05.568 --> 00:50:07.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In Detroit.

00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:08.390 align:middle line:90%
Good kid.

00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yeah.

00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Let's move forward now
in time, to maybe age 12.

00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:21.370 align:middle line:84%
Coming forward, growing,
developing, 12 years old.

00:50:21.370 --> 00:50:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not much
recollection there.

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:25.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Well, just feel it.

00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:28.360 align:middle line:90%
Just go from 6.

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I just see myself
playing, and active,

00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:37.060 align:middle line:84%
and busy in sports,
but comfortable.

00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:38.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Comfortable.

00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:40.900 align:middle line:90%


00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Is there any time where
there was a secret,

00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:46.620 align:middle line:84%
you did something
with some friends you

00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:49.810 align:middle line:90%
hoped no one would find out?

00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I was pretty
straight most of the time.

00:50:56.010 --> 00:50:58.870 align:middle line:84%
There was a time where the
neighborhood kids attacked me

00:50:58.870 --> 00:51:03.520 align:middle line:84%
with squirt guns and
I went home crying.

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And my mom told me to
invite them all over.

00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:08.650 align:middle line:90%
And I said, why?

00:51:08.650 --> 00:51:10.120 align:middle line:90%
Look what they've done to me.

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:12.380 align:middle line:90%
She said, just do it.

00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:13.630 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:15.550 align:middle line:90%
I said, come back over.

00:51:15.550 --> 00:51:17.670 align:middle line:90%
And they all came.

00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And then, she came from behind
them with a bucket of water

00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:23.310 align:middle line:90%
and dumped it on all of them.

00:51:23.310 --> 00:51:26.610 align:middle line:84%
I'll never forget
that, nor will they.

00:51:26.610 --> 00:51:27.930 align:middle line:90%
They left me alone after that.

00:51:27.930 --> 00:51:29.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yeah.

00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:30.932 align:middle line:90%
That says a lot about your mom.

00:51:30.932 --> 00:51:31.890 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about your mom.

00:51:31.890 --> 00:51:33.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, great
lady, still alive.

00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:35.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yeah, OK.

00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 88 years old.

00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Still very influential, caring,
listens to my radio show,

00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:46.950 align:middle line:84%
critiques it, wants the
books from the guests.

00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:50.010 align:middle line:90%
She'll probably want yours.

00:51:50.010 --> 00:51:52.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: So tell me,
George, when you feel

00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:54.870 align:middle line:84%
those feelings of
being in the womb

00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:57.730 align:middle line:84%
and you notice the
changes that you

00:51:57.730 --> 00:51:59.950 align:middle line:84%
were born with joy and
curiosity that you've

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:04.580 align:middle line:84%
carried through your life, What
else did you learn as a child

00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:08.230 align:middle line:84%
that you can bring
with you into adulthood

00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:10.480 align:middle line:90%
that will benefit you?

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:12.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I learned
things about never giving

00:52:12.370 --> 00:52:17.460 align:middle line:84%
up, never stopping, trying
to help others as much

00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:19.050 align:middle line:90%
as you could.

00:52:19.050 --> 00:52:22.686 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that's why I do what I do.

00:52:22.686 --> 00:52:24.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Well, thank
that part of you.

00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:27.885 align:middle line:84%
Thank that part of you for
healing others and helping

00:52:27.885 --> 00:52:28.685 align:middle line:90%
others.

00:52:28.685 --> 00:52:31.310 align:middle line:90%


00:52:31.310 --> 00:52:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that's part of the
DNA you got from your mother.

00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:36.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yeah.

00:52:37.650 --> 00:52:38.820 align:middle line:90%
So we need to honor that.

00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a mission
that I'm obsessed with.

00:52:43.850 --> 00:52:46.232 align:middle line:90%
And I just keep going.

00:52:46.232 --> 00:52:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: So we
need to honor that.

00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:52.792 align:middle line:84%
Thank that part of us,
not take it for granted.

00:52:52.792 --> 00:52:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready,
just bring yourself back

00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:57.820 align:middle line:90%
into full awareness.

00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:06.530 align:middle line:90%
5, 4, 3, 2, and 1.

00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Peaceful,
very, very peaceful.

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:16.060 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel as if I
was on a different planet

00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:17.140 align:middle line:90%
or someplace else.

00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:20.340 align:middle line:90%
But it was somewhere.

00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yeah.

00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's very light trance,
because you were very aware.

00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And you talked about
the past, as opposed

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:29.220 align:middle line:84%
to being in the present, except
when you were in the womb.

00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:30.900 align:middle line:90%
That was very different.

00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:32.772 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did I
really hear voices?

00:53:32.772 --> 00:53:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Where
would it come from?

00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:35.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:37.903 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: So you're very
connected to your subconscious.

00:53:37.903 --> 00:53:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So when you
past life people,

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:42.870 align:middle line:84%
do you take them through
these kinds of symptoms?

00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And I assume for a past life,
you go even further back,

00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:46.830 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Oh, all
the way back, yes.

00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:50.064 align:middle line:90%
And the soul--

00:53:50.064 --> 00:53:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You might have
been able to do that with me

00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:54.090 align:middle line:90%
at that point, today, right?

00:53:54.090 --> 00:53:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Maybe.

00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:57.130 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:53:57.130 --> 00:53:59.670 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:01.560 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
to make sure is

00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:04.550 align:middle line:84%
that they have permission from
the soul to take that journey.

00:54:04.550 --> 00:54:07.050 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes, they don't
have permission from the soul.

00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:09.900 align:middle line:84%
There's something they need to
deal with in this life first.

00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Should everyone
go through hypnosis,

00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:15.780 align:middle line:84%
or a past life, whether
they think anything's

00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:17.070 align:middle line:90%
wrong with them or not?

00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:19.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Oh, I wouldn't
tell anybody what to do.

00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:20.150 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they have to want to.

00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you recommend?
do you think they should?

00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: I recommend
that it gives you insight.

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:26.040 align:middle line:84%
It gives you understanding about
your life, and who you are,

00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:27.190 align:middle line:84%
and why you react
the way you do.

00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:28.815 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think that
it's kind of cool

00:54:28.815 --> 00:54:31.740 align:middle line:84%
that I recollect hearing
voices when I was in the womb.

00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:32.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:34.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that is
probably medically very

00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:36.280 align:middle line:90%
conceivable, isn't it?

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:37.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: So to speak, yeah.

00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:40.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, if they were
to play loud horrible music--

00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: --you
would have heard it.

00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:42.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --I would
have heard that.

00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:43.340 align:middle line:90%
It would have been jarring.

00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yeah.

00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:45.720 align:middle line:84%
Interesting, a
couple of the people

00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:49.320 align:middle line:84%
who've come in for
hypnosis because they

00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:52.500 align:middle line:84%
have low self-esteem,
when I took them back

00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:56.434 align:middle line:84%
to the very beginning of that
feeling of low self-esteem,

00:54:56.434 --> 00:54:58.850 align:middle line:84%
at the moment they were born,
they heard their father say,

00:54:58.850 --> 00:55:00.960 align:middle line:90%
oh, not another girl.

00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:04.580 align:middle line:84%
So that was locked into them
as not being good enough.

00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:07.136 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wasn't accepted,
that kind of thing.

00:55:07.136 --> 00:55:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Whatever I do,
I'll never be good enough.

00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:11.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do you take
your career, Georgina?

00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:13.560 align:middle line:90%
What do you do next?

00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Well, I'm
teaching at university now,

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:16.895 align:middle line:90%
which I love to teach.

00:55:16.895 --> 00:55:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do you teach?

00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: I teach
hypnosis and NLP

00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:22.950 align:middle line:90%
at the University of Toronto.

00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:26.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm in the clinic still,
and I'm still writing books.

00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:30.830 align:middle line:84%
So I will keep
doing what I'm doing

00:55:30.830 --> 00:55:32.936 align:middle line:90%
as long as I can stand up.

00:55:32.936 --> 00:55:34.310 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Have you
ever past lived

00:55:34.310 --> 00:55:38.980 align:middle line:10%
someone who lived such a
horrendous life, it even scared

00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:40.420 align:middle line:10%
you?

00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Not that scared me,
but it brought me to tears.

00:55:43.090 --> 00:55:46.090 align:middle line:84%
I had to remove myself
so I wasn't crying,

00:55:46.090 --> 00:55:47.650 align:middle line:90%
getting in the way.

00:55:47.650 --> 00:55:50.290 align:middle line:84%
They lived a series
of terrible lives

00:55:50.290 --> 00:55:53.850 align:middle line:90%
of victimhood or perpetrators.

00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:55.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And did you
make them feel better?

00:55:55.810 --> 00:55:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Well, the
thing is, the soul

00:55:57.850 --> 00:55:59.951 align:middle line:90%
heals along the process.

00:55:59.951 --> 00:56:01.450 align:middle line:84%
So they come into
that, then they're

00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:04.060 align:middle line:90%
drained when they come back.

00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:05.230 align:middle line:90%
And then they realize--

00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:08.180 align:middle line:84%
for instance, the one
person I remember,

00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:10.840 align:middle line:84%
he's working with
people who have AIDS

00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:12.470 align:middle line:90%
on the streets of New York.

00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:15.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's what he's doing
in this life to make up.

00:56:15.070 --> 00:56:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't even
know why he's doing it.

00:56:17.050 --> 00:56:17.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But it's there.

00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:18.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: It's there.

00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:18.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:56:18.730 --> 00:56:20.050 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being on the program.

00:56:20.050 --> 00:56:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Oh,
you're very welcome.

00:56:21.110 --> 00:56:21.790 align:middle line:90%
It's been a pleasure.

00:56:21.790 --> 00:56:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "The Third
Circle Protocol"

00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:25.480 align:middle line:84%
is Georgina Cannon's
latest book.

00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:27.520 align:middle line:90%
And it's well worth reading.

00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And some of the things that
she's talked about today

00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.280 align:middle line:84%
are well worth practicing,
meditating and trying

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.000 align:middle line:90%
to find your inner self.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, thanks for
watching "Beyond Belief".
