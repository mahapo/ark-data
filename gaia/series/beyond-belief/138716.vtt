>>GEORGE NOORY: Did you
know what you're eating

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.570 align:middle line:90%
could be poison?

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.830 align:middle line:10%
I'm not kidding you--

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.700 align:middle line:10%
actual poison from
genetically modified foods,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.440 align:middle line:10%
things that could harm you.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.920 align:middle line:90%
Our guest on "Beyond Belief"--

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.050 align:middle line:90%
Jeffery Smith.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.780 align:middle line:84%
He's the executive
director of the Institute

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.880 align:middle line:90%
of Responsible Technology.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.090 align:middle line:84%
He is also a leading
expert in the dangers

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.640 align:middle line:90%
of genetically modified foods.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.236 align:middle line:84%
Eating genetically modified
foods could hurt you,

00:00:45.236 --> 00:00:46.110 align:middle line:90%
couldn't it, Jeffrey?

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.860 align:middle line:90%
>>JEFFREY SMITH: Absolutely.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.568 align:middle line:10%
More and more, we're
getting to the point

00:00:48.568 --> 00:00:52.410 align:middle line:10%
that it may be creating enormous
diseases across the United

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.620 align:middle line:10%
States and around the world.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we just
don't know it, do we?

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.400 align:middle line:90%
As individuals.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Most recent
study, 25% of Americans

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.970 align:middle line:90%
have a fatty liver problem.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:01.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It turns
out that Roundup,

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.020 align:middle line:84%
which is sprayed on most
GMOs, at tiny concentrations

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.549 align:middle line:84%
promotes that type
of fatty liver.

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in all of this?

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: In 1996 I
went to a lecture

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.550 align:middle line:84%
from a scientist who was a
genetic engineer who blew

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.230 align:middle line:90%
the whistle on the technology.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.280 align:middle line:84%
He knew that it was
completely unsafe,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.670 align:middle line:84%
that there are all sorts
of unpredicted side effects

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.690 align:middle line:90%
that can occur.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And yet Monsanto was
going to go ahead and feed

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.770 align:middle line:84%
the products of
this infant science

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.080 align:middle line:84%
to the entire population
and release it

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.600 align:middle line:84%
in the environment, where the
self-propagating pollution

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.820 align:middle line:84%
of the gene pool through
cross pollination,

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.820 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, would last
essentially forever.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.990 align:middle line:84%
When I heard about that, it
became an A-plus emergency,

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.150 align:middle line:84%
like the highest
level of concern.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.760 align:middle line:84%
Because again-- everyone
who eats, all living beings,

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.290 align:middle line:90%
and all future generations.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, I've got to say,
whenever we deal with GMOs

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.660 align:middle line:84%
and you on "Coast
to Coast," we've

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.236 align:middle line:84%
always called Monsanto
for a statement.

00:01:54.236 --> 00:01:55.860 align:middle line:84%
They really don't
want to get involved.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, no.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.680 align:middle line:90%
And they won't debate me.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And see, the thing
is, we've always

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.930 align:middle line:90%
won the scientific debates.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.060 align:middle line:84%
So instead, they
try and discredit

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.347 align:middle line:84%
through a kind of internet group
of fake academics and front

00:02:06.347 --> 00:02:08.430 align:middle line:84%
people that were recently
exposed by "The New York

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.090 align:middle line:90%
Times."

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.548 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What I want to talk
with you about today, Jeffrey,

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:15.180 align:middle line:84%
new technologies with GMOs,
labeling issues, and what's

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.375 align:middle line:84%
happening around the country
there and everything else.

00:02:18.375 --> 00:02:19.500 align:middle line:90%
But here's the other thing.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.545 align:middle line:84%
You go into a supermarket,
and you pick a tomato.

00:02:22.545 --> 00:02:24.045 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they taste
like cardboard,

00:02:24.045 --> 00:02:28.050 align:middle line:84%
by the way, or some
corn or soybeans

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.000 align:middle line:90%
or whatever the products may be.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.984 align:middle line:84%
How we know that we're
eating GMO foods?

00:02:33.984 --> 00:02:36.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, if it's the
basic fruit or vegetable,

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.160 align:middle line:90%
you don't unless it's organic.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.225 align:middle line:84%
But you also have to know
which GMOs are out there.

00:02:41.225 --> 00:02:42.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So when
we're in a store

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.510 align:middle line:84%
and we're picking out
tomatoes or corn or soybeans,

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.210 align:middle line:84%
how do we know that we're
picking up GMO foods?

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you eating
genetically modified foods?

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.030 align:middle line:84%
Which foods contain Genetically
Modified Ingredients, or GMOs?

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.780 align:middle line:84%
How do you know if a food is
genetically modified or not?

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Which foods are
natural, and which foods

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.630 align:middle line:84%
were genetically engineered
by scientists in a laboratory?

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So, Jeffrey,
how do we know?

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, if it's
organic, it's not GMO.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.819 align:middle line:90%
It's not supposed to be.

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.610 align:middle line:84%
But if you're going to
the produce section,

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.830 align:middle line:84%
you have to know which
are the potential GMOs.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.680 align:middle line:10%
In fact, there's
only 11 GMOs that

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.390 align:middle line:10%
have been commercialized
right now-- soy, corn, cotton,

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.040 align:middle line:10%
canola, sugar beets, which
is used for sugar, alfalfa,

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.160 align:middle line:10%
and then papaya from
Hawaii or China, zucchini

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.190 align:middle line:10%
or yellow squash, and two
new ones introduced just

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.296 align:middle line:10%
recently-- apples and potatoes.

00:03:42.296 --> 00:03:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
about tomatoes?

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Tomatoes were taken
off the market years ago.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.250 align:middle line:84%
They were the first genetically
modified food to be approved.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.616 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were.

00:03:48.616 --> 00:03:48.860 align:middle line:90%
I remember that.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.359 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, the
Flavr Savr Tomato.

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:51.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But no more?

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.424 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No more.

00:03:52.424 --> 00:03:53.840 align:middle line:84%
Because they taste
like cardboard.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.390 align:middle line:90%
That's why.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's right, exactly.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, so, in
most cases, they're

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.930 align:middle line:90%
not labeled as GMOs, right?

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:01.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:02.729 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't know.

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:03.740 align:middle line:90%
How do people know?

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.364 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, more
and more, companies

00:04:05.364 --> 00:04:07.220 align:middle line:84%
are labeling their
products as non-GMO.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Because the average American now
believes that GMOs are unsafe.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And so the food
companies are rushing

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.399 align:middle line:84%
to market new formulations
for their products

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:18.829 align:middle line:84%
so they can boldly
announce. non-GMO.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.690 align:middle line:84%
So Nestle advertises
on television

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.060 align:middle line:84%
that its coffee
creamer is non-GMO.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.340 align:middle line:84%
So you know that the non-GMO
movement is making its mark.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Impact.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's making
its impact-- right.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many years have
you been doing this now?

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: 21.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 21 years
trying to educate people

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.070 align:middle line:90%
about the dangers of GMOs.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.060 align:middle line:84%
What is it specifically
that creates that danger?

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, there's
the GMO process itself,

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.460 align:middle line:84%
and a recent study shows that
the genetic engineering process

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.520 align:middle line:84%
of a certain type of corn
increased the proteins

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.170 align:middle line:84%
in the corn that are not
only linked to allergies

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.010 align:middle line:84%
and to cancer, but
they're called putrescine

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.530 align:middle line:90%
and cadaverine because they--

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Putrescine?

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.474 align:middle line:84%
&Gt;>SMITH: Yeah,
because they create--

00:04:58.474 --> 00:04:59.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like for putrid?

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:00.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Exactly.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.920 align:middle line:84%
These proteins are responsible
for the smell of a rotting,

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.880 align:middle line:90%
dead body.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, good.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And they are in higher
amounts in Monsanto's corn.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And we eat that.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's right.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.810 align:middle line:84%
So the process of
genetic engineering

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.340 align:middle line:84%
itself can cause
these problems--

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.880 align:middle line:84%
higher levels of allergens
and toxins and putrescine.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.320 align:middle line:84%
Then you have corn that produces
its own toxic insecticide,

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.440 align:middle line:84%
which breaks open the stomach
of the insects and kills it.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And a 2012 study showed that it
can poke holes in human cells

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.240 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And a recent study showed that
rats were fed this Bt corn,

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.270 align:middle line:84%
it's called, they
had severe damage

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.740 align:middle line:90%
in their digestive tract.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sometimes
you just wake up,

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.050 align:middle line:90%
and you just don't feel well.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.000 align:middle line:90%
You don't know why.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.680 align:middle line:84%
You went to bed
the night before.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.000 align:middle line:90%
You had something to eat.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.860 align:middle line:90%
You thought it was good.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.870 align:middle line:84%
How do we know that
the GMOs that we

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.760 align:middle line:84%
may have eaten
accidentally the night

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.510 align:middle line:84%
before are contributing
to that feeling of malaise

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:57.310 align:middle line:90%
the next day?

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:58.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's an
excellent question.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So what I did is
I asked audiences

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.470 align:middle line:84%
at about 150
lectures, what did you

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.220 align:middle line:84%
notice when you changed your
diet to non-GMO or organic?

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.840 align:middle line:90%
What did you notice got better?

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And people raised their hand
and say digestive problems

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.490 align:middle line:84%
or mood or behavior, like
anxiety, skin problems, energy.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:15.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All the worst parts.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Overweight
and all that stuff.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.825 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd say, OK, how
many people noticed that?

00:06:18.825 --> 00:06:20.150 align:middle line:90%
And I'd see the show of hands.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
consistent number of people.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And then I surveyed
3,600 people who

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.860 align:middle line:84%
said that they got better from
switching to non-GMO, and just

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.840 align:middle line:84%
like in the audiences,
the number-one response

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.030 align:middle line:90%
was gastrointestinal.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:35.840 align:middle line:84%
The number two was
increased energy.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Number three was
reduced weight problems.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Number four was brain fog,
and then all these others--

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.770 align:middle line:84%
skin conditions,
anxiety, et cetera.

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.810 align:middle line:90%
So we have a general idea.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.622 align:middle line:84%
And when I interviewed doctors
who prescribed non-GMO diets,

00:06:47.622 --> 00:06:49.580 align:middle line:84%
they back it up saying
in thousands of patients

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.760 align:middle line:84%
that they prescribed non-GMO
diets to, it's similar.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.220 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at the
animal feeding studies,

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.470 align:middle line:84%
when they force-feed
the animals GMOs,

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.830 align:middle line:84%
they suffer from very similar
categories of diseases.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And when livestock
are taken off of GMOs,

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.980 align:middle line:84%
they get better from very
similar categories of diseases.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And these are the diseases
that are on the rise

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.880 align:middle line:84%
in the US population, rising
in parallel with the increased

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.030 align:middle line:84%
use of GMOs and the Roundup
herbicide sprayed on most

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:18.390 align:middle line:90%
genetically modified organisms.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And this is definitive.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:20.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, yeah.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:21.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:24.170 align:middle line:84%
But those charts,
it's just correlation.

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.290 align:middle line:84%
We can't say that
because they happen

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.780 align:middle line:84%
to rise in parallel,
autism, diabetes, deaths

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.060 align:middle line:84%
from senile dementia,
Alzheimer's, et cetera,

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.940 align:middle line:84%
we can't say that there's
causative relationship just

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.210 align:middle line:90%
from the chart.

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.870 align:middle line:84%
But if you look, for example,
at Roundup herbicide, which

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.440 align:middle line:84%
is sprayed on GMOs, it is a
probable human carcinogen,

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.330 align:middle line:84%
according to the World
Health Organization.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.940 align:middle line:90%
It can mess up our hormones.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.930 align:middle line:84%
It's an antibiotic,
so it can wreak havoc

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:49.430 align:middle line:90%
with our gut bacteria.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:52.070 align:middle line:84%
It can block the
production of the building

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.946 align:middle line:84%
blocks of serotonin,
melatonin, and dopamine.

00:07:53.946 --> 00:07:54.745 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:07:54.745 --> 00:07:55.970 align:middle line:90%
Is it killing honeybees?

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It is very
likely a major contributor

00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:59.720 align:middle line:90%
to colony collapse disorder.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.150 align:middle line:84%
Because when they found
just regular environmentally

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:06.590 align:middle line:84%
relevant doses of Roundup and
they applied it into a hive,

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.430 align:middle line:84%
they found about 30%
death rate in the bees.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:10.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 30%.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.286 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't make their
way back to the hive.

00:08:12.286 --> 00:08:13.530 align:middle line:90%
They lost their navigation.

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.610 align:middle line:84%
So we think that Roundup
is contributing, along

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:17.655 align:middle line:90%
with other pesticides.

00:08:17.655 --> 00:08:18.530 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting.

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:21.080 align:middle line:84%
There was a company
called Beelogics

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.530 align:middle line:84%
that was discovering the cause
of colony collapse disorder.

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.590 align:middle line:84%
Guess which major
company bought Beelogics?

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.940 align:middle line:90%
Monsanto.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.130 align:middle line:84%
So now they no longer
do any research

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:33.840 align:middle line:84%
on the relationship between
Roundup and colony collapse

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.640 align:middle line:90%
disorder.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now, the GMO foods--

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.460 align:middle line:84%
some of them have
the insecticide

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:41.600 align:middle line:90%
built into it, right?

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.516 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's right.

00:08:42.516 --> 00:08:43.950 align:middle line:90%
That's right-- the Bt toxin.

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:46.172 align:middle line:84%
Originally it comes
from soil bacteria.

00:08:46.172 --> 00:08:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And if you just
gather the bacteria

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.260 align:middle line:84%
and spray it on a crop, it
will kill certain insects.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.170 align:middle line:84%
So the scientists take the
gene from the bacterium

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.180 align:middle line:84%
and take it out, multiply
it millions of times,

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.010 align:middle line:84%
put it into a gun,
shoot that gun

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.109 align:middle line:84%
into a plate of
millions of corn cells,

00:09:00.109 --> 00:09:01.900 align:middle line:84%
hoping that the gene
makes it into the DNA.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:02.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Takes it and keeps it.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Then they clone
that into a plant,

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.580 align:middle line:84%
and now every single
cell of that corn plant

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.860 align:middle line:84%
has a little gene-sized
spray bottle.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And when the bug
eats the corn, it

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:17.540 align:middle line:84%
breaks open little holes in
the walls of the intestines

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.670 align:middle line:90%
to kill the bug.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, the biotech industry
said, well, Bt is safe.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.320 align:middle line:90%
We could use it in organic food.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.430 align:middle line:84%
So it must be safe
to create Bt corn.

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, they ignore the fact
that when you just spray it on,

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.150 align:middle line:90%
it biodegrades.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.296 align:middle line:90%
It washes off.

00:09:33.296 --> 00:09:34.670 align:middle line:84%
But when it's
built into the corn

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:37.520 align:middle line:84%
at thousands of times the
concentration of the spray,

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.900 align:middle line:90%
it's encapsulated.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.067 align:middle line:90%
So we consume it.

00:09:40.067 --> 00:09:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's got to
affect a human being.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, absolutely.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:43.580 align:middle line:90%
I believe it does.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
about accumulation?

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, accumulation
is interesting.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.640 align:middle line:84%
It depends on where
it goes in the body.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.740 align:middle line:84%
A study that was
done in Canada found

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.200 align:middle line:84%
that 93% of the
pregnant women tested

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:58.160 align:middle line:84%
had the Bt toxin from
Monsanto's corn circulating

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.330 align:middle line:90%
in their blood.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And so did 80% of
their unborn fetuses.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, in a mouse study, they
found that the Bt toxin

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.650 align:middle line:90%
is toxic to blood cells.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.080 align:middle line:84%
So if it's in our
bloodstream, it

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.700 align:middle line:84%
might be causing
havoc in our blood.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And if it's in the unborn fetus,
there's no blood-brain barrier.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.990 align:middle line:84%
What this toxin does is it
pokes holes in human cells.

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:22.100 align:middle line:84%
So if it gets into the brain,
we might have this toxin

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.830 align:middle line:84%
from Monsanto's
corn poking holes

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:27.380 align:middle line:84%
in human brain cells of the
offspring of this generation.

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: God.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.500 align:middle line:90%
This is frightening.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, it's frightening,
but we do have a way out.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.190 align:middle line:10%
We do have the ability to
buy non-GMO and organic food.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:40.370 align:middle line:10%
And people say they get better
from all sorts of diseases.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:41.272 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How soon?

00:10:41.272 --> 00:10:42.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I talked
to one doctor who

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.070 align:middle line:84%
had 5,000 patients,
prescribed non-GMO diets,

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:50.420 align:middle line:84%
and she said the mental issues,
like anxiety and depression,

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:51.860 align:middle line:90%
can go away right away.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.680 align:middle line:84%
The allergic symptoms and
asthma, three to seven days.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.480 align:middle line:90%
Gastrointestinal, two months.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.090 align:middle line:84%
But you can rebuild the
system over two years.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:00.650 align:middle line:90%
This was her experience.

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:02.090 align:middle line:90%
Now, I actually was skeptical.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:03.840 align:middle line:84%
When people used to
come up to me and say,

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.402 align:middle line:84%
I can feel the
effects of GMOs, I

00:11:05.402 --> 00:11:07.110 align:middle line:84%
didn't really believe
then until a doctor

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:08.330 align:middle line:90%
started prescribing it.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.670 align:middle line:84%
So I said to her, can
I come to your office

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.260 align:middle line:90%
and meet your patients?

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And so the first
person I introduced

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:16.520 align:middle line:84%
had been on a non-GMO
diet for 24 days.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Three days into that, her
Crohn's disease symptoms

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.040 align:middle line:90%
disappeared.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.050 align:middle line:90%
Her hair stopped falling out.

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:22.600 align:middle line:84%
Her skin condition
started clearing up.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.630 align:middle line:90%
And she had lost 10 pounds.

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:23.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Remarkable.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And then patient
after patient after patient.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, when people
get rid of GMOs,

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:31.040 align:middle line:84%
because they're not labeled,
they gotta do a strategy.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.060 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they buy organic.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.190 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they switch to
non-processed foods.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:36.950 align:middle line:84%
So I was at a loss to figure
out, well, is it the non-GMO,

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:38.570 align:middle line:90%
or is it all these other things?

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:41.750 align:middle line:84%
At the same time I went to her
clinic, I went to some farms

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:44.920 align:middle line:84%
where they put their pigs or
cows on non-GMO soy or corn.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Big difference.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.586 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And there
was a big difference.

00:11:47.586 --> 00:11:48.830 align:middle line:90%
And it was the same.

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:52.940 align:middle line:84%
So the farmers were saying,
no more diarrhea in my pigs,

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.220 align:middle line:84%
and the clinic
patients were saying,

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.630 align:middle line:90%
no more irritable bowel.

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Calling it different words,
but it was the same thing.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And both after
switching to non-GMO.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've had dinner
with so many people who

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:07.220 align:middle line:84%
are complaining about
symptoms like what you've just

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:08.810 align:middle line:90%
been talking about.

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And they have no
idea what it is.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And I mention GMOs,
and they're beginning

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.022 align:middle line:90%
to learn this now, Jeffrey.

00:12:16.022 --> 00:12:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Are you finding
out that people are

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.830 align:middle line:90%
beginning to understand this?

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:19.663 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:12:19.663 --> 00:12:22.160 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of doctors are
prescribing non-GMO diets.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Millions of people--
the average American

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.240 align:middle line:90%
is now concerned about GMOs.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.656 align:middle line:10%
More than half are
concerned about GMOs.

00:12:28.656 --> 00:12:30.530 align:middle line:10%
And what doctors tell
us is very interesting.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:33.500 align:middle line:10%
You asked how long it takes
to have the influence.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.830 align:middle line:84%
When people clean out their
diet but then backslide--

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:40.670 align:middle line:84%
they go out for sometimes
even a single meal--

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.290 align:middle line:90%
old problems start to rise.

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:44.810 align:middle line:84%
You see, different people
have different sensitivities.

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:48.200 align:middle line:10%
The same GMO, the same Roundup
can be fed to one family,

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.830 align:middle line:10%
and one person has autism,
another person has a tumor,

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:53.630 align:middle line:10%
and another person has eczema.

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And when they change the
diet-- and I point this out

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.920 align:middle line:84%
in my new film,
"Secret Ingredients."

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.290 align:middle line:84%
One family with 21
chronic conditions,

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:02.330 align:middle line:84%
they switched to
non-GMO organic,

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.280 align:middle line:84%
and all of the
conditions disappeared.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.680 align:middle line:84%
They were different conditions
with different people,

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.029 align:middle line:90%
but they all disappeared.

00:13:08.029 --> 00:13:10.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There is a gene
called an epicyte, which

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:15.150 align:middle line:84%
affects men and women
in a very different way.

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:20.370 align:middle line:10%
>> In 2001, a small California
biotech company called Epicyte

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:24.870 align:middle line:10%
patented a product,
patented a gene,

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:29.880 align:middle line:10%
which causes both men and women
who eat it in the form of any

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:34.170 align:middle line:10%
product to produce
antibodies to sperm.

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:37.290 align:middle line:84%
If the men eat the
epicyte gene, they

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:40.410 align:middle line:84%
produce antibodies
to their own sperm,

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:45.510 align:middle line:84%
rendering them
irreversibly sterile.

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:51.660 align:middle line:84%
If women eat the epicyte gene,
when they have intercourse,

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:55.530 align:middle line:84%
their bodies produce
antibodies to the sperm that

00:13:55.530 --> 00:14:00.510 align:middle line:84%
has been deposited, and
they become infertile

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:03.420 align:middle line:84%
through the destruction
of the sperm.

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:10.350 align:middle line:10%
Now, DuPont and Monsanto formed
a joint venture, purchased

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:16.710 align:middle line:10%
the epicyte firm, and,
quote, "commercialized"

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:19.530 align:middle line:10%
the epicyte gene.

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:21.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why in
God's name would they

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:26.200 align:middle line:84%
want to use a gene like
that, sterilizing the planet?

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well,
theoretically, they're

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:31.402 align:middle line:84%
just using corn to produce
it more economically.

00:14:31.402 --> 00:14:32.860 align:middle line:84%
I'll let you decide
whether they're

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.380 align:middle line:90%
having any devious interests.

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.020 align:middle line:84%
But not just the
corn that's supposed

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.780 align:middle line:84%
to create a spermicide,
which theoretically was never

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.190 align:middle line:90%
made public--

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:44.380 align:middle line:84%
it turns out that there's
a lot of information

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:47.210 align:middle line:90%
linking GMOs with sterility.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:48.970 align:middle line:84%
In our film "Secret
Ingredients,"

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:50.770 align:middle line:84%
we went to a clinic,
a chiropractic clinic,

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:54.640 align:middle line:84%
where they put infertile
couples on 100% organic diet.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:58.870 align:middle line:84%
They had 77 so far, and
all 77 now have kids--

00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:59.670 align:middle line:90%
100%.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:00.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:01.780 align:middle line:90%
Remarkable.

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:02.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I know.

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:02.515 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:15:02.515 --> 00:15:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't get
those numbers in anything.

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:05.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I know.

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is
right now, infertility

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:09.790 align:middle line:84%
is through the charts
in the United States.

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:11.590 align:middle line:84%
There was a study done
by a Russian Academy

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:13.600 align:middle line:90%
of Sciences scientist.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.620 align:middle line:84%
She fed Roundup-Ready
soybeans to female rats

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:20.474 align:middle line:84%
before they got
pregnant, and after they

00:15:20.474 --> 00:15:22.390 align:middle line:84%
had their kids, more
than half of their babies

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.330 align:middle line:84%
died within three weeks,
compared to a 10% death rate

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.890 align:middle line:90%
when they ate regular soybeans.

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:30.880 align:middle line:84%
Another Russian Academy
of Sciences scientist fed

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.860 align:middle line:90%
hamsters Roundup-Ready soy.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.620 align:middle line:84%
By the third generation,
most were sterile.

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:39.760 align:middle line:84%
The government of Austria found
some sterility in its mice

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.400 align:middle line:84%
that were fed genetically
modified corn.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.110 align:middle line:90%
And we see a lot of people--

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:44.947 align:middle line:90%
I've heard this.

00:15:44.947 --> 00:15:46.030 align:middle line:90%
People can't get pregnant.

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:47.030 align:middle line:90%
They can't get pregnant.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.665 align:middle line:84%
They switch to organic, and all
of a sudden, they get pregnant.

00:15:49.665 --> 00:15:52.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you believe the
stores when it says organic?

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.512 align:middle line:84%
Are you actually getting
organic fruits, vegetables,

00:15:55.512 --> 00:15:56.470 align:middle line:90%
whatever you're buying?

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:58.803 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I mean, if it comes
from China, I have no idea.

00:15:58.803 --> 00:16:01.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when it comes imported
from another country--

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:02.830 align:middle line:84%
organic is pretty
well regulated.

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:05.241 align:middle line:84%
They have site visits,
document reviews.

00:16:05.241 --> 00:16:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Same with chicken
and things like that.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.290 align:middle line:90%
They say organic.

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:11.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, I mean,
there is occasional fraud.

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:12.920 align:middle line:90%
But it's not a common thing.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.680 align:middle line:90%
So I trust organic.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And organic does not allow
intentional use of GMOs.

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes there
is contamination.

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:21.400 align:middle line:84%
It does not allow
the intentional use

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.190 align:middle line:84%
of Roundup and other
nasty synthetic chemicals.

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And Roundup is one
of the major reasons

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:27.910 align:middle line:90%
why GMOs are so dangerous.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Most GMOs are considered
Roundup-Ready.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.670 align:middle line:84%
They're designed by Monsanto
to spray the whole field

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:36.560 align:middle line:84%
with Roundup herbicide so
that it kills the weeds

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.680 align:middle line:90%
but the GMOs survive.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.570 align:middle line:84%
So 80% of the GMOs
are Roundup-Ready

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:43.300 align:middle line:90%
and mean Roundup-drenched.

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:47.030 align:middle line:84%
But Roundup is also sprayed
on wheat, barley, rye, rice,

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:50.190 align:middle line:84%
potatoes, sweet potatoes, sugar
cane, and a whole bunch of non

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:54.160 align:middle line:84%
GMO crops just before
harvest to dry it down,

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.272 align:middle line:90%
like three to five days.

00:16:55.272 --> 00:16:56.230 align:middle line:90%
So we're eating wheat--

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:56.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're eating it.

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: We're eating wheat
that's drenched in Roundup.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.479 align:middle line:84%
It's not GMO, because
what is not GMO.

00:17:00.479 --> 00:17:02.020 align:middle line:84%
But all of a sudden,
we're eating it.

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's like our
bodies can react

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.000 align:middle line:84%
to that, which is why
we say non-GMO is good,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.950 align:middle line:90%
but organic is necessary.

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:11.829 align:middle line:84%
If you have an option to buy
organic, go there every time.

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:13.628 align:middle line:84%
And only when you
can't get organic,

00:17:13.628 --> 00:17:15.169 align:middle line:84%
then get something
that says non-GMO.

00:17:15.169 --> 00:17:16.839 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even though it
may cost a little more.

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:17.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, listen.

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.115 align:middle line:84%
In our film "Secret
Ingredients,"

00:17:19.115 --> 00:17:22.180 align:middle line:84%
there's a family that was
spending about $18,000 a year

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:24.919 align:middle line:84%
in health care costs
with five children.

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:25.960 align:middle line:90%
They switched to organic.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.060 align:middle line:84%
The next year it went down
to $9,000, the next year down

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:28.840 align:middle line:90%
to $3,000.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dramatic.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So I would
say for the big picture

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.270 align:middle line:84%
and for the quality
of life, absolutely.

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
initial reasoning

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.680 align:middle line:90%
for GMOs in the first place?

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.515 align:middle line:84%
There's a profit
reason, obviously.

00:17:40.515 --> 00:17:41.315 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, yeah.

00:17:41.315 --> 00:17:43.720 align:middle line:84%
Monsanto's patent on
Roundup was expiring,

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.660 align:middle line:84%
and so they created
Roundup-Ready seeds

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.710 align:middle line:84%
so that when you buy
the Roundup-Ready seeds,

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:49.540 align:middle line:84%
you sign a contract
that you only buy

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.460 align:middle line:90%
Monsanto's version of Roundup.

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.590 align:middle line:84%
So it was a way to
increase their dominance

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:56.560 align:middle line:90%
in selling these herbicides.

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, they claimed after
the pushback in Europe,

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:00.357 align:middle line:90%
oh, it's to feed the world.

00:18:00.357 --> 00:18:02.440 align:middle line:84%
But it actually wasn't
designed to feed the world.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And the world's experts
agree that it is actually

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:07.780 align:middle line:90%
not a solution to world hunger.

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.210 align:middle line:90%
It works against that.

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:13.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why does it seem
like Europe and Hawaii,

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.760 align:middle line:84%
part of the United
States, of course,

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:19.150 align:middle line:84%
are a little more aggressive
in trying to tell us

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:21.040 align:middle line:90%
about the dangers of GMOs?

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, Europe,
the press was open.

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Back in 1999, there
was a scientist

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:28.000 align:middle line:84%
who was given a bunch of
money, Dr. Arpad Pusztai,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.670 align:middle line:84%
to figure out how to test
for the safety of GMOs.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And he discovered that GMOs
were inherently dangerous

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:36.700 align:middle line:84%
and immediately was
gagged and fired

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.750 align:middle line:84%
and stripped of
responsibilities and attacked.

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:42.550 align:middle line:84%
When his gag order was lifted
by an order of parliament,

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:46.150 align:middle line:84%
over 700 articles were written
in the UK alone within a month.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Within 10 weeks,
so many consumers

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:51.340 align:middle line:84%
were concerned about GMOs
Unilever said, OK, no more

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.110 align:middle line:90%
GMOs in our European brands--

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:56.140 align:middle line:84%
same thing with Nestle, same
thing with everyone else.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:59.050 align:middle line:84%
But in the United States,
the media never covered it.

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And so the same
companies that removed

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.850 align:middle line:84%
GMOs for the discerning
European consumer

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:06.910 align:middle line:84%
continued to sell the
unaware American consumer

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:10.480 align:middle line:84%
the GMOs in their Frosted Flakes
and their tortillas, et cetera.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the doctor did
a study on rats and potatoes.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:15.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:17.890 align:middle line:10%
>> He took a potato that
was genetically engineered

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:21.010 align:middle line:10%
to produce an insecticide
and fed one group of rats

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:23.640 align:middle line:10%
the genetically
engineered potato.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.740 align:middle line:10%
He found another group
of rats natural potatoes

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:29.340 align:middle line:10%
and a third group of
rats natural potatoes,

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:32.430 align:middle line:10%
plus their meal was spiked
with the same insecticide

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:35.040 align:middle line:10%
that the GM potato was
engineered to produce.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:39.120 align:middle line:10%
So you have GM potato, natural
potato, and natural potato

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.530 align:middle line:10%
plus an insecticide.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:43.800 align:middle line:10%
And all three had a complete
and balanced diet as well.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.050 align:middle line:10%
>> We measured all
sorts of things--

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:50.820 align:middle line:10%
growth, for example, how these
young animals were growing,

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.580 align:middle line:10%
and what happened
to their inside

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:56.340 align:middle line:10%
and what happened to
their immune system.

00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And it became clear that
the GM had a slower growth.

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:09.750 align:middle line:84%
It had problems with internal
development of its organs.

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And it certainly knocked
out the immune system.

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:18.092 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What more evidence
do we need than that?

00:20:18.092 --> 00:20:20.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: What was interesting
about those potatoes is

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.550 align:middle line:84%
that it was only the
genetically modified potato that

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:24.770 align:middle line:84%
caused the problem,
not the potato

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:26.990 align:middle line:84%
that had been sprayed
with the insecticide.

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And so it was the process
of genetic engineering

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:31.050 align:middle line:90%
that caused the problem.

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I've interviewed Dr.
Pusztai for hours and hours

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:38.240 align:middle line:84%
and hours, and he was concerned
that GMOs on the market

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.327 align:middle line:84%
would have the same
problems in humans

00:20:40.327 --> 00:20:42.660 align:middle line:84%
as they had with the rats
that occurred in just 10 days.

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:44.326 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's no
question about that.

00:20:44.326 --> 00:20:47.960 align:middle line:84%
So I would guess that if
you're going to pick a food,

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.960 align:middle line:84%
the first should be
organic, the second should

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.677 align:middle line:84%
be one that's probably sprayed,
and then the third is the GMO.

00:20:54.677 --> 00:20:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, here's the thing.

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:58.640 align:middle line:84%
The first is organic,
the second is non-GMO.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a loaf
of bread that's non-GMO,

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.870 align:middle line:90%
it still might be sprayed.

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:03.990 align:middle line:90%
So organic is better.

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:05.930 align:middle line:84%
It's not allowed
to contain GMOs.

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:07.875 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So GMOs--
bottom of the list.

00:21:07.875 --> 00:21:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, you don't
want to eat GMOs for sure.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At all.

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:10.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Sure, absolutely.

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:11.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At all.

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And have you found in your
own diet that you avoid GMOs?

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, yeah.

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And I travel seven to nine
months a year for 13 years.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.080 align:middle line:90%
So I know.

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:21.050 align:middle line:10%
I call the restaurant beforehand
and say, what oil do you

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:22.460 align:middle line:10%
cook your food with?

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And if they say vegetable
oil, it's soybean,

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:28.610 align:middle line:84%
or they say cottonseed
or canola or corn oil,

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:31.640 align:middle line:84%
then I know that they're cooking
their food in a genetically

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.990 align:middle line:90%
modified oil.

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:35.847 align:middle line:84%
So it has probably higher levels
of Roundup and other problems.

00:21:35.847 --> 00:21:37.430 align:middle line:84%
So I'll find out if
they can cook mine

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:39.994 align:middle line:84%
in olive oil or
some other non-oil.

00:21:39.994 --> 00:21:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And then most of the
things are visible.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:42.460 align:middle line:90%
You can tell.

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:45.280 align:middle line:84%
If it is corn on the cob
or tortillas or tofu,

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.580 align:middle line:90%
it's from soy or corn.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And if it doesn't say
non-GMO or organic,

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.640 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be GMO if
produced in North America.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who are the
mental misfits who approved

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:55.790 align:middle line:90%
GMOs in the first place?

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:57.590 align:middle line:90%
And how did that happen?

00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:02.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Michael Taylor was
in charge of policy at the FDA

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:03.585 align:middle line:84%
when the GMO policy
came to pass.

00:22:03.585 --> 00:22:04.385 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A lawyer.

00:22:04.385 --> 00:22:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: A lawyer.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And the policy said, we
don't see any information

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.920 align:middle line:84%
showing GMOs are
significantly different,

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.740 align:middle line:84%
so no safety
studies were needed.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:14.450 align:middle line:90%
No labeling was needed.

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And companies like
Monsanto that told us

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:19.340 align:middle line:84%
that Agent Orange,
PCBs, and DDT were safe

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:23.060 align:middle line:84%
could introduce a GMO without
telling the FDA or consumers.

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:27.890 align:middle line:84%
Michael Taylor-- they created
a position for him at the FDA

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:30.290 align:middle line:84%
to be in charge
after the White House

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:32.870 align:middle line:84%
had told the FDA
to promote GMOs.

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:36.710 align:middle line:84%
He had been Monsanto's
attorney, later Monsanto's vice

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:39.830 align:middle line:84%
president, still later the
US food czar under the Obama

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:41.112 align:middle line:90%
administration.

00:22:41.112 --> 00:22:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And where is he now?

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, he just left
the Obama administration,

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:45.883 align:middle line:84%
and I don't have to
track him anymore.

00:22:45.883 --> 00:22:49.490 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHING] So my
feeling is this,

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:53.529 align:middle line:84%
that the government has been
marching lockstep with Monsanto

00:22:53.529 --> 00:22:54.570 align:middle line:90%
and the biotech industry.

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:57.650 align:middle line:84%
If you read the WikiLeaks,
you can find the ambassador

00:22:57.650 --> 00:22:59.900 align:middle line:84%
to France said, we should
create a retaliation list

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.330 align:middle line:84%
against the countries
that are resisting GMOs

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:03.860 align:middle line:90%
and cause some pain.

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:07.880 align:middle line:84%
The Spanish ambassador said that
Washington should help Brussels

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:10.400 align:middle line:84%
create a more pro-GMO
policy and that they just

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.432 align:middle line:84%
met with the Monsanto
director in the area,

00:23:12.432 --> 00:23:14.390 align:middle line:84%
and they want to support
the Spanish government

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:15.980 align:middle line:90%
to introduce more GMOs.

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:18.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's basically
Monsanto's enforcement wing

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:19.740 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the USDA
and the EPA all pushing GMOs.

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:26.040 align:middle line:84%
So the solution to
GMOs, in my opinion,

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.250 align:middle line:84%
is not to try and
convince the US government

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:30.740 align:middle line:84%
to go against their
support of Monsanto.

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:33.680 align:middle line:84%
It's to get the consumers
to stop eating it

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:37.470 align:middle line:84%
so we see the tipping point that
occurred in Europe happen here.

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:39.394 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what's happening.

00:23:39.394 --> 00:23:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This portion
of "Beyond Belief"

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:43.140 align:middle line:84%
has been brought to
you by GMO foods.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:43.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm kidding.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: [LAUGHING]

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:45.775 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm kidding.

00:23:45.775 --> 00:23:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Do they wield that
kind of clout?

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, yeah.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.930 align:middle line:84%
"The New York Times"
pointed out years ago

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:55.370 align:middle line:84%
that someone at the FDA
said that the regulators did

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:59.300 align:middle line:84%
everything that Big Ag asked
them to do and told them to do.

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Trump, before he was
nominated, met with the CEO

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:05.340 align:middle line:90%
of Monsanto and Bayer.

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.070 align:middle line:90%
They're merging.

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:08.450 align:middle line:90%
They have tremendous power.

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:10.924 align:middle line:84%
I've traveled to 42 countries
speaking about GMOs.

00:24:10.924 --> 00:24:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm usually briefed about
which part of the government

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:16.400 align:middle line:84%
has been essentially
taken over by Monsanto.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And often times, I get people
admitting to me-- someone

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:22.430 align:middle line:84%
who was a big regulator for
a country that I can't name,

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:24.770 align:middle line:84%
he said in his first
meeting with Monsanto rep,

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:27.560 align:middle line:84%
they said, oh, once
you approve our GMOs,

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.620 align:middle line:84%
we're going to give you a very
well-paying job with Monsanto.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:35.120 align:middle line:84%
So it was a legal bribe, but
he decided not to go for it.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Surely there
must be some scientists

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:41.720 align:middle line:84%
at these companies that are
trying to do the right thing,

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.040 align:middle line:90%
don't you think?

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I was at a lunch once
at a restaurant in St. Louis,

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:49.730 align:middle line:84%
and I invited some people
to join us at the table.

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And one was a
Monsanto scientist.

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And we started talking
about various things.

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And I said, when you
insert your gene,

00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:58.820 align:middle line:84%
you cause disruption
of that DNA.

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:00.170 align:middle line:90%
We talked about this earlier.

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:02.510 align:middle line:84%
You can have increased
allergens, toxins, et cetera.

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:04.760 align:middle line:84%
How do you know you're not
disrupting in ways that you

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.410 align:middle line:90%
can't even measure now?

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:08.030 align:middle line:90%
And he couldn't respond.

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:09.740 align:middle line:90%
He just didn't respond.

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:10.970 align:middle line:90%
He just continued to eat.

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And about two minutes later,
he looked up and said,

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:14.500 align:middle line:90%
well, you know, we need GMOs.

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:15.300 align:middle line:90%
I said, why?

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:16.790 align:middle line:90%
To feed the world.

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:18.170 align:middle line:90%
But he was completely wrong.

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:19.921 align:middle line:84%
He had his numbers
wrong and the world's--

00:25:19.921 --> 00:25:21.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But he believes that.

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:22.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: He believed it.

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, there was another guy
that was recruited by Monsanto

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.480 align:middle line:90%
to sell their cotton.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.449 align:middle line:84%
And he read the words of
the CEO, Robert Shapiro,

00:25:29.449 --> 00:25:31.490 align:middle line:84%
about doing all these
great things for the world,

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:33.650 align:middle line:84%
stood up at the meeting,
the orientation meeting

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:36.350 align:middle line:84%
at the Monsanto headquarters,
and told everyone

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:37.820 align:middle line:90%
about Robert Shapiro's words.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.320 align:middle line:84%
He was pulled over to the side
by a vice president who said,

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.337 align:middle line:90%
wait a minute.

00:25:41.337 --> 00:25:42.920 align:middle line:84%
What Robert Shapiro
says is one thing.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.480 align:middle line:90%
What we do is something else.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.449 align:middle line:84%
He's the front man
who tells the story.

00:25:46.449 --> 00:25:48.240 align:middle line:84%
We don't even know what
he's talking about.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.360 align:middle line:90%
We're here to make money.

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:53.090 align:middle line:84%
So then realized it was just a
story about saving the world.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:55.430 align:middle line:84%
It was just a
profit-driven company.

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And with the seeds,
aren't farmers now required

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:03.890 align:middle line:84%
to buy seeds every
year because they

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:07.931 align:middle line:84%
can no longer use the God-made
seeds that we used to have?

00:26:07.931 --> 00:26:08.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: More and more--

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:09.730 align:middle line:90%
more and more.

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:12.694 align:middle line:84%
So hybrid seeds often
don't breed true,

00:26:12.694 --> 00:26:13.860 align:middle line:90%
so you have to replace them.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:17.270 align:middle line:84%
But with GMOs, you actually
have to sign the contract

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:20.270 align:middle line:84%
that you will not replant
your soybeans, for example.

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:24.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, Monsanto has gone after
the seed cleaners from soybeans

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:26.480 align:middle line:84%
and had terrible, terrible
influence on them,

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.720 align:middle line:84%
sometimes theoretically,
or allegedly, attaching

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.900 align:middle line:84%
tracking devices to their
car and going and visiting

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:32.700 align:middle line:90%
all of them.

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:33.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No!

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:35.103 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Going and visiting
all of their consumers

00:26:35.103 --> 00:26:37.160 align:middle line:84%
or customers, threatening
them, taking them

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.101 align:middle line:90%
to court, et cetera.

00:26:38.101 --> 00:26:39.350 align:middle line:90%
I've interviewed some of them.

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:40.580 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely horrible.

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:44.930 align:middle line:84%
They've threatened hundreds
of farmers with lawsuits.

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:48.324 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they'll actually
take a farmer to court,

00:26:48.324 --> 00:26:49.490 align:middle line:90%
and they'll lose everything.

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One was
sued, wasn't he?

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.970 align:middle line:84%
Because something
blew into his field.

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:54.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Absolutely
Percy Schmeiser-- he

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:57.920 align:middle line:84%
never planted a genetically
modified canola,

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.280 align:middle line:84%
but trucks passed his farm and
blew the canola seeds over.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.990 align:middle line:90%
Neighbor's canola blew over.

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:06.050 align:middle line:84%
And he lost in the
Canadian Supreme Court

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:09.250 align:middle line:84%
because he had Monsanto's
intellectual property,

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:12.150 align:middle line:84%
their patented seeds,
growing on his property.

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:14.570 align:middle line:84%
He harvested his canola,
like he did every year,

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:18.610 align:middle line:84%
replanted it the next year,
and that act was illegal.

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:22.670 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, the farmers are
facing a lot of problems.

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:24.762 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How dangerous
is this, in your opinion?

00:27:24.762 --> 00:27:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, if you
look at the charts,

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:28.960 align:middle line:84%
there's over 30
diseases that rise

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.710 align:middle line:84%
in parallel in relationship
to the increased

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:34.810 align:middle line:90%
use of GMOs in Roundup.

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:39.760 align:middle line:84%
If that was a correlation
that was actually causation,

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.070 align:middle line:84%
then we're talking
about millions

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:46.270 align:middle line:84%
upon millions of people having
bad health effects and possibly

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:47.380 align:middle line:90%
death.

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:49.480 align:middle line:84%
Roundup is a class
2A carcinogen.

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.950 align:middle line:84%
The World Health
Organization said

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:53.110 align:middle line:90%
it causes cancer in animals.

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:55.940 align:middle line:84%
It causes mutations in human
DNA, which can lead to cancer.

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And where it is sprayed,
there are higher levels

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:00.100 align:middle line:90%
of cancer in the population.

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.840 align:middle line:84%
So we're seeing higher
levels of cancer.

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.540 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing levels of
fatty liver disease.

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:07.780 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing levels of
infertility, autism, diabetes.

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And they all could
have explanation

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:13.690 align:middle line:84%
in just the function,
how Roundup works

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:15.980 align:middle line:84%
and how GMOs might
cause problems.

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So I was not convinced
that it was so dangerous

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:22.450 align:middle line:84%
until I started hearing
people's stories.

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors tell me--
and it's in our film "Secret

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Ingredients"-- that a certain
percentage of their patients,

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:31.670 align:middle line:84%
even with autistic kids,
get better when they switch

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:32.470 align:middle line:90%
to organic foods.

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:33.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: When they switch.

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Not everyone,
but a certain percent.

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:35.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It helps.

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:36.730 align:middle line:90%
It helps.

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:39.160 align:middle line:84%
Advertising agencies
have done a great job

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:43.900 align:middle line:84%
specifically targeting
products to certain audiences,

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:45.630 align:middle line:90%
like children.

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Little kids especially are
attracted by colorful packaging

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.920 align:middle line:90%
and plastic toys.

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:53.860 align:middle line:84%
I must admit, I used
to be one of them.

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:56.530 align:middle line:84%
I also used to think
that all of our food

00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:59.390 align:middle line:84%
came from these happy little
farms where pigs rolled in mud

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:01.300 align:middle line:84%
and cows grazed
on grass all day.

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.680 align:middle line:84%
What I discovered
was this is not true.

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.090 align:middle line:84%
I began to look into the
stuff on the internet,

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:09.760 align:middle line:84%
in books, and in documentary
films, in my travels

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.120 align:middle line:90%
with my family.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:15.070 align:middle line:84%
I discovered the dark side of
the industrialized food system.

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:18.580 align:middle line:84%
First, there's genetically
engineered seeds in organisms.

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:21.640 align:middle line:84%
That is when a seed is
manipulated in a laboratory

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.730 align:middle line:84%
to do something not
intended by nature,

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:26.050 align:middle line:84%
like taking the DNA of
a fish and putting it

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:27.910 align:middle line:90%
into the DNA of a tomato--

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:28.810 align:middle line:90%
yuck.

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:30.100 align:middle line:90%
Don't get me wrong.

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.450 align:middle line:90%
I like fish and tomatoes.

00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:34.000 align:middle line:90%
But this is just creepy.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that you as a kid?

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: [LAUGHING] You
know, the kids, they have it.

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:39.360 align:middle line:90%
They understand.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.810 align:middle line:84%
I've spoken to fifth
and sixth graders.

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:43.590 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have to dumb
down my talk at all.

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:44.775 align:middle line:90%
They were like so on it.

00:29:44.775 --> 00:29:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They get it.

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:46.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, completely.

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:47.465 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They get it.

00:29:47.465 --> 00:29:49.770 align:middle line:90%
Are they health wise?

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:51.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, they're
telling their parents

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:53.820 align:middle line:90%
to switch to non-GMO.

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:55.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing, too.

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.650 align:middle line:84%
Is there a targeted
marketing campaign to kids--

00:29:58.650 --> 00:29:59.502 align:middle line:90%
secretly?

00:29:59.502 --> 00:30:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I
think that they're

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.410 align:middle line:84%
being targeted for all sorts
of modern American processed

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:07.320 align:middle line:84%
foods, and most processed
foods contain GMOs.

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.900 align:middle line:84%
But there's also coloring
books and whole curricula

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:13.380 align:middle line:84%
that are imported into the
schools, created by Monsanto.

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:15.540 align:middle line:84%
So they learn about
genetic engineering

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:18.120 align:middle line:84%
as some great, new
future when they're

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.850 align:middle line:84%
very young, coloring the
coloring books of the seeds

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:22.500 align:middle line:90%
and the genes and the DNA.

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:26.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's very dangerous,
and it doesn't

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:29.110 align:middle line:84%
raise any of the concerns
that we're talking about.

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jeffrey, in so many
cases with GMOs, people,

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:38.430 align:middle line:84%
of course, are buying
these products,

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:42.840 align:middle line:84%
not knowing what they're doing,
not knowing where they are.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Does it look like it's
going up or going down

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:50.867 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the awareness
and the buying of GMOs?

00:30:50.867 --> 00:30:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I'm happy to say,
George, after 21 years,

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:54.760 align:middle line:90%
we're in the home stretch.

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:58.620 align:middle line:84%
We officially declared in 2016
that the mainstream tipping

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:01.890 align:middle line:84%
point in the United States
against GMOs had started.

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Mainstream companies are
falling over themselves

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:06.690 align:middle line:84%
to declare their
products as non-GMO.

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Dannon said that in
three years, it's

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.950 align:middle line:90%
going to be non-GMO animal feed.

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:12.146 align:middle line:90%
Applegate-- same thing.

00:31:12.146 --> 00:31:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I like that.

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Nestle, is as I
said, non-GMO coffee creamer

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:17.920 align:middle line:84%
advertised on
television, Chipotle--

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:18.720 align:middle line:90%
I can do the list.

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I can go on and spend the rest
of the episode just describing

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.120 align:middle line:84%
the mainstream companies
that are introducing more

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.640 align:middle line:90%
and more products as non-GMO.

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they doing it
because it's the right thing

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:28.020 align:middle line:90%
to do?

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:29.120 align:middle line:90%
Or because they have to?

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No!

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.380 align:middle line:84%
They're doing it
because they have to.

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.039 align:middle line:90%
They're doing it to make money.

00:31:33.039 --> 00:31:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a marketing ploy.

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, yeah.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.096 align:middle line:84%
They're doing it
because they have

00:31:36.096 --> 00:31:39.600 align:middle line:84%
to because so many Americans,
especially moms concerned

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.880 align:middle line:84%
about kids who are most
at risk, are saying,

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.727 align:middle line:84%
we don't want to
feed our kids GMOs.

00:31:43.727 --> 00:31:45.060 align:middle line:90%
We know what happens in the gut.

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:46.810 align:middle line:84%
We know what happens
to the immune system,

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:50.130 align:middle line:84%
to the gut bacteria, even
do the brain function.

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Serotonin is really
important for our brain.

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:53.340 align:middle line:90%
It's our friend.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:56.580 align:middle line:84%
It's created through building
blocks from the gut bacteria

00:31:56.580 --> 00:32:00.160 align:middle line:84%
through a particular
pathway that Roundup blocks.

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And Monsanto has said for
years, oh, that pathway

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.340 align:middle line:84%
is just in plants, and
so you can drink Roundup.

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:08.430 align:middle line:84%
But our gut bacteria use
that metabolic pathway

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:11.850 align:middle line:84%
to produce the building blocks,
the things that keep us happy

00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:15.450 align:middle line:84%
and not full of anxiety
and depression and in pain,

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:16.260 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:18.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like the
cigarette industry, which

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:23.020 align:middle line:84%
got nailed because of
internal things that they did,

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:25.470 align:middle line:84%
might the same thing
be happening here?

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:26.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I hope so.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:29.700 align:middle line:84%
But we also saw that
the cigarette industry

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:32.760 align:middle line:84%
rigged their research, or
what I call "tobacco science."

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And that was imported
into the GMO world.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:38.490 align:middle line:84%
We have caught the biotech
industry red-handed

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:41.970 align:middle line:84%
rigging their research to
avoid finding problems.

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:43.770 align:middle line:90%
And it's pretty blatant.

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:44.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is blatant.

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:48.444 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what are you
doing to date to fight GMOs?

00:32:48.444 --> 00:32:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well,
what we're doing is

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:52.260 align:middle line:84%
we're introducing
behavior change messaging

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:54.606 align:middle line:84%
through the Institute for
Responsible Technology.

00:32:54.606 --> 00:32:55.980 align:middle line:84%
That's messaging
that gets people

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:58.830 align:middle line:84%
to think twice or three
times about eating that corn

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:01.110 align:middle line:84%
chip that might turn your
intestinal flora into living

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:03.450 align:middle line:84%
pesticide factories
and cause holes

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:05.820 align:middle line:84%
in the guts of your
bacteria, in the walls.

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:09.810 align:middle line:84%
We introduce the science in a
clear, accurate way, translated

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:10.670 align:middle line:90%
into English.

00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And we do it through
books and movies

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:16.140 align:middle line:84%
and through lectures and speaker
training and activist groups.

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And we're also
helping people stop

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:19.890 align:middle line:84%
the spraying of these
dangerous chemicals

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:21.130 align:middle line:90%
in their neighborhoods.

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:23.640 align:middle line:84%
So at the Institute for
Responsible Technology,

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:26.820 align:middle line:84%
we create a hub of
information and activism

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:29.790 align:middle line:84%
so people can get involved,
both in the United States

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:31.249 align:middle line:84%
and more and more
around the world.

00:33:31.249 --> 00:33:32.914 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And are you
finding that people

00:33:32.914 --> 00:33:34.320 align:middle line:90%
are jumping on board to help?

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:37.440 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we wouldn't have
been able to do anything

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.340 align:middle line:90%
without that help.

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:41.730 align:middle line:84%
We've trained 1,500 people
to speak about GMOs.

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:44.400 align:middle line:84%
We've had over 100
groups meeting regularly

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.960 align:middle line:90%
around North America.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.740 align:middle line:84%
People invite me
all over the world.

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:49.519 align:middle line:90%
So it's actually taking hold.

00:33:49.519 --> 00:33:51.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of
the crops are being

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:53.880 align:middle line:84%
treated with weed
killers, and those things

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.170 align:middle line:90%
could be devastating, too.

00:33:56.170 --> 00:34:04.480 align:middle line:84%
>> The application of high doses
of these weed killers destroys

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:08.949 align:middle line:84%
the weeds, upon which other
organisms normally would be

00:34:08.949 --> 00:34:10.790 align:middle line:90%
consuming.

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:13.239 align:middle line:84%
So the insect
population is reduced.

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And then there isn't
the insect population

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:20.409 align:middle line:84%
upon which the birds
are also consuming.

00:34:20.409 --> 00:34:24.040 align:middle line:84%
So there could be
a knock-on effect.

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:27.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's amazing what
they keep doing, Jeffrey,

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:28.513 align:middle line:90%
about these weed killers.

00:34:28.513 --> 00:34:30.429 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, Roundup
is the big weed killer,

00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:31.989 align:middle line:90%
and Roundup is very dangerous.

00:34:31.989 --> 00:34:36.310 align:middle line:84%
What happens is they overuse the
Roundup because the weeds gain

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:37.210 align:middle line:90%
resistance.

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And so you end up
with super weeds.

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And the farmers are spraying
more and more Roundup

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:43.510 align:middle line:84%
so that the amount
of weed killer

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:48.370 align:middle line:84%
has gone up by about 527 million
pounds over the first 16 years

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:50.710 align:middle line:90%
of GMOs because of the GMOs.

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And so the conclusion that the
biotech industry has is not

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:56.560 align:middle line:84%
to withdraw the technology
because it's failing,

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:59.260 align:middle line:84%
but to now create
Agent Orange crops,

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:02.770 align:middle line:84%
crops that are resistant to a
different weed killer, 2,4-D,

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:05.840 align:middle line:84%
which was part of Agent
Orange used in the Vietnam War

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:09.130 align:middle line:84%
as a defoliant and linked
to cancer and birth defects.

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:12.370 align:middle line:84%
So that's been approved by
the United States government.

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:13.990 align:middle line:90%
They're waiting to deploy that.

00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And they have also
dicamba-resistant and other

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:19.372 align:middle line:84%
herbicide-tolerant
crops that will increase

00:35:19.372 --> 00:35:20.830 align:middle line:84%
the use of some of
these herbicides

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:26.080 align:middle line:84%
by 25-fold in the country
and in our food supply.

00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And the Roundup is in such
high concentrations already.

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:29.560 align:middle line:90%
It's in the air.

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:30.760 align:middle line:90%
It's in the rain.

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:32.030 align:middle line:90%
It's in the drinking water.

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:33.820 align:middle line:90%
It's in our blood, in our urine.

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And they found that
the amount that it

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:40.780 align:middle line:84%
took for creating fatty liver
in rats and their daily dose

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:46.300 align:middle line:84%
was about 425,000 times
less than the amount allowed

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:51.430 align:middle line:84%
in humans on a per-bodyweight
basis by the EPA.

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:54.440 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about a tiny
amount of this ubiquitous weed

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:58.210 align:middle line:84%
killer may be responsible
for this non-alcoholic fatty

00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:02.050 align:middle line:84%
liver, which 25% of
Americans are facing.

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now they're talking
about genetically modified

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:05.604 align:middle line:90%
mosquitoes.

00:36:05.604 --> 00:36:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's right.

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:07.889 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What the heck are they?

00:36:07.889 --> 00:36:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I would
not like to be hired

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:10.837 align:middle line:84%
to do a recall on
the genetically

00:36:10.837 --> 00:36:11.670 align:middle line:90%
modified mosquitoes.

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or bitten by one.

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:14.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It's true.

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:16.870 align:middle line:84%
So a company called
Oxitec from the UK

00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:19.180 align:middle line:84%
has genetically
engineered mosquitoes

00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:22.990 align:middle line:84%
so that the male mosquitoes will
mate with regular mosquitoes

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:26.080 align:middle line:84%
and create supposedly
sterile larva so that they'll

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:29.350 align:middle line:84%
reduce the population of
a certain type of mosquito

00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:32.410 align:middle line:84%
that's linked to
Dengue and Zika.

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:34.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, it turns out they
have been misinforming

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:36.640 align:middle line:90%
the public and regulators.

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:39.225 align:middle line:84%
They said it was just the
males that would be released,

00:36:39.225 --> 00:36:40.600 align:middle line:84%
but there's a lot
of females that

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.724 align:middle line:90%
have been released as well.

00:36:41.724 --> 00:36:44.222 align:middle line:84%
They said all the
offspring would be sterile,

00:36:44.222 --> 00:36:45.430 align:middle line:90%
because the males don't bite.

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:46.570 align:middle line:90%
The females bite.

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that 3%
on average of the offspring

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:50.560 align:middle line:90%
would not be sterile.

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And in the case of when
there's some kind of antibiotic

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:58.300 align:middle line:84%
in the atmosphere, then it
could be 15% to 18% not sterile.

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I was talking to
a scientist from Oxitec.

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what about the
saliva of the mosquito?

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:08.220 align:middle line:84%
What if it's dangerous
and toxic to human blood?

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:09.760 align:middle line:90%
You never even tested it.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.590 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, we're
just now testing

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:15.030 align:middle line:84%
to see if the gene
expresses the new protein

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:16.900 align:middle line:90%
in the saliva of the mosquito.

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.400 align:middle line:90%
And I'm thinking, just now?

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.170 align:middle line:84%
They've already released
millions of them

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:21.975 align:middle line:90%
in four countries.

00:37:21.975 --> 00:37:22.975 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I see disaster.

00:37:22.975 --> 00:37:23.775 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh!

00:37:23.775 --> 00:37:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know,
when you insert a gene,

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:27.445 align:middle line:84%
you can create all
sorts of changes,

00:37:27.445 --> 00:37:29.070 align:middle line:84%
not just in the
protein that's created.

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:31.720 align:middle line:84%
You can create new allergens
and new toxins, et cetera.

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:35.047 align:middle line:84%
Shouldn't you be looking at the
entire profile of that saliva?

00:37:35.047 --> 00:37:36.380 align:middle line:90%
And you know what he said to me?

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:39.106 align:middle line:90%
He said, good idea.

00:37:39.106 --> 00:37:40.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is the
brain cell behind Oxitec.

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:42.313 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Coming from you, right?

00:37:42.313 --> 00:37:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: [LAUGHING]

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not good to play
around with Mother Nature.

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And they basically
want to genetically engineer

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:53.560 align:middle line:84%
100% of all commercial seeds,
all insects, all livestock,

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:54.920 align:middle line:90%
bacteria, algae, et cetera.

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All about profit.

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:59.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They want to
eliminate the nature of nature

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:01.760 align:middle line:84%
and turn it into designer
organisms for profit

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:02.560 align:middle line:90%
and control.

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, once you do that,
there's no reversal.

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:05.390 align:middle line:90%
You are basically--

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:06.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've wiped
out everything else.

00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You have changed
everything into man-made DNA,

00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:10.870 align:middle line:90%
and that self-propagates.

00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:13.660 align:middle line:84%
So this generation is faced
with a decision that's

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:16.357 align:middle line:90%
unprecedented in our history--

00:38:16.357 --> 00:38:17.940 align:middle line:84%
whether we're going
to do this or not.

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:19.875 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
only way to stop this?

00:38:19.875 --> 00:38:22.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, we could
pretend that the government

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.230 align:middle line:90%
is going to bail us out.

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
not gonna happen.

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:25.475 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That's
not gonna happen.

00:38:25.475 --> 00:38:28.520 align:middle line:84%
It comes down to
changing the marketplace.

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:31.540 align:middle line:84%
So even though we really
want all GMOs taken out

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:34.600 align:middle line:84%
of the food, taken out
of outdoor release,

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.970 align:middle line:84%
rather than going to the
Senate or the Congress,

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:39.520 align:middle line:84%
which has been actually
working against us,

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.320 align:middle line:90%
we go to consumers, to moms.

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And we say, are you
sure you want to eat it?

00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:45.100 align:middle line:90%
This is what happened to rats.

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:46.180 align:middle line:90%
This is what happened to mice.

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:48.263 align:middle line:84%
This is what happened to
animals when they ate it.

00:38:48.263 --> 00:38:49.930 align:middle line:84%
This is what's happening
to other people

00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:51.554 align:middle line:84%
when they report they
get off the stuff

00:38:51.554 --> 00:38:52.560 align:middle line:90%
and how they get better.

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And then they're
saying, oh, my god.

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:56.410 align:middle line:84%
They're changing their
diet, and the food industry

00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:57.320 align:middle line:90%
is responding.

00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:00.760 align:middle line:10%
So in order to protect the
genetic integrity of this

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:04.270 align:middle line:10%
and all future generations,
it may be the increased sales

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:07.702 align:middle line:10%
of certain processed foods at
Walmart that drives the change.

00:39:07.702 --> 00:39:09.910 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Jeffrey, you're
working on a brand new movie

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:12.370 align:middle line:10%
to help educate the
world about GMOs.

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I've removed genetically
modified food and had the kids

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:17.050 align:middle line:90%
eat all organic food--

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:18.940 align:middle line:90%
no pesticides, no GMOs.

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And the changes I've
seen are remarkable.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.930 align:middle line:10%
>> So we went from,
your son has autism,

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:29.610 align:middle line:10%
your daughter has asthma,
to, no, they don't.

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:33.180 align:middle line:10%
>> It's been eight years
since my diagnosis.

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:37.130 align:middle line:84%
I compete in triathlons,
and I feel great.

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I am 22 weeks pregnant,
and I feel fantastic.

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>> This shift can only come
by a global desire to change

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:48.050 align:middle line:90%
our food supply.

00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:51.560 align:middle line:84%
>> The removal of genetically
modified foods, glyphosate,

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:53.885 align:middle line:84%
and pesticides was
the fundamental,

00:39:53.885 --> 00:39:58.340 align:middle line:84%
the foundation for
why we all recovered.

00:39:58.340 --> 00:39:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
exciting, Jeffrey.

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:00.560 align:middle line:90%
Good for you.

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:01.476 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It's amazing.

00:40:01.476 --> 00:40:04.400 align:middle line:84%
I hear more testimonials
about the effects

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.310 align:middle line:84%
of removing GMOs and switching
to organic than perhaps

00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:08.720 align:middle line:90%
anyone in the world.

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And when I released
my previous film,

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:12.140 align:middle line:84%
"Genetic Roulette,"
I was besieged

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:13.820 align:middle line:90%
by these type of stories.

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And so I felt this
incredible pressure

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:17.330 align:middle line:90%
to share this with the world.

00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:19.630 align:middle line:84%
Because I became more
convinced than ever.

00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:22.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm talking to,
let's say, 2,500 doctors

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:24.660 align:middle line:84%
at a conference, and I say,
how many people are removing

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:26.390 align:middle line:90%
GMOs from your patients' diets?

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:27.480 align:middle line:90%
And all these hands go up.

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:28.910 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, what
are you noticing?

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:30.565 align:middle line:90%
And it's these type of things.

00:40:30.565 --> 00:40:31.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And
they're real things.

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:33.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There are three
autistic kids in our film.

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Two are no longer
autistic, and one

00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:37.670 align:middle line:84%
was so better he switched
to a mainstream classroom

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:38.660 align:middle line:90%
for the first time.

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:41.529 align:middle line:84%
And the main reason the parents
say was switching to organic.

00:40:41.529 --> 00:40:43.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you call this movie?

00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:44.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: "Secret Ingredients."

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:45.639 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: "Secret ingredients."

00:40:45.639 --> 00:40:48.170 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: The website is
SecretIngredientsMovie.com.

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:52.070 align:middle line:84%
&Gt;>NOORY: As we look at
the future of our own health,

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:56.780 align:middle line:84%
of our own well-being, it would
seem like government is going

00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:59.930 align:middle line:84%
to continue pushing
the corporate angle.

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:03.230 align:middle line:84%
We've got to keep
fighting back this way.

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Have you in your
career, Jeffery,

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:09.920 align:middle line:84%
ever felt as if they
were out to get you?

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Probably yes, always.

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:13.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING] I mean, if you look--

00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:17.120 align:middle line:84%
you can Google my name,
and you can find our stuff,

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:20.180 align:middle line:84%
and you can find their
disinformation campaign,

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:24.029 align:middle line:84%
where they try and create all
sorts of half truths about me.

00:41:24.029 --> 00:41:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And I was just reading
something about this

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:29.716 align:middle line:84%
this morning, how they
completely try and mess up

00:41:29.716 --> 00:41:32.090 align:middle line:84%
the reader, thinking that
everything that I say is wrong,

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:33.800 align:middle line:90%
so don't bother looking at it.

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.960 align:middle line:84%
They don't want people
to read the evidence.

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.790 align:middle line:84%
Because we have
caught them red-handed

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:39.500 align:middle line:90%
covering up their problems.

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't bother trying
to find all the instances where

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:45.050 align:middle line:90%
they're discrediting me.

00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:46.520 align:middle line:90%
I actually ignore it.

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:49.105 align:middle line:84%
Because if I can reach out and
convince a million people here

00:41:49.105 --> 00:41:50.480 align:middle line:84%
and a half a
million people there

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:54.560 align:middle line:84%
and a whole country over there,
it's a numbers game, George.

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:57.500 align:middle line:84%
If we can move enough
people into non-GMO eating,

00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:59.270 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter if
they've defamed me

00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:00.590 align:middle line:90%
all over the internet.

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:03.500 align:middle line:10%
Because we win, they
lose their salary,

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:06.200 align:middle line:10%
they go away, we end up
with a non-GMO food supply.

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If we didn't have
GMOs, what would Jeffery Smith

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:10.610 align:middle line:90%
be doing right now?

00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I think about
that from time to time.

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:14.185 align:middle line:90%
I'll let you know.

00:42:14.185 --> 00:42:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is an interesting,
perplexing question.

00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I would have
put myself out of a job.

00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:18.380 align:middle line:90%
That's my goal.

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You seem like you're
the Ralph Nader of consumerism,

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:21.230 align:middle line:90%
though.

that I have an option that
once we get rid of GMOs,

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:29.794 align:middle line:10%
I can go to other technologies
that are irresponsible

00:42:29.794 --> 00:42:31.460 align:middle line:10%
and take them into
the responsible side.

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:33.800 align:middle line:84%

you're watching things for us.
