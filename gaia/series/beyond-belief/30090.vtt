00:00:01.499 --> 00:00:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>>And I think many
people today don't

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.412 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:04.412 --> 00:00:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on--

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.870 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.072 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:17.072 --> 00:00:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>>We need to give
people the information.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.420 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.920 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.560 align:middle line:84%
>>And now, the host of the
nationally syndicated "Coast

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.100 align:middle line:84%
to Coast AM" and GaiamTV
bring you "Beyond Belief"

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.377 align:middle line:90%
with George Noory.

00:00:30.377 --> 00:00:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.310 align:middle line:84%
A long time ago in a
far off land, there

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.810 align:middle line:90%
was a name called Nostradamus.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And that very special
person wrote in quatrains.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Not a lot of people at
the time could figure out

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.450 align:middle line:90%
exactly what he meant.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Not only will our
guest interpret

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.360 align:middle line:84%
some of those special
quatrains, but he's

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.010 align:middle line:90%
very prophetic on his own.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.210 align:middle line:90%
Let's hear it for John Hogue.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.750 align:middle line:90%
Hey, John.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.599 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:59.599 --> 00:01:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>> JOHN HOGUE: Thank you.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.129 align:middle line:90%
Hey, hey.

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:02.107 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Good to have
you here, my friend.

00:01:02.107 --> 00:01:03.090 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.423 align:middle line:90%
>> HOGUE: Good to see you again.

00:01:04.423 --> 00:01:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Have a seat.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.220 align:middle line:84%
John, you look like the
modern day Nostradamus.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.570 align:middle line:90%
Almost identical.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.975 align:middle line:90%
How come? [LAUGHS]

00:01:13.975 --> 00:01:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: I think I look
more like Johannes Brahms.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.933 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.175 align:middle line:90%
But you may be reincarnated.

00:01:18.175 --> 00:01:18.800 align:middle line:90%
You may be him.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: Well,
it could be this.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.440 align:middle line:84%
You know how you start
looking like your dog,

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.150 align:middle line:84%
or you start looking
like your wife?

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.732 align:middle line:84%
When you're married to something
for over a quarter century--

00:01:30.732 --> 00:01:31.690 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.606 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: --that I've
actually been published,

00:01:33.606 --> 00:01:35.260 align:middle line:84%
But another 10
years before that.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.661 align:middle line:84%
And then yes, you start
looking like Nostradamus.

00:01:37.661 --> 00:01:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: [BARKING] Like that.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.050 align:middle line:90%
>> HOGUE: [CHORTLING]

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.250 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Who was Nostradamus?

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: Nostradamus was born
in 1503, and died in 1566.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.220 align:middle line:84%
If he had done
nothing in prophesy,

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.555 align:middle line:84%
he would still go down as
one of the great physicians

00:01:55.555 --> 00:01:58.740 align:middle line:90%
and healers of the 16th century.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.930 align:middle line:84%
He was known to have
single-handedly cured

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.220 align:middle line:84%
the plague in several
cities in South France,

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.940 align:middle line:90%
where he was born.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And he was also very
well known in his time

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.750 align:middle line:90%
as a maker of recipes.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.610 align:middle line:90%
Of cosmetics.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.600 align:middle line:90%
He had a cosmetics industry.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.670 align:middle line:84%
He also was truly
French in that he

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.200 align:middle line:84%
was a culinary genius in a
lot of things that he did.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.400 align:middle line:84%
His interest in prophecy
was a small part

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.900 align:middle line:84%
of what was a lifetime
of a Renaissance man

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.120 align:middle line:84%
who had many, many
passions and interests.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.720 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Was he
loved during his era?

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.510 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: Well, he had the
distinction of being the Jeane

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.674 align:middle line:90%
Dixon of his time.

00:02:37.674 --> 00:02:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Ah-ha.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I mean, he had a
very, very similar situation,

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.420 align:middle line:84%
where he started serializing
his history of the future,

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.920 align:middle line:90%
"Le prophete."

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Very generic title,
" The Prophecies."

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.700 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: It was supposed to
be 10 volumes of 100 quatrains,

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.000 align:middle line:84%
four-line poems apiece,
with a couple prose openings

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.880 align:middle line:90%
to the serializations.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.210 align:middle line:84%
It took a decade to be
released, but the first one

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.700 align:middle line:84%
that was released in
1555 got the attention

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.800 align:middle line:84%
of the Queen of France,
Catherine of Medici,

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.790 align:middle line:90%
who was quite an occultist.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:10.550 align:middle line:90%
He was summoned.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.900 align:middle line:84%
She nagged her
husband, Henry II,

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.180 align:middle line:84%
to have him summoned to court
and explain a quatrain which

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.860 align:middle line:84%
seemed to describe her husband's
death in a jousting accident.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.830 align:middle line:84%
So what's intriguing about
this is that before he could

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.720 align:middle line:84%
actually get your
book published,

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.210 align:middle line:84%
you had to send it to a
special office in the court.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.255 align:middle line:84%
And anything that was
occult, Catherine of Medici

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:36.380 align:middle line:84%
was probably the first
person in France to read it.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.338 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: She'd get it.

00:03:37.338 --> 00:03:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: To give
it the royal seal.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And so, she was
his first reader.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.530 align:middle line:90%
Probably his first disciple.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And then, because he
came out of the audience,

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure that he talked
about the other prophecies

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.950 align:middle line:84%
in the very same
volume that described

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.470 align:middle line:90%
two possibilities for the King.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Either he dies in
jousting accident,

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.310 align:middle line:84%
or he becomes
Cherim Saline, which

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.170 align:middle line:84%
is an anagram, a wordplay, for
Henrick, the H of his livery,

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.190 align:middle line:84%
and a crescent for his mistress,
Diane de Poitiers, Saline,

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.890 align:middle line:90%
the moon.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And so, everybody knew that he
was talking about Henry II, who

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.010 align:middle line:84%
was a very handsome jock,
but not much upstairs.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And so, rather than become the
second Charlemagne of France

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.110 align:middle line:84%
as predicted, several
years later in 1559,

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.080 align:middle line:84%
he died in a jousting
accident, exactly

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.100 align:middle line:90%
as the quatrain described.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why did he bury
his prophetic writings

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.350 align:middle line:84%
in quatrains, where nobody at
the time understood what he was

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.190 align:middle line:90%
writing about?

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: Well, actually,
in the 16th century,

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.560 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people wrote in
quatrains, in word plays,

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.140 align:middle line:84%
using classical
metaphors, anagrams.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.460 align:middle line:90%
It was the riot of the time.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.918 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look
at Shakespeare,

00:04:50.918 --> 00:04:56.460 align:middle line:84%
who's a near contemporary, you
find a lot of puns and anagrams

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.420 align:middle line:90%
in Shakespeare.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.290 align:middle line:84%
It was the fad of
writing of the time.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.120 align:middle line:84%
So what's more
intriguing to me is

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.100 align:middle line:84%
why the Luke Garricos and some
of these other visionaries

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.880 align:middle line:84%
of the time get
all but forgotten.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that Nostradamus,
using anagrams, using

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.780 align:middle line:84%
a charlatan's technique--
which he said would cause him

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.174 align:middle line:90%
a lot of troubles.

00:05:18.174 --> 00:05:19.840 align:middle line:84%
But he said, when I
look at the future--

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.890 align:middle line:84%
he soul searched for years
about writing this book.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.390 align:middle line:84%
Not just at the harm that might
come to him, a Christianized

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.850 align:middle line:84%
Jew, and to his family,
because of church justices.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.330 align:middle line:84%
But also in some
of his prophecies,

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.420 align:middle line:84%
it looks like he's very clearly
describing a man named Hister

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:44.250 align:middle line:84%
who would invade France through
the forest of the Ardennes,

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.300 align:middle line:84%
and the great French
empire would fall.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And when Goebbels, the
propaganda minister of Hitler,

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.410 align:middle line:84%
actually used Nostradamus'
verses in a propaganda war

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.530 align:middle line:84%
with the French
before the invasion,

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Nostradamus may have
seen that, and realized

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.780 align:middle line:84%
that I have to obscure
this enough so that it's

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.730 align:middle line:84%
a little harder for good people
to find out what I'm actually

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:13.110 align:middle line:84%
saying, and a little more
difficult also for evil people.

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.070 align:middle line:90%
I mean, give an example here.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.410 align:middle line:84%
What if Saddam Hussein
recognized himself

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.660 align:middle line:84%
in the prophecies, and realized
that invading Kuwait before he

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.072 align:middle line:84%
had nuclear tipped scud missiles
to hit Israel was a dumb idea?

00:06:25.072 --> 00:06:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He would have
backed off for a while.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: Who would be
responsible for that snafu,

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.160 align:middle line:90%
if it was too clear?

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.249 align:middle line:84%
If he called Hister
rather Hitler,

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:38.540 align:middle line:84%
even though he says he's
going to be born in the Norica

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Mountains, which is the Roman
Latin ancient term for Austria,

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:48.220 align:middle line:84%
that he-- Hister is the ancient
name of the River Danube.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:53.800 align:middle line:84%
He grew up in Linz, Austria at
the shores of the river Danube.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.280 align:middle line:84%
He was also call the
Captain of Greater Germany.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:02.290 align:middle line:84%
He described him as a man with
a crooked cross as his symbol.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:06.536 align:middle line:84%
That he would break
treaties in '41, '45.

00:07:06.536 --> 00:07:07.390 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Amazing.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: And then the one that
talks about him being buried

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.540 align:middle line:84%
in an iron cage, and no one
would know for sure what

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.540 align:middle line:84%
actually happened to him, when
the whole world was against

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:18.680 align:middle line:90%
Hister.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Now we think of the
Fuhrerbunker as finished

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.460 align:middle line:90%
in its cement bunker.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.360 align:middle line:84%
But I saw pictures
of the Fuhrerbunker

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.855 align:middle line:84%
when it was being built, and
it was a gigantic Rebar cage

00:07:28.855 --> 00:07:32.730 align:middle line:84%
of two stories deep down
in the Reich Chancellery.

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was an epiphany
for me saying,

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.460 align:middle line:90%
ah, he saw it as the cage.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:43.700 align:middle line:84%
So that's just a little
touch of some of the things

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:49.020 align:middle line:84%
that-- and I must also say that
in the over 1,500 verses, not

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.880 align:middle line:84%
just those in his major
work, "Le prophete,"

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.370 align:middle line:84%
"The Prophecies," but also
in all of his other works,

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.660 align:middle line:84%
that there is a huge
amount of his work

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.760 align:middle line:84%
which is completely
open to interpretation.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.761 align:middle line:84%
But there are, just when as
a scholar of Nostradamus,

00:08:05.761 --> 00:08:07.260 align:middle line:84%
just when there's
a moment where you

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.950 align:middle line:84%
want to throw the book to
the wall and say, come on,

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:15.390 align:middle line:84%
like light through the fog
comes a date, a name, a thing.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was almost
like he's expecting

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.030 align:middle line:84%
at a certain critical
mass of your attention

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:22.589 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to
say, aw, this is all BS,

00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:23.380 align:middle line:90%
something is there.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.921 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds of prophecies
are like that.

00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are there still some
prophecies from Nostradamus

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.320 align:middle line:84%
that have not happened yet
that you see in the future?

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.360 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: Well, Nostradamus
dated the end of his chronicle

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.380 align:middle line:84%
"Future History of Man"
to the year 3797 AD,

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.735 align:middle line:84%
which is nearly
1800 years from now.

00:08:42.735 --> 00:08:43.699 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:08:43.699 --> 00:08:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>> HOGUE: So, yeah.

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:48.110 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of history left.

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:51.940 align:middle line:84%
The other problem with this is
there's a lot of history that

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.580 align:middle line:84%
was definitely seen that's
never going to happen.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.380 align:middle line:84%
Because what I have
learned from studying

00:08:56.380 --> 00:09:01.480 align:middle line:84%
him is that there are
alternative futures.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:05.880 align:middle line:84%
The most famous one being
that launched him into fame.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.170 align:middle line:84%
That in his first serialization
of his early prophecies,

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Catherine de Medici was one
of the first people, the Queen

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.110 align:middle line:84%
of France, to read
his prophecy, that

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:18.080 align:middle line:84%
looked at the death of
her husband, Henry II,

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.750 align:middle line:90%
in a jousting accident.

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.440 align:middle line:84%
It became such the
talk of court--

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: She must
have panicked.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:23.510 align:middle line:90%
>> HOGUE: Well, she did.

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And being an occultist,
she panicked,

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:28.440 align:middle line:84%
and she wanted to see
this Nostradamus fellow,

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.610 align:middle line:84%
and he was called to the
court in August 1555.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.790 align:middle line:84%
We don't know exactly what was
stated in the conversation,

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.580 align:middle line:84%
but I imagine that
Nostradamus described the two

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.230 align:middle line:84%
alternative futures that he
had written for the King.

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:44.030 align:middle line:84%
One, he dies in a
jousting accident.

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Two, he becomes the
second Charlemagne,

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:49.910 align:middle line:84%
and even incorporates
Savoy and Northern Italy

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:52.920 align:middle line:84%
as part of what we
would call France today.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.560 align:middle line:90%
Well, he didn't do the latter.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.970 align:middle line:84%
There at least 15
prophecies that

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.520 align:middle line:84%
describe in detail a
history that never happened.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.590 align:middle line:90%
And why?

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:04.059 align:middle line:84%
Because being the
jock that he was--

00:10:04.059 --> 00:10:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: No.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: And even said, he
did comment a few months after

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:12.240 align:middle line:84%
the meeting, said, I can't
think of a better way to go than

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.080 align:middle line:84%
in a ritual combat,
fighting a fellow knight.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And if there's an
accident, it's fine.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:20.130 align:middle line:90%
And so, he chose that path.

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:24.070 align:middle line:84%
Several years later
in 1559, Nostradamus

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:26.860 align:middle line:84%
attained the fame of Jeane
Dixon in his own time

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:31.790 align:middle line:84%
by documenting a prophecy widely
known that was then fulfilled.

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And then he became the talk
of the courts of Europe.

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: In this particular
case with the King,

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:38.840 align:middle line:84%
did he die in a
jousting accident?

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.510 align:middle line:90%
>> HOGUE: He did.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:42.925 align:middle line:84%
The elements of the
prophecy are, the young lion

00:10:42.925 --> 00:10:46.530 align:middle line:84%
shall face the older lion
in a field of ritual combat.

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:49.790 align:middle line:84%
It is said that they
had both lions embossed

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.490 align:middle line:90%
on their shields.

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:55.690 align:middle line:84%
He will be pierced
through a gilded cage.

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:58.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, that sounds very
strange unless you understand

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.580 align:middle line:84%
that the King's
visor was gilded.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.538 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:11:00.538 --> 00:11:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: And a splinter from
de Lorges, who was fighting him,

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:04.050 align:middle line:90%
broke--

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:04.430 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: From his lance?

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: --and penetrated
through the visor.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:06.360 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Through his lance?

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:06.690 align:middle line:90%
>> HOGUE: Yes.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:07.570 align:middle line:90%
Through his lance.

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:09.250 align:middle line:90%
And penetrated behind his eye.

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And he said, both blinded
and dying a horrible death.

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:15.370 align:middle line:84%
He died of peritonitis
in agony 10 days later.

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And on the day of his
death, a mob in Paris

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.350 align:middle line:84%
came to the justices
of the Church

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:25.086 align:middle line:84%
with effigies of Nostradamus
aflame and said, burn this man.

00:11:25.086 --> 00:11:27.210 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They thought he
was a witch or something.

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:28.510 align:middle line:90%
>> HOGUE: Absolutely.

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:32.020 align:middle line:84%
When he had been
years before visiting

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.610 align:middle line:84%
on the grace of
the King and Queen,

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:37.190 align:middle line:84%
he had to leave early
when the justices wanted

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:40.800 align:middle line:84%
to ask him how he
did what he did.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And he always kept that
close to his chest,

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.220 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of what
he did was related

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:48.240 align:middle line:84%
to Hebraic astrological
calculations.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of books
that he said were

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:55.860 align:middle line:84%
forbidden that he burned, and
described an unholy light that

00:11:55.860 --> 00:12:00.260 align:middle line:84%
came out of his large
fireplace in Salon-de-Provence

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.089 align:middle line:90%
in South France where he lived.

00:12:02.089 --> 00:12:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, that could have
been resin from ancient books

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.190 align:middle line:90%
making funny colors.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:09.170 align:middle line:84%
But he said it was this white,
unholy light permeating all

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:10.070 align:middle line:90%
through the house.

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:13.190 align:middle line:84%
That could have also
been a ruse to say, yes,

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:14.580 align:middle line:90%
I did look at that bad stuff.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.130 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the
existential argument

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:17.140 align:middle line:90%
is the best way to save you.

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:18.556 align:middle line:84%
Rather than say,
no, no, I haven't

00:12:18.556 --> 00:12:20.870 align:middle line:84%
looked at all that stuff,
you say, yes I did,

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:22.559 align:middle line:90%
and I am chastened by it.

00:12:22.559 --> 00:12:23.600 align:middle line:90%
And I burned those books.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We're going to take
some of your questions for John

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:26.240 align:middle line:90%
Hogue.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.190 align:middle line:90%
So who's got one right now?

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Just hold your hand up,
and we'll get right to you,

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.750 align:middle line:84%
as we talk about the
prophecies of Nostradamus.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:34.347 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:12:34.347 --> 00:12:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: You know, not
to go to the end of the book,

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:40.650 align:middle line:84%
but his prophecies were also
very positive, weren't they?

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:45.940 align:middle line:84%
In that he said that
mankind would eventually

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.690 align:middle line:84%
achieve a new level,
or a new conscience?

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:50.401 align:middle line:90%
>> HOGUE: Well--

00:12:50.401 --> 00:12:51.650 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Was he upbeat, John?

00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:52.780 align:middle line:90%
Actually, no.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:57.260 align:middle line:84%
There are very, very few moments
where Nostradamus is upbeat.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.170 align:middle line:84%
He is one of the most
pessimistic prophets

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:01.290 align:middle line:90%
I've ever dealt with.

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:04.850 align:middle line:84%
But that is the nature of his
conditioning as a 16th century

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:05.760 align:middle line:90%
man.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And it was compassionate
that he was so scary,

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:13.500 align:middle line:84%
because I'm sure some of you
have seen the show "Scared

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Straight," where
a bunch of punks

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:20.930 align:middle line:84%
come into a maximum prison,
and then the lifers scare

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:23.319 align:middle line:84%
them enough to
make them not be--

00:13:23.319 --> 00:13:24.360 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Bad ever again.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.730 align:middle line:90%
>> HOGUE: Life of crime.

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, Nostradamus did
that with all of us

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.870 align:middle line:90%
in the coming generations.

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:34.910 align:middle line:84%
He tried to scare us off
certain negative trends.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:39.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, it is true, and the rarity
of his positive statements

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.950 align:middle line:84%
have far more power,
because they are so rare,

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:49.000 align:middle line:84%
that he does talk about
an evolution of humanity.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.590 align:middle line:84%
A golden age that will
come after a great crises.

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:57.060 align:middle line:84%
But his astrological
prophecies indicate

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:00.140 align:middle line:84%
that that is not
coming any time soon.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps the
most dangerous time

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.500 align:middle line:84%
is before us in the
next two decades.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.410 align:middle line:90%


00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:11.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he is like
many other predictors

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:13.690 align:middle line:84%
of other prophetic
traditions that

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:17.610 align:middle line:84%
foresaw the rising of
oceans, the sky inflamed

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:22.150 align:middle line:84%
with the sun desiccating
great tracts of latitude 48

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:23.850 align:middle line:90%
across the Earth.

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Which is all the major Northern
hemispheric grain belts.

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:33.100 align:middle line:84%
He described global
warming 450 years ago,

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.590 align:middle line:90%
like many traditions do.

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:37.980 align:middle line:84%
But even in greater detail,
describing how you'll come

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:41.430 align:middle line:84%
see a period of time where
there are mountains of grain.

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And then he goes
and describes a tube

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:46.660 align:middle line:84%
that breathes through a
hole in the floor that

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:47.820 align:middle line:90%
sends this grain through.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.040 align:middle line:84%
It's like he's trying
to describe a grain

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:56.410 align:middle line:84%
mill, a 20th century grain mill
from a 1500s point of view.

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:57.910 align:middle line:84%
But he says, there
will be mounds

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:00.420 align:middle line:84%
of grain, which is an
unbelievable sight,

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:02.640 align:middle line:90%
even for a man in the 1500s.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.860 align:middle line:84%
But there will be man
eating his fellow man.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:10.140 align:middle line:84%
So it shows that something
that we're already seeing today

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:15.860 align:middle line:84%
in the great imbalance of
wealth, the 99% versus the 1%

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.500 align:middle line:84%
is also a great
imbalance in those

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.860 align:middle line:84%
who have the mountains
of grain stored,

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:25.410 align:middle line:84%
and those who could be fed,
but can't even afford the food.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And then when you add
to that desisccating

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.200 align:middle line:84%
central continents, which are
definitely in his prophecies,

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.670 align:middle line:84%
the rising of the ocean where
the ocean will reach Paris

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:39.610 align:middle line:84%
from the Seine, you're
being scared straight.

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:43.317 align:middle line:84%
Are you being scared
straight to change it?

00:15:43.317 --> 00:15:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How about another one?

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:45.483 align:middle line:90%
Who's got something?

00:15:45.483 --> 00:15:47.820 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I know that
some of the prophesy,

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:53.950 align:middle line:84%
people who divine prophecy
throughout time have different

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:56.980 align:middle line:84%
modalities of achieving
this prophecy.

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.970 align:middle line:90%
Edgar Cayce was in hypnosis.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:03.447 align:middle line:84%
How do you think Nostradamus
was getting his information?

00:16:03.447 --> 00:16:05.780 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: Edgar Cayce was
known as the sleeping prophet,

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:08.980 align:middle line:84%
because the vast majority
of his 14,000 plus readings,

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:14.300 align:middle line:84%
most of which were about
healing the sick and doing life

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:19.450 align:middle line:84%
readings for people, were
basically done in a sleep

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:20.190 align:middle line:90%
trance.

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:23.050 align:middle line:84%
He used to put himself
into a trance on the couch,

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:26.320 align:middle line:84%
and they would record what he
would say, and document it.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And when he'd come out of it,
he'd say, what did we get?

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:33.700 align:middle line:84%
So except for a few waking dream
visionary prophecies, which

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:37.370 align:middle line:84%
are also quite amazing,
but very rare with Cayce,

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:41.050 align:middle line:84%
he was not home when
it was happening.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:45.210 align:middle line:84%
Nostradamus took a different
structure, and a unique one,

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:48.330 align:middle line:84%
in that he was a man
who-- I don't really

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.050 align:middle line:84%
know of any other person
in that period of time

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:57.000 align:middle line:84%
or before, even after,
that would amalgamate

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.690 align:middle line:84%
many different traditions
into his own customized

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:02.990 align:middle line:90%
version of magic.

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:05.240 align:middle line:90%
We get few hints of what he did.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.804 align:middle line:84%
And it really puts
a cabash on a lot

00:17:06.804 --> 00:17:08.220 align:middle line:84%
of the people who
have been trying

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:11.210 align:middle line:84%
to say he was part of
a secret organization

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:13.280 align:middle line:84%
or group, the Knights
Templar or others,

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:17.170 align:middle line:84%
because anybody who would stray
from the exact and secretive

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:20.890 align:middle line:84%
discipline, which
Nostradamus did all the time,

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:24.520 align:middle line:84%
would at the very least not
be included in the order,

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.930 align:middle line:84%
and the very worst,
assassinated.

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:30.460 align:middle line:90%
So he was a lone wolf.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.780 align:middle line:90%
He was extremely dyslexic.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:36.480 align:middle line:84%
It helps to be dyslexic to
study the works of Nostradamus.

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.736 align:middle line:90%
I'm dyslexic, so it helps.

00:17:38.736 --> 00:17:39.610 align:middle line:90%
If I said something--

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:41.930 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So you are
reincarnated from him.

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:45.340 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: Reincarnated from
him am I. [LAUGHING] No.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:49.180 align:middle line:90%


00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:55.180 align:middle line:84%
So Nostradamus,
unfortunately I'm

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.780 align:middle line:84%
at fault for a
misinterpretation.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.460 align:middle line:84%
It was true that Nostradamus
stared in bowls of water

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.690 align:middle line:90%
doing hydromancy.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:05.736 align:middle line:84%
The Hollywood picked that up,
and many of the documentaries

00:18:05.736 --> 00:18:06.360 align:middle line:90%
picked that up.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And now, you have this
poor mythology of,

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.780 align:middle line:84%
Nostradamus did nothing
but stare at bowls of water

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:12.360 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.624 align:middle line:90%
Which is actually, he used that.

00:18:14.624 --> 00:18:15.540 align:middle line:90%
He used magic mirrors.

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:18.100 align:middle line:84%
He used all the
tools of the occult.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.760 align:middle line:90%
He used Grimoires of Solomon.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:24.550 align:middle line:84%
He probably put himself in
a circle with the triangle

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:28.110 align:middle line:84%
to the right, where he
would conjure spirits.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:30.460 align:middle line:84%
He was fundamentally
a theurgist,

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:35.540 align:middle line:84%
who took the Neoplatonist
works of Iamblichus

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:37.810 align:middle line:84%
from second century
as his bible,

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:42.610 align:middle line:84%
because he quotes it outright
in the Marcino Fuccio

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:45.669 align:middle line:90%
edition in Latin.

00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:48.210 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have to go all over
the Mediterranean to find this,

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:52.090 align:middle line:84%
as some authors said, because
he always was nearby Marseilles.

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:55.940 align:middle line:84%
Marseilles is a port that was
a window to all the information

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.000 align:middle line:84%
that came through the
Mediterranean world.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And as much as he detested
the city in his writings,

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:05.230 align:middle line:84%
he even spent some time there,
because the tables of libraries

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:07.750 align:middle line:84%
at the wharfs had all
these remarkable books.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:11.780 align:middle line:84%
One of them being
to Fuccino's work.

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:17.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, he also would then
take the Oracle Delphi,

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:23.090 align:middle line:84%
and he would be like a priest,
rather than a priestess,

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:24.460 align:middle line:90%
sitting on a brass tripod.

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.990 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have the fissure
for the volcanic vent

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:30.120 align:middle line:84%
to create the noxious
sulfuric fumes that

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.650 align:middle line:84%
would make him go
off into a trance.

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:35.190 align:middle line:84%
So he had to do what
the brachide, which

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:37.160 align:middle line:84%
he says bronchus
is what he uses.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.680 align:middle line:84%
The brachide, who were the
priests and priestesses

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.455 align:middle line:90%
of Apollo.

00:19:41.455 --> 00:19:44.230 align:middle line:84%
They lived in Asia
Minor Greek colonies.

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:48.110 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't have a volcano,
so they had to improvise.

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:52.360 align:middle line:84%
So they had a brisket
with an iron bowl,

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.580 align:middle line:84%
and then they would
boil the noxious fumes

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.460 align:middle line:84%
with Devil's turds,
other things,

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.560 align:middle line:90%
to make this terrible smell.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And then he would
then purify himself.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.020 align:middle line:90%
Another big myth.

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:05.630 align:middle line:84%
No one's seen Nostradamus
in his street clothes

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:06.960 align:middle line:90%
doing hocus pocus.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He always
had robes on.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.305 align:middle line:90%
>> HOGUE: Yeah.

00:20:08.305 --> 00:20:10.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, he has his hat,
his three-cornered hat,

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.780 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And what he would
do is go through

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:15.430 align:middle line:90%
a spiritual purification.

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:18.100 align:middle line:84%
He would strip all of
his street clothes off.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.370 align:middle line:84%
He would purify him
in a bowl of water.

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:22.050 align:middle line:90%
He would wash himself.

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:22.900 align:middle line:90%
Douche himself over.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And then he would put on
a white robe with a hood.

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:30.020 align:middle line:84%
He would become a
Neoplatonist like Iamblichus.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:33.530 align:middle line:84%
He would look like he had
walked out of the ancient Roman

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:35.240 align:middle line:90%
necromantic times.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:38.380 align:middle line:84%
He would then mount
his brass tripod.

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And then with a laurel branch
in the column of the mist,

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.790 align:middle line:84%
he would then begin
his incantations

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:49.070 align:middle line:84%
that are secret only to him,
lilting deeper and deeper

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:50.930 align:middle line:90%
into a trance state.

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:53.343 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point,
he would reach down

00:20:53.343 --> 00:20:56.650 align:middle line:84%
with the laurel branch, dip
it into the boiling water

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:59.690 align:middle line:84%
sulfuric fumes,
and then flick it

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:02.710 align:middle line:84%
on his foot, and
the hem of his robe.

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And then, the sting
of that scolding,

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:09.090 align:middle line:84%
he would feel a great terror,
and then followed by divine

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:09.940 align:middle line:90%
splendour.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And then he would say, the
God to the side speaks.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:21.240 align:middle line:84%
So he was a channeler, as
we would rather vulgarly

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.950 align:middle line:90%
call it in our time.

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:24.040 align:middle line:90%
A New Age channeler.

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Although I prefer the term
medium, who would then

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:32.100 align:middle line:84%
conjure up either
within his inner mind,

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:35.710 align:middle line:84%
or literally in that triangle,
spirits that could be lower

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:41.240 align:middle line:84%
astral, demonic, or
Archons, gods, people.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Using his classical
metaphors, we

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:46.070 align:middle line:84%
would describe them as beings
from higher planes that

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:49.110 align:middle line:84%
would show him a dark and
shadowy view of the future,

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:51.860 align:middle line:84%
and then tell him
what is going on.

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:57.675 align:middle line:84%
And then out of this trance, he
would then with a sacred pen,

00:21:57.675 --> 00:21:58.300 align:middle line:90%
goose feather--

00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:58.700 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And he'd write.

00:21:58.700 --> 00:21:59.090 align:middle line:90%
>> HOGUE: He'd write.

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: John, we're
going to take this break.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:03.310 align:middle line:84%
We're going to come right back
with John Hogue on "Beyond

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:06.568 align:middle line:84%
Belief," talk about this
Mayan calendar dates.

00:22:06.568 --> 00:22:10.472 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:10.472 --> 00:22:12.424 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:12.424 --> 00:22:21.696 align:middle line:90%


00:22:21.696 --> 00:22:23.354 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:23.354 --> 00:22:25.270 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And welcome
back to "Beyond Belief,"

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:26.790 align:middle line:84%
with John Hogue,
our special guest,

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:29.680 align:middle line:84%
as we talk about the
prophecies of Nostradamus.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Today is a very
interesting day, John.

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:37.460 align:middle line:84%
It's December 21, 2012, the
Mayan calendar end date.

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:40.420 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
think, this is it.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:42.680 align:middle line:90%
There'll be no Saturday.

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.570 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean to you?

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: Well, the whole
feeling of, this day is it,

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:52.280 align:middle line:84%
really stems from how everybody
expected the year 2000,

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.510 align:middle line:84%
which was the ultimate moment
for Chicken Little to really

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:56.926 align:middle line:84%
get hit on the
head with the sky--

00:22:56.926 --> 00:22:58.240 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: The Y2K and all that.

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.010 align:middle line:90%
>> HOGUE: --and all that.

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And yet it passed unremarkable
for doom and gloom.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:07.660 align:middle line:84%
But as we get 12 years
into the 21st century,

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.440 align:middle line:84%
it seems more and
more of the things

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.930 align:middle line:90%
that we were all anticipating--

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:11.846 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Are coming--

00:23:11.846 --> 00:23:14.250 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: --are
coming to fruition.

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And so it has brought
more attention

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:22.950 align:middle line:84%
to a calendar system that is the
most ancient accurate calendar

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:24.070 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:26.620 align:middle line:84%
There are other more
ancient calendar systems,

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:28.350 align:middle line:84%
but this one is
the most accurate.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:32.730 align:middle line:84%
It has a leap year
every 320,000 years.

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:35.640 align:middle line:84%
And so, people are
logically, common sense

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:39.630 align:middle line:84%
says, well, if it's the most
accurate calendar, then when

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:43.000 align:middle line:84%
its age does a reboot,
that's the real millennium.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.310 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They're scared.

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:45.430 align:middle line:90%
They think it's over.

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:46.040 align:middle line:90%
It ends.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.450 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: Well, there's another
group of people that embrace it

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:52.620 align:middle line:84%
in a completely different
way that they think that

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:56.520 align:middle line:84%
they're going to get a
contact enlightenment high.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.867 align:middle line:84%
That they don't
have to do anything.

00:23:58.867 --> 00:24:00.450 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to
work on themselves.

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:03.230 align:middle line:84%
It's just because
the grand alignment

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:08.670 align:middle line:84%
of the Sun with the Earth
and the galactic center,

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:11.380 align:middle line:84%
which is what the Mayan,
some people believe,

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.800 align:middle line:84%
were calculating,
well, that alignments

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.370 align:middle line:84%
going to create some
kind of energy thing

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:18.844 align:middle line:84%
that's a lot like HG Wells'
"The Days of the Comet."

00:24:18.844 --> 00:24:19.510 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:20.210 align:middle line:90%
Or "Space Odyssey."

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:21.720 align:middle line:84%
Something's wonderful's
going to happen.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: Everybody wakes up,
and we've all had our Scrooge

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:27.310 align:middle line:84%
moment, and God bless
us, each and every one.

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:28.070 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Exactly.

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:29.150 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Tiny Tim.

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:31.110 align:middle line:90%
>> HOGUE: Yes.

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And I look at this as
a prophecy scholar,

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:38.390 align:middle line:84%
tracking many, many
different time cycles.

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And I often think
that what has happened

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:44.130 align:middle line:84%
to the poor Mayan calendar and
the Maya is that their date has

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:47.590 align:middle line:84%
become the Lindsay
Lohan of doomsday dates.

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:48.380 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: [LAUGHS]

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: It's gone
Hollywood, folks.

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:52.550 align:middle line:90%
And it's got a lot of drama.

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:53.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a bit simple.

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:54.640 align:middle line:90%
It's blonde.

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:58.350 align:middle line:84%
It's all the projections
and stereotypes

00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:02.230 align:middle line:84%
that we put on stuff that
doesn't really matter.

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:04.180 align:middle line:90%
But it's entertaining.

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And in that it has
been the loss of what

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:10.610 align:middle line:90%
the Mayan calendar really is.

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Also in that is a problem that
the Maya could never solve.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:21.190 align:middle line:84%
Because as great as they were
at calculating time with thumb,

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:28.100 align:middle line:84%
line, and remarkably primitive
tools, without a computer,

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:32.080 align:middle line:84%
you cannot calculate vast
periods of time without some

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.480 align:middle line:90%
miscalculation.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And there are people
who studied it

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.530 align:middle line:90%
at JPL and other laboratories.

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:42.350 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of astronomers,
by the way, who their day job is

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:46.100 align:middle line:84%
astronomy, but their
night hobby is astrology.

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And they have come to understand
that the Mayan 2012 actually

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.300 align:middle line:84%
happened 13 years ago,
between the winter

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:59.610 align:middle line:90%
solstices of 1998 and 1999.

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:07.445 align:middle line:84%
Now, nothing much happened that
could make a 2012 super mega--

00:26:07.445 --> 00:26:08.070 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:09.640 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing
that imprinted us.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:10.250 align:middle line:90%
That I can remember.

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: Buses weren't flying
through fissures with sewer

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:13.700 align:middle line:90%
pipes, and all that.

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.210 align:middle line:90%
It didn't happen.

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:17.180 align:middle line:90%
It didn't Hollywoodize.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.840 align:middle line:84%
But what I think is
important to understand

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.920 align:middle line:84%
is that in the great
calculation of times,

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.050 align:middle line:90%
these are like seasons.

00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:30.240 align:middle line:84%
Can you recall an exact moment
and exact time on your calendar

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:34.320 align:middle line:84%
that winter shifted to spring,
and suddenly all the flowers

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.620 align:middle line:84%
popped out, and the
birds began to sing,

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:38.650 align:middle line:90%
like a Hollywood Disney film?

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:41.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is not
how nature works.

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:43.850 align:middle line:84%
It's not even the
nature of great ages.

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:50.720 align:middle line:84%
These long counts of seasons,
that you have a sudden change.

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:51.450 align:middle line:90%
It's gradual.

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Even if it quickens,
as weather quickens,

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:58.560 align:middle line:84%
during the change of a season,
it also takes some time.

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of my work
is based on actually

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:03.600 align:middle line:90%
talking to Maya people.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And anthropologists who actually
speak Maya and lived with them,

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:10.470 align:middle line:84%
rather than what I came to
understand in press conferences

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:13.530 align:middle line:84%
I did in Mexico
City in 2010, where

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:16.980 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the Mexican press
and all across Latin America

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.886 align:middle line:90%
showed up for this.

00:27:18.886 --> 00:27:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And they were
saying, well, we're

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:24.210 align:middle line:84%
gratified that you're
talking about our heritage.

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:27.460 align:middle line:84%
But we're also a little
confused and overwhelmed by all

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:28.989 align:middle line:84%
the things that
have been loaded on.

00:27:28.989 --> 00:27:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yes, you're
talking about the Gringos

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:31.670 align:middle line:90%
from the North.

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:32.670 align:middle line:90%
The Gringos from North--

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:33.730 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: We did that.

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: Jose
Arguelles and others,

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:39.850 align:middle line:84%
who masterfully
imaginitive stuff,

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:43.930 align:middle line:84%
but it's all projected
on this system.

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And that often
happens, we had this

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:49.630 align:middle line:84%
before when Richard Noone
tried to make May 5, 2000

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:52.190 align:middle line:84%
the time when the
Earth's axis would shift.

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:53.270 align:middle line:90%
And nothing happened.

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:56.150 align:middle line:84%
He wrote a marvelous book
about it that was all wrong,

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:59.570 align:middle line:90%
but it was a great read.

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:03.525 align:middle line:84%
And the late Jose
Arguelles wrote

00:28:03.525 --> 00:28:05.310 align:middle line:90%
some great wonderful stuff.

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:09.510 align:middle line:84%
But as a scholar, I have to hose
it down a little bit and say,

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:11.900 align:middle line:84%
come on folks, it is
more seasonal change.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, basically,
the Mayan calendar--

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:16.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try to make
this as simple as I can.

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:18.740 align:middle line:84%
It is a complicated system,
especially for our minds,

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:21.700 align:middle line:84%
because we think of
the calendar as linear,

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.800 align:middle line:84%
because of our
Judeo-Christian conditioning.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.060 align:middle line:84%
But this is actually
like an odometer.

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:30.240 align:middle line:84%
It's flicking these kins,
these days, again and again.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And at a certain point,
a grand round is made,

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:36.050 align:middle line:84%
and then it clicks
the whole thing up.

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And then, counts it
20 times more time.

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And then, when those 20 times
more time larger periods

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.490 align:middle line:84%
of time reach the
number 13, then it

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:48.900 align:middle line:84%
flicks to another big wheel,
and another big wheel.

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you
basically get what's

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:54.270 align:middle line:84%
called the long count
in the Mayan calendar.

00:28:54.270 --> 00:29:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Which is a baktun
of 400 plus years.

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:04.520 align:middle line:84%
13 times that unit,
you get the grand age.

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:09.165 align:middle line:84%
The round of the grand age,
which started around 3100

00:29:09.165 --> 00:29:14.510 align:middle line:84%
BC, and people are
expecting to end today,

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:17.860 align:middle line:90%
on the 21st of December, 2012.

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:21.240 align:middle line:90%
It is 5,125 years, I believe.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.690 align:middle line:84%
So that, in the simplest form,
it's a very complicated system.

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:27.000 align:middle line:84%
But that is basically what
we're talking about here.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.380 align:middle line:90%
An odometer.

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Now the question is, does it go
back to 0000 and start again,

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:35.250 align:middle line:90%
or is that the end of time?

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:40.590 align:middle line:84%
This theory that the
late Terence McKenna

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:42.330 align:middle line:84%
used to say that
there's a time wave

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:43.840 align:middle line:84%
zero that's supposed
happen tonight.

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.390 align:middle line:84%
But everything's
supposed to stop.

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:48.570 align:middle line:90%


00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:50.486 align:middle line:84%
I think that is a
fundamental misunderstanding

00:29:50.486 --> 00:29:55.150 align:middle line:84%
of the seasonal quality
that the Native Americans

00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:58.770 align:middle line:84%
that I talked to Central,
North, and South.

00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And all their traditions
talk about this

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:04.210 align:middle line:90%
as a seasonal change.

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:07.830 align:middle line:84%
So time will reboot,
and I won't have

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:12.750 align:middle line:84%
to eat this hat in the
few seconds remaining.

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:16.420 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When time reboots,
what does the future hold

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:16.950 align:middle line:90%
for us?

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:19.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have personally
made a lot of predictions

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:21.330 align:middle line:90%
on "Coast to Coast."

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:25.560 align:middle line:84%
You have picked now the last
12 presidential elections.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.640 align:middle line:90%
Uncanny percent.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.160 align:middle line:90%
What's the future hold for us?

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.320 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.870 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: You know, there's
a side to the Mayan calender,

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:36.620 align:middle line:84%
one of its largest and
longest calculations,

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:39.750 align:middle line:84%
as you multiply
20, 13, 20, 13, 20,

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:45.970 align:middle line:84%
you get this huge time clock,
which covers about 64 million

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:46.990 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:50.000 align:middle line:84%
That would mean that
it goes from our time,

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.595 align:middle line:84%
all the way back to a million
years after the big rock--

00:30:54.595 --> 00:30:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wiped
out the dinosaurs.

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:59.630 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: --where the Maya were
many millions of years later.

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And brought us into the age of
the mammals, which brought us

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:07.440 align:middle line:84%
into an age of life on Earth
that could evolved collectively

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:11.020 align:middle line:84%
out of instinct to
sentience with the hominids

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:12.440 align:middle line:90%
and the human beings.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:17.560 align:middle line:84%
So in the biggest season
of the Mayan calendar, that

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:23.030 align:middle line:84%
is changing now, is a season
that for at least 5,000 years

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:25.710 align:middle line:84%
in the last cycle in
history, human beings

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:29.260 align:middle line:84%
are becoming more and more
sentient to a point of crisis

00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:30.440 align:middle line:90%
in our times.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:33.670 align:middle line:84%
So even though the
Mayan calendar actually

00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:36.140 align:middle line:84%
was aligned 13 years
ago, we're still

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:38.640 align:middle line:84%
under the influence
of it going out.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And you could say that there's
an orb in the Mayan calendar.

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:43.420 align:middle line:90%
An orb of degrees.

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:46.060 align:middle line:90%
15 years in, and 15 years out.

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And 2012 actually marks
the last five degrees

00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:53.140 align:middle line:84%
of us being in this
process of lining up

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:55.760 align:middle line:84%
with the galactic
center now lining out.

00:31:55.760 --> 00:32:00.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of like the
final flush of the old

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:01.850 align:middle line:90%
and the beginning of the new.

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:05.255 align:middle line:84%
Now, my feeling
as an interpreter

00:32:05.255 --> 00:32:07.870 align:middle line:84%
and as also a
predictor of future,

00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:11.710 align:middle line:84%
is that once we've
passed this day,

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:14.330 align:middle line:90%
this quickening will continue.

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:16.600 align:middle line:84%
That in a year from
now, after we've

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:21.460 align:middle line:84%
survived 2013 and the roller
coaster ride of 2014, 2015,

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:26.570 align:middle line:84%
2016, we enter a period
of civilization crisis

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:28.970 align:middle line:84%
that many other
traditions who don't

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:31.820 align:middle line:84%
count as much as
the Mayans do say

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:34.280 align:middle line:84%
is what's going to
happen in the 2020s,

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:37.460 align:middle line:84%
where the systemic
flaws of our system,

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:41.320 align:middle line:84%
that we're still trying to drag
into this new and revolutionary

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:46.810 align:middle line:84%
century, is going
to actually unhinge.

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:50.520 align:middle line:84%
There are many prophecies and
native peoples about that there

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:53.510 align:middle line:84%
is a critical mass of too many
people living unconsciously,

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:57.060 align:middle line:84%
thinking and putting out into
psycho-sphere unconscious

00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:00.740 align:middle line:84%
energies, that they call
it this wave of madness.

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Rather than a time wave
zero, there's a madness wave,

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:08.720 align:middle line:84%
that before it's gone to zero,
is affecting us more than ever.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Which brings up
another issue that's

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:14.170 align:middle line:84%
very important to many
people viewing beyond 2012.

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:16.070 align:middle line:84%
Many of the prophets
that I also write about,

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:18.690 align:middle line:84%
like Gurdjieff, like Osho,
and others that are--

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Were they as
good as Nostradamus?

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:27.440 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: Well, in some ways,
more fundamentally on track

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:32.330 align:middle line:84%
with what is needed in the
future than Nostradamus.

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:35.540 align:middle line:84%
For instance, clearly
in the prophecies

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:37.620 align:middle line:84%
of the prophets of the
new humanity of Homo

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:42.750 align:middle line:84%
novus, that that is born out
of us out of a great crisis.

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And that crisis is the
sustainability of the past.

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:50.550 align:middle line:84%
We are entering a period of
history-- and for over a decade

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:53.380 align:middle line:84%
now, you and I have talked
about this on the radio.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:56.240 align:middle line:84%
How I said, every year that
we get deeper and deeper

00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:02.150 align:middle line:84%
in the 21st century, the message
of existence that's saying,

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:04.020 align:middle line:90%
you've all got to change.

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.880 align:middle line:84%
You've all got to
redefine what is

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:09.889 align:middle line:84%
to be religious,
economical, moral.

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:14.429 align:middle line:84%
All these things
have to be rebooted,

00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:16.790 align:middle line:84%
or you will see a
division of the human race

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:21.170 align:middle line:84%
into the old mankind that
the Hopi Indians said,

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:23.962 align:middle line:84%
if you didn't embrace the
change of the great purification

00:34:23.962 --> 00:34:26.170 align:middle line:84%
that's coming, which is
related to the Mayan calendar

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:29.346 align:middle line:84%
prophecies, then you would
drop dead from your own fear.

00:34:29.346 --> 00:34:31.679 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: See, we're in that
eye of the storm right now,

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:32.405 align:middle line:90%
aren't we?

00:34:32.405 --> 00:34:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: Well,
this is a marker.

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:37.810 align:middle line:84%
This is a date in the
Mayan calendar that we tag

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:41.670 align:middle line:84%
and the Maya tag, just as a
reference point to a larger

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:43.380 align:middle line:90%
transformation of ages.

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:46.639 align:middle line:84%
Or the Hopi would call it that
we're losing the fourth world,

00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:48.240 align:middle line:90%
going into a fifth world.

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.790 align:middle line:90%
Rebooting of another time space.

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:53.520 align:middle line:84%
So rather than time wave
zero, we're in new times.

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:56.239 align:middle line:84%
And because we brought
so much of our baggage

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:59.150 align:middle line:84%
from the other eras
into it, that baggage

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:01.880 align:middle line:84%
is going to cause us to
have what I call the roaring

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:06.440 align:middle line:84%
2020s, which are
going to be the most

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:11.160 align:middle line:84%
dangerous decade for the
survival the human race.

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And it will have to
evolve and redefine itself

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:17.130 align:middle line:90%
to face its challenges.

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do you find this
era exciting right now?

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:23.720 align:middle line:84%
Are you glad you're alive
during this time period?

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:27.250 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: Well, as a person
on the path of meditation,

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:30.280 align:middle line:84%
I feel I'm here to take
life as a challenge.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.430 align:middle line:90%
To celebrate it.

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:35.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually, even
though I'm well

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:39.460 align:middle line:84%
known for my prophetic
work, I'm anti-prophetic.

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:46.730 align:middle line:84%
I look at prophecy like a
tantric teacher looks at sex.

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:48.880 align:middle line:84%
He's actually trying to
help you transcend it

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.760 align:middle line:90%
to super-consciousness.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Osho is one of the
more famous people for this.

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:58.910 align:middle line:84%
But what he's basically
saying is, in tantra, is you

00:35:58.910 --> 00:36:02.200 align:middle line:84%
go through the thing
rather than repress it.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.060 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:04.410 align:middle line:90%
We're fixated on future.

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:06.160 align:middle line:84%
We want to know what's
happening tomorrow.

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:06.780 align:middle line:90%
So embrace it.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Understand it through
going through it.

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:08.860 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I want
the lottery numbers.

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>> HOGUE: Yeah, exactly.

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:11.730 align:middle line:84%
I want to know if my
son or daughter is going

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:14.350 align:middle line:84%
to get married to
this guy, and all

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:16.180 align:middle line:90%
of the stuff that projects this.

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And what I take as a tantric
approach to the prophecy world,

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:24.060 align:middle line:84%
to bring people through the
future, back to the one place

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:25.170 align:middle line:90%
where all this happens.

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:27.160 align:middle line:90%
The eternity of the present.

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:31.090 align:middle line:90%
So I'm actually anti-prophetic.

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:34.060 align:middle line:84%
But I use prophecy to get
us back to the present.

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:35.700 align:middle line:84%
Because this is where
we're empowered.

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So you're
bullish on the future?

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.120 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: I'm bullish on
projecting and recreating

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:46.510 align:middle line:84%
an echo of that future which
embraces a golden present.

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And so that's actually
the key to giving birth

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:52.510 align:middle line:90%
to this new humanity.

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:54.620 align:middle line:84%
Because we are all
carrying the seed

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:57.460 align:middle line:90%
of this new humanity in us.

00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:00.430 align:middle line:84%
These people of the future
live in the present.

00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:04.250 align:middle line:84%
So if they are going to
have a bridge of this utopia

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:08.640 align:middle line:84%
to our times, we all
need to critically amass

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:12.660 align:middle line:84%
an individual understanding that
we must live in the present.

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What would you tell
a 10-year-old today about his

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:20.474 align:middle line:90%
or her future?

00:37:20.474 --> 00:37:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: The first thing I say,
not even just to a 10-year-old,

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.970 align:middle line:84%
but a new millennial,
to a Generation Xer,

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:30.040 align:middle line:84%
which I've often done, to
teenagers, I say, I apologize.

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:34.420 align:middle line:84%
I am sorry for my generation,
and the so-called greatest

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:37.380 align:middle line:84%
generation before
that spoiled us.

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And if they were a
great generation,

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:43.330 align:middle line:84%
why did they do not prevent
50 million people from being

00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:45.080 align:middle line:90%
killed in World War II?

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:48.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all due
respect to Brokaw,

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.700 align:middle line:84%
who coined the phrase
"the next generation,"

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:54.490 align:middle line:84%
I think humanity will
truly be great when

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:58.680 align:middle line:84%
we stand here and say, there has
been no great generation yet.

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:01.260 align:middle line:84%
We have not given birth
to that generation.

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:03.400 align:middle line:84%
So I look at that
10-year-old and say,

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:07.560 align:middle line:84%
I will do whatever I can to
help you be that generation.

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And if I fail, when your
children are reared, help them.

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, we will
have that great generation,

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:19.320 align:middle line:84%
which will give birth to
Homo novus, the new man.

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:23.220 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So when somebody
says, what's next?

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:26.460 align:middle line:84%
Here's the Mayan calendar,
it's come and gone.

a critical mass of putting too

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.180 align:middle line:84%
much carbon into the atmosphere
that will create a cascade

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:43.520 align:middle line:84%
of runaway global
warming as soon as 2017.

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:46.490 align:middle line:84%
25 years ago in my books,
I said the calculations

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:48.830 align:middle line:84%
of how quickly the
oceans will rise,

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:51.360 align:middle line:84%
and how fast the
climate will heat up,

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:54.950 align:middle line:84%
were based on not factoring
in the permafrost melting

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:56.690 align:middle line:90%
in the Northern hemisphere.

00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Which is literally a
super volcano of methane

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:02.980 align:middle line:84%
that no one has seen, which
has especially since 2008

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:08.020 align:middle line:84%
been vomiting a vast amount
of even richer greenhouse gas

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:09.000 align:middle line:90%
than CO2.

00:39:14.045 --> 00:39:17.650 align:middle line:84%
of the situation, that
the Copenhagen Accords was

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:23.660 align:middle line:84%
our Munich Pact before the Great
World War that we must face

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:26.470 align:middle line:90%
and fight with stupid.

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:29.270 align:middle line:84%
Stupid is the enemy
this time around.

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's a harder enemy
to deal with, because--

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But you
can't fix stupid.

00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:36.750 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: That's
what stupid says.

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's what all the
stupid in our history,

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:43.990 align:middle line:84%
which is the fundament of
our history, has told us.

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:45.690 align:middle line:90%
You can't get out of the box.

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:47.250 align:middle line:90%
You can't fly in the air.

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:49.800 align:middle line:90%
You can't capture radio waves.

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And you can't
enlighten the world.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:58.230 align:middle line:84%
These are those parts of
the human instinct that

00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:03.310 align:middle line:84%
presume humanity in us which are
actually territorialized animal

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:06.900 align:middle line:84%

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:29.600 align:middle line:90%
A day?

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.520 align:middle line:90%

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:46.420 align:middle line:84%
happened in Seattle when
my first book came out.

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And there was a debate
going on between somebody

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:51.887 align:middle line:84%
who, that Sunday, was going

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:00.436 align:middle line:90%
We've got John Hogue.

Who's next?

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:07.550 align:middle line:90%
Who's got a question for John?

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:09.350 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:11.940 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: As someone who
spent their life looking

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:17.540 align:middle line:84%
into prophecy cross-culturally
and also in meditation

00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:23.074 align:middle line:84%
and tantra, how would you
advise people to begin to live

00:41:23.074 --> 00:41:24.782 align:middle line:84%
in the moment that
you're speaking about?

00:41:24.782 --> 00:41:28.190 align:middle line:90%


00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:31.890 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: The first thing to do
is find meditation techniques

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:36.730 align:middle line:84%
that are appropriate
for the modern mind.

00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Most people start by
trying to be like a farmer

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:43.310 align:middle line:84%
25 centuries ago in
Bihar, who's met Buddha,

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:45.250 align:middle line:84%
and Buddha said, just
sit down and watch

00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:49.890 align:middle line:84%
your breath coming in,
coming out, coming in.

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:52.200 align:middle line:84%
A person 25 centuries
ago, without all

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:55.230 align:middle line:84%
of our distractions, without
all the complexity of our life,

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:58.330 align:middle line:84%
could do that, and perhaps
attain a certain glimpse

00:41:58.330 --> 00:41:59.360 align:middle line:90%
or enlightenment.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:07.150 align:middle line:84%
But we live in an overwrought,
overtactiled, overexposed,

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:10.690 align:middle line:90%
desensitizing world.

00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:13.500 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot
more, as we evolve,

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.390 align:middle line:84%
more sophistication
in our minds.

00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:17.830 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot more
things to throw out

00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:24.310 align:middle line:84%
that need a playful, active
way to go through stages that

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:28.790 align:middle line:84%
can get all that stuff
literally shook off yourself,

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:32.040 align:middle line:84%
and then reach a certain stage,
where after you've really

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:35.000 align:middle line:84%
thrown it off, you
can feel yourself sink

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.330 align:middle line:84%
into that space
25 centuries ago,

00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:39.550 align:middle line:84%
like some farmer
in Buddha's time,

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:42.050 align:middle line:90%
and have a glimpse of something.

00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And once you get that
glimpse under your skin,

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:51.880 align:middle line:84%
then a whole new journey begins
of existential, experiential,

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:54.170 align:middle line:84%
encounter moment to
moment with yourself.

00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Now for me, I often do
this in hogueprophesy.com,

00:42:57.630 --> 00:43:01.940 align:middle line:84%
I could only honestly
share the meditations

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:04.430 align:middle line:84%
that I've been doing
since 1980, when

00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:07.500 align:middle line:90%
I became a disciple of Osho.

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And so, I often offer freely
these links and information.

00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And I just say to the reader
or to you, just experiment

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:18.830 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:20.870 align:middle line:84%
One of things about
the Aquarian Age

00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:23.790 align:middle line:84%
is, it's not going to be an
age of belief-based religions.

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:25.600 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
an age of science.

00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.460 align:middle line:90%
Even the spiritual world.

00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And science is based on the word
scira, which means to know, not

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:36.170 align:middle line:84%
to base your entire life
and future of your religion

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:41.240 align:middle line:84%
on a qualified ignorance, which
isn't what really belief means.

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.950 align:middle line:84%
So the faith-based
religions of the Piscean era

00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:46.490 align:middle line:84%
are going to dwindle
in influence.

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Meditation is not
a religion, it's

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:52.860 align:middle line:84%
a technique that gives you more
sensitivity to who you are.

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And I say to Christians, it'll
make you a better Christian.

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.440 align:middle line:90%
It'll make you a better atheist.

00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:01.330 align:middle line:84%
It'll make you a better
Buddhist, a Hindu, a Muslim.

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And it may actually
also make you

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:06.380 align:middle line:84%
simply religious without
any of those things.

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:09.450 align:middle line:90%
That too can be helped by it.

00:44:09.450 --> 00:44:13.370 align:middle line:84%
So I can only give what I've
experienced as the fair thing

00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:16.940 align:middle line:84%
and say, if it resonates
with you, play with it.

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:19.270 align:middle line:90%
If it doesn't, no problem.

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:20.895 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Who's got
another one for us?

00:44:20.895 --> 00:44:22.050 align:middle line:90%
How about over here?

00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:23.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes, ma'am.

00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:24.860 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I loved
your descriptions.

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And I was curious,
did Nostradamus

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:32.050 align:middle line:90%
address 2012 at all?

00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:34.850 align:middle line:84%
He didn't necessarily
know about that culture.

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: You know, there's
been a lot said about that that

00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:42.220 align:middle line:84%
a man who was so good at
calculating-- in fact,

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:47.285 align:middle line:84%
I'm just releasing today for
download at hogueprophesy.com--

00:44:47.285 --> 00:44:48.619 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: H-O-G-U-E, by the way.

00:44:48.619 --> 00:44:49.576 align:middle line:90%
>> HOGUE: That's right.

00:44:49.576 --> 00:44:50.380 align:middle line:90%
It's like the wine.

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:50.963 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yes.

00:44:50.963 --> 00:44:55.030 align:middle line:90%


00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:57.680 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: A lot has been said
about Nostradamus actually

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:00.950 align:middle line:84%
foreseeing the grand
alignment in 2012.

00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:02.630 align:middle line:84%
If that's true,
why would someone

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:05.900 align:middle line:84%
who got so many periods
of time right, openly

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:09.297 align:middle line:84%
describe dates and
things, not mention 2012?

00:45:09.297 --> 00:45:11.380 align:middle line:84%
You think because it would
not have threatened him

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:12.130 align:middle line:90%
by the church.

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:13.760 align:middle line:90%
No one knew the significance.

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.940 align:middle line:84%
He could have just
simply said, 2012

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:17.545 align:middle line:84%
is when this big
shift, the cycle,

00:45:17.545 --> 00:45:19.990 align:middle line:84%
the great motor of the
centuries will change.

00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Instead, he's talks about at
the end of the Millennium.

00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And in his other
calculations, it's 1999.

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:28.390 align:middle line:84%
He's just off by
about seven months

00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:32.930 align:middle line:84%
or so from the winter
solstice that happened,

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:37.040 align:middle line:84%
or the midpoint between the
winter solstice of '98 and '99.

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:39.690 align:middle line:84%
So I contend that
Nostradamus did something

00:45:39.690 --> 00:45:42.300 align:middle line:90%
that the Mayan didn't do.

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:44.520 align:middle line:90%
He actually got the point right.

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:48.250 align:middle line:84%
But to say that he was a
Mayan, or that the lost

00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:50.900 align:middle line:84%
book of Nostradamus,
which was a fraud

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:56.390 align:middle line:84%
created in the 1700s, which
if it was created by anyone,

00:45:56.390 --> 00:46:00.120 align:middle line:84%
it might have been created
by his son, who was known

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:06.550 align:middle line:84%
to expand his own participation
in his father's legacy.

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:10.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a complete
red herring that he

00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:11.974 align:middle line:84%
had anything to do with
the Mayan calendar.

00:46:11.974 --> 00:46:12.890 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't need to.

00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:14.010 align:middle line:90%
He was more accurate.

00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:15.968 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, your
work, John, is phenomenal.

00:46:15.968 --> 00:46:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be back
with final comments on "Beyond

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:20.813 align:middle line:90%
Belief" in just a moment.

00:46:20.813 --> 00:46:22.660 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:25.292 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:46:25.292 --> 00:46:37.022 align:middle line:90%


00:46:37.022 --> 00:46:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: John Hogue with us.

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:40.450 align:middle line:84%
John, you're an
expert in Nostradamus.

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:42.620 align:middle line:90%
Nostradamus' predictions.

00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:44.490 align:middle line:90%
You make your own predictions.

00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:46.800 align:middle line:84%
I've talked with you
for at least 10 years

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.570 align:middle line:90%
on "Coast to Coast."

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:51.810 align:middle line:84%
The last 12
presidential elections,

00:46:51.810 --> 00:46:54.910 align:middle line:84%
you have called it,
even with the Al Gore

00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:57.360 align:middle line:90%
one on the popular vote.

00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.390 align:middle line:90%
How do you do these things?

00:46:59.390 --> 00:47:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: Well, it's completely
different from what Nostradamus

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:05.260 align:middle line:90%
did.

00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:06.440 align:middle line:90%
I simply do nothing.

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:09.160 align:middle line:90%


00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:12.450 align:middle line:84%
The work I do, if it
can be called that,

00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:14.840 align:middle line:90%
is to get out of my own way.

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And it just happens for me
that when I get to that point,

00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:21.660 align:middle line:84%
that still, small point where
the eternity of the present

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:25.280 align:middle line:84%
seems to be welling up,
then it's in that point

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.820 align:middle line:84%
that it's almost
like, oh, Clinton

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:29.185 align:middle line:90%
is going to be the president.

00:47:29.185 --> 00:47:30.310 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It just hits you.

00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:33.862 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: And it's
very undramatic.

00:47:33.862 --> 00:47:35.070 align:middle line:90%
You know, no hair on my fire.

00:47:35.070 --> 00:47:37.240 align:middle line:84%
No Tcheky Karyo in
the Nostradamus movie

00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:38.580 align:middle line:90%
climbing the library walls.

00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You would not-- and I
tried to get John to change his

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:44.740 align:middle line:84%
mind when he picked
President Obama.

00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:46.850 align:middle line:90%
Not for any political views.

00:47:46.850 --> 00:47:50.000 align:middle line:84%
It was just at a time
when everyone said,

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.830 align:middle line:90%
he's not going to get reelected.

00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:53.410 align:middle line:90%
You didn't change your mind.

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:55.290 align:middle line:84%
I went back in the
records of that.

00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:57.396 align:middle line:84%
I've got the show
up actually linked

00:47:57.396 --> 00:47:58.770 align:middle line:84%
to my website,
hogueprophesy.com,

00:47:58.770 --> 00:48:03.470 align:middle line:84%
where in September of 2009,
that was when I officially

00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:05.570 align:middle line:84%
said he would be a
second term president.

00:48:05.570 --> 00:48:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And really, the
prophet hit the fan.

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:11.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was a lot
of people were upset.

00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And then later
on, and I hope you

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:14.900 align:middle line:84%
will continue to say
this, because is there

00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:16.940 align:middle line:84%
some one thing that
could change it?

00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:19.140 align:middle line:84%
For instance, any of
you who read my work

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:21.850 align:middle line:84%
know that I also
anticipated Hillary Clinton

00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:24.040 align:middle line:90%
to be president in 2008.

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.680 align:middle line:84%
But I said there
was one weak link.

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:26.555 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: One caveat.

00:48:26.555 --> 00:48:26.890 align:middle line:90%
One change.

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:27.515 align:middle line:90%
>> HOGUE: Yeah.

00:48:27.515 --> 00:48:30.140 align:middle line:84%
The caveat was that if
she couldn't explain--

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:32.010 align:middle line:84%
this was a year
before it happened.

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:36.540 align:middle line:84%
It was the 2nd of March,
2007 when I documented this.

00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:39.730 align:middle line:84%
That if she didn't deal
with her vote for Iraq,

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:42.880 align:middle line:84%
the anti-war movement, in a
tight election with Barack

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:45.699 align:middle line:84%
Obama, would swing to him, and
she would lose her destiny,

00:48:45.699 --> 00:48:46.490 align:middle line:90%
and he we come to--

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:47.156 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Bingo.

00:48:47.156 --> 00:48:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: --and he would
come to his too soon,

00:48:49.110 --> 00:48:52.490 align:middle line:84%
and he would waste his first
term trying to learn how to be

00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:53.830 align:middle line:90%
president.

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:56.130 align:middle line:90%
So he survived.

00:48:56.130 --> 00:48:56.940 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now, when
people make predictions,

00:48:59.930 --> 00:49:03.640 align:middle line:84%
and I get this all the time on
the program, most of the time,

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:07.182 align:middle line:90%
predictions are of calamities.

00:49:07.182 --> 00:49:09.710 align:middle line:84%
There's never a
prediction of something

00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:10.980 align:middle line:90%
nice is going to happen.

00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:12.260 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:15.630 align:middle line:90%
>> HOGUE: Because time is mind.

00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And mind is programmed
to be predictable.

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:24.120 align:middle line:84%
So in most cases, people who
are living in their minds,

00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:27.560 align:middle line:84%
deep in their
minds, usually cycle

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:30.930 align:middle line:84%
towards the negative
potentials of unconsciousness.

00:49:30.930 --> 00:49:33.640 align:middle line:84%
A of people have asked me about
the prophecies of Nostradamus

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:35.430 align:middle line:90%
concerning the Antichrist.

00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:39.210 align:middle line:84%
He had three of them
in his prophecies.

00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And in the book, "Nostradamus
and the Antichrist,

00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:42.689 align:middle line:90%
Code Name Mabus--"

00:49:42.689 --> 00:49:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And we
think it's Napoleon.

00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: Napoleon,
Hitler, and then--

00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:46.885 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Hitler and?

00:49:46.885 --> 00:49:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: Somebody who
can decode the word Mabus,

00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:52.650 align:middle line:84%
M-A-B-U-S. And there's
four major people who do

00:49:52.650 --> 00:49:54.380 align:middle line:90%
anagrammatically that.

00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Saddam Hussein, Osama
bin Laden, Barack Obama,

00:49:58.170 --> 00:50:00.410 align:middle line:90%
and George W. Bush.

00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:01.420 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Nobody else?

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:03.503 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: Well, there are
other potentials always.

00:50:03.503 --> 00:50:05.890 align:middle line:84%
But these are the ones
that really cycle strong.

00:50:05.890 --> 00:50:12.027 align:middle line:84%
Now, I go through all
the permutations of that.

00:50:12.027 --> 00:50:14.235 align:middle line:84%
But I suddenly had an epiphany
at the end of the book

00:50:14.235 --> 00:50:16.234 align:middle line:84%
that I needed to talk
about the real Antichrist.

00:50:16.234 --> 00:50:18.450 align:middle line:84%
So I said to the
readers, I'm going

00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:20.260 align:middle line:90%
to show you the real Antichrist.

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:22.330 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get
up from your Kindle.

00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:24.880 align:middle line:84%
You're going to walk
into the bathroom.

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:27.050 align:middle line:84%
You're going to look
into the mirror.

00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:29.370 align:middle line:84%
No, it's not the person
you see in the mirror.

00:50:29.370 --> 00:50:32.140 align:middle line:84%
It's the mind behind
your eyes that

00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:33.680 align:middle line:84%
misinterprets what
you're seeing.

00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Because that is the source of
the predictability of prophecy,

00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:41.060 align:middle line:84%
which trends towards
the unconscious.

00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:44.180 align:middle line:84%
One thing that often
happens in dated predictions

00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:48.500 align:middle line:84%
is that the bomb drops right
out of dated predictions

00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:51.149 align:middle line:90%
around 2000 and 2012.

00:50:51.149 --> 00:50:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And then there are very few of
a controlled group of prophets

00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:54.730 align:middle line:84%
doing the most
difficult kind of thing.

00:50:54.730 --> 00:50:56.063 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Do they pick up later?

00:50:56.063 --> 00:50:57.190 align:middle line:90%
>> HOGUE: No, they don't.

00:50:57.190 --> 00:51:00.540 align:middle line:84%
So that has one of
two possibilities.

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:04.470 align:middle line:84%
Either we mechanically follow
our predictability into this

00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:06.252 align:middle line:84%
crisis-filled time
of the 2020s--

00:51:06.252 --> 00:51:07.960 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And it is
a crisis-filled time.

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: --and we are not
then inspired to change,

00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:17.390 align:middle line:84%
real change, evolve, then the
predictability of that timeline

00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:18.520 align:middle line:90%
will destroy itself.

00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And therefore,
there's not much said.

00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Or faced with the
crisis that's coming

00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:28.470 align:middle line:84%
and the survival of humanity,
a collection of individuals,

00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:33.070 align:middle line:84%
not a forest of people--
this is an unconscious idea.

00:51:33.070 --> 00:51:36.520 align:middle line:84%
When that happens,
spontaneous intelligent people

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:37.880 align:middle line:90%
are less predictable.

00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:41.040 align:middle line:84%
A more spontaneous
intelligent human race

00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:44.490 align:middle line:84%
will not be foreseen
much by prophets,

00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:48.500 align:middle line:84%
because they live outside of
the negativity of the mind.

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:51.800 align:middle line:84%
So except for a few mystics,
like Gurdjieff, and Osho,

00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:53.650 align:middle line:84%
and Krishnamurti,
and other people,

00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:56.090 align:middle line:84%
who have foreseen
a new man, they

00:51:56.090 --> 00:51:58.420 align:middle line:84%
say this new man
happens from people

00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:00.770 align:middle line:90%
living in their intelligence.

00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:04.130 align:middle line:84%
Finding a way to get out of the
programming of the past, which

00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:05.900 align:middle line:90%
has betrayed them.

00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:08.650 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I have learned
about prophecy from a lot

00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:11.390 align:middle line:90%
of our guests, especially you.

00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:15.114 align:middle line:84%
And I see the future
as being a bumpy road,

00:52:15.114 --> 00:52:16.530 align:middle line:84%
but we're going
to come out of it.

00:52:16.530 --> 00:52:20.310 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, good
will defeat evil.

00:52:20.310 --> 00:52:24.110 align:middle line:84%
Smart people will beat
the stupid people.

00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:28.150 align:middle line:84%
But getting there will be one
heck of a roller coaster ride.

00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't hold on,
we're going to fall out.

00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:32.450 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel that way?

00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:35.470 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: Well,
early in the show,

00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:38.840 align:middle line:84%
we talked about how Nostradamus
saw almost another 1800 years

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:39.480 align:middle line:90%
of history.

00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And in that same prophecy in
the "Profecias de Cesar," which

00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:44.420 align:middle line:84%
is his dedication
to his son, which

00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:47.610 align:middle line:84%
started his huge
prophetic work, he

00:52:47.610 --> 00:52:50.130 align:middle line:84%
talks about a
final conflagration

00:52:50.130 --> 00:52:53.380 align:middle line:84%
of the sun expanding
to the orbit of Earth,

00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:56.230 align:middle line:84%
burning up the Earth, but Mars
will continue its revolutions.

00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:58.999 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's astronomically
what they theorize

00:52:58.999 --> 00:52:59.790 align:middle line:90%
is going to happen.

00:52:59.790 --> 00:53:00.706 align:middle line:90%
And that could happen.

00:53:00.706 --> 00:53:01.960 align:middle line:90%
And it could happen.

00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:03.550 align:middle line:84%
Although many billions
of years later,

00:53:03.550 --> 00:53:06.440 align:middle line:84%
he says it's the
next 1800 years.

00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:10.760 align:middle line:84%
But he says the races of
humanity will survive this.

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Many of them will go to
Aquarius and spend time there

00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:15.040 align:middle line:90%
for a period of time.

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Many more go to Cancer and
live on time immemorial.

00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:21.120 align:middle line:90%
Live forever.

00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:25.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's his last prediction
dealt in a dyslexic way.

00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:29.080 align:middle line:84%
It's one first predictions
in his huge prophecy.

00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:30.850 align:middle line:90%
The last prediction is positive.

00:53:30.850 --> 00:53:33.490 align:middle line:84%
It's saying that we
will go beyond time.

00:53:33.490 --> 00:53:36.260 align:middle line:84%
That it's the only
time he uses astrology

00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:39.710 align:middle line:90%
as a place rather than a sign.

00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:42.350 align:middle line:84%
So when you look up
into the sky, when

00:53:42.350 --> 00:53:46.800 align:middle line:84%
you see the stars of Cancer
and Aquarius at night,

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:49.950 align:middle line:84%
you may be looking at the
future worlds of humanity,

00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:52.480 align:middle line:90%
who will live beyond time.

00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yes or no
to these questions.

00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:57.650 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrial life
somewhere out the universe?

00:53:57.650 --> 00:53:59.560 align:middle line:90%
Intelligent life like ours?

00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:00.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes or no.

00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:03.052 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: They're waiting
for us to be ready for them.

00:54:03.052 --> 00:54:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's a yes.

00:54:04.010 --> 00:54:04.800 align:middle line:90%
>> HOGUE: Yes.

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:07.390 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And life after death?

00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:08.590 align:middle line:90%
>> HOGUE: Yes.

00:54:08.590 --> 00:54:11.560 align:middle line:90%
Even life in life.

00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The ability for
humanity to pull out of this

00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:16.444 align:middle line:90%
mire, this muck, and survive?

00:54:16.444 --> 00:54:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: Never will happen,
because there's no such thing

00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:19.870 align:middle line:90%
as humanity.

00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:21.370 align:middle line:84%
That's a forest,
that's an abstract.

00:54:21.370 --> 00:54:22.320 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: No.

00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:23.470 align:middle line:90%
>> HOGUE: There are trees.

00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:26.080 align:middle line:84%
When all the individual
trees that make up humanity,

00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:28.350 align:middle line:84%
when enough of them
start realizing that only

00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:31.220 align:middle line:84%
their insignificance
in meditation

00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:33.800 align:middle line:84%
happens, and then
all of them start

00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:35.634 align:middle line:90%
changing the so-called forest.

00:54:35.634 --> 00:54:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What do
you think, John,

00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:41.190 align:middle line:84%
happens to be the biggest
question that most people have.

00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:44.780 align:middle line:84%
When you talk to them, I know
you from speaking engagements.

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:46.930 align:middle line:84%
We go all over the
country together.

00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:49.120 align:middle line:84%
What do they want
to know from you?

00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: They always
ask the wrong question.

00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:52.780 align:middle line:84%
So I give them the
question that is

00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:55.080 align:middle line:90%
the only question that matters.

00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:56.769 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:54:56.769 --> 00:54:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Can they answer that?

00:54:58.060 --> 00:54:59.300 align:middle line:90%
Can they answer that?

00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: There is a point where
one starts to, by the simple

00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:07.970 align:middle line:84%
asking, not even with the words,
but finding a thread in every

00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:12.040 align:middle line:84%
moment of your life, who
are you, who are you,

00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:12.790 align:middle line:90%
who is doing this?

00:55:12.790 --> 00:55:13.550 align:middle line:90%
Who is talking?

00:55:13.550 --> 00:55:14.220 align:middle line:90%
Who is happy?

00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:15.170 align:middle line:90%
Who is sad?

00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:17.330 align:middle line:90%
Who is in?

00:55:17.330 --> 00:55:20.700 align:middle line:84%
There comes a point
where I am told

00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:23.870 align:middle line:84%
how I'm seeing at this side
of the beginning of it,

00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:28.770 align:middle line:84%
that the questions begin
to be erased by answer.

00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:32.130 align:middle line:84%
That questions are perpetually
creating themselves out

00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:33.720 align:middle line:90%
of the same raw energy.

00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And then by simply doing
this mantra, this meditation,

00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:43.740 align:middle line:84%
every waking, sleeping hour,
you become aware of answer.

00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And one becomes
intimate with it.

00:55:45.850 --> 00:55:49.450 align:middle line:84%
I used to know so much
more about the occult,

00:55:49.450 --> 00:55:52.290 align:middle line:84%
and astral projections,
UFOs, everything like that.

00:55:52.290 --> 00:55:55.901 align:middle line:84%
And as I am now 32 years
a disciple of meditation.

00:55:55.901 --> 00:55:58.400 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I thought you were
going to say your were 32 years

00:55:58.400 --> 00:55:58.720 align:middle line:90%
old.

00:55:58.720 --> 00:55:59.345 align:middle line:90%
>> HOGUE: No.

00:55:59.345 --> 00:56:01.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm more like 58.

00:56:01.050 --> 00:56:05.770 align:middle line:84%
But the more I go
deeper into this,

00:56:05.770 --> 00:56:08.220 align:middle line:84%
I am losing all this
knowledge of what it is.

00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:09.820 align:middle line:90%
I really don't know what it is.

00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And in that process, it
becomes far more intimate,

00:56:12.610 --> 00:56:14.210 align:middle line:90%
far more close now.

00:56:14.210 --> 00:56:18.420 align:middle line:84%
I am disappearing into it,
and it's perfectly fine

00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:22.010 align:middle line:84%
to just go deeper and deeper
into this mystery of, who am I?

00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:23.520 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You have hope?

00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>> HOGUE: No.

00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:25.700 align:middle line:90%
Hope is a four letter word.

00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:30.730 align:middle line:84%
The man of the future will look
at many of our more happy words

00:56:30.730 --> 00:56:32.880 align:middle line:90%
as great inhibitors.

00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:36.320 align:middle line:84%
If you have hope, you also
drag along hopelessness.

00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:39.770 align:middle line:84%
If you have belief, you
also drag along disbelief.

00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:42.620 align:middle line:84%
If you kill one of them,
the other vanishes.

00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:44.000 align:middle line:90%
Hope is a four letter word.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.990 align:middle line:84%
People need to make
their future happen, not

00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:50.117 align:middle line:84%
hope that someone
else other than them

00:56:50.117 --> 00:56:51.700 align:middle line:84%
will have this
enlightened experience.

00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I like that, and
I think everybody else does.

00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:54.350 align:middle line:90%
Give us your website.

00:56:54.350 --> 00:56:55.690 align:middle line:90%
You've got e-books on it.

00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:56.540 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about it.

00:56:56.540 --> 00:56:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: My website
is hogueprophecy.com.

00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:03.360 align:middle line:84%
That's H-O-G-U-E,
P-R-O-P-H-E-C-Y dot com.

00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And I have abandoned the
dead tree publishing industry

00:57:09.830 --> 00:57:11.561 align:middle line:90%
about 10 books ago.

00:57:11.561 --> 00:57:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You're
all electronic now.

00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>> HOGUE: Lower our footprint as
readers, as well as publishers.

00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:17.620 align:middle line:90%
I've killed a lot of forests.

00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm trying to
counterbalance that.

00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And if I am an
accurate futurist,

00:57:22.930 --> 00:57:24.460 align:middle line:90%
then I know the next trends.

00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And so, you can go to my
website, and download my books,

00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:32.160 align:middle line:84%
and read over 400 pages
of documented articles

00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:34.175 align:middle line:84%
of predictions I've
been making since 1999.

00:57:34.175 --> 00:57:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And you
make them well.

00:57:35.550 --> 00:57:36.160 align:middle line:90%
John Hogue.

00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:38.338 align:middle line:90%
Let's have it for John Hogue.

00:57:38.338 --> 00:57:40.758 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:40.758 --> 00:57:44.630 align:middle line:90%


00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well,
there you have it.

00:57:46.050 --> 00:57:49.810 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get
through December 21, 2012.

00:57:49.810 --> 00:57:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And I guarantee you, we'll be
back next Friday on GaiamTV.

00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:55.310 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:57:55.310 --> 00:57:58.610 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:58.610 --> 00:58:15.534 align:middle line:90%
