going to talk about on

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.930 align:middle line:10%
Whoa.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.550 align:middle line:10%
Our financial future.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.910 align:middle line:10%
My special guest, Chuck Coppes.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.190 align:middle line:84%
He's an investment adviser,
expert in securities

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.870 align:middle line:90%
and precious metals.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.720 align:middle line:90%

>>It's the end of the US
economy as we know it,

and he feels fine.

00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:08.716 align:middle line:84%
Chuck Coppes, author of
"America's Financial Reckoning

00:01:08.716 --> 00:01:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Day," sees a perfect
economic storm brewing

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.555 align:middle line:84%
and anticipates that
America will implode

00:01:14.555 --> 00:01:16.010 align:middle line:90%
into a third-world nation.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.390 align:middle line:84%
He has found clues not
only in modern economic and

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.010 align:middle line:84%
geopolitical
conditions, but also

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.550 align:middle line:90%
in ancient biblical prophesies.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.760 align:middle line:90%
But there is hope.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.590 align:middle line:84%
Chuck explains how to ride
out the coming economic storm.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.675 align:middle line:90%
Today on "Beyond Belief."

00:01:32.675 --> 00:01:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And welcome
back to "Beyond Belief."

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And Chuck also is
a noted author.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.780 align:middle line:84%
His book, "America's Financial
Reckoning Day," hit the charts.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.560 align:middle line:84%
I know when I had him
on "Coast to Coast,"

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.960 align:middle line:84%
I had people calling me for
weeks after that, going,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.760 align:middle line:90%
"Help us.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Where can we get more on this
information and this book?"

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.290 align:middle line:84%
People are really
interested, Chuck,

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.960 align:middle line:84%
in their financial
future, aren't they?

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.085 align:middle line:90%
>>CHUCK COPPES: Absolutely.

00:01:53.085 --> 00:01:54.850 align:middle line:10%
And it's a general
theme in my book

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.670 align:middle line:10%
that we're on an
unsustainable path

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.380 align:middle line:10%
to a fiscal and monetary
collapse, a crisis.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Again.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: Well, it's
happened before in history.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And we're actually
in worse shape now,

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.710 align:middle line:90%
but we can feel it coming.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.590 align:middle line:84%
We're facing a reckoning day,
and people just instinctively

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.700 align:middle line:84%
can feel that something
bad is going to happen.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And a reckoning means
to settle accounts,

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.170 align:middle line:90%
like an asset and liability.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.310 align:middle line:90%
Households have that.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And as a nation, we have
too many liabilities

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.060 align:middle line:90%
and not enough assets.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.404 align:middle line:90%
And this is worldwide.

00:02:24.404 --> 00:02:26.570 align:middle line:84%
It's really suffering from
too much central planning

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.950 align:middle line:84%
in the world-- central banking,
central planning, and mischief

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.726 align:middle line:90%
that they create.

00:02:31.726 --> 00:02:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it healthy to have
these bubbles occur every once

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.730 align:middle line:90%
in a while and burst?

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: Well, the
Fed has actually

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.950 align:middle line:90%
created boom and bust cycles.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.302 align:middle line:90%
That's what they're noted for.

00:02:42.302 --> 00:02:44.637 align:middle line:84%
We should let the
corporations fail.

00:02:44.637 --> 00:02:46.220 align:middle line:84%
If you take the risk,
you should fail.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.400 align:middle line:90%
Banks should fail.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.770 align:middle line:84%
There shouldn't be this kind
of rescuing of the bank.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think
everybody feels that.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.066 align:middle line:90%
We're in a political season.

00:02:52.066 --> 00:02:54.000 align:middle line:90%
We're hearing a lot about that.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's really distorted
things and the marketplace.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.475 align:middle line:84%
So I think we're in worse
shape now than we were.

00:03:01.475 --> 00:03:02.540 align:middle line:90%
We never fixed anything.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, in 2008,
we bailed out the banks.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.570 align:middle line:84%
We bailed out AIG,
the insurance company.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.670 align:middle line:90%
We bailed out General Motors.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.170 align:middle line:90%
We bailed out failed banks.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we have
the financial wherewithal

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.530 align:middle line:90%
to do it this time, can we?

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.829 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: Well, we've
run out of ammunition.

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.870 align:middle line:84%
That's what the Bank of
International Settlements

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.240 align:middle line:84%
has said, that we
don't have enough ammo.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.110 align:middle line:90%
We've had QE.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.910 align:middle line:90%
We've had TARP.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.920 align:middle line:84%
We've had all these
programs and bailouts.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.422 align:middle line:84%
And now we've added
actually more debt

00:03:31.422 --> 00:03:32.380 align:middle line:90%
to the Federal Reserve.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Instead of being the
lender of last resort,

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.770 align:middle line:84%
it's now the buyer
of last resort.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.640 align:middle line:84%
$4.5 trillion dollars now
at the balance sheet there.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.710 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it's leveraged 80 to 1.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.110 align:middle line:90%
And that's big.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.380 align:middle line:84%
The banks in trouble in
2008 were like 30 to 1,

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.920 align:middle line:84%
and they're even
in worse shape now.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And the risk is
more concentrated.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.540 align:middle line:84%
So we just keep kicking
the can down the road.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.600 align:middle line:90%
And money should have utility.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.830 align:middle line:84%
It should have value,
a store of value.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.350 align:middle line:84%
That's fundamentally
what my business is.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.400 align:middle line:90%
But this is a silver coin.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.602 align:middle line:84%
It's only $17, but
a gold coin here--

00:04:08.602 --> 00:04:09.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thanks, Chuck.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>>COPPES: OK.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.360 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGH]

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.699 align:middle line:90%


00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:13.240 align:middle line:84%
You'd rather have
the gold, I'm sure.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:14.918 align:middle line:90%
>>COPPES: That's about 1,300.

00:04:14.918 --> 00:04:15.730 align:middle line:90%


00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.784 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nice little
piece of gold here.

00:04:17.784 --> 00:04:19.950 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: We like to say
that gold and silver is not

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:20.987 align:middle line:90%
getting expensive.

00:04:20.987 --> 00:04:22.320 align:middle line:90%
The currency is getting cheaper.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.890 align:middle line:84%
Again, see, gold and silver
is the standard by which

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.430 align:middle line:90%
currencies are measured.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there's
a battle to suppress

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.370 align:middle line:90%
the price of precious metals.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.390 align:middle line:84%
That battle's
constantly going on.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.190 align:middle line:90%
I have a chart.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.920 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in my lectures
and in my book,

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.570 align:middle line:84%
I start out with the
evolution of money--

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.860 align:middle line:90%
how money has progressed.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And we could show that
here on the slide.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Money should be
a store of value.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:51.110 align:middle line:84%
We've gone from commodity
money, which should be durable,

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.580 align:middle line:90%
visible, fungible.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
gold and silver is.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:55.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's heavy.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:56.410 align:middle line:90%
>>COPPES: Yeah.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.000 align:middle line:84%
That's three times heavier
than steel, gold is.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.220 align:middle line:90%
And it's scarce.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.020 align:middle line:90%
It's durable.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.440 align:middle line:90%
So it had all those qualities.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And it has intrinsic value,
where paper money doesn't.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Paper money cannot
be a store of value,

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.360 align:middle line:90%
and it's always being devalued.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And then we've evolved
into fiduciary money,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.400 align:middle line:84%
about the 13th century, in
the banking centers in Vienna,

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.190 align:middle line:84%
in Florence, and
later in Frankfurt,

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.230 align:middle line:84%
where the goldsmiths would
warehouse this, people's gold

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:22.500 align:middle line:90%
and silver.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
issue warehouse receipts.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'd rather
physically hold it.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.340 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't you?

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.340 align:middle line:84%
Rather than have
some other company--

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>COPPES: I stress that.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.260 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.730 align:middle line:84%
But they wanted it for safety,
so the goldsmiths held it

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:35.879 align:middle line:90%
for safekeeping.

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And then they gave out
a warehouse receipt.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.045 align:middle line:84%
So it was called
fiduciary money.

00:05:39.045 --> 00:05:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were like the
vaults of the past, or what?

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:42.610 align:middle line:90%
>>COPPES: They were the vaults.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.280 align:middle line:90%
This was the early banking.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.780 align:middle line:90%
This is the 13th century.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.629 align:middle line:84%
So you have-- they're
holding the gold and silver,

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:50.420 align:middle line:84%
but they're writing
the warehouse receipts.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.503 align:middle line:84%
And people are using them
because they trust them.

00:05:52.503 --> 00:05:54.710 align:middle line:84%
That's what the word
fiduciary means-- to trust.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't
shortly after that,

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.760 align:middle line:84%
the bankers decided
90% of the people

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.890 align:middle line:84%
are not coming in for
their gold and silver.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.240 align:middle line:84%
We could just issue more of
these warehouse receipts,

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.820 align:middle line:90%
these notes out.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On gold we
don't even own, right?

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.428 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: That's called
fractional money.

00:06:08.428 --> 00:06:09.590 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.020 align:middle line:90%
So they keep a 10% reserve.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's essentially what
our banking system does today.

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because if everybody,
if everybody went to the bank

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.270 align:middle line:84%
to empty out their accounts,
the banks could not

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.860 align:middle line:90%
come up with that kind of cash.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.660 align:middle line:90%
>>COPPES: No.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.480 align:middle line:84%
They're always
operating in insolvency

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.760 align:middle line:84%
because they're always
suffering-- the fear is always

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.360 align:middle line:90%
of a bank run.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.250 align:middle line:84%
So they want to prevent
that from happening.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.220 align:middle line:84%
So we've now evolved
to fiat currency,

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.360 align:middle line:90%
and that's the final stage.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which means
there's nothing backing

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.560 align:middle line:90%
the money, right?

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: It means to make
a decree, a government

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.650 align:middle line:90%
decree, a legal tender law.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.899 align:middle line:84%
So you see, real money doesn't
need legal tender laws.

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:44.090 align:middle line:90%
You know that's money.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: And they have
to force it on people.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we are today
with the Federal Reserve

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.120 align:middle line:84%
System, which is producing,
like all central banks, paper

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.310 align:middle line:90%
currency, and a flood of it.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very dark
history, where the Fed

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.560 align:middle line:90%
came from 100 years ago.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In 2008, they
talked about the banks

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.600 align:middle line:90%
being too big to fail.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.710 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: Well, probably--
there is 21 primary dealers

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.180 align:middle line:90%
of the Federal Reserve.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.250 align:middle line:84%
They're counterparties, so
they buy and sell bonds there.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.060 align:middle line:84%
They didn't always have
that charter to do that.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:25.020 align:middle line:84%
So now they act
as counterparties

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.090 align:middle line:84%
with the Fed-- JP Morgan,
Citigroup, Goldman Sachs.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.510 align:middle line:84%
80%, most of these,
are in the US.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:32.800 align:middle line:90%
Morgan Stanley.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And they're too big
to fail because they

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:40.295 align:middle line:84%
have too many derivatives
positions-- things like that.

00:07:40.295 --> 00:07:42.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Eric Holder,
I think four years ago,

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.780 align:middle line:84%
said we want to prosecute
these banks, but doing so

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.920 align:middle line:90%
would disrupt the economy.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.204 align:middle line:90%
So we can't do that.

00:07:49.204 --> 00:07:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So they them.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:50.780 align:middle line:90%
Get a fine.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:51.590 align:middle line:90%
Make some money.

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:54.280 align:middle line:90%
>>COPPES: That's too big a jail.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.410 align:middle line:90%
So too big to fail.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:08:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And central banking
is very corrupt.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:03.945 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was born in secrecy,
in Jekyll Island in 1910.

00:08:03.945 --> 00:08:06.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: By private
banking companies, right?

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:06.940 align:middle line:90%
Cartels, basically.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: Well,
it became a cartel

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:11.300 align:middle line:90%
because Paul Warburg was there.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.630 align:middle line:84%
His brother ran the
central bank in Germany.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And Nelson Aldrich headed
up this committee in 1908,

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.310 align:middle line:90%
after the bank panic of 1907.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And some of that was contrived
on Wall Street because

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.620 align:middle line:84%
of the market speculation,
the copper-- there

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.380 align:middle line:90%
was some copper speculation.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.340 align:middle line:84%
But nothing the
weakness, the bankers

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:33.159 align:middle line:84%
always wanted a
lender of last resort.

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:35.299 align:middle line:84%
They wanted an elastic
economy, as they put it.

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to put the
losses on the taxpayer--

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:40.270 align:middle line:90%
just what you said.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:41.920 align:middle line:90%
>>COPPES: Yeah.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.289 align:middle line:90%
Just what you said.

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:47.180 align:middle line:84%
So it would never square with
this, our US Constitution--

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:47.980 align:middle line:90%
a central bank.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.012 align:middle line:84%
We should have-- Article
1, Section 8 and 10,

00:08:50.012 --> 00:08:51.470 align:middle line:84%
we should have only
gold and silver

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.990 align:middle line:84%
as legal tender--
every state, colonies.

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:55.890 align:middle line:90%
And so now we have paper money.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.344 align:middle line:90%
So they had to run around that.

00:08:57.344 --> 00:08:59.010 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Federal
Reserve would never

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:02.529 align:middle line:84%
pass the supremacy test
today in the high court

00:09:02.529 --> 00:09:04.570 align:middle line:84%
because it wouldn't square
with our Constitution.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are all
countries in this kind

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.147 align:middle line:90%
of shape, financial shape?

00:09:09.147 --> 00:09:10.230 align:middle line:90%
>>COPPES: Yeah, very much.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:14.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Japan has been
pursuing QE for 25 years,

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:17.750 align:middle line:90%
the European Central Bank.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And central banking began in
1694, the Bank of England.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And so that's been
replicated everywhere.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And our founding
fathers knew this.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:31.180 align:middle line:84%
In 1775, Benjamin Franklin
said that the primary cause

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:35.240 align:middle line:84%
for the revolution was to get
control of our own currency

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.320 align:middle line:90%
and away from that debt.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.611 align:middle line:84%
They had run up their own
debt, being a British Empire.

00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:40.580 align:middle line:90%
Does this sound familiar?

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Trying to be a global
policeman and empire.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.410 align:middle line:84%
The cost of empire
is taking us down.

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's the risk
that we're running.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.460 align:middle line:84%
So central banking
was created in 1913

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.080 align:middle line:90%
with the Federal Reserve Act.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.370 align:middle line:84%
Congressmen really don't
understand banking.

00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:00.620 align:middle line:84%
They were just passing it
three days before Christmas,

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.490 align:middle line:84%
on a near-empty
congressional floor.

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And they passed the
Federal Reserve Act.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These people,
Chuck, aren't stupid.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they are
brilliant at what they

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.080 align:middle line:90%
do to get to where they are.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.840 align:middle line:90%
Why can't they fix this?

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.021 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to fix it.

00:10:16.021 --> 00:10:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: They don't
want to fix it.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's a good
question because they

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.220 align:middle line:90%
are operating like a cartel.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.530 align:middle line:84%
There's about 4,000
member banks of the Fed.

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:27.290 align:middle line:90%
Not all banks are members.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.570 align:middle line:84%
I would say the primary dealers
are more like a money trust.

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
Charles Lindbergh

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.080 align:middle line:84%
fought about 100 years ago--
the Money Trust hearings.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And they create now
the-- banks create debt

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.780 align:middle line:90%
by purchasing bonds.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And the counterparties
sell treasury bonds,

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.576 align:middle line:84%
and then we issue
money against it.

00:10:51.576 --> 00:10:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And so that's creating
money out of thin air.

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:54.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:54.640 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.920 align:middle line:90%
>>COPPES: Out of thin air.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And that creates a
multiplier effect.

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:03.220 align:middle line:84%
It goes down into the banking
system, where the money gets

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.280 align:middle line:90%
into the banking system.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:09.210 align:middle line:10%
If you show the multiplier
effect, you deposit $1,000,

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.010 align:middle line:10%
you can now loan out $900.

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:12.980 align:middle line:10%
And then they deposit.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.320 align:middle line:10%
Now you can loan out $810.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.600 align:middle line:10%
That keeps going, and that's
where you expand the money

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.370 align:middle line:10%
supply by 10-- maybe 10-fold.

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:23.650 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Chuck,
Ayn Rand predicted

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:28.090 align:middle line:10%
in her book, "Atlas Shrugged,"
that the financial system was

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:29.650 align:middle line:10%
on the verge of collapse.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:32.490 align:middle line:10%
Let's take a quick look.

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:35.180 align:middle line:10%
>>Money is the material
shape of the principle

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:39.330 align:middle line:10%
that men who wish to deal with
one another must deal by trade

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.270 align:middle line:10%
and give value for value.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:45.420 align:middle line:10%
Money is not the tool
of the moochers, who

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:49.070 align:middle line:10%
claim your product by
tears, or of the looters,

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:51.810 align:middle line:10%
who take it from you by force.

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:56.510 align:middle line:10%
Money is made possible only
by the men who produce.

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:59.760 align:middle line:10%
Is this what you consider evil?

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.330 align:middle line:10%
When you accept money in
payment for your effort,

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.740 align:middle line:10%
you do so only on the
conviction that you

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:08.810 align:middle line:10%
will exchange it for the
product of the effort of others.

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:10.830 align:middle line:84%
It is not the moochers
or the looters

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.170 align:middle line:90%
who give value to money.

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Not an ocean of tears nor
all the guns in the world

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.810 align:middle line:84%
can transform those pieces
of paper in your wallet

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:23.570 align:middle line:84%
into the bread you will
need to survive tomorrow.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:27.000 align:middle line:10%
Those pieces of paper,
which should have been gold,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.124 align:middle line:10%
are a token of honor.

00:12:29.124 --> 00:12:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So, Chuck,
they're trying

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.580 align:middle line:84%
to imply that money
is evil, and that we

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:38.560 align:middle line:84%
need to go back to gold
and silver, and do that.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.810 align:middle line:90%
But that's not feasible.

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.834 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: Well, truly, the
Bible says the love of money

00:12:42.834 --> 00:12:44.000 align:middle line:90%
is the root of all the evil.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.840 align:middle line:84%
That's why when you're
studying banking,

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.780 align:middle line:84%
you're getting into some
dark history in that.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.020 align:middle line:90%
There's always enough money.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.150 align:middle line:90%
You just get the price right.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:52.290 align:middle line:90%
That's what Jim Rickards says.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:53.580 align:middle line:90%
He was recently on your show.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: And you've just
got to get the price right.

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.070 align:middle line:90%
It's undervalued.

00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:00.170 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, gold and silver
doesn't get expensive.

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:01.860 align:middle line:90%
The currencies get cheaper.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And we've issued so much debt
that we need probably $10,000,

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:06.640 align:middle line:90%
$20,000-an-ounce gold anyway.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.205 align:middle line:84%
But central banks
create inflation--

00:13:10.205 --> 00:13:11.330 align:middle line:90%
what I just told you there.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.950 align:middle line:84%
John Maynard Keynes said
that not one man in a million

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:15.400 align:middle line:90%
can diagnose it.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.600 align:middle line:90%
It's very insidious.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.630 align:middle line:84%
Ron Paul's talked about
the inflation tax.

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:21.710 align:middle line:84%
It's a hidden tax because
governments can only

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:22.930 align:middle line:90%
tax, borrow, or print.

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:24.400 align:middle line:90%
What do you think they favor?

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.970 align:middle line:10%
The one that you don't
know, you don't understand.

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:26.410 align:middle line:10%
And people--

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:27.510 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Or can't control.

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: They think
an increase in prices

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.450 align:middle line:84%
is inflation, when it's
an increase in the money

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:33.840 align:middle line:90%
supply itself.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.660 align:middle line:90%
See, Keynes was an activist.

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:41.020 align:middle line:84%
He believed that governments'
central bank should

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:45.040 align:middle line:84%
be very active in promoting,
borrowing, and spending, when

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.080 align:middle line:84%
the real way to
grow an economy is

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.770 align:middle line:90%
through production and saving.

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:51.770 align:middle line:84%
We don't have
production and saving.

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:53.330 align:middle line:84%
We have a
consumer-based economy.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.150 align:middle line:84%
70% of our economy
is consumer spending.

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And they just want inspire
that and inspire that.

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:05.460 align:middle line:10%
And we're at levels below
1929, going back even to then.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:09.040 align:middle line:84%
So when you think about
where we are as a nation,

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.810 align:middle line:84%
we have the Baby
Boomer generation,

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:13.690 align:middle line:84%
which you and I are a member
of, a lot of our viewers.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.960 align:middle line:90%
And we are 80 million strong.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.490 align:middle line:84%
It's an extraordinary
demographic that's

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:22.630 align:middle line:90%
coming through our society.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:27.390 align:middle line:84%
We've lived it, so we can
see the influence we have.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And the Baby Boomer peak
spending period is upon.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.790 align:middle line:90%
It's coming right now.

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:33.670 align:middle line:84%
The peak spending years
of the Baby Boomers,

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:36.710 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at the ages
of 30 to 55 years old.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you have
families, and kids in school,

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:39.913 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:14:39.913 --> 00:14:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And you're getting into
your peak earning years.

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:45.420 align:middle line:84%
The risk we have with the
Baby Boomer generation

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.290 align:middle line:84%
today is the
unfunded liabilities,

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:50.517 align:middle line:84%
what's your $210
trillion, some estimates.

00:14:50.517 --> 00:14:51.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's growing.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.845 align:middle line:90%
>>COPPES: $210 trillion.

00:14:52.845 --> 00:14:53.720 align:middle line:90%
That's beyond belief.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.316 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:14:54.316 --> 00:14:55.116 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:14:55.116 --> 00:14:56.807 align:middle line:84%
That's why we named
the show that.

00:14:56.807 --> 00:14:57.640 align:middle line:90%
>>COPPES: And it is.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.440 align:middle line:90%
Trillions.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.400 align:middle line:84%
A trillion seconds
will take 30,000 years,

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.540 align:middle line:90%
so it's just staggering.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And now we've reached peak
spending in this next slide.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.430 align:middle line:84%
The peak spending years
have occurred right

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:14.660 align:middle line:90%
between 2000 and 2014.

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:18.560 align:middle line:84%
The 2008 crisis could
not come at a worse time

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.670 align:middle line:84%
because demographically, our
generation is now deleveraging,

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:25.380 align:middle line:84%
and downsizing, and
things like that.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:30.330 align:middle line:84%
When Social Security
was found in 1935,

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.630 align:middle line:84%
there was, like, 40
workers for every retiree.

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:33.750 align:middle line:90%
Now it's about two.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:34.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:36.360 align:middle line:84%
Those two are sustaining
the whole thing.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.780 align:middle line:90%
And it can't be done.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: That can't
be done either.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.687 align:middle line:84%
And so in 1937, they
actually were challenging it,

00:15:41.687 --> 00:15:44.270 align:middle line:84%
that the government shouldn't
be in the health care business--

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:47.190 align:middle line:84%
Helvering v. Davis, which
I write about in the book.

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And they said that the money
comes in is not earmarked.

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:51.650 align:middle line:84%
It goes into the
general revenue.

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:54.640 align:middle line:84%
So now we're back to
what central banking does

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:55.650 align:middle line:90%
with your deposit.

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:58.560 align:middle line:84%
It treats it as an
asset and a liability.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.210 align:middle line:84%
It's a dual claim
on the deposit.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I get
the impression, Chuck,

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:06.590 align:middle line:84%
that governments are
propping this up.

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:08.150 align:middle line:84%
They're not telling
people the truth.

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.950 align:middle line:90%
>>COPPES: No.

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:09.750 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they want to
sustain this for as long

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:16.790 align:middle line:84%
as they can, but they're
not sure how long they can.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:19.060 align:middle line:84%
So at what point-- I
mean, in your title,

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:24.990 align:middle line:84%
"America's Financial Reckoning
Day," that tells me that soon

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:26.970 align:middle line:90%
we've got that day of reckoning.

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:30.570 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to face
this horrible situation.

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: Well, Jim Rickards
is a gentleman I really like.

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:37.020 align:middle line:84%
But he talks about
an avalanche--

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:40.700 align:middle line:84%
that the debt in the world
is like an avalanche.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.230 align:middle line:84%
You don't know when the snow
is going to be on there,

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:44.630 align:middle line:90%
and it's going to break.

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:47.405 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be some
rogue event, some default,

00:16:47.405 --> 00:16:48.630 align:middle line:90%
a thing like that.

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then it just
snowballs all the way down.

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:50.720 align:middle line:90%
>>COPPES: It snowballs down.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.000 align:middle line:90%
And it just collapses.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's a contagion because
there's no negative feedback

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:54.600 align:middle line:90%
loop.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.270 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to
bail out who here?

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:59.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you just
create a monster.

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And Social Security
is what really

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:04.410 align:middle line:84%
inspired me to write my book
because I'm a baby boomer.

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:07.775 align:middle line:84%
And there's a study done
by Laurence Kotlikoff--

00:17:07.775 --> 00:17:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
too young to have

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:10.693 align:middle line:90%
Social Security, aren't you?

00:17:10.693 --> 00:17:12.359 align:middle line:84%
It hasn't kicked in
yet for you, has it?

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:12.710 align:middle line:90%
>>COPPES: No.

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:13.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm not even taking it yet.

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:15.353 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
if it will be there.

00:17:15.353 --> 00:17:17.854 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a poll said more
people believe in UFOs

00:17:17.854 --> 00:17:19.520 align:middle line:84%
than that Social
Security will be there.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.686 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, I believe that.

00:17:20.686 --> 00:17:22.405 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH CHUCKLE]

00:17:22.405 --> 00:17:23.339 align:middle line:90%


00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: So we're in
an unsustainable path.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.970 align:middle line:84%
I call it the third rail of
politics, which I write about,

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:32.500 align:middle line:84%
because this seeing
this coming convinced me

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.780 align:middle line:84%
that something bad is
really going to happen.

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Worse than 2008?

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: Oh, yeah, because
they're going to just displace

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:42.997 align:middle line:90%
whole generations of people.

00:17:42.997 --> 00:17:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chuck, I've had a
lot of people on my program--

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.455 align:middle line:84%
not only on "Beyond Belief,"
but "Coast to Coast"--

00:17:47.455 --> 00:17:49.570 align:middle line:84%
all of them talking
about the same thing,

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:52.790 align:middle line:84%
that there's going to be a
financial disaster ahead.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:54.920 align:middle line:84%
The problem is
nobody specifically

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.510 align:middle line:84%
can tell me when that
"ahead" is going to be.

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.935 align:middle line:90%
When is this going to happen?

00:17:58.935 --> 00:18:00.480 align:middle line:90%
Is it going to be six months?

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.280 align:middle line:90%
A year?

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.177 align:middle line:90%
10 years?

00:18:02.177 --> 00:18:03.010 align:middle line:90%
When does it happen?

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Or does it just creep up
on us, and then it's done?

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: Well, it's
like that avalanche.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:12.470 align:middle line:84%
The final amount of
debt, or contagion, risk

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:13.902 align:middle line:90%
is in the system.

00:18:13.902 --> 00:18:16.069 align:middle line:84%
The movie "The Big Short,"
perhaps you've seen.

00:18:16.069 --> 00:18:17.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Love that movie.

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>>COPPES: Yeah.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.160 align:middle line:90%
I love it too.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.470 align:middle line:90%
It got Oscar awards.

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And they knew that adjustable
rate mortgages were coming,

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:23.420 align:middle line:90%
so they were shorting it.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And they made 500% profit,
Kyla Bass and others.

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:27.740 align:middle line:90%
So I mean, they saw that.

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:30.354 align:middle line:84%
I mean, here are these geniuses
on Wall Street-- said, oh, who

00:18:30.354 --> 00:18:31.520 align:middle line:90%
could have seen this coming?

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.645 align:middle line:84%
And all the brokers were,
like, oh, Mrs. Jones, I'm

00:18:33.645 --> 00:18:35.430 align:middle line:90%
sorry about your account.

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Goldman Sachs was actually
shorting their own stuff

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:40.120 align:middle line:90%
too as they were selling it.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.975 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's some
people inside who see it,

00:18:42.975 --> 00:18:44.850 align:middle line:84%
and they're smart enough
to hedge themselves.

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:45.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm one of those.

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:48.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to get people to
protect their wealth and--

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you
can't give me a date.

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: --get
out of harm's way.

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, Bill Gross
is the bond King.

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And he says he's scared as heck,
and he can't sleep at night.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.220 align:middle line:90%
What is he worried about?

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.980 align:middle line:84%
We have a 35-year
credit cycle right now.

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.210 align:middle line:90%
It started in 1980.

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Interest rates were about 18%,
and [WHISTLES] all the way

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:07.050 align:middle line:90%
down to 0, negative.

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And you now have $88 trillion
of bonds, sovereign debt,

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:11.780 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:14.140 align:middle line:90%
45% of that is US debt.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:17.030 align:middle line:84%
Look at the exposure that
the US has in this regard.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:18.710 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's going to
dump them all at once.

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:22.564 align:middle line:84%
But Saudi Arabia has already
threatened to do that.

00:19:22.564 --> 00:19:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, they're
already borrowing money

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.620 align:middle line:84%
because the price of
oil being so cheap.

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: Well, but they were
threatening to asymmetrical

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:31.270 align:middle line:90%
warfare-- dump our bonds.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:32.694 align:middle line:90%
China has said this too.

00:19:32.694 --> 00:19:34.860 align:middle line:84%
So see, we're vulnerable
as a nation in that regard.

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.130 align:middle line:90%
Now that would be a high risk.

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:39.020 align:middle line:84%
I would say keep
your eye on Japan,

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:40.550 align:middle line:90%
which just went negative rates.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:41.540 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which means if
you put $100 in the bank,

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:45.930 align:middle line:84%
you'll take out,
like, $90, right?

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:46.770 align:middle line:90%
Something like that.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>>COPPES: A year later.

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:48.740 align:middle line:90%
So it's crazy.

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:52.060 align:middle line:84%
So in Japan, they just want
negative interest rates.

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.560 align:middle line:10%
And so they're
running out of safes

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.101 align:middle line:10%
because everybody's running and
getting money, and putting it

00:19:56.101 --> 00:19:57.200 align:middle line:10%
in their homes.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.840 align:middle line:90%
That sounds like Gresham's law.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.050 align:middle line:84%
Bad money drives out good money,
meaning that bad government

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:05.440 align:middle line:84%
money should force people into
the good money right here.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.960 align:middle line:90%
But that's negative rates.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.600 align:middle line:10%
That's how crazy
this has because.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.380 align:middle line:84%
The debt pyramid
in the world now,

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.910 align:middle line:84%
the McKinsey Global Institute
says, is $200 trillion,

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:16.970 align:middle line:84%
$60 trillion more
debt than 2008.

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:18.990 align:middle line:84%
So now we're in worse
shape than ever.

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:20.600 align:middle line:90%
We just papered over the crisis.

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.110 align:middle line:84%
We're kicking the
can down the road.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.530 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Would you feel secure
keeping money in a bank?

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:25.360 align:middle line:90%
>>COPPES: No.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:25.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At all?

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:26.140 align:middle line:90%
>>COPPES: No.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.110 align:middle line:90%
Look at Cyprus.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:28.870 align:middle line:90%
Portugal just had this happen.

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:30.890 align:middle line:10%
Puerto Rico, they're
downplaying this,

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:32.360 align:middle line:10%
but they're going
to have bail-ins.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:36.600 align:middle line:10%
Bail-ins means where
you're made a Class A

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.870 align:middle line:10%
stockholder, an
unsecured creditor,

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:39.930 align:middle line:10%
for the risk of the bank.

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Now this was written into the
Dodd-Frank Bill, Section 7-16,

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:46.390 align:middle line:84%
that they will not put it on
the taxpayers to bail out these

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:47.960 align:middle line:90%
too-big-to-fail banks.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:51.090 align:middle line:84%
So what we have is they're
going to put the losses

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:52.690 align:middle line:90%
on the depositors.

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:54.930 align:middle line:84%
Now I think in
Europe, for 20 months,

00:20:54.930 --> 00:21:01.946 align:middle line:84%
they've had this policy where
if you have more than $100,000,

00:21:01.946 --> 00:21:04.070 align:middle line:84%
they'll have negative rates
and that sort of thing.

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:05.450 align:middle line:84%
But this, we've
never done anything--

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:07.230 align:middle line:84%
this is uncharted water
for central banks.

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:10.040 align:middle line:84%
They're making it up
as they go, frankly.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dangerous.

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:13.423 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: Well, they
can't service the debt.

00:21:13.423 --> 00:21:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And see, that's why we
have 0 interest rates.

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:18.970 align:middle line:84%
David Stockman calls it
the monetary politburo,

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:22.450 align:middle line:84%
that they just keep enforcing
this 85 months or 90

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:24.440 align:middle line:90%
months of 0 interest rates.

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:28.506 align:middle line:84%
And this is killing people--
investors, retirees, savers.

00:21:28.506 --> 00:21:30.880 align:middle line:84%
But they don't have any choice
because if they were to go

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.160 align:middle line:84%
a 10-year treasury
bill, where 5% or 7%,

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.920 align:middle line:84%
you'd be looking at a trillion
dollars' worth of servicing

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:38.910 align:middle line:90%
that debt every year.

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:40.370 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that.

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:43.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I spent nine years
with the United States Navy.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm pro military, and
I think a nation needs

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:48.780 align:middle line:90%
to have a strong military.

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.760 align:middle line:84%
That being said, that
costs a lot of money.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And there's technology,
there's manpower,

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:58.510 align:middle line:84%
and you spend a lot of
money on the military.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:01.160 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
people in government

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.990 align:middle line:90%
who say cut that out.

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:06.350 align:middle line:90%
We're spending too much.

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:07.990 align:middle line:10%
>>Mr. Speaker, we
are considering

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:10.640 align:middle line:10%
a rule for a conference
report calling

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:16.850 align:middle line:10%
for a $290.8 billion dollar
Defense Authorization.

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:21.140 align:middle line:10%
On behalf of 5 million
children who are hungry,

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:25.730 align:middle line:10%
on behalf of 9 million American
workers who are unemployed,

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:29.210 align:middle line:10%
on behalf of 2 million
homeless Americans,

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:33.070 align:middle line:10%
on behalf of school districts
all over this country which

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:36.270 align:middle line:10%
lack the funds to provide
a decent education

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:40.290 align:middle line:10%
for their kids, on behalf
of 80 million Americans

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:42.530 align:middle line:10%
who either have no
health insurance

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:45.990 align:middle line:10%
or are only partially
insured, I ask

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:49.960 align:middle line:10%
that we reject this grossly
inflated military budget,

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:53.670 align:middle line:10%
and use the savings
to reinvest in America

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:57.850 align:middle line:10%
and to protect the
interests of our people.

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, we recognized
him, good old Bernie Sanders.

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:04.790 align:middle line:84%
That was more than 20 years
ago, talking about overspending

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:06.270 align:middle line:90%
in the military.

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:08.550 align:middle line:84%
But with what's going
on around this planet

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:10.730 align:middle line:84%
these days, with
China, and North Korea,

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:13.800 align:middle line:84%
and everybody else increasing
their military spending,

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.900 align:middle line:84%
is that a wise
thing for us to do,

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.379 align:middle line:84%
and that is cut our
military spending?

00:23:18.379 --> 00:23:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: Well, the
real question is,

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:24.130 align:middle line:84%
can we afford to be the
global policeman as well?

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:27.490 align:middle line:84%
We have essentially a
warfare-welfare state.

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:30.480 align:middle line:84%
Eisenhower, in 1961 when he
had the Farewell Address,

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.730 align:middle line:84%
said we need to be on guard
of the military industrial

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:34.990 align:middle line:84%
complex, that it
will keep expanding,

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:39.340 align:middle line:84%
and that has led to even
the militarization of law

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.750 align:middle line:84%
enforcement and things
like we're seeing today.

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:44.480 align:middle line:10%
But we kept perpetuating.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Japan went to a peacetime
economy and so on.

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:50.190 align:middle line:84%
We spend more than the next 19
nations on our defense budget.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:52.080 align:middle line:90%
We have 10 aircraft carriers.

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:56.730 align:middle line:84%
We're building two Ford-class
aircraft carriers at $5 billion

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:57.612 align:middle line:90%
apiece.

00:23:57.612 --> 00:23:59.820 align:middle line:84%
There's only about 16 aircraft
carriers in the world.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.410 align:middle line:90%
So we really are an empire.

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And one historian said
that empires don't last.

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:06.040 align:middle line:90%
Nations do.

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.954 align:middle line:84%
Should we be meddling
in other affairs,

00:24:07.954 --> 00:24:09.120 align:middle line:90%
and intervention, and so on?

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:16.160 align:middle line:84%
Do we need 180 military
bases around the world?

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.350 align:middle line:90%
Can we afford this?

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:18.500 align:middle line:90%
Bernie's right.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.450 align:middle line:10%
He's often got
the-- he's targeting

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:25.320 align:middle line:10%
the problem, the banking
cartels and the plutocracy that

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.316 align:middle line:10%
runs the banking syndicate.

00:24:27.316 --> 00:24:28.690 align:middle line:84%
But he's got the
wrong solutions.

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:30.890 align:middle line:84%
As Reagan said, government's
never the solution.

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:32.210 align:middle line:90%
It's always the problem.

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:35.940 align:middle line:84%
We'd do very well if we had
a much reduced government.

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:38.670 align:middle line:84%
But this all started,
and was benefited by,

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:41.430 align:middle line:84%
the Bretton Woods
Agreement in 1944.

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:43.390 align:middle line:84%
You have to go back
in monetary history.

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:46.070 align:middle line:84%
That was a monetary
reset in a way.

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:49.400 align:middle line:84%
That was where, in
the post-war period,

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:53.100 align:middle line:84%
other nations were
decimated-- Europe, of course.

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:54.979 align:middle line:84%
And so we established
the US dollar

00:24:54.979 --> 00:24:56.520 align:middle line:84%
as the reserve
currency of the world.

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.020 align:middle line:84%
This is the Bretton
Woods Agreement.

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:01.450 align:middle line:84%
John Maynard Keynes hosted
it, and he's obviously

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:02.810 align:middle line:90%
a collectivist.

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:07.960 align:middle line:84%
So we gave a $35-per-ounce
gold standard to the dollar--

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:12.000 align:middle line:84%
that foreigners could redeem
their dollars that we issue

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000 align:middle line:90%
for $35.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.170 align:middle line:84%
In the US, that couldn't be
done because Franklin Roosevelt

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:18.760 align:middle line:90%
called in the gold in 1933.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:22.690 align:middle line:84%
So he decoupled the gold for
the American people in 1933.

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And now Nixon, later, by
1971, so many foreigners

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:29.760 align:middle line:84%
were demanding payment in
our loose fiscal spending.

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He took us off
that standard, didn't he?

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: He took
us off the standard,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.190 align:middle line:90%
closed the gold window.

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And that was a delivery
default on the gold.

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:38.600 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
even risking today,

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:39.690 align:middle line:90%
with the record demands--

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:42.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Countries
like China and India

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.620 align:middle line:90%
are buying gold like crazy.

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:45.660 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:47.340 align:middle line:10%
>>COPPES: Well,
obviously, they're

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:49.730 align:middle line:10%
very smart for doing that.

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:52.817 align:middle line:84%
In China's case, they're
trying to, I think,

00:25:52.817 --> 00:25:54.400 align:middle line:84%
have a soft landing
for their economy.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.820 align:middle line:84%
But they're also trying
to have enough gold

00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:00.450 align:middle line:84%
to back not the Yuan currency,
but just to rebalance

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:02.850 align:middle line:84%
the system as a
percentage of GDP.

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:06.560 align:middle line:84%
I read a monthly newsletter,
I got into this last one,

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.550 align:middle line:84%
because the SDR, the
special drawing rights,

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:10.200 align:middle line:90%
were just adopted.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.300 align:middle line:84%
China was just allowed
that special drawing

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.760 align:middle line:84%
rights of the International
Monetary Fund.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, Jim
Rickards says that they

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:21.770 align:middle line:84%
have the only cleanest balance
sheet to rescue us from that.

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:24.800 align:middle line:84%
In fact, another author that
I've read is Willem Middelkoop.

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.170 align:middle line:90%
He's a Dutch author.

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:27.130 align:middle line:90%
"The Big Reset."

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:31.480 align:middle line:10%
He's talking about a monetary
reset in which he says,

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.290 align:middle line:10%
will either be well
planned in advance

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:37.339 align:middle line:10%
or hastily implemented on
the back of a dollar crisis.

00:26:37.339 --> 00:26:38.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So that's a prediction

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:40.087 align:middle line:90%
>>COPPES: I think that's-- yeah.

00:26:40.087 --> 00:26:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's-- they always
wait for a crisis because you

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:43.878 align:middle line:90%
never want a good crisis to--

00:26:43.878 --> 00:26:46.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So, Chuck,
the person at home,

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:48.040 align:middle line:84%
the people listening
to this program,

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:54.530 align:middle line:84%
watching this program, all
they want is to be comfortable.

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:56.870 align:middle line:84%
They want to pay
their house payment.

00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:59.740 align:middle line:90%
They want their car or cars.

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.420 align:middle line:84%
They want a nice,
little comfortable job.

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And they want to pay their bills
and take care of their family.

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:09.180 align:middle line:90%
That's all they want.

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Are you telling me
that that's going

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:14.150 align:middle line:90%
to be gone for these people?

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: The more I look into
this-- especially in Japan,

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:18.020 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:20.950 align:middle line:84%
They have a demographic,
the oldest population--

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:22.380 align:middle line:90%
one of them-- in the world.

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:24.030 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
enough birth rate.

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:27.900 align:middle line:84%
So the demographics are
extremely tilted, and just

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.770 align:middle line:90%
like it is here in the US.

00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:32.780 align:middle line:84%
So they're facing a possible
humanitarian crisis.

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:36.110 align:middle line:84%
When governments can't deliver
and the checks can't come,

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:38.410 align:middle line:84%
that's going to displace
a lot of people.

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think our
government knows this.

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:43.310 align:middle line:84%
I think they're anticipating
some of this unrest, uneasiness

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:44.110 align:middle line:90%
that we see.

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that
golden dream will be

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:47.160 align:middle line:90%
shattered for a lot of people.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.160 align:middle line:90%
>>COPPES: It already is.

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.400 align:middle line:84%
We have 100 million people
structurally unemployed.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.790 align:middle line:90%
We've outsourced our industry.

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:54.430 align:middle line:84%
These are things Donald
Trump's talking about.

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:56.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure we can
make America great again

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.220 align:middle line:90%
if-- these are the globalists.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:02.830 align:middle line:84%
They think in terms
of the global economy,

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:06.104 align:middle line:84%
the secret trade agreements,
this kind of thing.

00:28:06.104 --> 00:28:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And they're not working in
favor of the middle class

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:10.850 align:middle line:90%
or American families.

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:14.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the Federal
Reserve part of the problem?

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:17.640 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: It's very much, yeah,
because it monetizes the debt.

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.110 align:middle line:90%
It is our credit card.

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:23.110 align:middle line:90%
We couldn't even go this far.

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:26.410 align:middle line:84%
In Britain, when Nixon closed
the gold window in 1971,

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:28.450 align:middle line:84%
they floated the currency
for a couple years

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:29.770 align:middle line:90%
at the Smithsonian Institute.

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:31.140 align:middle line:90%
It was very uneasy.

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:32.830 align:middle line:90%
They created the G7.

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And then the oil
shock came about 1973.

00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:37.490 align:middle line:90%
Some people might remember that.

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:40.340 align:middle line:90%
It was a 400% increase in oil.

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And there was lines, and
a lot of people thought,

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:45.300 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know we
imported anything.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:46.670 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know.

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:48.560 align:middle line:10%
And so they came up
with a genius idea,

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.610 align:middle line:10%
with Henry Kissinger at the
Bilderberg meeting and others,

00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:53.700 align:middle line:10%
to create a
petrodollar recycling.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:55.200 align:middle line:10%
And that's in my third slide.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:59.090 align:middle line:10%
And I want people to see
that because it's a genius

00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:00.810 align:middle line:10%
way of exporting our inflation.

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:02.257 align:middle line:10%
That's our main export.

00:29:02.257 --> 00:29:03.840 align:middle line:10%
There's too many
dollars in the world.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.805 align:middle line:10%
Currency reserves
back then were 90%.

00:29:05.805 --> 00:29:07.420 align:middle line:10%
They're about 60% now.

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:09.266 align:middle line:10%
So we have all these
dollars offshore,

00:29:09.266 --> 00:29:12.030 align:middle line:10%
and we're not feeling
the effects of inflation

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:13.920 align:middle line:10%
as dramatically as we would.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:14.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not yet.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.386 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: Well, if
it's all repatriated.

00:29:16.386 --> 00:29:21.120 align:middle line:84%
Or say, bonds are dumped on
us with coupon plus interest,

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:22.710 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:24.970 align:middle line:84%
Paul Krugman says that we
owe our debt to ourselves

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:26.180 align:middle line:90%
and we can just write it off.

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:26.980 align:middle line:90%
No we don't.

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.010 align:middle line:84%
We owe $6 trillion
to foreigners.

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:30.370 align:middle line:90%
They'd be pretty angry.

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:32.690 align:middle line:84%
We owe $6 trillion to
the inter-government debt

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:35.939 align:middle line:84%
for Social Security, which
is broke, which is empty.

00:29:35.939 --> 00:29:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Former
Congressman Ron Paul,

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:40.350 align:middle line:84%
when he was a congressman,
wanted to abolish the Fed.

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:42.070 align:middle line:90%
He got involved in a debate.

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.870 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:45.510 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't say much.

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:48.460 align:middle line:10%
>>I think to say that you
want to abolish the Fed just

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:50.211 align:middle line:10%
because they've made
some bad decisions is

00:29:50.211 --> 00:29:52.126 align:middle line:10%
like throwing the baby
out with the bathwater.

00:29:52.126 --> 00:29:53.602 align:middle line:10%
I mean, President
Bush, God knows,

00:29:53.602 --> 00:29:56.060 align:middle line:10%
has made a terrible amount of
decisions over the past seven

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:56.860 align:middle line:10%
years.

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:58.610 align:middle line:10%
Do we want to abolish
the presidency?

00:29:58.610 --> 00:29:59.410 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:01.743 align:middle line:10%
And I think that the reason
that we want to keep the Fed

00:30:01.743 --> 00:30:03.200 align:middle line:10%
is because over
the past 70 years,

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.960 align:middle line:10%
we've had pretty good stability
in our financial system.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.920 align:middle line:10%
Prior to the
existence of the Fed,

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.480 align:middle line:10%
in the late 1800s,
early 1900s, we

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:14.970 align:middle line:10%
had bank runs after bank
runs, panics after panics

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:18.530 align:middle line:10%
because we didn't have one
centralized system that

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:20.937 align:middle line:10%
was ensuring the stability
of our financial markets.

00:30:20.937 --> 00:30:23.270 align:middle line:10%
And now we have the Fed, and
it's been pretty successful

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:25.790 align:middle line:10%
for the past 70 years.

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:27.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It seems like
we're trapped, Chuck.

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:30.740 align:middle line:84%
It seems like we're trapped
in a monetary system

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:33.350 align:middle line:90%
that we just can't pull out of.

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:34.200 align:middle line:90%
Am I right?

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.920 align:middle line:90%
>>COPPES: Well, yeah.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.505 align:middle line:84%
It's really too much
central planning, too much

00:30:39.505 --> 00:30:41.630 align:middle line:84%
central planning on the
behalf of the central bank.

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:43.213 align:middle line:84%
That's what Ron Paul
is really saying.

00:30:43.213 --> 00:30:46.150 align:middle line:84%
They create boom-bust
cycles, malinvestment.

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:47.597 align:middle line:90%
And it happens all the time.

00:30:47.597 --> 00:30:48.680 align:middle line:90%
Look at the asset bubbles.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.230 align:middle line:84%
The stock market right
now is in an asset bubble.

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And so we're running the
risk of central planners

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:57.750 align:middle line:84%
meeting in private and
trying to run an economy.

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.520 align:middle line:84%
This is what the old
Soviet Union did.

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:02.208 align:middle line:90%


00:31:02.208 --> 00:31:04.610 align:middle line:84%
We need-- the US
Treasury Department

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:06.610 align:middle line:84%
should be the fiscal agent
of the United States.

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Should be.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:08.440 align:middle line:90%
>>COPPES: Yeah.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.879 align:middle line:90%
It's too partisan, the Fed is.

00:31:09.879 --> 00:31:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Right now, they've
lowered rates just

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:13.795 align:middle line:84%
in an election year because
they do it every time there's

00:31:13.795 --> 00:31:15.840 align:middle line:90%
an incumbent party.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:19.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's sending false
signals into the marketplace.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, traders are
all at their keyboards,

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:24.040 align:middle line:84%
waiting eight times a
year when the FOMC is

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.470 align:middle line:90%
going to make an announcement.

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:26.775 align:middle line:90%
That's not a real economy.

00:31:26.775 --> 00:31:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's just
trading the Fed.

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:30.135 align:middle line:84%
And as long as it's
easy money, then--

00:31:30.135 --> 00:31:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Most people
think things are fine.

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:33.030 align:middle line:90%
>>COPPES: No.

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:34.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's the sad part.

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:36.081 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: Well, they
don't hear bad things.

00:31:36.081 --> 00:31:37.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's their perception.

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: They don't
want to hear bad news.

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And their brokers tell them
to stay in for the long term,

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:42.660 align:middle line:84%
things will come back,
we're in some kind

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:43.830 align:middle line:90%
of an economic recovery.

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:47.947 align:middle line:84%
Well, borrowing and spending
got us into this problem.

00:31:47.947 --> 00:31:50.030 align:middle line:84%
Borrowing and spending is
not going to get us out.

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got some
e-mails here for you, Chuck.

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Mary from Long
Beach, California,

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:57.410 align:middle line:84%
writes, "In your opinion, what
would be the most effective way

00:31:57.410 --> 00:32:00.450 align:middle line:84%
we could revamp our
monetary system?"

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:02.317 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: Boy, that's
a good question.

00:32:02.317 --> 00:32:04.150 align:middle line:84%
That's really what this
gentleman has said--

00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Jim Rickards and
others-- that I study,

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:09.560 align:middle line:84%
and that is that we do
need a monetary reset.

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:14.180 align:middle line:84%
We need to write down
debts, sovereign debt.

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:15.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can we do that?

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.083 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: It's been
done before, sure.

00:32:17.083 --> 00:32:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is like
a voluntary bankruptcy?

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:21.240 align:middle line:10%
>>COPPES: Well, It's
not done voluntarily,

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:24.360 align:middle line:10%
but that's what
hyperinflation can lead to.

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:25.772 align:middle line:84%
Then you have to
just start over.

00:32:25.772 --> 00:32:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Now again, it's going to
be either well planned

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:29.760 align:middle line:90%
or it's going to go critical.

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.370 align:middle line:10%
Now Robert Triffin was a
great economist in the '40s,

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:36.390 align:middle line:10%
and he saw this coming.

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:38.440 align:middle line:90%
It's called Triffin's dilemma.

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And what he said in
1961 was the nation

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.520 align:middle line:84%
that's issuing the reserve
currency of the world would

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.550 align:middle line:84%
pursue loose fiscal policies,
exporting inflation,

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:48.789 align:middle line:90%
and it would lead to a collapse.

00:32:48.789 --> 00:32:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
they'd ever get to a point,

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:53.260 align:middle line:84%
though, where they would
say, on such and such

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:56.800 align:middle line:84%
a date, your mortgages, your
car payments, your credit card

00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:00.140 align:middle line:84%
debt, things you owe,
your student loans,

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:01.630 align:middle line:90%
everything is forgiven.

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:03.760 align:middle line:90%
We are starting clean, folks.

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.480 align:middle line:90%
You can keep your things.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.810 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to give your
house back or your car,

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:10.120 align:middle line:90%
but we have no debt anymore.

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And then we start
all over again.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.240 align:middle line:90%
What would happen?

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.550 align:middle line:90%
>>COPPES: We are in a period.

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:16.630 align:middle line:84%
We've been in inflation
ever since there's

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:17.530 align:middle line:90%
been a central bank.

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:19.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the dollar's
worth only $0.03

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.610 align:middle line:84%
what it used to be
100 years ago, see.

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:25.240 align:middle line:84%
So maybe we need to just
go back to old pricing

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.210 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing.

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:29.520 align:middle line:90%
But it's very messy to do this.

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:31.560 align:middle line:84%
It's all about a
confidence game.

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Everything's built on
confidence and trust.

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And as long as people
have confidence

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:38.431 align:middle line:84%
in the system, when
they lose that trust,

00:33:38.431 --> 00:33:39.430 align:middle line:90%
then you have bank runs.

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
these bad outcomes.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.110 align:middle line:90%
And China, I think, is losing--

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:44.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you
don't think, though,

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:45.851 align:middle line:84%
we could remove all
the debt for everybody?

00:33:45.851 --> 00:33:48.570 align:middle line:90%


00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: Well, if they destroy
all the digital records, who

00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:52.130 align:middle line:90%
is to know?

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:53.300 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH CHUCKLE]

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:54.100 align:middle line:90%


00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could we
start over like that?

00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:58.830 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: As far
as citizens, it's

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:02.790 align:middle line:84%
a matter of monetary
policy and recalibrating

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:06.050 align:middle line:90%
what the value is going to be.

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Again, the standard,
and many believe,

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:11.150 align:middle line:84%
that that's why gold has to be
a component of a new reserve

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:12.100 align:middle line:90%
currency.

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:13.969 align:middle line:84%
We've had the reserve
currency status.

00:34:13.969 --> 00:34:15.590 align:middle line:90%
They don't last forever.

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And the IMF, I believe, is going
to propose a special drawing

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:19.030 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Right now, it is mostly 40% the
dollar and then euro, and 37%.

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:26.230 align:middle line:84%
Then you have the yen,
the sterling, and then

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:32.409 align:middle line:84%
China's just been included
this last year, in 2015.

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:34.960 align:middle line:10%
They've always wanted
to be part of it,

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:37.210 align:middle line:10%
but they've kept--
it's a Western club.

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:38.030 align:middle line:90%
So they kept just--

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they're
now in the club.

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:41.699 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: Well, in
a smaller way, yeah.

00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:45.909 align:middle line:84%
But look at all the gold they're
getting as a percentage of GDP.

00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:50.110 align:middle line:84%
They might have 10,000 tons,
not the 1,600 they're saying.

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:52.060 align:middle line:84%
They're the number
one producer of gold.

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:53.040 align:middle line:10%
They could have 20--

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.409 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I don't think we
have what we say we have.

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:56.400 align:middle line:10%
>>COPPES: I don't think
we have 8,000 tons.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.410 align:middle line:90%
Europe has 12,000.

00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think
Fort Knox is empty.

00:34:58.940 --> 00:34:59.740 align:middle line:90%
They tricked us.

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:02.222 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: Well, it hasn't
been haunted lately.

00:35:02.222 --> 00:35:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I wouldn't
trust that either.

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:07.470 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we really
need a monetary reset.

00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And this would be for-- it's
a unit of account at the IMF.

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's used for settlement
among nations and so on.

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:16.885 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't be a currency
that we'd be using.

00:35:16.885 --> 00:35:18.980 align:middle line:90%
Now they are issuing SDR bonds.

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:22.410 align:middle line:84%
In every reserve currency, you
need a large liquid bond market

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:25.240 align:middle line:84%
to absorb that, for currency
reserves and nations

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:27.270 align:middle line:90%
in doing commerce.

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:28.990 align:middle line:84%
I think that's likely
to happen, and I

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:30.820 align:middle line:84%
think we could see
a recalibration

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:32.720 align:middle line:90%
of the euro beating the dollar.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:33.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:34.310 align:middle line:10%
That's a big move.

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:35.770 align:middle line:10%
>>COPPES: We're in
worse shape than Europe.

00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:36.560 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's a big hope.

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Let's see what
Senator Ted Cruz has

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:41.280 align:middle line:90%
to say about the gold standard.

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.080 align:middle line:10%
>>It's interesting.

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:45.200 align:middle line:10%
You look at on Wall Street,
the Fed is doing great.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.650 align:middle line:10%
It's driving up stock prices.

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:48.100 align:middle line:10%
Wall Street's doing great.

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:51.320 align:middle line:10%
Today, the top 1% earn a
higher share of our income

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.530 align:middle line:10%
than any year since 1928.

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:56.610 align:middle line:10%
But if you look at
working men and women,

00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:59.110 align:middle line:10%
if you look at a single
mom buying groceries,

00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:03.050 align:middle line:10%
she sees hamburger prices
have gone up nearly 40%.

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:06.860 align:middle line:10%
She sees her cost of
electricity going up.

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:08.590 align:middle line:10%
She sees her health
insurance going up.

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:12.030 align:middle line:10%
And loose money is one
of the major problems.

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:13.340 align:middle line:10%
We need sound money.

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:15.010 align:middle line:10%
And I think the
Fed should get out

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:17.500 align:middle line:10%
of the business of trying
to juice our economy,

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:21.720 align:middle line:10%
and simply be focused on sound
money and monetary stability,

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:24.649 align:middle line:10%
ideally tied to gold.

00:36:24.649 --> 00:36:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I guess you
would agree with that.

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:27.898 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: I tend
to agree with him.

00:36:27.898 --> 00:36:30.801 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure we would have
a classic gold standard.

00:36:30.801 --> 00:36:32.550 align:middle line:84%
That's a little bit
different in the '20s,

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:35.410 align:middle line:84%
and that led to the
depression and things.

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And John Maynard
Keynes actually called

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:42.540 align:middle line:84%
that the barbaric relic,
the classic gold exchange.

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:44.640 align:middle line:84%
If we had a nominal gold
backing of currency,

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.280 align:middle line:84%
it would surely help
bring stability.

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And it would anchor the
temptation to inflate money,

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:50.900 align:middle line:90%
see.

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:54.180 align:middle line:10%
But that's the hidden--
that's what central banks do.

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:56.730 align:middle line:10%
We have a debt-based economy.

00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:58.550 align:middle line:10%
Money is created
out of thin air.

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:01.530 align:middle line:10%
To pay-- if you had just
$1 in the whole world,

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:03.113 align:middle line:10%
but you owed 10%
interest on it, where

00:37:03.113 --> 00:37:04.529 align:middle line:10%
are you going to
get the interest?

00:37:04.529 --> 00:37:07.480 align:middle line:10%
So you have to create money
to pay the interest on top

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.280 align:middle line:10%
of the-- yeah.

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:11.910 align:middle line:10%
And this has created the--
it's a reckoning day.

00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:14.420 align:middle line:90%
It's postponing a reckoning day.

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.670 align:middle line:84%
People always want to know,
when's it going to happen?

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:17.519 align:middle line:90%
That sort of thing.

00:37:17.519 --> 00:37:18.810 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be a rogue event.

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:19.893 align:middle line:90%
It'll be a Monday morning.

00:37:19.893 --> 00:37:21.070 align:middle line:90%
It will be a forex meltdown.

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:21.870 align:middle line:90%
It will be a bond--

00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:23.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'll wake up in the
morning, and it'll happen.

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.401 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: It'll be a
banking contagion right now.

00:37:25.401 --> 00:37:29.100 align:middle line:84%
You have $500 trillion
of derivatives.

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:30.730 align:middle line:90%
These are credit-sensitive--

00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:32.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or credit swaps, right?

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:32.890 align:middle line:90%
>>COPPES: Yeah.

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're
credit derivatives.

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And they're sensitive
to interest rates.

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:38.020 align:middle line:90%
So we're trapped at the 0 bound.

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:39.269 align:middle line:90%
We can't even raise the rates.

00:37:39.269 --> 00:37:40.840 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the
negative rates--

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:41.930 align:middle line:84%
and to make that
even work, you'd

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:43.360 align:middle line:90%
have to have a cashless society.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And the Bible says
someday there's

00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:47.760 align:middle line:84%
going to be a cashless
society, and you're

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.150 align:middle line:90%
going to have a government--

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will it be
an effect, though,

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:55.250 align:middle line:84%
where we get worse, and worse,
and worse after that Monday

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:56.860 align:middle line:90%
morning we wake up?

00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:58.970 align:middle line:84%
Or is it just going
to hit us one time

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:00.144 align:middle line:90%
and then stabilize again?

00:38:00.144 --> 00:38:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: When you're dealing
with emotion in the markets,

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:03.760 align:middle line:90%
then that's the main driver.

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.970 align:middle line:84%
There's two emotions--
fear and greed.

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And if fear takes over,
then it's a contagion.

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.710 align:middle line:84%
If you have a Lehman event
and nobody can bail them out--

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:14.280 align:middle line:84%
and you know what I'm saying--
so one thing leads to another,

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:16.180 align:middle line:84%
we have counterparty
risk with all the banks,

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:17.490 align:middle line:90%
and in Europe and so on.

00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Japan right now has had 25
years of quantitative easing.

00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:24.540 align:middle line:84%
They're buying 90%
of their own bonds,

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:29.190 align:middle line:84%
40 percent of their ETFs,
equities, to stimulate growth.

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.990 align:middle line:90%
This is crazy.

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:31.135 align:middle line:90%
This is like on steroids.

00:38:31.135 --> 00:38:31.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is crazy.

00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:32.270 align:middle line:90%
>>COPPES: Yeah.

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:33.890 align:middle line:90%
This is the bad ending.

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Look at Zimbabwe, where they
had $500 trillion notes.

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:39.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do we really want
to go down this path?

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Hyperinflation is not
something that is a policy.

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:44.310 align:middle line:84%
It's just something
they're forced into.

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:45.560 align:middle line:90%
So then you get the deflation.

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.200 align:middle line:84%
It's like Harry Dent
and others saying, well,

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.241 align:middle line:84%
we're going into this
contraction, and deflation,

00:38:49.241 --> 00:38:50.154 align:middle line:90%
and deleveraging.

00:38:50.154 --> 00:38:51.070 align:middle line:90%
And I agree with that.

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:52.860 align:middle line:90%
Even the demographics.

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:55.110 align:middle line:84%
But that precedes
hyperinflation.

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:56.820 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like a tsunami.

00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:59.960 align:middle line:84%
It sucks all the water out,
and people aren't happy.

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden, you have
too much-- too much liquidity,

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:04.380 align:middle line:90%
too much response from the bank.

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:09.447 align:middle line:84%
This is what happened in Germany
in 1923, Yugoslavia, Zimbabwe.

00:39:09.447 --> 00:39:11.030 align:middle line:84%
There's a museum, I
think in New York.

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:13.840 align:middle line:10%
It's about the history
of money that failed.

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:16.750 align:middle line:10%
There's never been a fiat
currency that didn't fail.

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Voltaire said that all
fiat currency goes back

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:21.600 align:middle line:90%
to its intrinsic value of 0.

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And this can never go
to 0-- gold and silver.

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:26.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Another e-mail in
from Jonathan in Massachusetts.

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:30.450 align:middle line:84%
He said, what led up to
the 2008 financial crisis?

00:39:30.450 --> 00:39:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And as you've said, we're
in a worse shape today.

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:35.010 align:middle line:90%
But what happened?

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:38.870 align:middle line:84%
What caused people to collapse
in paying their mortgages

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:40.130 align:middle line:90%
and things like that?

00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:41.630 align:middle line:90%
>>COPPES: Boy.

00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:44.440 align:middle line:84%
It all goes back to
one event-- 9/11.

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.380 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:48.380 align:middle line:84%
When 9/11 hit, you had
the dot-com bubble.

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:49.920 align:middle line:90%
And then you had 9/11 hit.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, they
close the stock market.

00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And the response was
to go out and spend.

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:57.280 align:middle line:84%
They lowered interest
rates, Greenspan

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:01.070 align:middle line:84%
did, about 16 times
down to 0-- very low.

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And it just created
an asset bubble.

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Here's your boom-bust
cycle again.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.028 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you see
this coming in 2008?

00:40:06.028 --> 00:40:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: Yeah,
I wrote about it.

00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:10.530 align:middle line:84%
The books-- actually, I was
doing research back then.

00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:12.130 align:middle line:90%
And Peter Schiff called this.

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:13.765 align:middle line:90%
He called it accurately.

00:40:13.765 --> 00:40:15.790 align:middle line:90%
And I was seeing it come too.

00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Look, "The Big Short," they
saw the adjustable rates

00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:20.870 align:middle line:90%
coming in 2006 even, 2005.

00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:23.820 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we had weakness there.

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And then, finally, it just
got too overleveraged.

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
blame to go around.

00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:31.280 align:middle line:84%
People were overstating
their income.

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:33.959 align:middle line:84%
They were overrating,
triple A rating

00:40:33.959 --> 00:40:35.250 align:middle line:90%
the mortgage-backed securities.

00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Then they were selling them
and packaging them all.

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:39.130 align:middle line:90%
And nobody wanted it to end.

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:40.922 align:middle line:84%
Nobody wanted to be
the first to say, hey,

00:40:40.922 --> 00:40:41.880 align:middle line:90%
something's wrong here.

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:43.171 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were riding high.

00:40:43.171 --> 00:40:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: Wall Street was
having a-- it was like a casino.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.140 align:middle line:90%
It was like an absolute Casino.

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:48.626 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can
people track you?

00:40:48.626 --> 00:40:49.826 align:middle line:90%
Website, please.

00:40:49.826 --> 00:40:51.200 align:middle line:10%
>>COPPES: Yeah,
I would recommend

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:54.890 align:middle line:10%
they go to my website,
idpconsultinggroup.com.

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:57.900 align:middle line:84%
We can assist people there and
deliver your precious metals,

00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:59.760 align:middle line:90%
storage accounts, IRA accounts.

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:00.910 align:middle line:90%
We do a lot in the IRAs.

00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:04.380 align:middle line:10%
You can roll over and transfer
these accounts for safety.

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:07.140 align:middle line:84%
We like to put a lot of those
in silver, for obvious reasons.

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:08.940 align:middle line:84%
It's undervalued,
and I think there's

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:09.940 align:middle line:90%
going to be a break out.

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:11.660 align:middle line:84%
I think China is
smartly doing this.

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Central banks are buying
it as well, and so on.

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:15.820 align:middle line:84%
But we can assist
people that way.

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:18.980 align:middle line:90%
And we can do that.

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:19.910 align:middle line:90%
We'd be glad to help.

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the best
suggestion for people

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:24.510 align:middle line:90%
right now would be what?

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: Lower your
exposure to the bank.

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:28.820 align:middle line:84%
Lower your exposure
to the equities.

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:33.344 align:middle line:84%
Get into-- well, chapter
8 gets into a whole bunch

00:41:33.344 --> 00:41:35.010 align:middle line:84%
of our recommendations
there, and I even

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:38.560 align:middle line:84%
have an investment triangle on
my website for cash and growth,

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:40.020 align:middle line:90%
and those kinds of things.

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:40.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And just
be smart about it.

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:42.730 align:middle line:84%
>>COPPES: I would have a core
position in precious metals,

00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:43.580 align:middle line:90%
absolutely.

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And just be prepared to
ride through this storm

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:48.320 align:middle line:90%
that we see coming.

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:50.153 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I hope
the next time we talk,

00:41:50.153 --> 00:41:51.770 align:middle line:84%
you're not telling
me, I told you so.

00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:53.710 align:middle line:90%
But you never know.

00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:56.374 align:middle line:84%

just a messenger.

00:41:56.374 --> 00:41:57.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:58.275 align:middle line:90%
Don't kill the messenger.

00:41:58.275 --> 00:41:59.733 align:middle line:10%
>>COPPES: Don't
kill the messenger.

00:41:59.733 --> 00:42:01.340 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Just take
care of yourself.

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:04.120 align:middle line:10%
Plan accordingly because
it could be coming.
