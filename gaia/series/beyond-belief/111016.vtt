00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.612 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[THEME MUSIC] And I think
many people today don't

00:00:07.612 --> 00:00:08.820 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.290 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.670 align:middle line:84%
>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.345 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.345 --> 00:00:25.384 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.384 --> 00:00:26.800 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY:
Well, welcome back

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.610 align:middle line:10%
to our second edition
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.250 align:middle line:10%
And I say second edition
because in our first,

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.440 align:middle line:10%
with our very special guest,
we dealt a lot with chemtrails

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.789 align:middle line:10%
and how it affects us.

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:38.830 align:middle line:84%
What we're going to be
talking about in this show

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.480 align:middle line:84%
is how you can fight
back personally,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.560 align:middle line:84%
and what else is out
there in this atmosphere

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.210 align:middle line:84%
that we can use, that we can
tap into with our special guest.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.630 align:middle line:84%
How did Sharon
Schloss get involved

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.730 align:middle line:84%
in looking at things that
are going on in the climate,

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.589 align:middle line:84%
in the atmosphere, which we
call anti-geoengineering.

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:00.630 align:middle line:90%
How did you get involved?

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.080 align:middle line:84%
You're an author, you're a
writer, you're a musician.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SHARON SCHLOSS:
I am a musician.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But how did
you end up doing this?

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.950 align:middle line:10%
>>SCHLOSS: Well, yes.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:07.960 align:middle line:10%
This is interesting.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.960 align:middle line:10%
I grew up doing music
and art my whole life.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.010 align:middle line:10%
I have an art degree.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.040 align:middle line:10%
I play music.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.350 align:middle line:10%
I tour doing music.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.890 align:middle line:10%
And I just had all
these health issues,

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.330 align:middle line:10%
these inexplicable
health issues.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to tie it to the
spraying going on in the sky.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.160 align:middle line:84%
Finally figured out,
because I didn't realize,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.230 align:middle line:90%
that this was unnatural.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.220 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even notice
it for so long.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And then I noticed that
things had changed.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, and I've always
enjoyed clouds and rain,

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.140 align:middle line:90%
and I love nature.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.070 align:middle line:90%
I love the sky.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You go out a lot.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.296 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: I do.

00:01:39.296 --> 00:01:40.462 align:middle line:90%
I love hiking.

00:01:40.462 --> 00:01:41.170 align:middle line:90%
I love bicycling.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm a very outdoorsy
kind of person.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And I had noticed some
things going awry.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.650 align:middle line:84%
We weren't getting any rain
for a long time in California.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.980 align:middle line:84%
There have been a lot of
problems in the climate.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And I've also always been very
environmentally conscious.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.470 align:middle line:84%
As young as seventh grade,
I was an environmentalist.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was trying to rile
people up and get people

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.290 align:middle line:84%
involved, and get
people to recycle

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.150 align:middle line:90%
before anybody was doing it.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.970 align:middle line:84%
I was very concerned
about the rain forest.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.520 align:middle line:84%
I was very concerned about
many environmental issues

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.732 align:middle line:84%
and start writing letters
to the representatives.

00:02:16.732 --> 00:02:17.815 align:middle line:90%
So it's always been in me.

00:02:17.815 --> 00:02:20.310 align:middle line:90%
I love the earth so much.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.470 align:middle line:84%
When I learned about
geoengineering,

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.686 align:middle line:84%
it was such a difficult
truth to accept, and painful,

00:02:29.686 --> 00:02:32.060 align:middle line:84%
and thinking about how many
people are suffering from it,

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.601 align:middle line:84%
and how the environment
of suffering.

00:02:33.601 --> 00:02:37.180 align:middle line:84%
Animals, plants,
forests are dying.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.439 align:middle line:84%
It seemed like the
environmental issue of all time

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:43.480 align:middle line:84%
that we needed to deal
with, because it's global.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.150 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Every environmental
issue is very important.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.050 align:middle line:84%
The rain forest being
destroyed is very important.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.580 align:middle line:84%
We have this issue of
geoengineering, which is not

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.410 align:middle line:84%
even localized to one
place, but the entire planet

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.030 align:middle line:90%
is suffering from it.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.160 align:middle line:84%
So it's something
that needs to stop.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.060 align:middle line:84%
Where did you go for
sources and resources

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.130 align:middle line:84%
when you want to start
investigating this?

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Because there aren't a
lot of places you can go.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.140 align:middle line:10%
>>SCHLOSS: Well, I learned a lot
from geoengineeringwatch.org,

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.090 align:middle line:10%
Dane Wigington, who
is a climate expert.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of great
documentary films

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.297 align:middle line:84%
that turned me on to
the issue that I think

00:03:22.297 --> 00:03:24.130 align:middle line:84%
would be great for your
viewers to check out

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.260 align:middle line:84%
would be "What in the
World Are They Spraying?"

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.220 align:middle line:10%
and "Why in the World
Are They Spraying?"

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.840 align:middle line:10%
These are films
by Michael Murphy,

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.140 align:middle line:10%
and they have a lot of
experts, a lot of scientists

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.830 align:middle line:10%
that speak about it, USDA
scientists and people

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.560 align:middle line:10%
in the medical profession.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.620 align:middle line:84%
Rosalind Peterson is another
great source for information.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.500 align:middle line:84%
She has an organization
called the Agriculture Defense

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.110 align:middle line:84%
Coalition, and also she
runs California Sky Watch.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And she used to work for the
USDA as a crop loss adjuster.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.760 align:middle line:84%
So she would go out and research
why are crops failing in areas.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And starting in 2002,
she was able to tie

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.170 align:middle line:84%
this to geoengineering, and
she's done extensive research.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.760 align:middle line:10%
Clifford Carnicom come,
The Carnicom Institute,

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.770 align:middle line:10%
is a great resource for
understanding the pathogens

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.510 align:middle line:10%
and these mixes that
they're spraying.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.890 align:middle line:84%
He has data from the late
'90s till the present.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.870 align:middle line:84%
So there are many scientists
that are doing this.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.074 align:middle line:90%
And the info can be found.

00:04:22.074 --> 00:04:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How has the sky
changed since we were kids?

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I go back- I mean
that's a long, long time ago--

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.720 align:middle line:84%
the atmosphere was
pretty darn clear.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.725 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: Yeah, it used
to be a lot different.

00:04:32.725 --> 00:04:34.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When do you
think this started?

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: Well, climate
engineering, geoengineering,

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.280 align:middle line:84%
has been going on in
experimental phases

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.430 align:middle line:90%
since the end of World War II.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.040 align:middle line:84%
But what's going on
in the last few years,

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.770 align:middle line:84%
especially since
the late '90s, is

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.390 align:middle line:84%
dramatically different
than anything we've seen.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.210 align:middle line:84%
So there has been some spraying
in the past and experiments.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.750 align:middle line:84%
But since the late
'90s up until now,

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.880 align:middle line:84%
we have this on just
a massive scale.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.770 align:middle line:90%
It's no longer experimental.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Weather modification is
a full-blown operation.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.680 align:middle line:84%
So we used to see occasional
contrails, little short trails

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.560 align:middle line:84%
that would dissipate
of jet exhaust.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.380 align:middle line:84%
But now we see these
lingering chemtrails.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.550 align:middle line:90%
It just sticks.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, you've
got grid spraying,

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.190 align:middle line:90%
and the sky gets hazy and murky.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And our beautiful blue
skies seem to be going away.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.790 align:middle line:84%
We don't have the beautiful
rain clouds we used to have.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.180 align:middle line:90%
We are bringing them back.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.230 align:middle line:90%
We are restoring things.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.720 align:middle line:84%
But geoengineering
destroys rain clouds.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.510 align:middle line:90%
It destroys blue sky.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.010 align:middle line:84%
It creates just a
murky white flat sky.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For every
one person, Sharon,

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.750 align:middle line:84%
that is trying to better the
atmosphere for all of us,

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.010 align:middle line:84%
how many are trying to
destroy it, or destroy us,

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.880 align:middle line:90%
I should say?

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: You know what?

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.410 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very few who
are trying to destroy it.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.160 align:middle line:84%
I just think they
have great resources.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.440 align:middle line:84%
I would say that there
are billions of us that

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.110 align:middle line:84%
want clean air and want a
beautiful world to live in,

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.010 align:middle line:90%
and a future for the children.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.670 align:middle line:84%
There are very few people
that want to destroy it.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.490 align:middle line:84%
These are psychopaths
we're talking about.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.260 align:middle line:84%
They have no empathy and they
can't understand what they do.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's only 4% of
the population at most.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most people
want it to be nice.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And if they had the
opportunity, they

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.220 align:middle line:84%
would do what they
could to undo this,

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.230 align:middle line:84%
although most people
feel helpless.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Many years ago,
Nikola Tesla, a genius,

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.420 align:middle line:84%
found out that we could get
free energy from the atmosphere.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.020 align:middle line:84%
We could literally pull
it down and use it.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.670 align:middle line:84%
Problem is, his investors
said, how are we

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.410 align:middle line:90%
going to make money doing this?

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:36.350 align:middle line:90%
It's free energy.

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.300 align:middle line:84%
What they should
have realized was

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.900 align:middle line:84%
that the machines to suck in the
energy, they could have sold.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And they could
have made billions

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:49.510 align:middle line:84%
selling the machines while
people were using free energy.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.310 align:middle line:84%
Every home would
have had a unit.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Every business would
have had a unit.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.420 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have the
vision to see that,

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.070 align:middle line:90%
so they stopped funding Tesla.

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.980 align:middle line:90%
And there is his died.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.920 align:middle line:84%
But you've looked at other
things too, like orgon energy.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.217 align:middle line:90%
Explain what that is.

00:07:04.217 --> 00:07:06.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: Orgon energy was
discovered by Wilhelm Reich.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And he was an Austrian
psychoanalyst.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.280 align:middle line:10%
And he got into this
because he discovered

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.570 align:middle line:10%
a bioelectrical charge
in his patients,

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:15.910 align:middle line:10%
and was able to measure this.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.940 align:middle line:84%
So this happened in
the 1930s that he

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:23.090 align:middle line:84%
was able to measure the
bioelectrical charge

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.080 align:middle line:84%
with a sensitive
millivolt reader.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And he discovered that this
energy, which was measurable,

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.265 align:middle line:84%
was what ancient cultures
had called chi or prana.

00:07:31.265 --> 00:07:32.685 align:middle line:90%
It was life energy.

00:07:32.685 --> 00:07:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And now science as able to
validate that yes, there

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:38.190 align:middle line:84%
is an energy, an
electricity of the body.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:38.980 align:middle line:90%
And it's free.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.420 align:middle line:90%
It's part of us.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.120 align:middle line:84%
So he thought,
this is beneficial.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.820 align:middle line:84%
We can use this in
a beneficial way.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.500 align:middle line:90%
How do we collect this energy?

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.460 align:middle line:84%
How do we use it to
benefit humanity?

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.500 align:middle line:84%
So he was able to use
it to treat cancer

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.200 align:middle line:90%
and in drought abatement.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
happened to him?

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: He got put in jail.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.300 align:middle line:10%
The United States
government put him in jail.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.700 align:middle line:10%
They destroyed his laboratory.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.120 align:middle line:10%
They burned his books.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And if it weren't for the
German copies of his books,

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:10.880 align:middle line:90%
we wouldn't have his work today.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Those were translated,
I think, in the 1970s.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.180 align:middle line:90%
So we do have access to it.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.680 align:middle line:84%
He was going to be
released in 1957,

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.572 align:middle line:84%
and he died in jail
two weeks before he

00:08:20.572 --> 00:08:21.780 align:middle line:90%
was scheduled to be released.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:22.697 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:08:22.697 --> 00:08:24.446 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: This is
what happens to anybody

00:08:24.446 --> 00:08:25.420 align:middle line:90%
working in free energy.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:26.310 align:middle line:90%
It's a very field.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.101 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did they
put him in jail for?

00:08:28.101 --> 00:08:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: Well, it was
a minor labeling issue.

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:35.710 align:middle line:84%
The FDA just found a little
minor labeling issue,

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:38.274 align:middle line:84%
and they called him to
court and he didn't show up.

00:08:38.274 --> 00:08:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
like so many people

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:42.190 align:middle line:84%
who get in trouble
with the FDA today,

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:45.720 align:middle line:90%
say that this cures this.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.010 align:middle line:90%
And that's a no no.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:50.330 align:middle line:84%
So what you have to
say is, we believe

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.730 align:middle line:90%
that this will help you.

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:53.990 align:middle line:90%
But you don't say cure.

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:55.282 align:middle line:90%
Cure's a bad word with the FDA.

00:08:55.282 --> 00:08:57.365 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: Well, he was
in the experimental phases

00:08:57.365 --> 00:08:58.090 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:00.320 align:middle line:84%
The reason he was put
in jail is because what

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.970 align:middle line:84%
he was doing was
so beneficial, it

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:06.220 align:middle line:84%
would make a lot of the
pharmaceutical industry

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.160 align:middle line:90%
obsolete.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And he was working with
free energy, something

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:12.200 align:middle line:90%
that we could all use.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And also, interestingly,
since weather modification

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.010 align:middle line:84%
had already been
going on at that time,

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:18.600 align:middle line:84%
he had documented
chemtrail spraying

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.940 align:middle line:90%
over his facility, Orgonon.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is in a
very rare book of his

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:24.865 align:middle line:90%
called "Contact with Space."

00:09:24.865 --> 00:09:26.240 align:middle line:84%
They had already
been doing this.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's very, very possible,
since they're so far ahead

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:33.500 align:middle line:84%
technologically-- we don't even
know what level of technology

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.170 align:middle line:84%
our government has--that they
already knew that this energy

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:38.820 align:middle line:84%
was incompatible with the
geoengineering programs,

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.070 align:middle line:90%
which it absolutely is.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:43.830 align:middle line:84%
His energy just makes the
engineering fall apart.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:47.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is orgone and
orgonite one and the same?

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:50.329 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: Orgonite are
these devices that I make.

00:09:50.329 --> 00:09:51.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's see
what we have here.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: This is
an orgonite device.

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.410 align:middle line:90%
And it's very small.

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.710 align:middle line:84%
Something like this is just
good for a room, you know.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:59.319 align:middle line:90%
This is nice in your home.

00:09:59.319 --> 00:10:00.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's this made with?

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:02.068 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: This is
made with resin.

00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And so inside there
we have-- this one

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.896 align:middle line:90%
has a smoky quartz crystal.

00:10:05.896 --> 00:10:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Looks like a
little spring in there.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:08.436 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: Yeah.

00:10:08.436 --> 00:10:09.560 align:middle line:90%
And that's a Tesla coil.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.932 align:middle line:90%
It's a copper coil.

00:10:10.932 --> 00:10:11.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You made this?

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:12.848 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: I made that.

00:10:12.848 --> 00:10:13.610 align:middle line:90%
And I make those.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:14.670 align:middle line:90%
And I have others, too.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:18.090 align:middle line:84%
This is more a
rough version of it.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you explain
what the top of this is?

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:22.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: That's brass.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.760 align:middle line:90%
So it uses metal shavings.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:28.210 align:middle line:84%
So orgonite is a device
which uses orgone energy.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.320 align:middle line:84%
So when Wilhelm Reich
discovered this,

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.620 align:middle line:84%
he used alternating
layers of wood and metal

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.030 align:middle line:90%
to create an orgone accumulator.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And he found that the
alternating layers

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.790 align:middle line:84%
of organic and inorganic
material in a box

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:43.810 align:middle line:84%
would collect orgone,
just collected out

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:44.890 align:middle line:90%
of the atmosphere.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:49.240 align:middle line:84%
So what these do is they use the
resin and the metal, primarily.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And the crystal and the coil
only just help it work better.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.490 align:middle line:90%
And it produces orgone.

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:59.560 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, the crystal
contains orgone energy.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.040 align:middle line:90%
It contains scalar energy.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.520 align:middle line:90%
That's the same thing.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And when compressed in a resin,
that amplifies that energy,

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:10.855 align:middle line:84%
and the metals and the
coil broadcast it out.

00:11:10.855 --> 00:11:11.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So what do you do?

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.500 align:middle line:90%
Just like keep it in your house?

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:14.166 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: Yeah.

00:11:14.166 --> 00:11:16.550 align:middle line:84%
I like to have it next
to my bed when I sleep.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:17.700 align:middle line:90%
Because what this does is--

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just on the table.

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:19.376 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: Yeah.

00:11:19.376 --> 00:11:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is, it
creates a scalar wave vortex,

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:25.880 align:middle line:84%
and the more of it you have,
the stronger this field is.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And it neutralizes harmful
EMF, and it removes toxins

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.212 align:middle line:90%
from the air.

00:11:31.212 --> 00:11:32.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a filter.

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:32.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: Yes.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What else is this?

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Looks like somebody's
finger that was chopped off.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: This is a very
simple and small obelisk

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:41.760 align:middle line:90%
which also uses orgone energy.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same principle?

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.385 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: Yes.

00:11:43.385 --> 00:11:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And this was developed by
this guy in Switzerland.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.160 align:middle line:90%
And his name is Ea.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.070 align:middle line:90%
That's his short name.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And you can go to my
website to link to his.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a simple
device anyone can make,

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.754 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't use resin so
it's easier for some people.

00:11:57.754 --> 00:11:59.211 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
wrapped up with wire.

00:11:59.211 --> 00:12:00.100 align:middle line:90%
I see the wire here.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: It's the same
materials without resin.

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:02.400 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.930 align:middle line:90%
It uses gold leaf.

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:08.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's 23 karat gold
that I wrapped around it.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Silver, copper, iron,
and aluminum wires.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:13.730 align:middle line:90%
And this is the same thing.

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:14.690 align:middle line:90%
It cleans the sky.

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:17.047 align:middle line:84%
It's a sky cleaner, an
atmospheric cleaner.

00:12:17.047 --> 00:12:18.630 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
great videos online

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.090 align:middle line:90%
where you can see what it does.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:23.090 align:middle line:84%
He has a whole lot of
them, and I have some too.

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:26.276 align:middle line:84%
When the sun hits it,
it works even better.

00:12:26.276 --> 00:12:27.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.360 align:middle line:90%
And you just keep it around?

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: I keep them around.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:32.150 align:middle line:90%
I keep tons of them around.

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And these ones, these are
what we call tower busters,

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.950 align:middle line:84%
developed by John Croft,
and Carol Croft, his wife.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:42.650 align:middle line:84%
They started distributing these
simple, cheap orgonite devices

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:44.890 align:middle line:90%
in the year 2000, around then.

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And they probably,
at this point,

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.840 align:middle line:84%
distributed hundreds
of thousands of them.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.360 align:middle line:84%
They go on huge
expeditions and missions.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.072 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:12:50.072 --> 00:12:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: And so when
you have a ton of them--

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:54.260 align:middle line:84%
and in LA, we've
thrown hundreds of them

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.360 align:middle line:84%
around-- when you
have a lot of these,

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.119 align:middle line:84%
you see weather changes,
dramatic weather changes.

00:12:59.119 --> 00:13:00.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They have that impact.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: They do,
but it definitely

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:03.350 align:middle line:90%
needs a large quantity.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And as we talked about
in the last show,

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:09.280 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned weather modification
with negative ionization.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:13.260 align:middle line:84%
So not all weather
modification needs chemicals

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.130 align:middle line:84%
through the process of
negative ionization.

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Simply working with the
electrical properties

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:19.600 align:middle line:84%
of the atmosphere,
some companies

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.660 align:middle line:84%
have been able to clean
air and produce rain.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And this uses the same
type of technology.

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:28.540 align:middle line:84%
But this is something
anyone can make.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The orgonite, how
does it remove these toxins

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:32.990 align:middle line:90%
from the atmosphere?

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: So it creates
a vortex of energy.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.590 align:middle line:90%
It's called scalar wave vortex.

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:39.910 align:middle line:84%
There's an electrical
engineer, Ken Rohla,

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:41.624 align:middle line:90%
who talks about this a lot.

00:13:41.624 --> 00:13:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And I put a couple
of these videos

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.220 align:middle line:90%
on my site, thechembow.com.

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:50.150 align:middle line:84%
So what it does is it creates
this vortex of energy that

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:52.500 align:middle line:84%
removes toxins from
the air and puts out

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.690 align:middle line:84%
clean air through a
process of transmutation.

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:57.530 align:middle line:90%
So we have changing of energy.

00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:59.610 align:middle line:90%
So it removes toxins.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:01.630 align:middle line:84%
It takes the positive
ions and the toxins out.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:03.120 align:middle line:84%
It puts out negative
ions and clean air.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't
see this, right?

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.886 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: Some people
can, but you have

00:14:05.886 --> 00:14:07.720 align:middle line:90%
to be very energy sensitive.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.220 align:middle line:84%
I've put four of these at the
corners of the home of somebody

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:15.040 align:middle line:84%
who is a psychic, who
is energy sensitive.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:15.840 align:middle line:90%
I am not.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.820 align:middle line:84%
But she said she
could see spirals,

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.100 align:middle line:90%
because that's the shape.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:24.600 align:middle line:84%
But I do have pictures of
the spirals of the pollution

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.800 align:middle line:90%
spiraling down.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.780 align:middle line:84%
When you see spirals of
it, it's because it's

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:30.710 align:middle line:84%
being transmitted by
orgone energy, which

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:32.980 align:middle line:90%
is also naturally occurring.

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.360 align:middle line:90%
Crystals contain it.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.316 align:middle line:84%
Mountains produce it as
well, mountain ranges.

00:14:37.316 --> 00:14:38.690 align:middle line:84%
Since I've been
here in Colorado,

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:40.880 align:middle line:84%
I've seen some great
lenticular clouds.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Lenticular clouds are produced
over mountain ranges because

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.110 align:middle line:84%
of the scalar field put
out by the mountain.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:50.435 align:middle line:84%
And we actually had lenticular
clouds form over our house.

00:14:50.435 --> 00:14:51.810 align:middle line:84%
While we were
living in Hollywood

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:54.360 align:middle line:84%
in the flats, no
mountains, we have them

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.160 align:middle line:84%
over our house because
the orgone energy,

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.440 align:middle line:84%
in the amount we had m creates
the same field as a mountain.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's wonderful
because it gathers

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:07.820 align:middle line:84%
toxins up and just collects
them and puts out clean air.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:08.990 align:middle line:90%
That's one thing it does.

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:13.580 align:middle line:84%
The other thing it does is it
neutralizes EMF frequencies.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.550 align:middle line:84%
So your cell phone
will still work,

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:17.910 align:middle line:90%
your Wi-Fi will still work.

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:21.320 align:middle line:84%
But this energy that comes
out these devices is chaotic.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:24.370 align:middle line:84%
It's incompatible with our
body's electrical system.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And the orgonite
just transforms it

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.290 align:middle line:84%
into parallel lines that move
through your body quietly.

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.030 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have the
same agitating effect,

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:35.150 align:middle line:90%
and it's healthier and safer.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
orgonite made of?

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: It's made of resin,
crystal, metal shavings,

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.120 align:middle line:90%
and copper coil.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.120 align:middle line:90%
It's that simple.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And these
are all natural.

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:47.320 align:middle line:90%
You can pick it up anywhere.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:47.530 align:middle line:90%
How do you make it?

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.225 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: Well, the only thing
that's unnatural is the resin.

00:15:49.225 --> 00:15:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And the resin, that's
a little toxic,

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.070 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we have
this obelisk for-- this

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.620 align:middle line:84%
is great for people who don't
want to work with resin.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:57.810 align:middle line:90%
Some people use beeswax.

00:15:57.810 --> 00:15:59.420 align:middle line:84%
There are other
materials you can use.

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.560 align:middle line:90%
But I use resin.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.154 align:middle line:90%
It is toxic.

00:16:01.154 --> 00:16:02.820 align:middle line:84%
I recommend you're
in a well- ventilated

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.610 align:middle line:90%
area when you make these.

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:05.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it easy to make?

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:06.270 align:middle line:90%
People can do it?

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:07.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: It is easy to make.

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:08.420 align:middle line:90%
Simple, organized, easy.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:11.227 align:middle line:84%
I make some fancy pieces
that are very decorative.

00:16:11.227 --> 00:16:12.310 align:middle line:90%
They're harder to make it.

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:13.820 align:middle line:90%
You have to layer the resin.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.780 align:middle line:84%
But these simple devices
are very easy to make.

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.870 align:middle line:90%
You just get a mold.

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:21.300 align:middle line:84%
You can get silicon
molds where you

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:22.920 align:middle line:90%
don't need any releasing agent.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.680 align:middle line:84%
You put in a coil and a crystal,
and the crystal can be rough.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.690 align:middle line:84%
It could be small,
and it could be cheap.

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:30.452 align:middle line:84%
You can even use white quartz
that you just find on a beach

00:16:30.452 --> 00:16:32.110 align:middle line:90%
or out in nature.

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And then you mix
and pour the resin

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:36.750 align:middle line:84%
according to the
instructions on the resin.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:38.810 align:middle line:90%
You can even use bondo.

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:40.690 align:middle line:84%
You can even use brillo
pads for your metal.

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:46.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: All it needs is those
elements to produce the energy.

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You are a booster
in vitamins and supplements

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:53.550 align:middle line:84%
to try to combat what's
happening out there

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:54.426 align:middle line:90%
in the atmosphere.

00:16:54.426 --> 00:16:55.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: Yes.

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:56.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
how you use that.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:56.765 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: Yes.

00:16:56.765 --> 00:16:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Because we have to
first clean the air,

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.230 align:middle line:90%
but we have to clean ourselves.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:02.040 align:middle line:84%
We need to heal
ourselves from this.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.940 align:middle line:84%
So there are
different vitamins I

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.420 align:middle line:84%
take that will block
heavy metals in the body.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.859 align:middle line:84%
And there are
supplements, herbs that I

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:11.470 align:middle line:84%
use to chelate heavy
metals out of the body.

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:14.670 align:middle line:84%
So the main constituents
of chemtrails

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:17.130 align:middle line:84%
are aluminum, barium,
and strontium.

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And so if you take
magnesium, you're

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:22.609 align:middle line:84%
able to block the aluminum
from integrating with your body

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:24.599 align:middle line:84%
because they're
molecularly similar.

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:26.359 align:middle line:84%
So we need to make
sure that we're

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:27.880 align:middle line:90%
getting plenty of magnesium.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.360 align:middle line:90%
I take supplements for that.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And also, strontium is easily
uptaken into the bones.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.290 align:middle line:84%
So you need to have
adequate calcium, which

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:39.540 align:middle line:90%
is also similar to strontium.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.500 align:middle line:84%
So if you have adequate
calcium intake--

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.210 align:middle line:84%
I take a supplement
for that too-- you

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:46.270 align:middle line:84%
will be able to prevent
the strontium from being

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:48.040 align:middle line:90%
taken into your bones.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And barium is tricky
one, because this

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.520 align:middle line:90%
depletes the body's potassium.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's
in the spraying a lot.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: It is
a lot of barium.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And it'll make you feel
exhausted and depleted,

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.980 align:middle line:84%
because it inactivates the
potassium in your body.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:08.640 align:middle line:84%
I have not been able to find an
adequate potassium supplement.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.900 align:middle line:84%
However, I eat foods rich
in potassium, and especially

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.120 align:middle line:90%
on spray days.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.500 align:middle line:90%
Bananas, coconuts, potatoes.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And coconut water, actually,
is a wonderful source

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:21.480 align:middle line:90%
of potassium and magnesium.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.300 align:middle line:90%
And I'll drink coconuts.

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.460 align:middle line:84%
On spray days I'll
go to town with it.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.640 align:middle line:84%
I'll drink a lot
of coconut water

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.900 align:middle line:90%
and I'll use chelating herbs.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.580 align:middle line:90%
Cilantro is delicious.

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:33.824 align:middle line:90%
You can use it on everything.

00:18:33.824 --> 00:18:34.990 align:middle line:90%
And it removes heavy metals.

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're like
little filters, aren't they?

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:37.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: They are.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just the
geoengineering stuff.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.790 align:middle line:84%
It takes out lead
and mercury, which

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:42.860 align:middle line:84%
is-- they found these
things in the mix, too.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:46.610 align:middle line:84%
But primarily aluminum, barium,
and strontium is being sprayed.

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:49.060 align:middle line:84%
But we get lead and
mercury from our water.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.370 align:middle line:84%
So you eat cilantro, and
I have a recipe on my site

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:53.866 align:middle line:90%
for Cilantro Chelation Pesto.

00:18:53.866 --> 00:18:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what
is your website?

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.531 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: It's thechembow.com.

00:18:56.531 --> 00:19:03.780 align:middle line:10%
That's T- H- E- C- H- E- M as
in man, B as in boy, O-W.com.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:04.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thechembow.com.

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:06.905 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: It's like
a chemical rainbow.

00:19:06.905 --> 00:19:08.030 align:middle line:90%
We see those on spray days.

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:11.746 align:middle line:84%
As I was leaving LAX to
come here, I looked outside

00:19:11.746 --> 00:19:13.120 align:middle line:84%
and I saw loads
of geoengineering

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:16.100 align:middle line:84%
over the ocean, which stopped
abruptly at Los Angeles,

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.715 align:middle line:84%
because we have thousands
of these in the city.

00:19:18.715 --> 00:19:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that what's
pushing back, do you think?

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: It just
transmutes it.

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:25.310 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't allow it to come in,
and it transmutes what's here.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:28.430 align:middle line:84%
So I saw the geoengineering
coming in, stopping at LA,

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:30.360 align:middle line:84%
because we haven't got
out to the ocean yet.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.580 align:middle line:84%
We're going to drop tons
of this in the ocean.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.400 align:middle line:84%
But it stops at LA,
and I looked out there

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.810 align:middle line:84%
and I saw a little
chembow in the sky.

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:39.520 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen these-- they
call them fire rainbows

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.500 align:middle line:84%
in the mainstream news, because
people are a little scared,

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.910 align:middle line:84%
and they say, what is
this thing in the sky?

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And so they made
up a name for it.

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:50.890 align:middle line:84%
But it's a chembow, caused by
the light hitting the chemical

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:51.750 align:middle line:90%
nanoparticulates.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:53.875 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I for one,
am not the kind of person

00:19:53.875 --> 00:19:58.920 align:middle line:84%
to look at the sky, see these
chemtrail patterns, and say,

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going out.

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:01.870 align:middle line:90%
I'll still do my thing.

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:03.330 align:middle line:90%
Is that smart or not?

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:04.170 align:middle line:90%
Should I say in?

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:05.795 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: Well, if
you have to go out,

00:20:05.795 --> 00:20:08.304 align:middle line:84%
I have a few more chelating
agents you can use,

00:20:08.304 --> 00:20:09.970 align:middle line:84%
because this is
actually very important.

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:11.680 align:middle line:90%
You sometimes have to go out.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.705 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to
take the stuff in.

00:20:13.705 --> 00:20:15.330 align:middle line:84%
I try to stay in when
they're spraying,

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:16.990 align:middle line:84%
but inevitably
you'll be out there.

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:20.010 align:middle line:84%
So a few more things to
add to the supplement list,

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:22.220 align:middle line:90%
very important ones, actually.

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.650 align:middle line:90%
Chlorella.

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:24.754 align:middle line:90%
I take a ton of it.

00:20:24.754 --> 00:20:25.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a good filter.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: It's great, and
I take it on the spray days.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.460 align:middle line:84%
I take it in the
morning every day.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.793 align:middle line:84%
On s pray day, I'll take it
in the afternoon and evening

00:20:31.793 --> 00:20:32.760 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing is,
get into using zeolite

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:38.010 align:middle line:90%
as just a maintenance.

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:40.710 align:middle line:90%
I use zeolite as a detox.

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:42.800 align:middle line:84%
I took the detox
dose for a week,

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.820 align:middle line:84%
and I felt horrible
all week while it

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:49.380 align:middle line:84%
was removing all this backed up
heavy metal out of my system.

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:52.240 align:middle line:84%
But zeolite, I now take a
maintenance dose every day.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And this keeps you
clean from heavy metals

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:57.150 align:middle line:84%
because it's a negatively
charged mineral

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:59.890 align:middle line:84%
that collects positively
charged heavy metals,

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:01.380 align:middle line:90%
and you can pass them through.

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.750 align:middle line:84%
So inevitably you're going to
have to go out on spray days.

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:08.200 align:middle line:84%
When you do, take
extra precaution,

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.330 align:middle line:90%
take extra supplements.

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And be aware of it, and
make sure you're eating

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.404 align:middle line:90%
plenty of foods with potassium.

00:21:13.404 --> 00:21:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's smart.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: Yeah, you just
have to be aware of it.

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:17.956 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And have you
seen a difference?

00:21:17.956 --> 00:21:20.062 align:middle line:84%
Because in the beginning,
before you did this,

00:21:20.062 --> 00:21:21.499 align:middle line:90%
thse chemtrails affected you.

00:21:21.499 --> 00:21:22.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: Oh, yes.

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:23.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about now?

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: I am so much
healthier now than I've ever

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.600 align:middle line:84%
been, and it's wonderful,
because I've discovered

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.430 align:middle line:90%
these healing agents.

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:34.230 align:middle line:84%
But also, learning
about chemtrails

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:35.930 align:middle line:90%
has led me towards other things.

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I also eat a
healthier diet now and keep

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.580 align:middle line:84%
my immune system very
strong with fresh fruits

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:43.080 align:middle line:90%
and vegetables, organic food.

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:47.790 align:middle line:84%
But I actually am better
off now than I was before.

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And I don't get
sick like I used to.

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:53.440 align:middle line:84%
If it's a very heavy spray day,
I still will have symptoms.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.260 align:middle line:84%
So I'll take an Epsom salt
bath, too, on those days.

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:58.690 align:middle line:90%
I highly recommend that.

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And usually after that, I'm
back to my normal self again.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:04.860 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I'm not as
debilitated anymore by this.

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sharon,
electromagnetic frequencies

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:10.140 align:middle line:90%
are bombarding us all the time.

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:11.300 align:middle line:90%
Will this help?

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:12.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: It does.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.670 align:middle line:90%
It helps very much.

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:16.240 align:middle line:84%
Having these in your
home, it neutralizes it.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.590 align:middle line:90%
So it's still there.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:19.150 align:middle line:90%
It's still coming through.

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:21.310 align:middle line:84%
But we at least
quiet the waves so

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:23.270 align:middle line:84%
that they are less
harmful to us,

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:26.360 align:middle line:84%
so that they're less
carcinogenic, because our body

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.600 align:middle line:84%
is not being-- when
we're bombarded

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.450 align:middle line:84%
with EMF, that causes
a miscommunication

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:32.880 align:middle line:90%
between our cells.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.819 align:middle line:90%
That's what leads to cancer.

00:22:34.819 --> 00:22:37.110 align:middle line:84%
But if we can neutralize it
and have it pass through us

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:40.650 align:middle line:84%
quieter, we reduce that risk,
and we also feel better.

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:42.240 align:middle line:90%
We rest better.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:45.280 align:middle line:84%
We can meditate and
relax more easily.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.490 align:middle line:84%
But I also think
it's very important

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:49.620 align:middle line:84%
to remove these
devices from the home,

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:52.120 align:middle line:84%
because we're still being
bombarded with it from outside,

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.530 align:middle line:84%
so the more of it you can
get rid, the better you are.

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:56.310 align:middle line:90%
The better off you are.

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:58.610 align:middle line:84%
If you have a smart
meter on your home,

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:00.082 align:middle line:90%
this is constantly emitting--

00:23:00.082 --> 00:23:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And many
homes are getting them.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: They are
putting them everywhere.

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.250 align:middle line:90%
You need to opt out.

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:06.860 align:middle line:84%
If you have that opportunity,
and your power company says,

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:08.970 align:middle line:84%
we're going to put
this on your house,

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:10.750 align:middle line:90%
opt out, even if it costs money.

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:13.640 align:middle line:84%
It's worth it, because
those things disrupts sleep

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.520 align:middle line:90%
and they cause cancer.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And there have been no studies
done to prove they're safe.

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:20.430 align:middle line:84%
So they're going ahead
with this although there's

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:22.400 align:middle line:90%
no studies to prove it's safe.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.030 align:middle line:84%
Also, I recommend highly
that people get rid

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:26.380 align:middle line:90%
of their wireless Internet.

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:27.800 align:middle line:90%
It's very convenient and nice.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:28.545 align:middle line:90%
The wires are annoying.

00:23:28.545 --> 00:23:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I love
my wireless Internet.

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:30.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: I know.

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:30.710 align:middle line:90%
It's so convenient.

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:32.376 align:middle line:84%
I never thought I
could live without it.

00:23:32.376 --> 00:23:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I beam it
to my flat screen TV.

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:35.560 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.386 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: And these things,
what we're talking about,

00:23:38.386 --> 00:23:40.760 align:middle line:84%
what comes out of the TV, what
comes out of the Internet,

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.900 align:middle line:84%
this is what Wilhelm Reich
called deadly orgone radiation,

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:46.540 align:middle line:84%
which is to contrast with the
healthy life-giving energy

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:47.650 align:middle line:90%
that this puts out.

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:50.070 align:middle line:84%
So we actually are
beating ourselves

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:53.430 align:middle line:84%
in what's deadly
radiation, contrary to how

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:54.480 align:middle line:90%
our bodies work.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.280 align:middle line:90%
And yes, it's nice.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a
television anymore.

00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:58.536 align:middle line:90%
I don't use wireless Internet.

00:23:58.536 --> 00:23:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I hope
you have a radio.

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:00.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: I have a radio.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:01.263 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good.

00:24:01.263 --> 00:24:03.951 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: We use an AM radio
to listen to the Kings games.

00:24:03.951 --> 00:24:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And to my show.

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:05.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: Yes.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:06.896 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thank you.

00:24:06.896 --> 00:24:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: And so we
have an AM radio set up,

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:11.660 align:middle line:84%
and that's all we listen to on
the radio is actually-- yes,

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:14.050 align:middle line:90%
talk radio and sports.

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny, because we'd
set that up because we couldn't

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:19.360 align:middle line:90%
live without the AM radio.

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.590 align:middle line:90%
But that's what we have.

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:21.715 align:middle line:90%
We don't have a television.

00:24:21.715 --> 00:24:23.872 align:middle line:90%


00:24:23.872 --> 00:24:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Because?

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: Because,
one, I don't need

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:27.170 align:middle line:84%
to be programmed,
because I don't

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:29.177 align:middle line:84%
need the programming
of the television.

00:24:29.177 --> 00:24:31.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't you want to
watch a movie once in awhile?

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: I watch
it on the computer.

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And the computer, yeah,
it does emit something,

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:38.900 align:middle line:84%
but it's less--
according to James DeMeo,

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:42.530 align:middle line:84%
a laptop computer,
actually, is less dangerous

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:43.700 align:middle line:90%
than a lot of these devices.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.790 align:middle line:84%
So I plug directly
into the Internet.

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:49.034 align:middle line:84%
I do actually check
out a lot of coast

00:24:49.034 --> 00:24:50.450 align:middle line:84%
to coast stuff on
YouTube, though.

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:52.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm always a sort of
after the fact person.

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:55.330 align:middle line:84%
I listen to most of
my stuff on YouTube.

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you say,
Sharon, to people who say,

00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:59.970 align:middle line:90%
you're being over paranoid.

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:03.160 align:middle line:84%
Come on, these things
aren't happening to us.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.309 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: Well, you
know, a lot of people

00:25:05.309 --> 00:25:06.850 align:middle line:84%
don't want to think
about this stuff.

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:09.910 align:middle line:84%
But I feel bad for people who
don't want to think about it,

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:12.720 align:middle line:84%
because their health
is being affected,

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.650 align:middle line:90%
and they may or may not know it.

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:19.350 align:middle line:84%
But we've accepted feeling
terrible as the new normal,

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:21.790 align:middle line:90%
and it shouldn't be that way.

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:23.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: People should upgrade.

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:25.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: Well, we can.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.040 align:middle line:84%
We need to look at
what we're taking in.

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:30.005 align:middle line:84%
We need to look at
what we're eating.

00:25:30.005 --> 00:25:31.630 align:middle line:84%
We need to look at
what we're breathing

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:32.588 align:middle line:90%
and the water we drink.

00:25:32.588 --> 00:25:35.200 align:middle line:84%
But to some people, it's
just too much to think about.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.990 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't think about it,
you know, what kind of a life

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:39.170 align:middle line:90%
are you living?

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:42.070 align:middle line:84%
So I do encourage people to
think more about their health.

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:44.790 align:middle line:90%
But I also see the denial of it.

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:46.531 align:middle line:84%
And people just accept
they just feel bad

00:25:46.531 --> 00:25:48.030 align:middle line:84%
and they'll go take
a pill for that.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you
had a magic wand,

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:53.240 align:middle line:84%
how would you wave that over the
planet, and what would it do?

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: My magic wand.

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:57.315 align:middle line:84%
This is my magic wand,
and I'm waving it

00:25:57.315 --> 00:26:00.220 align:middle line:84%
over the planet,
and-- all of this,

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:03.590 align:middle line:84%
actually-- we're
transforming things

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:07.360 align:middle line:84%
using orgonite, because not only
does it clean the atmosphere

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.290 align:middle line:84%
and bring things
back into balance.

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:12.460 align:middle line:84%
But actually, this energy,
by quieting all that EMF,

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:16.570 align:middle line:84%
allows humanity to
find themselves again,

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:18.330 align:middle line:84%
because we're quieting
all the noise that

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:22.850 align:middle line:84%
has been kind of suppressing
our consciousness.

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:25.870 align:middle line:84%
We're unable to think
straight when we're bombarded

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:27.920 align:middle line:90%
with these dangerous energies.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And by transmuting that and
removing that influence,

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:33.680 align:middle line:84%
people all of a sudden can
think clearly and see clearly.

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.250 align:middle line:84%
So I've actually seen
neighborhoods change

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:37.940 align:middle line:84%
in Hollywood, where
we were living.

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.820 align:middle line:84%
It was just chaos
over there, so noisy.

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:43.690 align:middle line:84%
We started doing this, and
a lot of the crazy people

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:44.960 align:middle line:90%
started acting less crazy.

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:45.860 align:middle line:90%
It became quiet.

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:48.540 align:middle line:84%
We had nice quiet nights
where we could sleep.

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.090 align:middle line:84%
It didn't even sound
like Los Angeles anymore.

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Those are
pleasant moments.

00:26:54.300 --> 00:27:00.000 align:middle line:84%
What do you tell people who want
to change, who want to learn,

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.390 align:middle line:84%
who want to fight back, and
they just don't know what to do?

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: Well, I
think that you just have

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:08.060 align:middle line:90%
to take it one step at a time.

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of
resources online that help.

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:13.560 align:middle line:84%
I would say for people
who don't want to do,

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.030 align:middle line:90%
start with what you eat.

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:19.370 align:middle line:84%
Start with-- changing your
diet is a great first step

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:21.600 align:middle line:90%
towards further awareness.

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Get that junk food
out of your diet.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Start eating healthy
and exercising.

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:29.561 align:middle line:84%
And once you do
that, I would say,

00:27:29.561 --> 00:27:31.060 align:middle line:84%
get that fluoride
out of your water.

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:32.420 align:middle line:84%
Get those heavy metals
out of your water.

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:34.086 align:middle line:84%
Think about where
your water comes from.

00:27:34.086 --> 00:27:37.750 align:middle line:84%
So I would say begin by
taking care of your health,

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:43.170 align:middle line:84%
and making time to meditate
and relax and clear your mind.

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:44.750 align:middle line:90%
Those are great first steps.

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Having energy tools
around like this is great.

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:50.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot for some
people to understand,

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:52.550 align:middle line:84%
because we're talking
about invisible phenomenon.

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:54.510 align:middle line:84%
But I'd say start
with your health.

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:57.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not out of your
control to make a change.

00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:00.890 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability to
decide what we take in.

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And also, decide what you
take in mentally, too.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.920 align:middle line:84%
Don't just look at any
old TV show that's on.

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.110 align:middle line:90%
Don't watch the commercials.

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:14.170 align:middle line:84%
Look for something that
stimulates your mind, that

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:15.620 align:middle line:90%
gives you new information.

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:15.915 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: An education.

00:28:15.915 --> 00:28:16.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: Yeah.

00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:17.590 align:middle line:90%
Start thinking about things.

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:19.500 align:middle line:90%
And that's why we do this.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:23.070 align:middle line:84%
It clears out a lot of that
junk, a lot of that EMF,

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:25.457 align:middle line:84%
so that people can use their
minds more effectively.

00:28:25.457 --> 00:28:27.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you finding,
Sharon, that more people

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:31.405 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to tune in, to
listen to people like you?

00:28:31.405 --> 00:28:32.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: Every day.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Every day there's
somebody new listening.

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:37.470 align:middle line:90%
And it's very, very encouraging.

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:39.570 align:middle line:84%
I think the human
race is evolving.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:40.760 align:middle line:90%
We're awakening.

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And the powers that be do
not want us to wake up.

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:45.510 align:middle line:84%
They like things just
the way they are.

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And many people are content with
things just the way they are.

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:51.280 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is, we're moving
on to a better way of being.

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.690 align:middle line:84%
We're moving on to
a world without war

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:56.240 align:middle line:84%
where we are cooperative
and we help each other,

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.420 align:middle line:84%
because human nature is
cooperative and loving and

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:00.620 align:middle line:90%
compassionate.

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:02.160 align:middle line:90%
We're not warlike.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.930 align:middle line:90%
We want to help each other.

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:05.040 align:middle line:90%
We're not greedy.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.750 align:middle line:90%
These are not our nature.

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:09.200 align:middle line:84%
We're being influenced
by something

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.135 align:middle line:84%
from outside, outside
influences that are not us.

00:29:12.135 --> 00:29:14.294 align:middle line:90%
It's psychopathic.

We need to come
back to ourselves,

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.960 align:middle line:10%
discover who we are
again as human beings,

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:25.560 align:middle line:10%
and move to a higher level
of thinking and awareness.

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:26.980 align:middle line:90%
It's not just a new age thing.

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.494 align:middle line:84%

of so much more.

around your own home in

just remember some of the things
