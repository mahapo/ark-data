>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.630 align:middle line:10%
G Edward Griffin with us,
noted researcher and author,

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.110 align:middle line:10%
of course, "The Creature
from Jekyll Island,"

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.900 align:middle line:10%
but that's not what we're going
to talk about in this program.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.040 align:middle line:84%
In this program, we're going
to talk about Edward's work,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.730 align:middle line:84%
seeking out and
finding Noah's ark.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.180 align:middle line:90%
He knows where it is.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.020 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk more
about the JFK assassination,

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.260 align:middle line:84%
what really happened,
and who killed Kennedy.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, cures
for cancer-- is it there?

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.010 align:middle line:84%
That'll be next
on Beyond Belief.

>>G. Edward Griffin was called
a quack, a conspiracy theorist,

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.570 align:middle line:84%
and a crackpot until his work
exposing the Federal Reserve

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.260 align:middle line:90%
became mainstream.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.130 align:middle line:84%
But did you also know he
has stirred controversy

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.090 align:middle line:84%
with his theories on a
world without cancer,

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.310 align:middle line:84%
who really killed
JFK, and he says he

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.790 align:middle line:90%
knows where to find Noah's ark.

>>NOORY: And welcome
back to Beyond Belief

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.010 align:middle line:84%
with our special guest,
G Edward Griffin.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.080 align:middle line:84%
This is exciting
stuff you work on, Ed.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.552 align:middle line:10%

it keeps me very much awake.

00:01:23.552 --> 00:01:25.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got
two documentaries out

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.800 align:middle line:90%
on Noah's ark.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Yeah.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.870 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's great stuff.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.370 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIFFIN: Well,
it's amazing stuff,

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.790 align:middle line:10%
and it's sort of off
of my normal path,

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.010 align:middle line:10%
but it's something I've always
been fascinated by since being

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.000 align:middle line:10%
a child, you know.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.710 align:middle line:84%
As we get into it,
I want you look

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.850 align:middle line:84%

-In the Koran, we find
essentially the same story,

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.450 align:middle line:84%
including the
loading of animals,

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.980 align:middle line:84%
the scoffing of unbelievers, and
the ark's final resting place

The story of a mammoth
flood and its survivors

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.820 align:middle line:84%
has been preserved in the
written and spoken traditions

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.620 align:middle line:84%
of most of the ancient
peoples of the Earth.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.830 align:middle line:84%
It's found in Northern Europe,
Southeast Asia, China, Egypt,

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:14.350 align:middle line:84%
North and South America, Africa,
India, and the Pacific Islands.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.140 align:middle line:84%
The oldest of these
records dates back

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.500 align:middle line:84%
over 4,000 years to the
land of Sumer, the world's

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.090 align:middle line:90%
first known civilization.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Stories of the
early history of man

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.280 align:middle line:84%
were written on clay tablets,
which were copied and spread

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.960 align:middle line:90%
throughout the ancient world.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.560 align:middle line:84%
In the 1840s, hundreds
of these tablets

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.850 align:middle line:84%
were discovered by
archaeologists digging

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.440 align:middle line:84%
among the ruins at
Nineveh, the capital city

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.740 align:middle line:90%
of the ancient Assyrian empire.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.810 align:middle line:84%
The account of the
flood was among them

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.750 align:middle line:84%
and was discovered on the 11th
tablet of a longer story called

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.047 align:middle line:90%
"The Epic of Gilgamesh."

watch these documentaries.

If you're into Noah's
ark as I have been,

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.720 align:middle line:84%
it's really
fascinating material.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.610 align:middle line:10%
How did you, an expert on
the Federal Reserve, the JFK

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.900 align:middle line:10%
assassination, cancer
treatments-- how in the world

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.296 align:middle line:10%
did you start doing
documentaries on Noah's ark?

00:03:08.296 --> 00:03:10.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, I'd
like to say I got bored,

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.170 align:middle line:90%
but that's not the case.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.510 align:middle line:84%
I have an amazing collection
of friends, George,

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.430 align:middle line:84%
and in almost all
of those cases,

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.700 align:middle line:84%
I started into a
project, because someone

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.650 align:middle line:84%
contacted me and said, you've
got to learn about this.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.430 align:middle line:84%
You've got to talk
about this, and I've

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.180 align:middle line:90%
looked at it reluctantly.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.410 align:middle line:90%
I thought, Noah's ark?

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.911 align:middle line:84%
What kind of a
weird thing is that?

00:03:29.911 --> 00:03:31.660 align:middle line:84%
I was interested in
the story, but I never

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.830 align:middle line:84%
thought there was a
controversy to it.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.840 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was
a biblical story.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, to make a
long story short,

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.370 align:middle line:84%
I was approached by
Donald Patton, who

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.810 align:middle line:84%
was an amateur-- well, he's
a historian and geographer

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.870 align:middle line:84%
and geologist, amateur, and he
gathered a lot of scientists

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.360 align:middle line:84%
around him, and they came up
with some amazing theories

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.300 align:middle line:84%
about the scientific explanation
for Noah's flood, which

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.860 align:middle line:90%
turns out to be real.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.934 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It did happen.

00:04:00.934 --> 00:04:02.350 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if
it was worldwide--

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.930 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIFFIN: The geological
record is very clear.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:04.760 align:middle line:10%
It did happen.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it
worldwide, or was it just

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.180 align:middle line:84%
restricted to a certain
region on this planet?

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: It was
worldwide in the sense

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.190 align:middle line:84%
that it went around the
world, but not at the poles.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.709 align:middle line:84%
It was more around the center
of the Earth, because you see,

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.140 align:middle line:84%
the Earth was rotating, and
the impact, the geographical

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.780 align:middle line:84%
and gravitational impact
was from outer space.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.740 align:middle line:84%
So as the Earth rotated
underneath it, then

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.370 align:middle line:90%
it was on like a plane.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.132 align:middle line:84%
So it was more affected
through the continents,

00:04:33.132 --> 00:04:35.590 align:middle line:84%
through the major continents,
but not so much on the poles.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And nearly every
ancient civilization

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.430 align:middle line:84%
has written about some kind
of a major catastrophe,

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.410 align:middle line:84%
a major flood that occurred
5,000 some years ago.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.120 align:middle line:84%
In your opinion, based
on your research,

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.300 align:middle line:90%
we agree the flood occurred.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.270 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.440 align:middle line:90%
What caused it?

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, that's always
been one of the mysteries,

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.890 align:middle line:84%
and one on the reasons
that people reject

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.996 align:middle line:84%
the story of the
flood is that well,

00:04:58.996 --> 00:05:00.120 align:middle line:90%
what happened to the water?

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.100 align:middle line:84%
If you cover Earth with a flood,
well, did the water evaporate?

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.900 align:middle line:90%
Where'd it go?

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where did it go?

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:06.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well,
that's because they

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.690 align:middle line:84%
don't have the understanding
that although it was a flood,

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.850 align:middle line:84%
it was not worldwide
all at the same time.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And the concept turns out
to be that it was tides.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.090 align:middle line:84%
It was a gravitational
interaction

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.250 align:middle line:84%
between a large body
in space coming fairly

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.840 align:middle line:84%
close to the Earth, and
the gravitational impact

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.700 align:middle line:84%
between the two was causing the
waters to rise at the tides.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a tsunami?

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Very
much like a tsunami.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.890 align:middle line:84%
We have tides now that
go as high as 40 feet

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.240 align:middle line:90%
at the Bay of Fundy.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.710 align:middle line:90%
So tides are not uncommon.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And all you need for a really
high tide at 5,000 feet

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.490 align:middle line:84%
or more is to have something
big, bigger than the moon,

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.830 align:middle line:84%
come into the Earth's
field-- not close enough

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.000 align:middle line:84%
to collide or anything,
but close enough

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.550 align:middle line:84%
to cause this
gravitational interaction

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.730 align:middle line:84%
so that the tides would be
pulled up to 5,000 feet.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:56.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: And it's
clearly possible.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.665 align:middle line:90%
It's mathematically possible.

00:06:00.665 --> 00:06:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And not only would
there be tides

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.260 align:middle line:84%
in the water on the
surface of the Earth,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.300 align:middle line:84%
but tides in the magma, the
liquid core of the Earth.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.650 align:middle line:10%
Those would be tiding too and
pushing up mountain ranges,

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.880 align:middle line:10%
and that finally becomes the
most plausible explanation

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.340 align:middle line:10%
for how our mountains
were formed,

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.630 align:middle line:10%
because the mountains
are all formed

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.180 align:middle line:10%
in rings in circles
around the Earth,

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.840 align:middle line:10%
and they parallel each
other as you would imagine

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.390 align:middle line:10%
if the Earth were spinning,
and there was a big magnet

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.720 align:middle line:10%
out there pulling
magma from the center,

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.950 align:middle line:10%
pushing the mountains up.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And as the Earth spun
around, the mountains

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.344 align:middle line:84%
would come up and form this
ring and ring after ring.

00:06:34.344 --> 00:06:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And you see them
around the earth.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.301 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And then
they parted, right?

00:06:37.301 --> 00:06:39.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As you look at the
stories of our Planet X,

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.150 align:middle line:84%
that it comes to around
every 3,600 years

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.820 align:middle line:84%
and does incredible catastrophic
things to our planet,

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:54.030 align:middle line:84%
might that have been the
initial cause of this flood?

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, you can't
say what was for sure

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.550 align:middle line:90%
and what was not.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.012 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you do think a
heavenly object effected this?

00:07:02.012 --> 00:07:02.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: It is clear.

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:04.730 align:middle line:84%
I think the evidence
clearly points

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.420 align:middle line:84%
that it was a heavenly
object, something in space.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Now whether it was Nibiru
or one of the-- Planet X,

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:15.650 align:middle line:84%
as they call it-- or whether
it was the planet Mars changing

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.050 align:middle line:84%
orbit from the previous
orbit to where it is now,

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.330 align:middle line:84%
the people who worked on this
program, the astronomers--

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or Venus.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.199 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: --believe now that
it was most likely Mars changing

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:28.240 align:middle line:90%
orbit, believe it or not.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ha.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.930 align:middle line:90%
OK, now I was raised a Catholic.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.370 align:middle line:90%
I went to catechism classes.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.600 align:middle line:90%
I was told about Noah's ark.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm now George the adult,
the probing talk show host.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.920 align:middle line:84%
I find it very
difficult to comprehend

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:50.320 align:middle line:84%
that God spoke to someone named
Noah, gave him forewarning,

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.870 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden,
he built this huge ark

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:57.280 align:middle line:84%
and filled it with every animal
known to man at the time.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.050 align:middle line:90%
I do believe he had an ark.

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:00.670 align:middle line:90%
I do believe he built something.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:02.250 align:middle line:90%
We'll get into that.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.622 align:middle line:84%
But to put every animal
in there-- really?

00:08:04.622 --> 00:08:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Yeah, I like
your reasoning, George,

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.920 align:middle line:84%
because I went through
that same process.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you just
want to just remove

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.400 align:middle line:84%
the question of whether
this was God speaking

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.320 align:middle line:84%
or not, and just
look at the evidence,

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.870 align:middle line:84%
the geological evidence,
something really happened.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:22.180 align:middle line:84%
It becomes clear that
there was a flood,

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:27.730 align:middle line:84%
and it's also clear from
the geological work that

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:31.660 align:middle line:84%
was done later that there's
a huge fossil remnant

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.995 align:middle line:84%
of something that looks
exactly like the ark.

00:08:33.995 --> 00:08:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's the right measurement
and everything else.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.370 align:middle line:84%
So maybe there was an
ark and all of that,

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:40.770 align:middle line:84%
but the question of the
animals, I agree with you.

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:46.100 align:middle line:84%
You see, if you go back and look
at the original clay tablets

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.590 align:middle line:90%
that they found in--

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sumer.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:49.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Yeah.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
original story shows up

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.940 align:middle line:84%
in "The Epic of Gilgamesh" long
before the Old Testament was

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:55.740 align:middle line:90%
written.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.090 align:middle line:10%
The story of Noah's ark--

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:58.300 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Which echoed that.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.100 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIFFIN: Exactly.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:04.470 align:middle line:10%
They all echo that first story,
which appeared in Gilgamesh.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, it was clear when
you go back to those clay

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:13.510 align:middle line:84%
tablets that they were
talking about the animals

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:18.440 align:middle line:84%
at Noah's door was
the exact translation.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.160 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's
domestic animals,

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:20.990 align:middle line:90%
which would be a lot of them.

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.589 align:middle line:84%
There would be
cattle and chickens--

00:09:22.589 --> 00:09:24.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Goats and things
like that, some horses.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.046 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: But obviously not
animals all around the world.

00:09:27.046 --> 00:09:28.820 align:middle line:84%
That all around
the world issue was

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:33.309 align:middle line:84%
added to the language
1,000 years later.

00:09:33.309 --> 00:09:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It made a great story.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: It made
a great story, yeah.

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.130 align:middle line:84%
But it clearly wasn't
every animal in the world.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.010 align:middle line:84%
How would every
animal in the world

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:43.329 align:middle line:84%
get from other
parts of the world--

00:09:43.329 --> 00:09:44.370 align:middle line:90%
they had to cross oceans.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:47.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, elephants would have
to swim over oceans and things

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.720 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.487 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of animals that
have very special diet

00:09:51.487 --> 00:09:53.320 align:middle line:84%
only in the part of the
world that they live

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.250 align:middle line:84%
would have to bring
on their back enough

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:56.870 align:middle line:90%
for a five-year journey.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.200 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make sense.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.190 align:middle line:84%
But when you think in terms
of the original translation

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:04.400 align:middle line:84%
that those were Noah's
domestic animals,

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.450 align:middle line:84%
which would require a pretty big
ark for that, and a pretty good

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:08.774 align:middle line:90%
crew, by the way.

00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what about
forewarning, the forewarning

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.120 align:middle line:84%
we're told that
God talked to Noah

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.560 align:middle line:84%
and gave him time
to build this ark?

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.201 align:middle line:90%
I mean it wasn't built in a day.

00:10:17.201 --> 00:10:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, it
wasn't built in a day,

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.040 align:middle line:84%
and, of course, in
our documentaries,

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.290 align:middle line:84%
we don't go into the theological
side of God speaking to Noah.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:28.980 align:middle line:84%
All we are dealing with is that
Noah or somebody built an ark,

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:33.000 align:middle line:84%
and it was so long and so wide
and made out of this substance.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And this was the
design and so forth.

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, why would
anybody build an ark

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.350 align:middle line:84%
to survive a flood
if they didn't

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.590 align:middle line:84%
have some premonition
at least or instruction?

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:45.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: A dream, perhaps,
or a message from God--

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.080 align:middle line:90%
I won't go there.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:49.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or ETs?

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:50.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Or ETs.

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:51.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:52.035 align:middle line:90%
But Noah--

00:10:52.035 --> 00:10:53.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The ETs
would know there

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:56.730 align:middle line:84%
was a planetary object
heading our way that was going

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.044 align:middle line:90%
to do some profound things.

00:10:58.044 --> 00:10:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: And there's
a lot of evidence

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:04.860 align:middle line:84%
that the earliest men on
Earth really didn't spring

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.400 align:middle line:90%
from the slime of the Earth.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.050 align:middle line:84%
That's a controversial
issue in itself.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:09.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All by itself.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.594 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: By itself.

00:11:10.594 --> 00:11:15.060 align:middle line:10%
But Sumer was the first
civilization on Earth,

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.554 align:middle line:10%
and it's full blown.

00:11:16.554 --> 00:11:18.220 align:middle line:10%
It shows up in the
middle of the desert,

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.810 align:middle line:10%
full blown civilization.

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:23.080 align:middle line:84%
There's no record
that it started

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.620 align:middle line:84%
thousands of years ago in a
primitive form and evolved.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were just there.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.778 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: All of a sudden it
was there with music and math

00:11:28.778 --> 00:11:33.250 align:middle line:84%
and history and language
and everything, clothing.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:36.510 align:middle line:84%
It was a fully developed
transplanted civilization,

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:40.660 align:middle line:84%
so it's a possibility, at least,
that the origin of human life

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.630 align:middle line:90%
is not from the Earth itself.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some claim
that they have found Mt.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:48.690 align:middle line:90%
Ararat and Noah's ark.

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:49.650 align:middle line:90%
Have they?

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:50.000 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIFFIN: Well--

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.930 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Do we have
pictures from space?

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:55.280 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIFFIN: I believe that the
evidence, the hard evidence

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.420 align:middle line:10%
that you can touch, measure,
put a Geiger counter over it

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:03.250 align:middle line:10%
to see what's in the rock and
so forth-- that kind of evidence

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:07.900 align:middle line:10%
shows that they found a fossil
that remarkably resembles

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.690 align:middle line:10%
the ark 17 miles away from Mt.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Ararat on the slopes
that lead up to it.

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.879 align:middle line:84%
It's about the
7,000-foot elevation.

00:12:16.879 --> 00:12:18.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are those some
of the old pictures

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.060 align:middle line:84%
we've all seen, where
people are hovering

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:24.670 align:middle line:84%
around what looks like an
ark, or is this different?

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, I
think this is different.

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:31.425 align:middle line:84%
The fossil that we're talking
about-- actually, from the air

00:12:31.425 --> 00:12:34.530 align:middle line:84%
is how it was discovered
by a cartographer taking

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.490 align:middle line:84%
pictures of the air mapping
that area of Turkey.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:40.860 align:middle line:84%
They saw this boat-shaped
thing in a crevice.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.950 align:middle line:84%
What is this perfect
boat-shaped thing?

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.370 align:middle line:84%
So they'll send a team
of explorers down there,

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:48.115 align:middle line:84%
and they found this
massive artifact, this--

00:12:48.115 --> 00:12:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it still there?

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Oh, it's
still there, yeah.

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:52.539 align:middle line:84%
In fact, our documentary
showed these guys

00:12:52.539 --> 00:12:54.080 align:middle line:84%
climbing around with
Geiger counters.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.413 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it wood-- petrified?

00:12:55.413 --> 00:12:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: No, it's
all petrified stone.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.090 align:middle line:10%
Any wood that was in it is--

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:00.339 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But it once was wood.

00:13:00.339 --> 00:13:02.250 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIFFIN: There was
a lot of wood in it,

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:04.784 align:middle line:10%
but it was not made
of wood, apparently.

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:06.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean the main structures
might have been supported

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:11.150 align:middle line:84%
by wood beams, and
interestingly enough, there's

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:14.630 align:middle line:84%
relics of iron fittings where
they joined the beams together,

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:18.080 align:middle line:84%
crude iron, but
nevertheless, iron.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.900 align:middle line:84%
But when it came to
the structure itself,

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:24.429 align:middle line:84%
on the outside, it appears
to be made of reeds.

00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's a good reason
for that, it turns out.

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:28.950 align:middle line:84%
We had-- there was
a guy, Sam Windsor,

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:32.550 align:middle line:90%
who is a designer of boats.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:34.970 align:middle line:84%
He's a boat architect,
and he explains

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:39.200 align:middle line:84%
that a wooden structure
of that length

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.500 align:middle line:84%
would not have withheld
the seas because

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.610 align:middle line:84%
of what they call
hogging and stressing

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.820 align:middle line:90%
when the waves go like this.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.100 align:middle line:10%
If the boat's too long,
it hangs over the edge

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.450 align:middle line:10%
of one of those big
waves, and it sags.

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And then the wave
moves this, and it

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:54.650 align:middle line:90%
does it hogging and stressing.

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:55.450 align:middle line:90%
It snaps.

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:57.160 align:middle line:10%
It breaks apart.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.280 align:middle line:84%
So a wooden ship can't
exist that long as it was.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.880 align:middle line:84%
But a reed ship made of
reeds is very flexible.

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.070 align:middle line:84%
It's like rope, and
that's what it was.

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:07.145 align:middle line:90%
They find the fossil--

00:14:07.145 --> 00:14:08.436 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It bends with the sea.

00:14:08.436 --> 00:14:10.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: It bends
with the sea, yeah.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.710 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of ideas
of Noah's ark have

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:16.829 align:middle line:84%
to be revised when you look
at the hard fossil evidence.

00:14:16.829 --> 00:14:17.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:19.860 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you what's
exciting about this.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.587 align:middle line:84%
If it's there, and
you believe it is.

00:14:21.587 --> 00:14:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: I believe it is, yes.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.076 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That tells me--

00:14:24.076 --> 00:14:25.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: May I interrupt?

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.050 align:middle line:84%
If it's not Noah's ark,
it's somebody's ark.

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:27.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's somebody's ark.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.081 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: It's
somebody's ark, yeah.

00:14:29.081 --> 00:14:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It tells you that the
story had some truth to it.

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:35.640 align:middle line:84%
And what is so
fascinating to me yet

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.680 align:middle line:84%
is that if that
story is accurate,

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:42.620 align:middle line:84%
and that ark is there,
and it's in the Bible,

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:47.050 align:middle line:84%
then what else in the Bible
is real and accurate as well?

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:51.180 align:middle line:84%
So when you read Genesis and all
these other incredible stories

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:55.350 align:middle line:84%
of fallen angels
and visitations,

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:57.890 align:middle line:84%
other than
interpretation, symbolism

00:14:57.890 --> 00:14:59.930 align:middle line:84%
of what really
happened, you've got

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:03.170 align:middle line:84%
to assume if the
ark story is real,

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.640 align:middle line:84%
then the rest of
the Bible is real.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.561 align:middle line:84%
And that makes it the
greatest book of all times.

00:15:09.561 --> 00:15:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, it's certainly
a compelling argument.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think anybody
that wants to put down

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:19.030 align:middle line:84%
the Old Testament in particular,
because it's all myth,

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:22.140 align:middle line:84%
has got a real
awakening coming when

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:27.020 align:middle line:84%
they go looking at the, now, the
latest archaeological evidence

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.400 align:middle line:90%
to support those old stories.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.140 align:middle line:90%
These battles really took place.

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:33.100 align:middle line:84%
These people really existed
like Gilgamesh, for example.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:33.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: He really existed.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:35.880 align:middle line:90%
Now we know.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.600 align:middle line:90%
He was not a mythological king.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.600 align:middle line:10%
We know he really did
accomplish at least some

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.970 align:middle line:10%
of the conquests
and achievements

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:45.450 align:middle line:10%
that they say he did.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:46.980 align:middle line:90%
So you can't discount it.

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Now it's true that over the
centuries, over the millennia,

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:54.220 align:middle line:84%
really, these stories
have been told and retold,

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.460 align:middle line:84%
and you have to have your
mind open that each time it's

00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.760 align:middle line:84%
retold, maybe it's flavored
a little bit and changed.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.720 align:middle line:84%
We know that that's the
case, because if you

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:06.100 align:middle line:84%
take a modern translation
of these old books,

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:10.280 align:middle line:84%
and you go back and compare them
with the original translations,

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.340 align:middle line:90%
there's sometimes a difference.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to keep
that open in your mind.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.520 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, to cut
to the chase, it

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.580 align:middle line:84%
turns out that I believe
the story of Noah's ark

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:23.040 align:middle line:84%
is based on actual
historic fact.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.162 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And why isn't real
science following up on that?

00:16:26.162 --> 00:16:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, they--

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a discovery.

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: I think real
science has a subconscious

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.960 align:middle line:90%
war against theology.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.242 align:middle line:90%
I don't see why.

00:16:35.242 --> 00:16:36.700 align:middle line:84%
I think that theology
and science--

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a
scientific discovery.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.033 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: --support each other.

00:16:39.033 --> 00:16:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:42.341 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: I don't see it
that way, but a lot of people

00:16:42.341 --> 00:16:44.930 align:middle line:84%
think that if you
accept anything that's

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:48.240 align:middle line:84%
written in the Old Testament
to be accurate, therefore,

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:52.420 align:middle line:84%
you are a Bible thumping
evangelist or something

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:53.220 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And the two don't
go together at all.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.260 align:middle line:90%
They don't have to.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:58.540 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they do.

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:00.700 align:middle line:84%
But when I approach
this topic, I

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.130 align:middle line:84%
decided to take it strictly
from the point of view

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:05.569 align:middle line:90%
of a geological discovery.

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:07.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's see what the
Earth record shows.

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.050 align:middle line:90%
What's the historic record?

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And leave the
theology to others.

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:11.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Perfect.

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:15.900 align:middle line:84%
You have done a lot of work
into the JFK assassination.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:19.750 align:middle line:84%
I was 13 years old when my
English teacher, Miss Leonard,

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:24.710 align:middle line:84%
whom I just found on Facebook,
which is a treat all by itself,

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.220 align:middle line:90%
came into our school crying.

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:28.510 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knew what was going on.

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:31.490 align:middle line:84%
My god, we're 13-year-old
kids-- and said,

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:34.010 align:middle line:90%
"The president has been shot."

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't
comprehend it then.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:37.320 align:middle line:90%
We didn't understand it.

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:40.230 align:middle line:84%
But the question is,
of course, everybody

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:46.710 align:middle line:84%
remembers where they were
on November 22, 1963.

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:47.510 align:middle line:90%

-From Dallas, Texas, the
flash, apparently official,

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:55.730 align:middle line:84%
President Kennedy died at
1:00 PM Central Standard

00:17:55.730 --> 00:18:01.450 align:middle line:84%
Time, 2 o'clock Eastern Standard
Time, some 38 minutes ago.

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:07.230 align:middle line:90%


00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Vice President
Lyndon Johnson has

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:12.070 align:middle line:84%
left the hospital in
Dallas, but we do not

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:15.370 align:middle line:90%
know to where he has proceeded.

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Presumably, he will be taking
the oath of office shortly

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:23.755 align:middle line:84%
and become the 36th president
of the United States.

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was an
emotional time period for us.

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:33.190 align:middle line:84%
Still is, but seeing
Walter Cronkite break up

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:38.130 align:middle line:84%
that way-- I mean, the guy
never broke up over anything.

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:40.660 align:middle line:84%
This got to him, and
I don't think we've

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.070 align:middle line:90%
ever been the same since ever.

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:47.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: No, it has changed
the course of American history.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.640 align:middle line:90%
No question about that.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many issues that
come together in that story.

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.120 align:middle line:90%
Everyone was shocked.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.190 align:middle line:84%
Even I think
Kennedy's opponent's,

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:02.730 align:middle line:90%
political opponents, grieved.

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:06.470 align:middle line:84%
It was not just a
personal tragedy so much

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:07.980 align:middle line:90%
as it was a national tragedy.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.440 align:middle line:84%
It was a blow against
America, what we believe,

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.222 align:middle line:90%
our system, and everything.

00:19:13.222 --> 00:19:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Everybody was
affected by it, and I

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.950 align:middle line:84%
think everyone I've
ever run into today

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:20.170 align:middle line:84%
that was alive at that time can
tell you what they were doing

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:21.214 align:middle line:90%
when they heard the news.

00:19:21.214 --> 00:19:22.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
five years later, they

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:29.440 align:middle line:84%
killed his brother, Bobby,
which is unbelievable.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.960 align:middle line:10%
As we look at the
JFK assassination,

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.120 align:middle line:10%
tell me your approach.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.070 align:middle line:84%
What were you looking
for in your work?

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:38.780 align:middle line:90%


00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, I'm trying
to rewind the tape now

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.836 align:middle line:90%
in my memory to that moment.

00:19:42.836 --> 00:19:45.490 align:middle line:90%


00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:47.990 align:middle line:84%
I think the most
clear recollection

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:51.860 align:middle line:84%
is one of just being stunned,
not knowing what to make of it.

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:56.610 align:middle line:84%
I had no inkling at all at that
time that parts of the story

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:58.140 align:middle line:90%
might not be accurate.

00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.495 align:middle line:90%
I just took it at face value.

00:19:59.495 --> 00:19:59.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everybody did.

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:00.991 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Everybody did.

00:20:00.991 --> 00:20:02.050 align:middle line:90%
How else could you not--

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:04.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If they said Oswald
did it, we believed it.

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Absolutely.

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And it took quite awhile
after these facts of the story

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.290 align:middle line:84%
began to come in slowly
that some of the pieces

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:17.470 align:middle line:90%
didn't seem to fit together.

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:19.170 align:middle line:84%
The Oswald story,
in particular--

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:23.840 align:middle line:84%
I began to learn that Oswald
probably wasn't the shooter.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And that was an outrageous
conclusion, or suspicion,

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.310 align:middle line:84%
I might add, to
make at the time.

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:32.530 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:33.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Almost unpatriotic.

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:34.718 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Unpatriotic.

00:20:34.718 --> 00:20:37.340 align:middle line:84%
To question the official
story was unpatriotic.

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And it put anyone, such as
myself who was entertaining

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.600 align:middle line:84%
that possibility at
least, it put them

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.970 align:middle line:84%
in the category of being
tinfoil hat people.

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:50.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Conspiracy theorists
and all, that sort of thing.

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:52.390 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And dangerous
to society in some cases.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:55.730 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIFFIN: Dangerous to society
to question the official story.

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:59.020 align:middle line:10%
Well, I've been used to
questioning the officials'

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.880 align:middle line:10%
story for quite awhile.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And it just-- I don't consider
myself to be the world's expert

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.840 align:middle line:84%
by a long shot, but it
was clear after awhile

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:13.039 align:middle line:84%
that it looked to me like
Oswald didn't shoot Kennedy,

00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:14.830 align:middle line:84%
and that there was a
big cover-up going on.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:15.950 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't understand.

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:18.190 align:middle line:84%
I still don't
understand all of it,

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:24.540 align:middle line:84%
except I'm convinced that the
official story was a cover-up.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.760 align:middle line:84%
I guess that's the--
you start with that.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And isn't that shocking enough
that an official story put up

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:34.150 align:middle line:84%
by your government, the Warren
Commission story on this,

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:38.000 align:middle line:84%
was a cover-up of an event
of such tragic and huge

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.350 align:middle line:90%
proportions?

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:41.940 align:middle line:84%
That in itself, I
think, is enough.

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:45.440 align:middle line:84%
It shocks one's confidence
in the real world.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.660 align:middle line:84%
You think we're living in
a society that is real,

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.330 align:middle line:84%
and it protects us, and we
understand where we stand.

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And yet if something of that
magnitude can be covered up,

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:58.030 align:middle line:84%
and the truth is
withheld from the people,

00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:59.340 align:middle line:90%
it takes away your confidence.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.802 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, it destroys it.

00:22:00.802 --> 00:22:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Destroys it.

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have concluded
after my years of research

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.900 align:middle line:84%
into this that there
were a number of groups

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:13.650 align:middle line:84%
that wanted Kennedy killed-- the
mob, the CIA, other entities.

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:15.195 align:middle line:84%
They all got together
and said, we've

00:22:15.195 --> 00:22:16.320 align:middle line:90%
got to get rid of this guy.

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.170 align:middle line:10%
I mean he wanted to do away
with the Federal Reserve.

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:23.840 align:middle line:10%
So you had a lot of people who
hated his guts, hated his guts,

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.280 align:middle line:10%
including Lyndon Johnson,
his vice president.

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.220 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIFFIN: Absolutely.

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.136 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That selection
came only because they

00:22:29.136 --> 00:22:31.610 align:middle line:10%
needed Texas in the election.

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And so you had this group of
people that wanted him out,

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:39.230 align:middle line:84%
and I do think the conspiracy
began with the plan

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:42.220 align:middle line:84%
that they would-- they
had to find the villain,

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.590 align:middle line:90%
and the villain was Oswald.

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And they picked
him out of nowhere.

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:47.520 align:middle line:90%
They tracked him.

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.940 align:middle line:90%
They got him to Russia.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:50.990 align:middle line:90%
They got him all over the place.

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And Oswald was part of a group--
there's no doubt in my mind--

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:56.790 align:middle line:90%
but he wasn't the shooter.

00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:00.120 align:middle line:84%
He was, as he always
said, the Patsy.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.720 align:middle line:90%
He was told to be there.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.790 align:middle line:84%
He was in the school book
depository, where he worked.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:07.780 align:middle line:84%
While the whole
conspiracy was going on,

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:10.080 align:middle line:90%
I think he was oblivious to it.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.750 align:middle line:84%
He was walking around after the
shooting like, what's going on?

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:14.720 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.200 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know
what was happening.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And then the tie-in with Jack
Ruby killing Oswald and all

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.580 align:middle line:90%
that-- it was just too much.

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:24.780 align:middle line:84%
So even at that young
age, I concluded

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:28.220 align:middle line:84%
that they killed this guy,
because they needed him out

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:29.970 align:middle line:90%
of the picture for some reason.

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:32.340 align:middle line:90%
I still don't know why.

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:34.690 align:middle line:84%
But they got together and
did it and got rid of him,

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:39.456 align:middle line:84%
and it was the biggest coup
this country has ever seen.

00:23:39.456 --> 00:23:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: I agree
with that appraisal,

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:45.150 align:middle line:84%
and fortunately, it's not
as controversial today

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:48.130 align:middle line:84%
as it was five, six,
seven years ago.

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:49.029 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:23:49.029 --> 00:23:50.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or 20 years ago.

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:51.278 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Or 20 years, yeah.

00:23:51.278 --> 00:23:54.140 align:middle line:84%
The further back you go, the
more outrageous it becomes.

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:57.500 align:middle line:84%
But with the passage of
time and with the revelation

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:00.510 align:middle line:84%
of more facts, it becomes a
highly plausible scenario,

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:01.640 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, I don't run
into too much criticism

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:10.630 align:middle line:84%
today from people who think that
that's an absurd theory at all.

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:13.002 align:middle line:90%
The evidence is so strong.

00:24:13.002 --> 00:24:14.210 align:middle line:90%
So where do you go with that?

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:16.600 align:middle line:84%
You just have to walk out
the door and say, hey,

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:21.870 align:middle line:84%
this is not a real world that
I thought I was living in.

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:23.966 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot going
on behind the scenes.

00:24:23.966 --> 00:24:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And once you get to
that point, and you

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:middle line:84%
start questioning authority,
which is almost a mortal sin

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:33.590 align:middle line:84%
today to question authority,
it's very unnerving.

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:36.559 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
you feel like-- I

00:24:36.559 --> 00:24:38.850 align:middle line:84%
don't know how to phrase
this, except that something is

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:39.650 align:middle line:90%
very urgent.

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:42.530 align:middle line:84%
We have to do something
to restore our system,

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:46.360 align:middle line:84%
because if we don't, our
children and our grandchildren

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.280 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even us--
we're not going

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.290 align:middle line:84%
to like the system that
we're heading into.

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:52.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They want us to
think that we're free.

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:54.750 align:middle line:84%
They want us to
have the perception,

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:57.890 align:middle line:84%
because we can go out
and buy the car we want

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:01.390 align:middle line:84%
or pick the house we want
that there's freedom here,

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:04.530 align:middle line:84%
or pick the politician
we want, when

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:07.460 align:middle line:84%
they hand pick it for us
and say, these are the ones

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:11.070 align:middle line:84%
that you're going
to be voting on.

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a difficult
situation, I think,

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:17.000 align:middle line:84%
for most people to
comprehend that we don't have

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.970 align:middle line:90%
the freedoms we think we have.

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:20.650 align:middle line:90%
We really don't.

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: No, we don't.

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And the question is, what
are we going to do about it?

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:27.270 align:middle line:84%
We can either sit around and
say, hm, look what happened.

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:28.740 align:middle line:90%
We finally figured it out.

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:31.590 align:middle line:90%
We're living in a dream world.

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:34.320 align:middle line:90%
We've taken the blue pill.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.580 align:middle line:90%
And now, what do we do?

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:38.080 align:middle line:90%
Do we take the red pill?

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.920 align:middle line:84%
Or do we just say we
don't want to know.

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.600 align:middle line:10%
And people more
and more are having

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.480 align:middle line:10%
to take that choice today.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:49.020 align:middle line:10%
And if I had to give advice
to anybody, if they ever

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:52.450 align:middle line:10%
asked me my advice, I'd
say, take that red pill,

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:54.414 align:middle line:10%
because things are not
what you think they are.

00:25:54.414 --> 00:25:55.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Take it fast.

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Take it fast, because
we still have time to recover.

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:01.595 align:middle line:84%
We still have time to move
on to a wonderful future.

00:26:01.595 --> 00:26:02.970 align:middle line:84%
But if we don't
move pretty soon,

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:05.910 align:middle line:84%
I think our options would
be eliminated, perhaps,

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:07.920 align:middle line:90%
for a very, very long time.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you've also
dealt with other topics,

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:12.000 align:middle line:90%
including, of course, cancer.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.584 align:middle line:90%

One out of four of us will
develop cancer in our lifetime.

That's over 50 million people

The purpose of this
presentation is

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:33.310 align:middle line:10%
to show that this
great human tragedy can

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:36.910 align:middle line:10%
be stopped now entirely
on the basis of existing

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:39.210 align:middle line:10%
scientific knowledge.

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:41.350 align:middle line:84%
We'll explore the
theory that cancer,

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:45.580 align:middle line:84%
like scurvy or pellagra, is a
deficiency disease, aggravated

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:50.190 align:middle line:84%
by the lack of an essential food
compound in modern man's diet,

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:53.310 align:middle line:84%
and that its ultimate
control is to be found simply

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:57.326 align:middle line:84%
in restoring this substance
to our daily intake.

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:18.010 align:middle line:10%
Incredible to look at
that and put my mind back

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:22.630 align:middle line:10%
to the types of production we
had available at that time.

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:25.790 align:middle line:84%
That was a filmstrip, a
lot of single pictures.

And when that was
made originally,

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.132 align:middle line:90%

>>GRIFFIN: Well,
nutrition has everything

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:51.990 align:middle line:84%
to do with fighting
cancer in my view.

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And that was the theme, one
of the themes of this story.

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And that is that cancer is a
breakdown of a natural process

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:01.620 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't happen if you
have all of the micronutrients

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:03.790 align:middle line:84%
that the body is
supposed to have.

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
you're developing cancer

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:09.430 align:middle line:84%
is because you're missing
some of these micronutrients

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:11.540 align:middle line:84%
that a primitive
person would have,

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.830 align:middle line:84%
but modern man is not
getting, because it

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:15.760 align:middle line:90%
is refined food supply.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:18.200 align:middle line:90%
It's as simple as that.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Modern medicine today
is talking about stem cells

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:24.380 align:middle line:84%
to prevent cancer and different
areas, different kinds

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:28.200 align:middle line:84%
of therapies, yet
they still seem

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.550 align:middle line:84%
to miss the mark when
it has to do with how

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:33.260 align:middle line:90%
to take care of yourself.

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Cayce, the late
American prophet,

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:41.540 align:middle line:84%
once said, if you eat
three raw almonds a day,

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.780 align:middle line:90%
it'll prevent cancer.

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:45.040 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.980 align:middle line:84%
I have always done
that ever since that,

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:52.410 align:middle line:84%
because I'm a believer in Cayce
and his therapeutic trances.

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:56.610 align:middle line:84%
But to eat three almonds a day
is because of the substance

00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:57.410 align:middle line:90%
in the almonds.

00:28:57.410 --> 00:28:58.493 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:28:58.493 --> 00:29:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, I think
it depends on what almonds.

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:04.270 align:middle line:84%
Now when Cayce
wrote that, almonds

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:06.690 align:middle line:90%
were all better almonds.

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:08.240 align:middle line:84%
So an almond was
a bitter almond.

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.320 align:middle line:84%
Today you can't buy a
bitter almond in the store.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.360 align:middle line:10%
If you take that advice today--

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.410 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Nobody would eat
one anyway, would they?

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:17.700 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIFFIN: Well,
that's the whole point.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:20.170 align:middle line:10%
The substance that
we believe is one

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:24.240 align:middle line:10%
of the most active
anti-cancer natural substances

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.650 align:middle line:10%
that you could take
is called amygdalin,

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:31.240 align:middle line:10%
and it's found in
bitter almonds, seeds.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.960 align:middle line:90%
It's found in apricot seeds.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.570 align:middle line:90%
It's found an apple seeds.

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:38.190 align:middle line:84%
It's found in about
1,400 edible plants,

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:41.050 align:middle line:84%
but modern man doesn't
eat any of them,

00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:43.270 align:middle line:84%
because it's bitter
to the taste.

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:45.180 align:middle line:90%
P-pew, we don't want that.

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:47.510 align:middle line:10%
So we get rid of the
very thing that the body

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:50.870 align:middle line:10%
needs to maintain this
balance and to prevent--

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:51.670 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Amygdalin.

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:52.570 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIFFIN: Amygdalin.

00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And so the almond
seed originally

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:58.390 align:middle line:84%
was loaded with
amygdalin, but today

00:29:58.390 --> 00:29:59.990 align:middle line:84%
if you go down and
buy almond seeds,

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:01.724 align:middle line:90%
you'll find they're sweet.

00:30:01.724 --> 00:30:03.140 align:middle line:84%
They've all been
grafted, hybrids.

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's no
amygdalin in the almonds?

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: There's
no amygdalin in them.

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:07.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So I'm not getting
any benefit from it?

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:09.068 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Not if you're
buying a sweet almond.

00:30:09.068 --> 00:30:10.870 align:middle line:10%
It has to taste really
bitter before you're

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:11.670 align:middle line:10%
getting enough to--

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:12.970 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Where do you
get bitter almonds?

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:14.310 align:middle line:10%
I want to know this for myself.

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, you
can plant a tree,

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.850 align:middle line:84%
but better, go out and
buy some apricot seeds.

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:19.651 align:middle line:10%
Same thing.

00:30:19.651 --> 00:30:20.483 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same thing.

00:30:20.483 --> 00:30:21.400 align:middle line:90%
You just chew them up?

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Chew them up, yeah.

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:23.983 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's laetrile, right?

00:30:23.983 --> 00:30:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, that's the name
they give for amygdalin when

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:30.100 align:middle line:90%
it's purified and concentrated.

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.070 align:middle line:90%
Then they call it laetrile.

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:35.320 align:middle line:84%
But in its natural
form, it's amygdalin.

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And where do
you get apricot seeds?

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:38.560 align:middle line:90%
Health food stores?

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well,
you can buy them

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.364 align:middle line:90%
in many health food stores.

00:30:40.364 --> 00:30:43.150 align:middle line:84%
You can buy them
online on the internet.

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:46.870 align:middle line:10%
You can grow them in your
own backyard if you want to.

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:49.460 align:middle line:84%
You have to get a hammer and
break open that hard pit.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't buy
bitter almonds anymore?

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:52.985 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: I don't
think you can.

00:30:52.985 --> 00:30:53.860 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:55.260 align:middle line:90%
They're not very common.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:57.030 align:middle line:10%
There's not much of
a market for them.

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:59.488 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you think that's
what Cayce was talking about.

00:30:59.488 --> 00:31:00.947 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: I'm sure it was.

00:31:00.947 --> 00:31:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's good to know that.

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.654 align:middle line:90%
See, I just learned something.

00:31:03.654 --> 00:31:05.320 align:middle line:84%
I've been taking all
these almonds for--

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:05.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Eat an apricot.

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:07.850 align:middle line:84%
Eat an apricot or
three of them a day,

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:10.550 align:middle line:84%
and you'll be getting the same
thing of what you'd be getting

00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:12.090 align:middle line:90%
from three bitter almond seeds.

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:12.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ha.

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:14.880 align:middle line:84%
Now the seed is
within the hard shell.

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:15.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Exactly.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:16.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:16.970 align:middle line:90%
You don't want that pit.

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:17.690 align:middle line:90%
It'll break your teeth.

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:19.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, you can't eat
the-- can't chew the pit.

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:22.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Not well.

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As you look at
cancer research today,

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:29.100 align:middle line:84%
do you think we'll
truly find that cure?

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:32.240 align:middle line:84%
Or are they going to
suppress that on us?

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.257 align:middle line:90%
Make a lot of money.

00:31:33.257 --> 00:31:34.090 align:middle line:90%
Make a lot of money.

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:35.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: We already have--
we already know the cure.

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.450 align:middle line:90%
That's the whole point of this.

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:39.510 align:middle line:90%
It's not that they'll find it.

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:41.060 align:middle line:90%
In a way, yes.

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:46.260 align:middle line:84%
In a way, the question has
merit, because in the 1970s,

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:51.110 align:middle line:84%
Sloan Kettering did some testing
on laetrile or amygdalin,

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:55.192 align:middle line:84%
and they came up with some
very favorable results.

00:31:55.192 --> 00:31:56.650 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
their initial tests

00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:59.560 align:middle line:84%
showed that it was
an anti-cancer agent

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:00.950 align:middle line:90%
like they've never seen before.

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:05.460 align:middle line:10%
So they got rid of Dr. Sugiura,
who was the chief researcher,

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:07.060 align:middle line:10%
and got some other
guys in there,

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:10.127 align:middle line:10%
and redid the experiment
until they made it fail.

00:32:10.127 --> 00:32:11.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They wanted it to fail.

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:13.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: They did not
want a positive result, no.

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't
patent an apricot seed.

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:17.400 align:middle line:90%
You can't make any money on it.

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't
make any money.

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: And the
pharmaceutical industry

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:22.630 align:middle line:84%
is not there to--
I hate to say it--

00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:24.394 align:middle line:84%
but they're not there
to cure diseases.

00:32:24.394 --> 00:32:25.560 align:middle line:90%
They're there to sell drugs.

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why doesn't a
smart pharmaceutical company

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:29.769 align:middle line:84%
do a synthetic
version of amygdalin?

00:32:29.769 --> 00:32:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, that's
the point I'm leading to.

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:35.160 align:middle line:84%
The minutes of the meeting
of the board of directors

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.400 align:middle line:84%
of the Sloan Kettering group
that did that research-- this

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:42.300 align:middle line:84%
was found through a
Freedom of Information Act

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:43.510 align:middle line:90%
by a congressman.

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And the minutes of
the meeting said,

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Sloan Kettering is not
interested in researching

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:53.970 align:middle line:84%
amygdalin, but we would be
very interested in researching

00:32:53.970 --> 00:32:59.620 align:middle line:84%
cyanide-bearing substances,
such as amygdalin,

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:01.330 align:middle line:90%
that we could patent.

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:02.240 align:middle line:90%
And there you had it.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:02.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And make a lot of
money doing that.

00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:05.553 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Yeah, if
you can patent it,

00:33:05.553 --> 00:33:07.030 align:middle line:90%
you can make money on it.

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:07.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting stuff.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: And that's really--
that's the tragic foundation

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.630 align:middle line:90%
of our medical system today.

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:16.040 align:middle line:84%
Cure is not as
important as profit.

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's always
been that way, Ed.

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:21.174 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: I hate to think
it, but it probably has.

00:33:21.174 --> 00:33:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can that
ever be changed?

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:23.830 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, I
think it can be changed

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:24.845 align:middle line:10%
with public understanding.

00:33:24.845 --> 00:33:25.450 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What would change that?

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:27.030 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIFFIN: I think it's
being changed right now,

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:29.970 align:middle line:10%
because there's a large movement
around the world, where people

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:33.880 align:middle line:10%
are seeking natural
cures, natural therapies.

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:38.090 align:middle line:84%
They're rejecting
toxic chemicals.

00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is a much
stronger movement

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:45.534 align:middle line:84%
now than in 1974, when I
first did work on that.

00:33:45.534 --> 00:33:46.950 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's a
powerful movement.

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:50.520 align:middle line:84%
Now we have health food
stores on every block.

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:53.140 align:middle line:84%
In those days, I never heard
of a health food store.

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:54.390 align:middle line:90%
It didn't exist.

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:57.810 align:middle line:84%
So there's a movement, and
I think it will be changed.

00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Cancer research is a
multi-billion dollar industry.

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:06.910 align:middle line:90%
Why do they want a cure?

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: They want a cure,
as long as they can keep it

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:10.720 align:middle line:90%
as a multi-billion industry.

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:11.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: And that's
the bottom line.

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:14.048 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If they can own it--

00:34:14.048 --> 00:34:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: If they can
own it, then we'll get it,

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:18.900 align:middle line:84%
and we'll have to have
it paid for by insurance,

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:19.984 align:middle line:84%
and it'll be very,
very expensive.

00:34:19.984 --> 00:34:22.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always wondered
like poor Jerry Lewis.

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:25.880 align:middle line:84%
Every year he'd do his telethon
before they kicked him out.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.120 align:middle line:84%
He'd raise a lot of
money, and we never

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:31.900 align:middle line:84%
got any closer to
finding a cure for MS.

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.610 align:middle line:90%
It's got to be frustrating.

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well,
it's unfortunate,

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:38.600 align:middle line:84%
but when you think about any of
these fundraising organizations

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.770 align:middle line:84%
that are raising
millions of dollars

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:44.219 align:middle line:84%
to find a cure for some
dreaded disease, what happens

00:34:44.219 --> 00:34:46.200 align:middle line:90%
to them when they find it?

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:47.199 align:middle line:10%
They're out of business.

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:47.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
out of business.

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:48.239 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Yeah.

00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:49.905 align:middle line:84%
So there's a conflict
of interest there.

00:34:49.905 --> 00:34:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you want a little
work into it, but not a lot.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: That's right.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.540 align:middle line:90%
Keep the money coming.

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:55.850 align:middle line:90%
We're getting close, folks.

00:34:55.850 --> 00:34:57.500 align:middle line:84%
We've got this
promising research.

00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:58.500 align:middle line:90%
Send us some more money.

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we'll break it
one of these day soon.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:02.410 align:middle line:90%
Keep the money coming.

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They just injected
some leukemia patients, who

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:12.110 align:middle line:84%
were on death's door with stem
cells, and 90% of them, 90%

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:13.150 align:middle line:90%
in remission.

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And they were on
death's door, Ed.

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.434 align:middle line:84%
That's a dramatic
possibility too, I think.

00:35:18.434 --> 00:35:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well,
you see, when you

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:22.190 align:middle line:84%
get into the science
of amygdalin,

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:25.440 align:middle line:84%
you find out that you are
dealing with the body's stem

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:30.160 align:middle line:84%
cells, and you're allowing the
body to produce its own stem

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.670 align:middle line:90%
cells to cure cancer.

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:35.220 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to take
it from some other animal

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:36.970 align:middle line:90%
or produce it in a laboratory.

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:41.100 align:middle line:84%
You treat your own body with
the natural elements it needs,

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.959 align:middle line:84%
and its own stem cells
move in and do the job.

00:35:43.959 --> 00:35:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do what
they have to do.

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:46.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Yeah.

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:48.060 align:middle line:84%
But there's no
money in that one.

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that what
the apricot seeds do?

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:50.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Basically.

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:50.940 align:middle line:90%
That's an oversimplification--

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:51.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jump start you.

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:53.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: That's an
oversimplification,

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:54.526 align:middle line:84%
but that's basically
what happens.

00:35:54.526 --> 00:35:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 40 years ago when you
did that documentary, 40 years

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:00.210 align:middle line:90%
ago, what got you to do it?

00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:02.616 align:middle line:90%
What did you see?

00:36:02.616 --> 00:36:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well,
like everything,

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:06.310 align:middle line:90%
George, it's not myself at all.

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:07.200 align:middle line:90%
I had a friend.

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.930 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend in those
days, Dr. John Richardson,

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:12.550 align:middle line:84%
who was an M.D. in the
San Francisco area,

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:15.790 align:middle line:84%
started using amygdalin in the
treatment of cancer patients,

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:18.750 align:middle line:84%
was having amazingly
positive success,

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:21.124 align:middle line:84%
and then got into trouble
with the Medical Association.

00:36:21.124 --> 00:36:22.665 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to take
his license away.

00:36:22.665 --> 00:36:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ah, he
was a quack, right?

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.003 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: He was a quack,
because he wasn't using

00:36:26.003 --> 00:36:27.659 align:middle line:90%
the approved chemotherapy.

00:36:27.659 --> 00:36:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And so he approached
me and said, Ed,

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:31.157 align:middle line:84%
I need some help in
telling my story.

00:36:31.157 --> 00:36:31.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:33.448 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: So I
was dragged into it

00:36:33.448 --> 00:36:35.590 align:middle line:84%
completely from the out--
I didn't know anything

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:36.790 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I was about to learn one
of the most important stories

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.830 align:middle line:90%
of my life.

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:43.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happened
to the doctor?

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, eventually,
they took his license.

00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:46.560 align:middle line:84%
They succeeded in getting
him out of his business.

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They destroyed him.

00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: They
destroyed him, uh-huh.

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:52.082 align:middle line:84%
And so that was one
of my motivations

00:36:52.082 --> 00:36:52.915 align:middle line:90%
to learn about this.

00:36:52.915 --> 00:36:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Lost his career.

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:55.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Pardon?

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:55.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He lost his career?

00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:57.411 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIFFIN: He lost
his license, yeah.

00:36:57.411 --> 00:37:01.880 align:middle line:84%
He went-- he practiced as a--
he got another license in I

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:03.200 align:middle line:90%
forgot what it was.

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.180 align:middle line:90%
It was homeopathy, perhaps.

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:07.600 align:middle line:84%
He was able to practice
for awhile in Las Vegas.

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:08.570 align:middle line:90%
He was OK there.

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:12.554 align:middle line:84%
He practiced for a
little while in Mexico.

00:37:12.554 --> 00:37:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he
do the same thing?

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: He did
the same thing, yeah.

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:17.820 align:middle line:84%
But basically, they
ruined his career.

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:18.730 align:middle line:90%
He a fine doctor.

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:19.617 align:middle line:90%
He was saving lives.

00:37:19.617 --> 00:37:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was he the one
who discovered this?

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: No.

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:27.500 align:middle line:84%
It was discovered by Dr. Ernst
T. Krebs and his son, Junior.

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And the father was an
M.D. The son was a PhD.

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:34.039 align:middle line:90%
And they just found it.

00:37:34.039 --> 00:37:35.580 align:middle line:84%
They were doing
experiments and found

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:38.831 align:middle line:84%
that this substance, which had
a tradition of being useful,

00:37:38.831 --> 00:37:40.330 align:middle line:84%
not only in the
treatment of cancer,

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:42.910 align:middle line:84%
but many other
diseases as well-- they

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:46.400 align:middle line:84%
began to experiment with it
and found that it worked.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't it amazing
that the cures for disease

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:54.290 align:middle line:84%
are on this planet-- you
just need to find them?

00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:55.815 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: That is
an amazing truth.

00:37:55.815 --> 00:37:57.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How does that work?

00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Yeah.

00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:02.250 align:middle line:84%
The diseases and their cures--
they come at the same time.

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:03.930 align:middle line:90%
We have access to both of them.

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:05.266 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The ying, the yang.

00:38:05.266 --> 00:38:06.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: The
ying and the yang.

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:09.480 align:middle line:84%
I found out in my
experience that if you just

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:12.470 align:middle line:84%
give nature a chance, you're
going to do pretty well.

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Not 100%, but a lot better
than if you go trying to find

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:19.030 align:middle line:84%
test tube cures
for your diseases.

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:22.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's an amazing
discovery, I think,

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:26.250 align:middle line:84%
of what was on this planet,
what is on this planet,

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:30.050 align:middle line:84%
but however it was made,
however your belief system, it's

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:31.420 align:middle line:90%
truly remarkable, isn't it?

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:32.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: It is.

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:38.710 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazing signal to me of
creation, design, intelligence.

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:40.240 align:middle line:84%
None of this could
be accidental.

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:44.202 align:middle line:84%
It has to be carefully
designed and built.

00:38:44.202 --> 00:38:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What else are you
working on these days, Ed?

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:47.784 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: I'm
building something

00:38:47.784 --> 00:38:50.230 align:middle line:84%
that I call Freedom
Force International.

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:54.980 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the most
common problems to all

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:57.860 align:middle line:84%
of our confrontations
in society is

00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:00.460 align:middle line:90%
our lack of freedom to choose.

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.669 align:middle line:84%
The growth of
government continues.

00:39:02.669 --> 00:39:04.710 align:middle line:84%
We've been talking about
the growth of government

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:06.560 align:middle line:90%
restrictions in health care.

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:07.880 align:middle line:90%
But it's everywhere.

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe
that if we're going

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:14.810 align:middle line:84%
to survive as free human beings
and healthy human beings,

00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:16.690 align:middle line:84%
we have to have
freedom to choose,

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:18.700 align:middle line:84%
and we better
tackle that problem,

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:22.330 align:middle line:84%
because it's the base of all of
the fronts against our freedom.

00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:25.020 align:middle line:84%
So Freedom Force International
is an organization

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:28.260 align:middle line:84%
that I created, and we're
tackling that problem.

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:30.864 align:middle line:84%
We now have members in
78 countries, I think.

00:39:30.864 --> 00:39:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Yeah, it's
amazing, because the world

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:35.320 align:middle line:90%
is facing this problem.

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And we want to restore
freedom of choice.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:41.810 align:middle line:10%
We want to get the government
off the backs of humans,

00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:44.660 align:middle line:10%
so they can pursue
their own best interests

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:47.320 align:middle line:10%
and take care of each other
through charitable means

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.027 align:middle line:10%
instead of compulsion,
and we think

00:39:49.027 --> 00:39:51.110 align:middle line:10%
there's a better world
that can be built that way.

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:53.320 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Ed, are we at
war with governments

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:56.130 align:middle line:10%
that want to control us?

00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Unfortunately,
it's the other way around.

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:02.340 align:middle line:84%
Individuals who want to
control us are at war with us,

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:06.150 align:middle line:84%
and up until now, recently,
we haven't fought back.

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:09.520 align:middle line:84%
We've just assumed that they
were there to take care of us,

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.480 align:middle line:84%
that they were there
for our best interests,

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:14.089 align:middle line:84%
and whatever the government
says, we should follow.

00:40:14.089 --> 00:40:15.380 align:middle line:90%
And so we've never fought back.

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:16.290 align:middle line:90%
We've never resisted.

00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:19.650 align:middle line:84%
We didn't realize that they,
in many cases, in many cases--

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:21.480 align:middle line:84%
not all-- we're our
enemy, because they

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:24.970 align:middle line:84%
wanted to take our liberty,
our freedom, and our property.

00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:26.810 align:middle line:84%
So now we're back to
Freedom Force again.

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:28.350 align:middle line:90%
We're changing all of that.

00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:32.410 align:middle line:84%
We do think there's a war
going on between two ideas.

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:35.650 align:middle line:84%
One idea is one of collectivism
where the human being

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:38.160 align:middle line:84%
is thought of like
a bee in a beehive

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.420 align:middle line:90%
or an ant in an anthill.

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:41.030 align:middle line:84%
They're all the
collective, and they

00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:42.930 align:middle line:90%
should serve the collective.

00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:46.470 align:middle line:84%
The other form was what we
used to have in America, which

00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:48.980 align:middle line:84%
is individualism, where the
whole purpose of the state

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:50.580 align:middle line:90%
was to protect the individual.

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
center of society.

00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:54.370 align:middle line:84%
We drifted away
from individualism

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:57.200 align:middle line:84%
to collectivism in
the last 200 years.

00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:00.744 align:middle line:84%
Now it's time to
move back and beyond.

00:41:00.744 --> 00:41:02.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I hope
you get that done.

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: We're working on it.

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:04.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a great project.

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:06.434 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: That's what Freedom
Force International is all

00:41:06.434 --> 00:41:07.530 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Quick
review-- Noah's ark--

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.900 align:middle line:90%
it's there, up there somewhere.

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:12.900 align:middle line:90%
You know where it is?

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:14.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: I know
exactly where it is.

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:16.210 align:middle line:84%
We've got pictures of it,
and we've got pictures--

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we see
it on Google Maps?

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:18.036 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: --people
walking around

00:41:18.036 --> 00:41:19.180 align:middle line:90%
with their metal detectors.

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:20.596 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we know
exactly where it is.

00:41:20.596 --> 00:41:22.330 align:middle line:90%
It's 17 miles away from Mt.

00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:23.590 align:middle line:90%
Ararat.

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:25.490 align:middle line:84%
It's at about the
7,000 foot elevation,

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:27.510 align:middle line:84%
and you can go
visit it if you can

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:29.850 align:middle line:84%
get past the Turkish
government and the war that's

00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:31.280 align:middle line:90%
going on in that area.

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.180 align:middle line:90%
But it's there.

00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:34.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And it measures
what the Bible says?

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:38.895 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Within an inch.

00:41:38.895 --> 00:41:39.770 align:middle line:90%
Can you believe that?

00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:40.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: If you use the
cubit, the Egyptian cubit,

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:47.170 align:middle line:84%
which is-- let's face it--
Moses was raised in Egypt.

00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And when he gives a
dimension of the cubits,

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:52.310 align:middle line:84%
he's not going to
use the Hebrew cubit,

00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:53.720 align:middle line:90%
even though he was a Hebrew.

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.510 align:middle line:84%
He's going to use the
one he learned in school.

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:58.450 align:middle line:90%
It's within an inch.

00:41:58.450 --> 00:41:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love it.

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:00.289 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: It's amazing.

00:42:00.289 --> 00:42:01.562 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And how high is it?

00:42:01.562 --> 00:42:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, it's
collapsed now, of course.

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:06.089 align:middle line:84%
Whatever superstructure might've
been on top has collapsed.

00:42:06.089 --> 00:42:07.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK, so it's collapsed.

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: So we see--

00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Within it?

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:10.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GRIFFIN: Probably.

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:13.330 align:middle line:84%
All of the reeds
and all of the wood

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:16.054 align:middle line:84%
have gone-- they've gone
to-- they've rotted.

00:42:16.054 --> 00:42:16.970 align:middle line:90%
They've gone to stone.

00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:18.053 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Like rotted away.

00:42:18.053 --> 00:42:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Yeah,
they've become stone.

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:21.950 align:middle line:90%
But you can find remnants.

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:24.830 align:middle line:84%
You can find remnants
of the metal joints.

00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:26.664 align:middle line:84%
We find them with
metal detectors.

00:42:26.664 --> 00:42:27.830 align:middle line:90%
You can see the shape of it.

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:29.288 align:middle line:10%
You could find a
moon pool that was

00:42:29.288 --> 00:42:30.940 align:middle line:10%
built into it that
allowed the water

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:32.480 align:middle line:10%
to come up and
down in the middle

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:35.670 align:middle line:10%
to act like a piston to pump
air up and down to ventilate

00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:36.470 align:middle line:10%
the structure.

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:41.540 align:middle line:10%
It's an amazing, amazing
craft, and it's there,

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:43.005 align:middle line:10%
and you can see it and walk it.

00:42:43.005 --> 00:42:43.805 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Excellent.

00:42:43.805 --> 00:42:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Ed, I want to thank you
for being on Beyond Belief.

00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Thanks
for inviting me.

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:48.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Amazing subjects
that you've handled.

00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:49.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GRIFFIN: Well, we
have a lot of fun.

00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:51.020 align:middle line:90%
It's exciting.

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:53.830 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So you look at the
Bible and the discussion

00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:55.970 align:middle line:10%
about Noah's ark-- it's there.

00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:59.810 align:middle line:84%
The JFK assassination-- you
know how we feel about that.

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And this fight for cancer
is critical as well.

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:06.301 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching Beyond Belief.
