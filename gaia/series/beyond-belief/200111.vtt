00:00:24.553 --> 00:00:26.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.840 align:middle line:10%
You're going to
enjoy this episode.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.690 align:middle line:10%
Jack Cary has better
paranormal investigator

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.480 align:middle line:10%
and cryptozoologist
for 25 years.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.050 align:middle line:84%
He's the founder of the
Paranormal Intelligence Agency

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.950 align:middle line:84%
and the director of
Crypto Four Corners.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And his new book,
Paranormal Planet, Jack

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.820 align:middle line:84%
presents his
unified field theory

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.390 align:middle line:84%
of paranormal activity, which
covers everything from missing

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.920 align:middle line:90%
people to cryptids.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.440 align:middle line:90%
Jack, welcome to the program.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>>JACK CARY: Thanks
a lot, George.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.560 align:middle line:90%
Looking forward to it.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: How did you
get started in this field?

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.240 align:middle line:10%
>>CARY: I had a lot of
really strange incidents

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.810 align:middle line:10%
occur to me as a child, and so
that kind of ignited a passion

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.780 align:middle line:10%
I've had since childhood,
all things mysterious.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.090 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Did the parents
help magnify that?

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.820 align:middle line:10%
>>CARY: Not a lot, but
the house we lived in did.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.300 align:middle line:10%
I lived in a haunted antebellum
mansion in southern Oklahoma.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.370 align:middle line:84%
This thing was built
prior to the Civil War.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of
those big pillars

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.410 align:middle line:90%
in the front and Magnolia trees.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.160 align:middle line:90%
Well it was haunted as can be.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And I've have seen shadow
people from a very early age.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.080 align:middle line:84%
There was a poltergeist
in the home that

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.510 align:middle line:84%
was fond of opening all
the kitchen cabinets

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.880 align:middle line:84%
and smashing all of
my mother's dishes.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you scared?

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.390 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: We would never hear
anything or see anything.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, as a child you're
like, wow, what is going on?

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
not scared anymore.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Not anymore, no.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.160 align:middle line:84%
Ghosts to me are not a mystery,
that's why I don't really

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.210 align:middle line:90%
do ghost investigations.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.660 align:middle line:84%
There's plenty of evidence
to show that they're real.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.120 align:middle line:84%
The real question is
how, when, and why

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.530 align:middle line:84%
did they get trapped
into that existence?

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what do they want?

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.580 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.130 align:middle line:84%
You know, a lot of
people assume they

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.139 align:middle line:90%
had some unfinished business.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.320 align:middle line:84%
That might just be something to
make us feel better at night.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Closure.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: There might just be
a mechanism by which they

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.670 align:middle line:90%
get stuck and can't get out.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.910 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting is
in most EVP sessions

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.980 align:middle line:84%
during these ghost
investigations,

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.110 align:middle line:90%
the entities ask for help.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Meaning they're
in distress of some kind,

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.418 align:middle line:90%
and yet no help is ever given.

00:02:34.418 --> 00:02:36.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe some of
them left too early.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yeah.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:37.200 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.242 align:middle line:84%
We don't really know the
source of that distress,

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:41.100 align:middle line:84%
but it comes across
time and again.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And yet the investigators don't
really help these entities.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.490 align:middle line:84%
They're left in a
state of distress.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.205 align:middle line:90%
But we know they're there.

00:02:49.205 --> 00:02:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your new book is
called Paranormal Planet.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.620 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: So it presents
my Unified Field

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.910 align:middle line:90%
Theory of Paranormal Activity.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.480 align:middle line:84%
It breaks all paranormal
activity into two branches--

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.130 align:middle line:84%
one branch is interaction
with a type 3 civilization.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.120 align:middle line:84%
That's something that a
Russian scientist came up

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.300 align:middle line:90%
with named Nikolai Kardashev.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.480 align:middle line:84%
He came up with the
idea that civilizations

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.940 align:middle line:84%
could be judged on the amount
of energy that they consume.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.500 align:middle line:84%
A type 1 civilization
can basically

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.440 align:middle line:90%
control the energy of a star.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.390 align:middle line:84%
It would be like us
building a mega structure

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.670 align:middle line:84%
around our star harnessing
all of that energy

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.740 align:middle line:90%
for our technology.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Type 2's can do that on a
multi star level, and a type

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.690 align:middle line:90%
3 can do it on a galactic level.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And so what I
think you're seeing

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.150 align:middle line:84%
is something far larger
with the UFO phenomenon

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.580 align:middle line:84%
than just a couple of
species visiting the planet.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.380 align:middle line:90%
I think--

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.347 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's evolved.

00:03:50.347 --> 00:03:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Yeah, and I
think that they're

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.040 align:middle line:84%
all part of the same
type 3 civilization.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Enrico Fermi, with
Fermi's Paradox,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.330 align:middle line:84%
made the statement that if these
million year old civilizations

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.610 align:middle line:84%
existed without
destroying themselves,

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.115 align:middle line:84%
they had plenty of time to
colonize the entire Milky Way.

00:04:09.115 --> 00:04:09.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: And I think that's
exactly what they've done.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
these various species

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.610 align:middle line:84%
you see appearing on the planet
and in front of abductees

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.010 align:middle line:84%
and contactees are all part of
the same type 3 civilization.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think,
Jack, that the verbiage

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.730 align:middle line:84%
of angels in the Bible
and things like that

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.460 align:middle line:84%
really made reference
to extraterrestrials?

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.550 align:middle line:84%
They just didn't understand what
they were looking at the time?

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Absolutely.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, they were
pertaining to the Anunnaki.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.580 align:middle line:84%
The Anunnaki, you
know, most people

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.210 align:middle line:84%
know a lot of information
about the Anunnaki these days.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The works of the
late Zecharia Sitchin.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And others that have
examined some of the tablets

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.360 align:middle line:90%
from Ashurbanipal.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.720 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting is in
the Western occult tradition

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.910 align:middle line:84%
it kind of changes
from what some people

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.590 align:middle line:90%
believe about the Anunnaki.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting is they
built these ancient structures

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.840 align:middle line:84%
all around the world that seem
to exhibit the mathematics

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.660 align:middle line:90%
of musical harmonics.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.460 align:middle line:90%
That's really significant.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.350 align:middle line:90%
For instance--

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
the same everywhere.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yeah.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Most of the structures built by
the Anunnaki have seven levels.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Those match the seven
notes in a musical octave.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.590 align:middle line:84%
It's the reason why
the pyramid doesn't

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.550 align:middle line:84%
have the top part, which would
have completed the octave.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.760 align:middle line:90%


00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.620 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the difference in
mass between the large pyramid

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.160 align:middle line:84%
and the pyramid at
Khefren, the next largest,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.380 align:middle line:90%
is 0.0136 expressed as a ratio.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.310 align:middle line:90%
That mass--

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Almost identical.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:56.800 align:middle line:90%
Almost identical.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.610 align:middle line:84%
That's just the discrepancy
between the two masses, right?

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Well that matches exactly
the difference in mass

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.520 align:middle line:90%
between our star and Sirius B.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go figure.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.175 align:middle line:90%
Good coincidence, right?

00:06:09.175 --> 00:06:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: What a coincidence.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Even more interesting than
that is that in these mystery

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.770 align:middle line:84%
schools, since the
time of the Anunnaki,

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.080 align:middle line:84%
they've been concealing
the knowledge

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.520 align:middle line:84%
that the laws of the universe
interact through the laws

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.720 align:middle line:90%
of harmonic resonance.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And so basically what they
were trying to show 1.36

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.240 align:middle line:84%
is actually known as
the Pythagorean comma.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.630 align:middle line:84%
Musicians use it for a equal
tempering of their instruments

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:39.430 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They know
what that means.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:41.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's the exact discrepancy
between the mathematics

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.870 align:middle line:84%
of the octave and
the mathematics

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.835 align:middle line:90%
of the fifth note in an octave.

00:06:48.835 --> 00:06:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was there
a message they

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:51.377 align:middle line:90%
were trying to convey to us?

00:06:51.377 --> 00:06:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: They were
trying to convey

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.710 align:middle line:84%
that not only did they build
these structures-- and a lot

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.300 align:middle line:84%
of people think,
wow, why did they

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.890 align:middle line:90%
just build stone structures?

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's because
after the deceit of Noah

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.120 align:middle line:84%
was discovered, after Enki,
he and his royal guard

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.090 align:middle line:84%
were cast down on
Mount Hermon forever.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.520 align:middle line:90%
That was their exile.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.070 align:middle line:84%
Because of your deceit and
because you love your creation

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.620 align:middle line:84%
so much, you'll be
cast down among them

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.360 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of your days.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And so imagine what you could
build on a desert island

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.160 align:middle line:90%
if you had been a castaway.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.230 align:middle line:90%
Imagine what would you build.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And all that was left
of them were stone.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And with extremely
advanced engineering

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.560 align:middle line:84%
and mathematical skill,
they built structures

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.660 align:middle line:90%
that we can't replicate today.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And what's fascinating
is they went

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.550 align:middle line:84%
to the trouble of constructing
all of these structures

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.542 align:middle line:84%
around the laws of
mathematical harmonics.

00:07:45.542 --> 00:07:47.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You call your
theory the Unified Field

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.700 align:middle line:90%
of Paranormal Activity.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:49.730 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yeah.

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.740 align:middle line:84%
So one branch is the
interaction with the type 3

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.270 align:middle line:90%
society I was describing.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.980 align:middle line:84%
So there is the whole vast
body of paranormal activity

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.730 align:middle line:84%
that would be covered
under that including

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:05.520 align:middle line:84%
cattle mutilations, unexplained
animal deaths, missing people,

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:11.510 align:middle line:84%
the alien abduction phenomenon,
UFO sightings in general.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.470 align:middle line:84%
All of that kind of activity
is covered under interaction

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:15.430 align:middle line:90%
with the type 3.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:18.610 align:middle line:84%
The other kind of
paranormal interaction

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:20.770 align:middle line:90%
occurs enter dimensionally.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And it fits into all
of the same teaching,

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.770 align:middle line:84%
because what physicists
all around the world

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:29.230 align:middle line:84%
in these hushed conferences
are talking about

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:32.620 align:middle line:90%
is that other dimensions exist.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.429 align:middle line:84%
And if they exist, like pages
in a book change the frequency,

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:38.440 align:middle line:90%
you could see another dimension.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.169 align:middle line:84%
If you could change the
frequency of your body,

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:42.010 align:middle line:90%
your consciousness.

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:45.190 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, they know
that creatures exist

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:46.430 align:middle line:90%
on these other dimensions.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And like Michio Kaku
mentioned, if creatures

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:52.060 align:middle line:84%
exist on those dimensions,
then some of them

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.790 align:middle line:84%
will have been
advanced enough to have

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.293 align:middle line:90%
found a way into this one.

00:08:56.293 --> 00:08:58.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jack, you talked
earlier a little bit

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:00.010 align:middle line:90%
about animal mutilations.

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:03.880 align:middle line:84%
There's a photo of some horses
that were later were mutilated.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about this image
that we're looking at.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:06.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Sure.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:11.410 align:middle line:10%
So this took place in Tennessee.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.770 align:middle line:10%
The owner's name
was Terry McIlvain.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:17.590 align:middle line:10%
This was published in the
paper so he doesn't mind

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.390 align:middle line:10%
his name being known anymore.

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:20.890 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: This is
an authentic photo?

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.420 align:middle line:10%
>>CARY: Authentic photo.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:26.560 align:middle line:10%
He had two prized Paso
Fino horses in the field,

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.530 align:middle line:10%
and so he had put up two
different infrared cameras

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:32.290 align:middle line:10%
that could keep eye
on them at nighttime.

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:35.530 align:middle line:10%
On two separate occasions
on those cameras

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:37.390 align:middle line:10%
this light source showed up.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:38.560 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: From where?

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.520 align:middle line:10%
>>CARY: From the sky.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.517 align:middle line:10%
And if you see
further to the left

00:09:41.517 --> 00:09:43.850 align:middle line:10%
on that image, which you might
be able to on the screen,

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:46.660 align:middle line:10%
you can see a spot
light source, right?

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:47.650 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:50.380 align:middle line:10%
>>CARY: The horse is
not reacting at all.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.000 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's engulfed
him, the light.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.500 align:middle line:10%
>>CARY: So it's silent.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.280 align:middle line:10%
And it's such a bright
light that it was infrared.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:01.270 align:middle line:10%
That's why it appeared so bright
on these infrared cameras.

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:04.720 align:middle line:10%
What's interesting about that
is that light appeared twice--

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.510 align:middle line:10%
shortly before the
mutilation of those horses

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:11.800 align:middle line:10%
occurred, and on the night that
they occurred the cameras were

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.090 align:middle line:10%
rendered inoperable.

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:13.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: So the intelligence
behind that light

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:21.040 align:middle line:84%
is the intelligence behind
the entire animal mutilation

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.150 align:middle line:90%
phenomenon.

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And it appears as though
it's alien in nature.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.480 align:middle line:90%
And with the UFO's recent--

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.190 align:middle line:90%
the US Navy's recent--

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we know
if the horse was

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.920 align:middle line:90%
kind of pulled into the craft?

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:33.720 align:middle line:90%
Or what happened?

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: It was typical.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:39.010 align:middle line:84%
All of the reproductive
organs were taken.

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:41.010 align:middle line:90%
Tongue cut out.

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:43.920 align:middle line:84%
The half moon section
along the facial area.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:44.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No blood?

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:45.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: No blood.

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:48.220 align:middle line:84%
They're completely
exsanguinated.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.430 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting that all
those particular organs

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:52.922 align:middle line:84%
that are taken have the
highest cell reproduction rate.

00:10:52.922 --> 00:10:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think they're doing?

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:55.630 align:middle line:90%
Why are they mutilating?

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:58.440 align:middle line:84%
Why are they taking
organ samples?

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: They-- the
alien presence,

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.420 align:middle line:84%
whoever this type 3
civilization-- has

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:08.280 align:middle line:84%
gone to a huge amount
of expense and time,

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:12.330 align:middle line:84%
testing and retesting this
environment in every way,

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.920 align:middle line:90%
even down to the atomic level.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And so what you're seeing
with unexplained animal deaths

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.770 align:middle line:84%
and cattle mutilations is the
testing of our food supply.

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:22.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As opposed to us.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:27.120 align:middle line:84%
Now what they discovered,
which the NIDS discovered--

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.730 align:middle line:84%
it was Robert Bigelow's
original group that

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.850 align:middle line:90%
went to the Skinwalker Ranch.

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:37.380 align:middle line:84%
They were also given a project
to look into cattle mutilation.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:41.170 align:middle line:84%
This report was published once
upon a time under the NIDS

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:41.970 align:middle line:90%
website.

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:44.560 align:middle line:90%
It since has been removed.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.040 align:middle line:84%
However, I have a copy
still from back then.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And so they determined
that they could, in fact.

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Predict cattle
mutilations wherever

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:59.920 align:middle line:84%
there was a breakout of
chronic wasting disease.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.160 align:middle line:10%
In other words, when chronic
wasting disease occurred

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.940 align:middle line:10%
in an area, shortly after that
cattle mutilations occurred.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:06.930 align:middle line:90%
They also recognized--

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're testing.

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:08.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And they also determined
that the black triangular

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:15.150 align:middle line:84%
craft that people kept seeing
were the ones involved.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:19.190 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't determine
fully whose craft they were,

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:20.720 align:middle line:84%
but they determined
that this was

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:23.930 align:middle line:90%
much like a testing program.

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And that the fact
that the animals were

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:28.640 align:middle line:84%
being tested at all
means that the beef

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.315 align:middle line:90%
supply had been compromised.

00:12:30.315 --> 00:12:31.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Now this led
them to investigate

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:37.242 align:middle line:84%
what happened in Fort
Collins in the late 1960s.

00:12:37.242 --> 00:12:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened there?

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: There was
a secret facility

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:43.380 align:middle line:84%
being run by the US government
that did animal testing.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And one of those scientists
went to New Guinea

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:49.020 align:middle line:84%
and he collected
samples of Kuru virus.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And he brought Kuru virus
back to Fort Collins

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:54.260 align:middle line:84%
and he began to inject it in
some of the wildlife to see

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:55.490 align:middle line:90%
what the effect would be.

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:56.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dangerous.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:03.830 align:middle line:84%
Well one of those deer escaped
and Kuru virus in that animal

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:06.920 align:middle line:84%
population becomes
chronic wasting disease.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:10.640 align:middle line:84%
That's the clinical
manifestation of it.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.190 align:middle line:84%
Well deer don't care
about barbed wire.

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:16.490 align:middle line:84%
They jump right over barbed wire
fences where the cattle are.

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And they feed from the
very tops of the plants,

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:22.550 align:middle line:84%
whereas cattle pull the whole
plant up and consume it.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And they leave
saliva deposits that

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:30.450 align:middle line:84%
are contaminated with what
we call prion proteins.

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:34.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, prion proteins are what
cause Jakob Creutzfeldt--

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The brain disease.

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:36.190 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.600 align:middle line:84%
That causes it to
turn into a sponge.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.430 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting is
cattle are butchered

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:41.670 align:middle line:90%
before their fifth year.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.960 align:middle line:84%
So according to the
NIDS, these symptoms

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.700 align:middle line:84%
are sub-clinical in
the cattle population.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Meaning the symptoms
don't show up

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.450 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
have long enough.

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:52.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But they're there.

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:53.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.660 align:middle line:84%
It's become clinical
in the human population

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:59.090 align:middle line:84%
through early
Alzheimer's disease.

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And they discovered that the
rates of early Alzheimer's

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:06.140 align:middle line:84%
disease had actually increased
by thousands of percent

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.933 align:middle line:84%
since the first reported case
of chronic wasting disease.

00:14:09.933 --> 00:14:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And who says
Alzheimer's is not

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.620 align:middle line:90%
derived from it?

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:13.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:13.950 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting is
that the US government,

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.640 align:middle line:84%
they got savvy to these
testings taking place.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And they were like,
well we've got

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.100 align:middle line:84%
to have our own program to
test these animals to see

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.420 align:middle line:90%
what it is they're testing.

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.620 align:middle line:90%
Because what did they find?

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:28.700 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where you have
this cross contamination

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.500 align:middle line:84%
of cases where
people say, oh, I saw

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.680 align:middle line:84%
some military black helicopters
right before the mutilation.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.785 align:middle line:84%
And other people
see an alien craft.

00:14:39.785 --> 00:14:42.380 align:middle line:84%
It's because one was
copying the other.

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We seem to be getting
lots of UFO disclosure stories

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:46.490 align:middle line:90%
these days.

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think
this is being fueled?

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:51.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: I believe something
has forced their hand.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.670 align:middle line:84%
I've asked that very
question on my blog.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:56.720 align:middle line:90%
Why now?

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:00.350 align:middle line:84%
After this many
decades of deceit

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.200 align:middle line:84%
and how long they've
tried and how hard they've

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.610 align:middle line:90%
tried to hide it, why now?

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a
really scary question.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they would
have unless their hand had

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.390 align:middle line:90%
been forced into it.

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:15.835 align:middle line:84%
And whatever that is is probably
not something beneficial.

00:15:15.835 --> 00:15:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
the government has

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:21.230 align:middle line:84%
admitted that the Navy
"tic tac" videos are

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.150 align:middle line:90%
accurate and authentic.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And what they have recently
said is they should never

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.590 align:middle line:90%
have been released.

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:28.810 align:middle line:90%
And they're upset about that.

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Sure.

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:31.730 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely upset about it.

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:34.920 align:middle line:84%
It's crazy, and there are quite
a few other shows on right

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.720 align:middle line:90%
now--

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:41.165 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about To The Stars
Academy with Luis Elizondo.

00:15:41.165 --> 00:15:42.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tom DeLonge.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:46.280 align:middle line:84%
You got another show that's
got these CIA analysts on it.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.740 align:middle line:84%
That show has already
mentioned Robert Bigelow's name

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:49.820 align:middle line:90%
three or four times.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And so it's my prediction that
the next wave of disclosure

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:58.235 align:middle line:84%
will come in the form of objects
that he has in his possession.

00:15:58.235 --> 00:15:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You might
be right about that.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:00.740 align:middle line:90%
You might be.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:03.470 align:middle line:84%
Has your theory of
paranormal activity

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:07.270 align:middle line:84%
been vilified with
all this UFO activity?

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:08.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: No.

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:09.080 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.500 align:middle line:90%
Not vilified at all.

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:15.560 align:middle line:84%
In fact, all of this ties
together into one big circle.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.840 align:middle line:84%
My interest in
cryptozoology, which

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:23.750 align:middle line:84%
by the way since the disclosure
of the UFOs by the US Navy

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.940 align:middle line:84%
has caused closure
in my interest,

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.520 align:middle line:90%
really, in most cryptozoology.

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:32.570 align:middle line:84%
Because what we have now is
a direct line of knowledge

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:34.760 align:middle line:84%
to what the genome
studies were telling us.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:39.500 align:middle line:84%
They kept telling us that
these were genetic chimeras.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.000 align:middle line:84%
That these creatures
had mitochondrial DNA,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.350 align:middle line:84%
but the other DNA was
thousands of different strains

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:49.430 align:middle line:84%
all fused together in a way
that really scared them.

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And so they proved
that whatever this was,

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:57.090 align:middle line:84%
it was a genetic alien
construction of some kind.

00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:01.970 align:middle line:84%
So any hominid
cryptozoological animal

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:04.430 align:middle line:84%
is going to be one
of these chimeras.

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:08.839 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why is because it
has zero foundation for biology

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:10.190 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:12.050 align:middle line:90%
It can not occur.

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And when you eliminate the
impossible, whatever remains,

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.776 align:middle line:84%
however improbable,
has to be the truth.

00:17:18.776 --> 00:17:19.609 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point.

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: And what's
impossible with cryptozoology

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:26.390 align:middle line:84%
is for a breeding population
of 5,000 or 6,000 animals

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:30.110 align:middle line:84%
to remain hidden and undetected
for this amount of time,

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:33.920 align:middle line:84%
no matter how smart they are,
no matter how elusive they are,

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:37.070 align:middle line:84%
unless they possess
DNA which allows

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:39.207 align:middle line:90%
them abilities to stay hidden.

00:17:39.207 --> 00:17:40.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point.

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:43.040 align:middle line:84%
Nick Pope, who used to
head up the British Defense

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.950 align:middle line:84%
Department's UFO
files, had a chance

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:47.450 align:middle line:90%
to talk with me about UFOs.

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him
specifically if he

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:53.478 align:middle line:90%
thought the UFOs were threats.

00:17:53.478 --> 00:17:55.520 align:middle line:10%
>>NICK POPE: You know,
there's a threat equation.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.830 align:middle line:10%
I know this sounds kind
of crazy, but there is.

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:01.880 align:middle line:10%
Threat is defined
in the military

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:06.290 align:middle line:10%
as being a product of
capability and intent.

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:08.690 align:middle line:10%
We know what the
capability is, or we

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:11.480 align:middle line:10%
have some fairly good pointers.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.520 align:middle line:10%
For example, watching
those videos.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.040 align:middle line:10%
The capability is huge.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:19.940 align:middle line:10%
What we don't know is
what the intent is.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:24.290 align:middle line:10%
And any time in an equation
where you have an unknown,

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:26.610 align:middle line:10%
the answer is also
going to be an unknown.

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:29.120 align:middle line:10%
So my answer to
your question is we

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:33.250 align:middle line:10%
don't know if there's a threat,
and therefore in government

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:37.820 align:middle line:10%
the prudent policy is to
assume that there is a threat,

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.250 align:middle line:10%
and then allow yourself
to be pleasantly

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:43.610 align:middle line:10%
surprised and relieved if
it doesn't materialize.

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:47.000 align:middle line:10%
As opposed to the other way
around, which is crazy--

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.060 align:middle line:10%
assume there's no threat
and then get caught out

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:52.720 align:middle line:10%
if it does prove to be hostile.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You agree
with him, Jack?

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: I do agree with him.

00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:01.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- assuming that it's
a non-hostile presence is

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:03.710 align:middle line:84%
the worst thing
that you could do.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And when you go back and
look at the origins of what

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.370 align:middle line:84%
we would call psychic
abilities for human beings,

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:12.050 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
that was something

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:16.160 align:middle line:84%
that was built into our
biology by the Anunnaki

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.980 align:middle line:84%
as a way of eventually
gaining our freedom

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:20.960 align:middle line:90%
from this alien presence.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think that they
literally constructed

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:26.210 align:middle line:84%
the laws of harmonic
resonance not only

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:31.040 align:middle line:84%
to show that this resonant
effect takes place

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.310 align:middle line:84%
between stellar bodies,
and that takes place

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:37.160 align:middle line:84%
between musical
notes and an octave,

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:41.180 align:middle line:84%
but they built our biology
with seven chakra zones,

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:44.930 align:middle line:84%
each one of them vibrates
to the same frequency

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:46.880 align:middle line:90%
as a musical note.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And because of
that, your biology

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:53.420 align:middle line:84%
can vibrate with the
reality matrix around you

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:57.090 align:middle line:84%
and cause conformity
and change with will.

00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:58.920 align:middle line:90%
And that's real magic.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's what all
of these occult groups

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:04.760 align:middle line:84%
have been encapsulated--
their knowledge encapsulated

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.710 align:middle line:90%
and hiding all these many eons.

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:10.160 align:middle line:84%
Because the Anunnaki
were so concerned with it

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.260 align:middle line:90%
being preserved for humanity.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where did they go?

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Well, you
know, it was just

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Enki and his 200 royal
guard that were actually

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.580 align:middle line:90%
cast down on Mount Hermon.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:26.793 align:middle line:84%
The Anunnaki princes
were given clone guards.

00:20:26.793 --> 00:20:29.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they're the ones
that seeded us, aren't they?

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:32.930 align:middle line:84%
But this is what happened--
a natural event was going

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:37.070 align:middle line:84%
to happen, cause a flood to
wipe out most of humanity,

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.940 align:middle line:90%
if not all of it.

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:39.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The flood of Noah?

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.497 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: The flood
of Noah recorded

00:20:40.497 --> 00:20:44.180 align:middle line:84%
in every ancient culture
around the world.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And Anu and Enlil in the
high council of the Anunnaki

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:52.550 align:middle line:84%
decided to just let
it happen and wipe out

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:53.640 align:middle line:90%
the human creation.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.440 align:middle line:90%
They thought--

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds
biblical, doesn't it?

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yeah.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.170 align:middle line:84%
They hated it that Enki
and his wife Ninhursag

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:02.690 align:middle line:84%
had altered us to be
able to reproduce.

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:03.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Adam and Eve?

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:04.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.125 align:middle line:84%
Before that they were
creating batches of clones.

00:21:07.125 --> 00:21:09.500 align:middle line:84%
It eventually got to the point
they needed enough workers

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.548 align:middle line:84%
that they had to alter
us for reproduction.

00:21:11.548 --> 00:21:14.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did the Anunnaki come
from the so-called 10th planet

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:15.590 align:middle line:90%
that's in our solar system?

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:18.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: I do, but I believe
that planet was destroyed.

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of the
interesting thing about it.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:24.380 align:middle line:84%
I believe that Enki and
his fallen Anunnaki,

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:28.450 align:middle line:84%
which was the origin of the
fallen angel mythos, right?

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Went about helping their genetic
offspring to build all of these

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:35.600 align:middle line:90%
temples to start civilization.

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And specifically in
both the Book of Enoch

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:41.150 align:middle line:84%
and in the tablets,
the Sumerian tablets,

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:43.700 align:middle line:84%
they taught them
the laws of magic.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.550 align:middle line:10%
And those laws of magic
are the same things

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:50.150 align:middle line:10%
that allow for psychic
functioning of the human body.

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:52.820 align:middle line:10%
And it's only through
psychic functioning

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.860 align:middle line:10%
that you're ever going
to have an advantage

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.650 align:middle line:10%
over these creatures, because
the problem isn't that they're

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:59.720 align:middle line:10%
technologically superior.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:03.590 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that they
are neurologically superior.

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:05.590 align:middle line:90%
And that's a really dark outset.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:06.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:07.190 align:middle line:90%
It sure is.

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:09.200 align:middle line:90%
Cryptids-- what our cryptids?

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Well, as I
was saying earlier,

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm now convinced through
that, you know, we always

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:16.250 align:middle line:90%
knew that UFOs were real.

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:19.070 align:middle line:90%
Well now we can say absolutely.

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:21.920 align:middle line:84%
So we've eliminated the
impossible out of that equation

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.810 align:middle line:90%
that the aliens weren't real.

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:27.200 align:middle line:84%
That leaves us with just
these two probabilities--

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.210 align:middle line:84%
and they're high
probabilities given the genome

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:32.120 align:middle line:84%
studies-- that they're
alien chimera animals.

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.885 align:middle line:90%
Now there's another--

00:22:33.885 --> 00:22:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they would be
what creatures are we talking?

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Well, dog
man, Sasquatch,

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:38.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Big Foot.

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:39.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yeah.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:42.560 align:middle line:84%
There was a creature,
an alien creature,

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:48.500 align:middle line:84%
recorded in Bishopville, I think
Georgia, that became famous.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:52.070 align:middle line:84%
People have seen fish men and
all of these different kind

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.890 align:middle line:90%
of chimeras.

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:56.540 align:middle line:84%
We don't really know what their
purpose is, only that they--

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:57.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mothman?

00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:00.270 align:middle line:90%
Or on land.

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:02.610 align:middle line:84%
We don't really know
why they were created.

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:05.280 align:middle line:84%
I suspect Sasquatch was
created during the time

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:08.347 align:middle line:84%
of the early Anunnaki
when they were mining.

00:23:08.347 --> 00:23:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might they have been
genetic experiments, Jack,

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:11.620 align:middle line:90%
that went awry?

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:12.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: They are.

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:12.870 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They just
got out of control?

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:15.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Absolutely.

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:18.450 align:middle line:84%
Ninhursag, who was
Enki's wife, she

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:21.450 align:middle line:84%
was a genetic scientist
who actually created

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:23.070 align:middle line:90%
a lot of human chimeras.

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of these Egyptian
gods you see with animal heads,

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:28.893 align:middle line:84%
those were real creatures she
had created at some point.

00:23:28.893 --> 00:23:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at
a picture of Sasquatch,

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:34.220 align:middle line:84%
and kind of tell us
what you think they did.

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Was Sasquatch, for example,
genetically manipulated from--

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:41.610 align:middle line:90%
what is that?

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Well, here is a very
close blown up of a Sasquatch.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.600 align:middle line:84%
This is 800% blown up
of a Sasquatch taken

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.310 align:middle line:90%
in North Carolina.

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:52.900 align:middle line:84%
Now the very bottom
line there is the mouth.

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:56.040 align:middle line:84%
The two egg shaped things
are in the nostrils.

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.110 align:middle line:90%
There's the nose.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:59.880 align:middle line:84%
It almost appeared as
though this creature

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:04.110 align:middle line:84%
had a black smudge across
his eyes right here.

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:04.980 align:middle line:90%
But those are eyes.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:05.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that his head?

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: That's the cone
shaped head right there.

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:09.212 align:middle line:90%
That's his head.

00:24:09.212 --> 00:24:10.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: We've got the--

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:11.857 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Looks like a shoulder?

00:24:11.857 --> 00:24:12.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: No shoulder.

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:14.700 align:middle line:90%
This is simply a head shot.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:16.270 align:middle line:90%
All a head shot.

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:17.070 align:middle line:90%
And there is--

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:18.278 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why is it so blurry?

00:24:18.278 --> 00:24:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: There's photos taken
away-- this particular photo

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.310 align:middle line:84%
was run through a
blue light filter

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:26.598 align:middle line:84%
so that all of the greenish tint
of the foliage wouldn't show up

00:24:26.598 --> 00:24:28.140 align:middle line:84%
and you could see
the bone structure.

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:29.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it's got kind
of like an oblong face?

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:30.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: It does.

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:33.018 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're often reported
with cone shaped heads.

00:24:33.018 --> 00:24:34.560 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting
about this picture

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:39.030 align:middle line:84%
is that you can make out the
real human-looking bottom

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:42.060 align:middle line:84%
part of the face, and yet the
top part and the cone shaped

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:47.130 align:middle line:84%
head are distinctly not human,
or even primate-looking.

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
do you think there

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:50.960 align:middle line:84%
are running around this
country, this planet?

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: If you have to
have a viable breeding

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.040 align:middle line:84%
population without
showing up with birth

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.430 align:middle line:84%
defects and mental
illness, you have

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:02.030 align:middle line:84%
to have 5,000 to 6,000 animals
just in the United States

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:02.830 align:middle line:90%
alone.

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is Sasquatch
the same as Yeti

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:07.620 align:middle line:84%
and the Abominable
Snowman theories?

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: They're all based
on the same genetic chimera

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:12.780 align:middle line:90%
work of this alien presence.

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:15.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now tie this together
with your Unified Theory.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.935 align:middle line:84%
What are these cryptids--
what are they here for?

00:25:17.935 --> 00:25:19.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: That we don't know.

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.730 align:middle line:84%
We don't know why
they're here, but it

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:24.600 align:middle line:84%
explains their existence
and their ability

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.540 align:middle line:90%
to remain so elusive.

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:33.090 align:middle line:84%
One of the Bigfoot
researchers I trust the most

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:36.450 align:middle line:84%
presented evidence to me
where a large male traveled

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:39.070 align:middle line:90%
a hundred miles in a night.

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:40.690 align:middle line:90%
That's insane.

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And they can travel so
fast that if you spook one,

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:46.250 align:middle line:84%
10 minutes later
it's two miles away.

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:47.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: That's the kind of
DNA abilities they have,

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:52.480 align:middle line:84%
and that's why they
can remain unseen.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it conceivable,
Jack, that these cryptids

00:25:55.810 --> 00:26:02.260 align:middle line:84%
were supposed to be human-like
creatures instead of us,

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:03.060 align:middle line:90%
and they went awry?

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:03.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yeah.

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:05.890 align:middle line:84%
I believe they were
the first attempt

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:08.980 align:middle line:90%
at the miners for the Anunnaki.

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:12.600 align:middle line:84%
They eventually changed the DNA
of us to look more like them,

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:13.737 align:middle line:90%
like it says in the Bible.

00:26:13.737 --> 00:26:15.070 align:middle line:90%
They made them out of our image.

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:16.445 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
creatures were here

00:26:16.445 --> 00:26:19.330 align:middle line:84%
on this planet that
allowed them to begin

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:20.740 align:middle line:90%
to genetically manipulate?

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:21.920 align:middle line:90%
Were they apes?

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Yeah, there must have
been relic hominid species.

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:27.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean we find so many
different ones now,

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:32.140 align:middle line:84%
and it looks like the lineage
of modern Homo sapiens sapiens

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:36.040 align:middle line:84%
is actually a very complicated
spider web to process,

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.690 align:middle line:90%
if it's evolutionary at all.

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:41.920 align:middle line:84%
But it looks like we were
purposely genetically altered,

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:45.560 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted us to
look more like them.

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And they did to the point
where there was a breeding

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:49.347 align:middle line:90%
interaction that occurred.

00:26:49.347 --> 00:26:50.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But something happened.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Loren Coleman,
cryptozoologist

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:56.170 align:middle line:84%
as well, I had a chance to
talk with him about this.

00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:57.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Great.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:01.310 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Why can't we find one
and say, here you go world.

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:02.680 align:middle line:10%
Look!

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.150 align:middle line:10%
>>LOREN COLEMAN: Well I
think they're very elusive.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:05.192 align:middle line:10%
They're very intelligent.

00:27:05.192 --> 00:27:08.940 align:middle line:10%
I mean, if you think of all
of the apes or the primates,

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:12.270 align:middle line:10%
the one that's closest to
the intelligence of humans

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:15.180 align:middle line:10%
has to be Bigfoot.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:19.530 align:middle line:10%
Grover Krantz and I once
talked about statistically

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:23.640 align:middle line:10%
for every 10,000 black
bear, there's one Bigfoot.

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:28.440 align:middle line:10%
And if you remember that
case of the Atlanta bomber,

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:32.850 align:middle line:10%
he hid in the woods of North
Carolina for three years.

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:36.060 align:middle line:10%
And here you had the whole
United States government

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.620 align:middle line:10%
looking for this one man.

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:38.400 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They couldn't find him.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.090 align:middle line:10%
>>LOREN COLEMAN: They
couldn't find him.

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:40.860 align:middle line:10%
How was he finally found?

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.290 align:middle line:10%
He was raiding a garbage dump.

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:47.280 align:middle line:10%
And that I think is how
you're going to find Bigfoot.

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:50.160 align:middle line:10%
A lumber truck is going
to hit one on a road.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:54.360 align:middle line:10%
One is going to be near
some kind of area eating

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.980 align:middle line:10%
and will get shot.

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:59.370 align:middle line:10%
But there's no concerted
effort right now.

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:01.350 align:middle line:10%
There's no money,
there's no museums,

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:04.740 align:middle line:10%
there's no zoos looking
for these animals the way

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:07.230 align:middle line:10%
they were during
the Victorian Age.

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:11.070 align:middle line:10%
It's kind of haphazard,
and that's not a good way

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:12.112 align:middle line:10%
to look for a new animal.

00:28:12.112 --> 00:28:14.112 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that how it's
going to happen, Jack?

00:28:14.112 --> 00:28:16.280 align:middle line:84%
We're going to stumble
across a creature like that?

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: No.

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:20.215 align:middle line:84%
I actually disagree for a
couple of different reasons.

00:28:20.215 --> 00:28:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell me why.

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: The great Jonathan
Keel of the Mothman prophecies,

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:28.050 align:middle line:84%
and sort of it started a
lot of us on this path,

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:32.130 align:middle line:84%
discovered that at least
20% of all credible Bigfoot

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:34.927 align:middle line:90%
sightings a UFO is also seen.

00:28:34.927 --> 00:28:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, that's true.

00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:37.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: So that's
a huge number--

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or lights or something.

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.643 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Yeah, they see
anomalous lights in the sky

00:28:40.643 --> 00:28:43.020 align:middle line:84%
that we would describe
as being a UFO.

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:45.510 align:middle line:84%
I on my own field
investigations,

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:47.700 align:middle line:84%
I've come across
with my partners

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:51.390 align:middle line:84%
a line of tracks that go
200 yards out into a middle

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:56.640 align:middle line:84%
of a field where they should
continue and they just stop.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.640 align:middle line:84%
This creature had about
a four foot stride

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.900 align:middle line:90%
while it was walking.

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:04.373 align:middle line:84%
The four foot stride turned
into about seven feet right

00:29:04.373 --> 00:29:05.290 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of that.

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:07.450 align:middle line:90%
That's a 10 foot tall creature.

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And because of
the stride change,

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:13.710 align:middle line:84%
we could tell the exact moment
when something spooked it

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:16.180 align:middle line:84%
and that stride changed
to a much bigger stride.

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:17.090 align:middle line:90%
It took off running.

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:17.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a run?

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:18.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yeah.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.110 align:middle line:10%
It was frightened.

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And so whatever took
it took it right

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:24.130 align:middle line:90%
at the end of that trail line.

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:26.200 align:middle line:90%
And I believe that was a UFO.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
this alien presence

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:31.660 align:middle line:84%
uses them for some ends or means
that we don't quite understand.

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's interesting
that George Lucas in Star Wars

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:38.400 align:middle line:84%
would have Chewbacca, the
Wookie, look like Sasquatch.

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:42.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: And admitted that that's
what he had crafted it after.

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Its amazing work.

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:47.260 align:middle line:84%
You have tied in your work
into what we call the Mars

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.250 align:middle line:90%
connection as well.

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:50.480 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that relationship.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:54.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Well, with
the new pronouncement

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:59.230 align:middle line:84%
of having a space fleet,
it really occurred to me

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:02.470 align:middle line:84%
that this is all part of
the recent disclosure that's

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:03.580 align:middle line:90%
taking place.

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they
can hide the fact

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:09.290 align:middle line:84%
that there is an operational
Mars colony anymore.

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And my point with the Mars
colony is that there is a--

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.742 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you think
it's a manned Mars colony?

00:30:16.742 --> 00:30:17.542 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: I do.

00:30:17.542 --> 00:30:18.760 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely manned by humans.

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that there is a
very interesting and compelling

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:29.410 align:middle line:84%
line of evidence from an
A to a B to a C to a D

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:33.580 align:middle line:84%
to prove that the colony
is there and operational,

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:37.750 align:middle line:84%
without throwing any of the
other information that's

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:40.780 align:middle line:84%
being thrown around Mars right
now with people saying 20

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:43.420 align:middle line:84%
and back and you know all
of these other themes that

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:45.110 align:middle line:90%
are being thrown into it.

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:47.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you look
all the way back

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.290 align:middle line:84%
like I did into my
research early on,

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:53.500 align:middle line:84%
you come across a group
called the Club of Rome.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:57.010 align:middle line:84%
The Club of Rome was
this global think tank.

00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:59.110 align:middle line:84%
People today would--
some people would say,

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:00.700 align:middle line:90%
that's the Illuminati.

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:01.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They would.

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: It's just a group
of really powerful people--

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:05.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Planetary wide.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And they were all
a part of this.

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And they met to
discuss the problem

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:13.390 align:middle line:90%
of human overpopulation.

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And they came up with
three different scenarios.

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.480 align:middle line:84%
Scenario one-- you
could keep them

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:23.380 align:middle line:84%
controlled through
controlled warfare.

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:28.460 align:middle line:84%
That became an untenable
solution after the atomic war.

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:32.200 align:middle line:84%
The atomic bomb was created,
you couldn't use warfare anymore

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.270 align:middle line:84%
because you would destroy
the one thing you're

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:35.590 align:middle line:90%
trying to keep control over.

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yup.

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: So they went
with alternative--

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.680 align:middle line:90%
they also had alternative 2.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Alternative 2 was trying
to control human breeding

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:45.080 align:middle line:90%
practices.

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And they soon realized
that the only way

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:50.920 align:middle line:84%
to do that is by controlling
human religious belief systems,

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.590 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
controls human breeding.

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And they said, yeah, that's
completely impossible.

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:58.390 align:middle line:90%
So they went with alternative 3.

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And alternative 3 was a
secret colonization of space.

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.930 align:middle line:84%
Because they never
expected that they

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:07.720 align:middle line:84%
would get the funding
necessary to actually

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.160 align:middle line:90%
carry this project off.

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.740 align:middle line:84%
They started it as a
completely secret program.

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the space program,
the Mars space program,

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:19.570 align:middle line:84%
aimed at eventually getting
humans there for ever?

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:21.010 align:middle line:90%
Or what do you think it is?

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:22.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Well, I
think they intended

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:24.838 align:middle line:84%
it to be the survival
of the human species.

00:32:24.838 --> 00:32:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even though there
might be 20 people up there?

00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Well, it
was their intention

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:32.080 align:middle line:84%
those people reproduce,
and that humanity

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:35.530 align:middle line:84%
could get a toehold
onto another planet

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:37.013 align:middle line:90%
before we overpopulated ours.

00:32:37.013 --> 00:32:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How about that birth
certificate-- where were you

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.880 align:middle line:90%
born?

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:40.680 align:middle line:90%
Mars.

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:44.890 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:47.900 align:middle line:84%
You add into that the
testimony of Gary McKinnon,

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:51.430 align:middle line:84%
the British hacker who hacked
NASA and NSA computers.

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:55.330 align:middle line:84%
He came up with a list of
non terrestrial officers

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:58.480 align:middle line:84%
along with two
photographs of spacecraft

00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.637 align:middle line:90%
that nobody has ever seen.

00:32:59.637 --> 00:33:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're still trying
to extradite him, aren't we?

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: They have
given up now finally.

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:08.200 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, they tried for
years and years and years.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:12.620 align:middle line:84%
So he comes up with this list
of non terrestrial officers,

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:15.550 align:middle line:84%
and then all of a
sudden we get testimony

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:19.160 align:middle line:84%
from the great granddaughter
of Dwight D Eisenhower--

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:19.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Laura.

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.190 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Laura.

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:23.380 align:middle line:84%
Telling us that she
was approached to be

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:25.237 align:middle line:90%
a part of a secret Mars colony.

00:33:25.237 --> 00:33:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, talking about Mars, there's
a JPL laboratory photo, Jack,

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:33.590 align:middle line:84%
that talked about
the dome of Mars.

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:34.610 align:middle line:90%
Why is that important?

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:35.693 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:33:35.693 --> 00:33:38.070 align:middle line:90%


00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:39.030 align:middle line:90%
What are we looking at?

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:39.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yeah.

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:41.820 align:middle line:84%
Here you can see
a JPL photograph

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:44.820 align:middle line:84%
that was discovered by Dr.
Courtney Brown, pictured

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:46.410 align:middle line:90%
on the right hand side here.

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Courtney Brown,
he basically decided

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:54.660 align:middle line:84%
that he was going to take
remote viewing from the military

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:58.240 align:middle line:84%
into private practice and use it
for the betterment of humanity.

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.420 align:middle line:84%
He came up with this
target, because he wanted

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:02.190 align:middle line:90%
to know what was going on Mars.

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:04.830 align:middle line:84%
So he went to JPL
photographs and went

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:08.429 align:middle line:84%
through all their files, and he
found this photograph himself.

00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And he turned this
into a blind target

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:12.540 align:middle line:90%
for all of his remote viewers.

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.670 align:middle line:84%
They knew nothing
about the target.

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:18.500 align:middle line:84%
This is a giant dome, as you
can see on the bottom here.

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:21.760 align:middle line:84%
There is a pipe coming
out of it and it's spewing

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:25.860 align:middle line:90%
a liquid out of the top.

00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And so what he did
was he made the dome

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:35.420 align:middle line:84%
Target A, the pipe Target
B, and the liquid Target C

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:36.929 align:middle line:90%
in the remote viewing sessions.

00:34:36.929 --> 00:34:38.931 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big is that, Jack?

00:34:38.931 --> 00:34:40.139 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: It would be enormous.

00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:42.719 align:middle line:90%
It's an enormous structure.

00:34:42.719 --> 00:34:45.123 align:middle line:84%
That's not a structure
that we created.

00:34:45.123 --> 00:34:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how about
the alien face on Mars?

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.480 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at this.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:53.250 align:middle line:84%
This of course is in the
Cydonia region, of course.

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:57.510 align:middle line:10%
That is that Vincent DiPietro,
Richard Hoagland, and others

00:34:57.510 --> 00:35:01.420 align:middle line:10%
have looked at this, and they're
convinced that this is indeed

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:05.337 align:middle line:10%
a face, sort of like
a message to those

00:35:05.337 --> 00:35:06.420 align:middle line:10%
who would look down on it.

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:07.080 align:middle line:10%
What do you think?

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:07.880 align:middle line:10%
>>CARY: Absolutely.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:11.790 align:middle line:10%
This was a face built
by the survivors of Mars

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:15.840 align:middle line:10%
left after the war,
for the survivors that

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.970 align:middle line:10%
were left on arks that
eventually made it

00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:19.230 align:middle line:10%
to the Earth.

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And now you can
see the one built

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:23.760 align:middle line:84%
by the ones who landed
here on some very

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:28.668 align:middle line:84%
specific Google coordinates
now, which I'm sure--

00:35:28.668 --> 00:35:30.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that was taken
with the Viking spacecraft.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:31.850 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:32.650 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:34.680 align:middle line:84%
Now we have Google
coordinates to a same face

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:35.510 align:middle line:90%
here in Antarctica.

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:36.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same thing.

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:38.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: That was
released recently.

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:41.430 align:middle line:84%
It was discovered by a
Scandinavian UFO group,

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:44.910 align:middle line:84%
actually, and then made
its way onto to Reddit,

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:47.980 align:middle line:84%
and then we came across
it relatively fast.

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:50.340 align:middle line:84%
You can see that, you
type in those coordinates,

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:53.620 align:middle line:84%
it will take you right to a face
that looks just like the face.

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:55.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Technology is amazing.

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:57.270 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed the
researcher John Brandenburg

00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:00.953 align:middle line:84%
about his theory about what
might have happened to Mars.

00:36:00.953 --> 00:36:02.870 align:middle line:10%
>>JOHN BRADENBURG: The
best working hypothesis

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:08.330 align:middle line:10%
is that Mars was like Earth and
developed a indigenous humanoid

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:13.087 align:middle line:10%
species like us that evolved
to a primitive civilization.

00:36:13.087 --> 00:36:14.420 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Primitive civilization.

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:15.795 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADENBURG: It
looks primitive.

00:36:15.795 --> 00:36:18.500 align:middle line:10%
We don't see any roads,
airports, anything like that.

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:19.875 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Even the
face in Cydonia

00:36:19.875 --> 00:36:21.710 align:middle line:10%
don't he looks Egyptian.

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:23.630 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADENBURG: It looks
Egyptian or Aztec.

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:25.820 align:middle line:10%
You know, Olmec.

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:28.430 align:middle line:10%
The people who carved
big heads in helmets

00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:29.840 align:middle line:10%
were the Olmecs on Earth.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:31.430 align:middle line:10%
They're also very mysterious.

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:35.090 align:middle line:10%
Nobody knows where
they came from.

00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:38.940 align:middle line:10%
But it appears that there was a
primitive civilization on Mars,

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:40.910 align:middle line:10%
and then somebody
attacked them from space.

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:45.050 align:middle line:10%
Because the explosions
where air bursts

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:47.550 align:middle line:10%
of two massive nuclear weapons.

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:49.250 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How big would they be?

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:50.540 align:middle line:10%
What would they look like?

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:52.340 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADENBURG: They would have
looked like the Empire State

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:53.000 align:middle line:10%
Building.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:53.800 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That big?

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:54.820 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADENBURG: Yes.

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:55.620 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:56.420 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADENBURG: Huge.

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:58.550 align:middle line:10%
They would have been
easily constructable

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:02.152 align:middle line:10%
in the asteroid belt from the
materials in the asteroid belt,

00:37:02.152 --> 00:37:03.860 align:middle line:10%
then brought to Mars
and dropped on Mars.

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:07.130 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Why would anyone
want to destroy what

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:09.100 align:middle line:10%
was on the planet at the time?

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:11.040 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADENBURG: I don't know.

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:15.260 align:middle line:10%
All I know is there's precedent
on Earth for people wiping out

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:16.070 align:middle line:10%
other people.

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:17.420 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, but that's war.

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:21.530 align:middle line:10%
So are we sure that maybe
there wasn't a war on Mars?

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:25.260 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADENBURG: It looks
as though the Martians--

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:27.320 align:middle line:10%
it may be the face on Mars--

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:32.720 align:middle line:10%
in fact, Mark Carlotto's
version of the face on Mars,

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.000 align:middle line:10%
it looks quite
threatening, and looks

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.360 align:middle line:10%
like it's baring its teeth
at somebody in outer space.

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:42.470 align:middle line:10%
So it could be that
the people on Mars

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:44.742 align:middle line:10%
had a beef with
somebody in outer space.

00:37:44.742 --> 00:37:45.950 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Ticked somebody off.

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:47.117 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADENBURG: Or they-- yes.

00:37:47.117 --> 00:37:49.350 align:middle line:10%
And somebody got
annoyed with them.

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:50.150 align:middle line:90%
Who knows.

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Fascinating
possibilities.

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:53.360 align:middle line:90%
My gosh.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: So according
to farsight.org,

00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:59.360 align:middle line:84%
who did the remote
viewing on Mars,

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:02.030 align:middle line:84%
they came up with answers
for a lot of these questions.

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:07.910 align:middle line:84%
So the dome they detected
humans in, at Target A.

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:09.500 align:middle line:90%
They were in the dome.

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.750 align:middle line:84%
They were in a
state of distress.

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:15.050 align:middle line:84%
They needed replacement parts
for some of their equipment,

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:17.042 align:middle line:84%
and they were messing
with a technology

00:38:17.042 --> 00:38:18.000 align:middle line:90%
they didn't understand.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.792 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Almost like
the movie The Martian.

00:38:19.792 --> 00:38:22.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Almost, except
for this group of people

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.010 align:middle line:84%
knew that when they left
it was a hardship duty.

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:26.870 align:middle line:84%
That also came out in
the remote viewing.

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:30.230 align:middle line:84%
That meant they knew they would
never return to the earth.

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:31.985 align:middle line:90%
They had volunteered for this.

00:38:31.985 --> 00:38:33.135 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A one way trip.

00:38:33.135 --> 00:38:34.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: One way trip.

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:35.468 align:middle line:84%
They knew they
weren't coming back.

00:38:35.468 --> 00:38:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would you do that?

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: You know, you would
have to really believe

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:41.850 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to save
humanity, your species.

00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:43.350 align:middle line:84%
If you had that
belief in you soul--

00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:45.517 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And had your family
or something like that.

00:38:45.517 --> 00:38:46.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:51.420 align:middle line:84%
But they went on further
than that, and they put--

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:52.610 align:middle line:90%
two different time zones.

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:56.480 align:middle line:84%
They were like, well, go
back in time 10,000 years

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.060 align:middle line:84%
and see what you can
see happen on Mars.

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Eventually at some timeline
they detected a war

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.740 align:middle line:84%
taking place, which
explains all the xenon

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:06.200 align:middle line:84%
129 on the surface
of Mars, which only

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.450 align:middle line:90%
comes from nuclear explosions.

00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:11.510 align:middle line:84%
There was a neighboring planet
that they had gone to war with.

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:14.572 align:middle line:84%
We can only assume that
that planet was Nibiru.

00:39:14.572 --> 00:39:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
wiped out the Martians?

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:17.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yeah.

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:19.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, this ongoing
war had damaged

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:22.520 align:middle line:84%
the atmosphere in Nibiru and
they came here for the gold

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:23.850 align:middle line:90%
to repair it.

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:26.600 align:middle line:84%
You get to see that
interaction, the reason why.

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:28.910 align:middle line:84%
At the same time
the Anunnaki weapons

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:32.390 align:middle line:84%
were devastating the planet
of Mars and its species,

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:35.090 align:middle line:90%
and almost about to win the war.

00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the Martians
came up with a mega weapon--

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:42.290 align:middle line:84%
a weapon that was so deadly
that when they launched it,

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:45.230 align:middle line:84%
it literally blew
the entire planet up.

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And that became
the asteroid belt.

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yep.

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And that left Mars
completely devastated.

00:39:52.850 --> 00:39:54.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, completely devastated.

00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:55.150 align:middle line:90%
So what did they do?

00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:58.210 align:middle line:84%
The only thing they could do--
they built a couple of space

00:39:58.210 --> 00:39:59.020 align:middle line:90%
arks--

00:39:59.020 --> 00:39:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And came here.

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:00.747 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: And came here.

00:40:00.747 --> 00:40:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And they landed in
Antarctica, and that's

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:06.010 align:middle line:84%
the source of all the
structures in Antarctica.

00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:08.597 align:middle line:84%
At some point some
sort of calamity

00:40:08.597 --> 00:40:09.680 align:middle line:90%
caused that civilization--

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could they
have come to Egypt?

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: I think when
the calamity occurred

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.080 align:middle line:84%
in Antarctica, they
dispersed all over the world.

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chiro means
Mars in Arabic.

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:19.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And the face that you
see now in Google Earth

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:24.470 align:middle line:90%
matches the face on Mars.

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that that
was a heartfelt symbol

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:32.590 align:middle line:84%
from the last of the Martians
saying, we hope you made it.

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When do you
think this all happened?

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:38.993 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: That's an interesting--
it was millions of years ago,

00:40:38.993 --> 00:40:39.910 align:middle line:90%
I think is when they--

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:41.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they were
advanced, though?

00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:42.595 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Extremely advanced.

00:40:42.595 --> 00:40:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the Martians were
an advanced society.

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And they had the
type of technology

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:50.950 align:middle line:90%
that seems so alien to us.

00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:53.220 align:middle line:84%
But they did build
pyramidal structures.

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:56.338 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Couldn't Mars have
been a base for other UFOs?

00:40:56.338 --> 00:40:58.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Well, I believe that
those two planets are part

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:00.580 align:middle line:90%
of this type 3 civilization.

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:03.160 align:middle line:84%
There's an overarching
umbrella authority

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:06.230 align:middle line:90%
that was overlooking even that.

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:07.863 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is amazing.

00:41:07.863 --> 00:41:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Yes, so that's how
big we have to think now.

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:12.010 align:middle line:90%
That Fermi was right--

00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:13.780 align:middle line:84%
that what we're
seeing are just--

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.300 align:middle line:84%
these are interaction
of testing vehicles,

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:17.980 align:middle line:90%
for lack of a better term.

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:22.130 align:middle line:84%
They're unpiloted
drones, most of them.

00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are piloted
by alien scientists

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:29.140 align:middle line:84%
and so forth doing their work
of testing us as a society

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:32.730 align:middle line:84%
as we are slowly being bred
into this type 3 civilization.

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think that
regardless of where these

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:38.950 align:middle line:84%
civilizations are, on
what planetary systems,

00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:42.370 align:middle line:84%
that the quest to find
out how this all started--

00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:45.640 align:middle line:90%
the universe, them, God--

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:46.790 align:middle line:90%
is the same?

00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: It is.

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:50.380 align:middle line:90%
I believe it's all the same.

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:53.830 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting, and what
a lot of ancient mystery

00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:56.590 align:middle line:84%
researchers don't
really pick up on,

00:41:56.590 --> 00:42:00.550 align:middle line:84%
is the work of Robert Temple,
who wrote "The Sirius Mystery."

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And he describes that
in ancient times,

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:05.230 align:middle line:84%
there were these things
called oracle octive

00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:08.590 align:middle line:84%
centers, of which like the
Oracle of Delphi was one.

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:12.700 align:middle line:10%
And they started off in
the city of Behdet in Egypt

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:17.020 align:middle line:10%
and they stretched all across
a vast geographic area one

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:19.570 align:middle line:10%
geodetic degree from each other.

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:22.840 align:middle line:10%
And each one of
those oracle temples

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:25.030 align:middle line:10%
was what they called
an omphalos stone.

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:27.400 align:middle line:10%
It was an egg shaped
stone that had a mesh

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:31.190 align:middle line:10%
pattern all around it, and
then a serpent wound about it.

00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:34.030 align:middle line:84%
It's the same stone that
you see in depictions

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:37.180 align:middle line:84%
of Enki on the baskets
that he's holding.

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And each one of these stones
was inscribed a phonetic vowel.

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:45.340 align:middle line:84%
There were eight of
them, all symbolic

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:47.920 align:middle line:90%
of a full musical octave.

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And when you uttered the
phonetic representation

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:54.280 align:middle line:84%
of each of those
vowels, it spelled

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:57.790 align:middle line:84%
out the eight lettered
unutterable name

00:42:57.790 --> 00:43:00.440 align:middle line:84%
that the Egyptian
priest talked about.

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And so basically,
the name of God

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:07.297 align:middle line:84%
is made up of harmonic
musical octaves.

00:43:07.297 --> 00:43:08.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:09.990 align:middle line:84%
Jack, thanks for being
on Beyond Belief.

00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:11.157 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Thank you very much.

00:43:11.157 --> 00:43:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You bring fascinating
theories to the mix here.

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:14.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Well, I appreciate it.

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Fascinating
work, investigating

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:19.150 align:middle line:10%
what happened at our
solar system, what

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:20.810 align:middle line:10%
happened at our universe.

00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:22.840 align:middle line:10%
It is truly
remarkable that there

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:27.340 align:middle line:10%
could have been other
civilizations that seeded us.

00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:31.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching Beyond Belief.
