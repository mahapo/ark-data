00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.110 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief"

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.480 align:middle line:10%
with our special
guest Jason Martell.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.520 align:middle line:10%
He is an acclaimed
researcher and lecturer

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.190 align:middle line:10%
in ancient civilization
technologies,

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.180 align:middle line:10%
and for over 20 years these
two realms of his business life

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.490 align:middle line:10%
and his personal
passion has served

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.230 align:middle line:10%
as a pillar of his career.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And he's here on "Beyond
Belief" to talk about it.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.380 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Jason.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.950 align:middle line:90%
>>JASON MARTELL: Hi, George.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:45.670 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me back.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Always good to see you.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Thank you.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.023 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Always good to see you.

00:00:48.023 --> 00:00:50.110 align:middle line:84%
How did you get involved
in ancient civilizations

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.145 align:middle line:90%
and studying those?

00:00:52.145 --> 00:00:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, you know,
it's been almost 20 years now.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That long?

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: I know.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:56.750 align:middle line:90%
Time flies.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:57.855 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It does.

00:00:57.855 --> 00:00:59.230 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTELL: When
I was in college,

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.647 align:middle line:10%
someone had mentioned
that there's

00:01:00.647 --> 00:01:02.650 align:middle line:10%
some structures
on Mars, possibly

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.770 align:middle line:10%
a face and some pyramids
that are artificial.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.450 align:middle line:10%
20 years ago this
was a different type

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.230 align:middle line:10%
of climate around these topics,
so I was a little skeptical

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.860 align:middle line:10%
and started to look into things
like the Freedom of Information

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.020 align:middle line:10%
Act, various space agencies
and what they were doing,

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.770 align:middle line:10%
and started to form my
own opinion around what's

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.590 align:middle line:10%
actually happening and started
to realize that there's

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.935 align:middle line:10%
a lot more going on
below the surface

00:01:25.935 --> 00:01:27.310 align:middle line:10%
if people start
to pay attention.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was a
lot of talk and brouhaha

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.670 align:middle line:84%
about the Mayan calendar
or December 21st, 2012.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Some people thought
the world would end.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Some people thought
nothing would happen.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.450 align:middle line:90%
Where did you fit in that camp?

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Yeah, and
so the Mayan calendar

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.360 align:middle line:84%
was really one of those
interesting topics

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.690 align:middle line:84%
that, for me, when I started
to look into ancient cultures,

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.070 align:middle line:90%
Mars kind of kicked it off.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.100 align:middle line:84%
But then I realized we have
topics all over our own planet.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.980 align:middle line:84%
Ancient sites,
ancient civilizations.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.530 align:middle line:84%
The Mayans were one of those
that really raised my eyebrows,

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.110 align:middle line:84%
because it started
to gain awareness

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.180 align:middle line:84%
that there is some type
of a calendar system

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.460 align:middle line:84%
and they're predicting
the end of time.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.400 align:middle line:84%
People misunderstood
this around 2012.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.130 align:middle line:84%
After 2012 passed, there
was a new understanding

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.900 align:middle line:84%
at looking at the Mayan calendar
to go, well, wait a minute.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.590 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't an ending of
time, it was an ending

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.750 align:middle line:90%
of an epoch of time, an age.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: An age, an epoch.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:18.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: So that's
where we started

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.310 align:middle line:84%
to realize that there's
a deeper history into how

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.490 align:middle line:84%
they viewed time using
astronomical movements.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.575 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How advanced
were the Mayans?

00:02:26.575 --> 00:02:29.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: You know, the Mayans
were a little bit more advanced

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.000 align:middle line:90%
than we give them credit for.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Even the Spaniards, when they
came there and aggressively

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.850 align:middle line:84%
converted everybody
to Christianity,

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.120 align:middle line:84%
they were very much intimidated
by the knowledge of the Mayans.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.730 align:middle line:84%
They had very advanced
astronomical knowledge

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.200 align:middle line:84%
and movements of the heavens,
and Diego de Landa and others

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.560 align:middle line:84%
that were coming there as these
Christian conquistadors were

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.840 align:middle line:84%
a little bit challenged
by the integrity

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.050 align:middle line:84%
and technological advances that
the Mayans already possessed.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They had a lot to
do with prophecy as well,

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.350 align:middle line:90%
did they not?

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: They did.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.810 align:middle line:84%
They had an
interesting calendar,

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.600 align:middle line:84%
which was a
prediction-based calendar,

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.760 align:middle line:84%
and they were known
as these baktuns,

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.960 align:middle line:84%
that they could predict
what would be happening.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.760 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they have
many baktuns, right?

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Many of them, right.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And I remember on
one of the stories,

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.758 align:middle line:84%
this is a little
interesting, where

00:03:14.758 --> 00:03:17.350 align:middle line:84%
they were predicting the
return of their god Kukulkan.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was right
around the time frame

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.240 align:middle line:84%
that the conquistadors
showed up,

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.930 align:middle line:84%
and so they thought that this
was the god Kukulkan returning

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.593 align:middle line:84%
in the glowing armor and
these white glowing sails.

00:03:29.593 --> 00:03:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out that
they were conquistadors

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.540 align:middle line:84%
and aggressively converted
everybody to Christianity

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.720 align:middle line:90%
and burned all the codices.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.700 align:middle line:90%
I think we have like three left.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:36.804 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:03:36.804 --> 00:03:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And brought diseases and
everything else, right?

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: All kinds
of other stuff.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.750 align:middle line:84%
So those prediction
calendars weren't

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.410 align:middle line:84%
always like Edgar
Cayce perfection,

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.970 align:middle line:90%
some advanced knowledge.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.350 align:middle line:84%
They were ways to predict
the changing and a larger

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.960 align:middle line:84%
understanding of the
things that affect time.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The documentary
"Mayan Revelations"

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.240 align:middle line:84%
depicted some of
these prophecies.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.900 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.720 align:middle line:10%
>> December 21st, 2012.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.270 align:middle line:10%
That was the last time in
which people around the world

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.010 align:middle line:10%
collectively thought the world
might actually come to an end.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.880 align:middle line:10%
This theory was based on a
supposed Mayan prophecy that

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.630 align:middle line:10%
proclaimed an
Armageddon was coming

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.240 align:middle line:10%
at the end of the 13th
baktun of the Mayan calendar.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.840 align:middle line:10%
This created a modern
obsession for the Mayan culture

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.860 align:middle line:10%
like no other, an obsession
that turned global

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.020 align:middle line:10%
when we learned about
the astonishingly

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.820 align:middle line:10%
accurate measurements of time
the ancient Mayans had made.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.000 align:middle line:10%
Lending credibility to
this conspiracy theory,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.630 align:middle line:10%
a string of natural disasters
with intensities not seen

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.170 align:middle line:10%
in recent times struck
our modern civilization

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.360 align:middle line:10%
and caught us very
much unprepared.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.580 align:middle line:10%
However, once the supposed date
of this Armageddon had passed,

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.800 align:middle line:10%
many of the doomsday
conspiracies

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.410 align:middle line:10%
quickly faded from memory,
though for some, many questions

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.080 align:middle line:10%
remained unanswered.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.950 align:middle line:10%
Had the Mayans made a mistake?

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.780 align:middle line:10%
Had their science been flawed?

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Or was it our very own
science that failed us?

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Must be fascinating
to tour some of the ruins

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:23.680 align:middle line:90%
to see what they've done.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: You know, lot
of these sites, George,

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.520 align:middle line:84%
like Chichen Itza, we have
these pyramids where they align

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.420 align:middle line:84%
in such a way where this
repeating, undulating snake

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.630 align:middle line:84%
comes down the
pyramid of Castillo.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And there's just
no way that they

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.860 align:middle line:84%
could have done this
by chance, to architect

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.120 align:middle line:90%
and design these things.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.990 align:middle line:84%
It really does lend to their
amazing base of technology

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.310 align:middle line:90%
that they must have had.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they have help?

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's been
all kinds of talk

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:55.170 align:middle line:84%
that that so-called figure
Lord Pakal came down from above

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.340 align:middle line:90%
and helped them out.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.813 align:middle line:90%
What's that all about?

00:05:57.813 --> 00:05:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, you
know, others in my field,

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.970 align:middle line:84%
David Childress,
many have concluded

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.840 align:middle line:84%
that the Mayans were possibly
led to their location

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.690 align:middle line:84%
by something they
called the Sky People.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.940 align:middle line:84%
It's really interesting to
look at their belief system

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:17.100 align:middle line:84%
and how they architect
their understanding of gods.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And there's
definitely a presence

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.390 align:middle line:84%
of a few different
gods that seem

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:25.190 align:middle line:84%
to be detached from the
local populace, meaning,

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.810 align:middle line:84%
you know, the Mayan
population are all dark skin,

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.300 align:middle line:90%
dark hair, shorter people.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.470 align:middle line:84%
Kukulkan, Quetzalcoatl,
large figures.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.920 align:middle line:84%
Skinny, pale skin,
red hair, even.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And Pakal, King Pakal, very
interesting because even

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.730 align:middle line:84%
to this day the sarcophagus
that he's in, you know,

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.230 align:middle line:84%
not only is it
amazing that they had

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.930 align:middle line:84%
to build this whole pyramid
over his sarcophagus,

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.677 align:middle line:84%
but that lid clearly shows
King Pakal manipulating what

00:06:52.677 --> 00:06:54.260 align:middle line:84%
looks like some type
of a rocket ship.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like he's in a
spaceship or something?

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: He's in
a spaceship, yeah.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even the local
tourism there now

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.722 align:middle line:84%
has embraced von Daniken's ideas
that, you know, you go there

00:07:03.722 --> 00:07:05.430 align:middle line:84%
and they're telling
you it's a spaceship,

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:11.022 align:middle line:84%
and you can buy the little
Pakal sarcophagus lid anywhere.

00:07:11.022 --> 00:07:12.480 align:middle line:84%
So the tourism
there has definitely

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.490 align:middle line:90%
been uplifted by these topics.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.765 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How old
is the sarcophagus?

00:07:16.765 --> 00:07:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: I'm not really sure
exactly when it was built.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.880 align:middle line:84%
That might be a better
crested question for someone

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.230 align:middle line:84%
like David Childress,
but you can

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:23.150 align:middle line:90%
Google it and find that fact.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.067 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But it's old.

00:07:24.067 --> 00:07:25.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: It is old.

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And the geography that
they find in going

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:35.100 align:middle line:84%
to where King Pakal is, they
find stalagmites, stalactites.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.017 align:middle line:84%
This is a sign that this
cave has been there--

00:07:37.017 --> 00:07:37.892 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A long time.

00:07:37.892 --> 00:07:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Possibly
thousands of years, yeah.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might they
have been visited?

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:41.490 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:42.540 align:middle line:90%
What's your gut tell you?

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: My gut says yes,
but whether they were aliens

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:45.780 align:middle line:90%
we don't know.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.140 align:middle line:84%
What we see is that
many of these cultures

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.200 align:middle line:84%
have been visited by
some lost race that

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.800 align:middle line:84%
left an imprint on them about
technology, building styles,

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.970 align:middle line:90%
astronomy.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.620 align:middle line:84%
But many other
cultures seem to have

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.765 align:middle line:84%
that imprint from
some lost race,

00:08:00.765 --> 00:08:02.640 align:middle line:84%
and we can't quite
pinpoint who they are yet.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
tie-in between the Mayans

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.960 align:middle line:90%
and the Martians?

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: I would say that
there has to be in the sense

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.000 align:middle line:84%
that if you ask the Mayans,
even the Mayans that exist today

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.880 align:middle line:84%
as elders living in
Guatemala and other areas,

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.070 align:middle line:90%
they still do this chanting.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.350 align:middle line:84%
That is to say they're
connecting with these Sky

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:20.610 align:middle line:90%
People, their ancient gods.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:22.560 align:middle line:84%
They say at some
point there will

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.380 align:middle line:84%
be an Armageddon or
some global catastrophe,

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.990 align:middle line:84%
and this chanting keeps
them connected to be

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:30.480 align:middle line:84%
saved from their gods in
their own view system.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I know
one Maya, and he's

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.770 align:middle line:84%
one of the hardest-working
guys I know.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, he's
dedicated to what he does,

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.350 align:middle line:84%
and he helps clean
buildings at night.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:45.480 align:middle line:84%
But I picture him back
several thousand years ago,

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.450 align:middle line:84%
and what remarkable
people they were.

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:50.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Very
resilient, very smart.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.513 align:middle line:84%
And again, when the
conquistadors showed up,

00:08:52.513 --> 00:08:54.180 align:middle line:84%
they were the ones
that were intimidated

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.940 align:middle line:84%
by the Mayans' advances in
technology and understandings

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.140 align:middle line:90%
of space and time.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
people were there?

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.125 align:middle line:90%
Was it a big civilization?

00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Yeah, the
Mayan civilization

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:07.820 align:middle line:84%
extended for at least
1,400 years in that area.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.050 align:middle line:84%
But again, there's
been migration patterns

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.990 align:middle line:84%
showing that they probably
came from other areas.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.420 align:middle line:84%
Childress thinks there's
a lot of connections

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.150 align:middle line:84%
with this ancient race
known as the Olmecs,

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:21.990 align:middle line:84%
and we see that there was some
type of trans-oceanic contact

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:26.190 align:middle line:84%
from Asia and Vietnam and some
of these other places that

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:29.970 align:middle line:84%
brought civilization, maybe it
was this advanced lost race,

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.430 align:middle line:84%
brought civilization
to the Mayan continent

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:33.607 align:middle line:90%
and continued to flourish.

00:09:33.607 --> 00:09:35.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And now
where have they gone?

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:36.810 align:middle line:90%
They've scattered everywhere.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Yeah.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.810 align:middle line:84%
The Mayans are basically
in various other parts

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:41.050 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:43.320 align:middle line:84%
There's a big presence
still in Guatemala.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them
that are elders still

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.350 align:middle line:84%
uphold these
traditions of chanting

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.140 align:middle line:84%
and an ancient understanding
of watching the skies

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.810 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
that time is affected

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:56.670 align:middle line:90%
by the movements of the heavens.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you impressed
with the Mayan technology

00:09:59.020 --> 00:09:59.820 align:middle line:90%
of the past?

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.230 align:middle line:90%
And did they have any tools?

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.670 align:middle line:90%
Was there any artifacts around?

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:05.087 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: You know, there's
only certain things like King

00:10:05.087 --> 00:10:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Pakal's sarcophagus or the
Chichen Itza layout where

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.400 align:middle line:84%
this Kukulkan is coming down
the side of the pyramid,

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.570 align:middle line:90%
the architecture.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.420 align:middle line:84%
We haven't really found
any whiz-bang technology

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.640 align:middle line:84%
components, but I
also think, George,

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.030 align:middle line:84%
that there's another
layer there that Nazis

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:23.610 align:middle line:84%
and various other
parties, for a long time

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.440 align:middle line:84%
they've been seeking
out advanced relics,

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.360 align:middle line:84%
and have scooped up any
of the really good stuff.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think the
Mayans might have been

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.312 align:middle line:90%
the protectors of the planet?

00:10:33.312 --> 00:10:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: I think at some
point they were definitely

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.300 align:middle line:84%
connected to, let's call it
this geodetic world energy

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:43.050 align:middle line:84%
grid of ancient sites, where
technology and knowledge was

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:44.410 align:middle line:90%
being shared.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So Mayan civilization seems
to have been influenced

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.430 align:middle line:84%
by other advanced
cultures, and they

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:53.100 align:middle line:84%
were sharing knowledge
in a way that I

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.490 align:middle line:84%
think still kind of dumbfounds
modern science and archeology.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason, tell us a
little bit about precession.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.907 align:middle line:90%
What exactly is that?

00:11:00.907 --> 00:11:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, precession
is a very interesting topic.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:07.140 align:middle line:84%
Today, we kind of explain
it in saying that there's

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.060 align:middle line:90%
a lunar solar wobble.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.060 align:middle line:84%
The moon is affecting the wobble
of the Earth in such a way

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:17.190 align:middle line:84%
so that the orientation of our
North Star every 2,000 years

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:19.080 align:middle line:90%
is pointing to a new North Star.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, their version of
precession, you know,

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.870 align:middle line:84%
modern times, is very complex,
thousands of variables

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.730 align:middle line:90%
of motion and torque.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And so precession is something
that we want to understand,

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:34.110 align:middle line:84%
because many, many ancient
cultures, over 30 of them,

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.850 align:middle line:90%
were tracking precession.

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you consider
the modern view of it,

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.420 align:middle line:90%
it's a 26,000-year cycle.

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.630 align:middle line:84%
I take a slightly different
view of precession,

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.730 align:middle line:84%
which we'll discuss
a little bit, on some

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.340 align:middle line:84%
of the influences
of ancient cultures,

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.910 align:middle line:84%
over 30 ancient cultures,
that watch the heavens.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And their version of
precession puts it

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:01.342 align:middle line:84%
more in a cycle of about 24,000
years rather than 26,000.

00:12:01.342 --> 00:12:03.800 align:middle line:84%
So there's some variations on
how we view precession today.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's a couple
thousand years over time,

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.150 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.608 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: You know, I don't
think it's that big of a deal,

00:12:08.608 --> 00:12:10.800 align:middle line:84%
but when we move it to
a 24,000-year cycle,

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.860 align:middle line:84%
we see alignment with the
idea that there's 12 houses

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:18.030 align:middle line:84%
of the zodiac broken down into
12 parts, each constellation.

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:21.817 align:middle line:84%
And we move through each
zodiacal age every 2,000 years.

00:12:21.817 --> 00:12:24.150 align:middle line:84%
It's just a happier set of
numbers that work out better.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a book
called Hamlet's Mill that

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.150 align:middle line:90%
somehow ties into this.

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:29.130 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: So there were
a couple MIT professors

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.330 align:middle line:84%
that actually tracked
over 30 ancient cultures

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:37.340 align:middle line:84%
all using house of
the zodiac references.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.040 align:middle line:84%
We've broken the heaven
down into 12 parts

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.680 align:middle line:84%
and assigned a
symbol to each house.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.020 align:middle line:84%
So somehow over 30
ancient cultures

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:46.700 align:middle line:84%
were watching
precession and knew

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:51.380 align:middle line:84%
that it was a cycle, that we
seem to go into a dark age,

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:53.990 align:middle line:84%
and then come out of it
and go into a golden age.

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:55.130 align:middle line:90%
And the cycle repeats.

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:57.680 align:middle line:84%
We've all heard of the
Golden Age and the Dark Age.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Precession seems to somehow
connect these terms as time

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:04.160 align:middle line:90%
being a cyclical process.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's a whole new lens to
look through our ancient times.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.958 align:middle line:84%
Some of the oldest
sites, Gobekli Tepe,

00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.000 align:middle line:90%
first dynastic pharoahs--

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:11.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Giza.

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:12.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Giza.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.390 align:middle line:84%
The older back we go,
the more complex it is.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.560 align:middle line:84%
The further we come to us
and the Renaissance era,

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.780 align:middle line:90%
it's Game of Thrones.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.100 align:middle line:84%
We forgot all the
ancient knowledge.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.390 align:middle line:90%
We're now relearning it.

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:27.920 align:middle line:84%
Precession is somehow guiding
this lost age, dark age,

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.090 align:middle line:90%
golden age cycle.

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:32.150 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be guided and moved
by the motions of the planets.

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did we
lose the knowledge?

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:36.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we don't know how
the pyramids were made.

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:40.040 align:middle line:84%
We've got all kinds of theories
about that from poured,

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.730 align:middle line:84%
to the blocks were pulled
by thousands of Egyptians,

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:48.370 align:middle line:84%
to sound resonance that
moved them into place,

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:50.060 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial help.

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.690 align:middle line:84%
How did we lose the
knowledge of that?

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:52.490 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:55.220 align:middle line:84%
Something just stopped,
and we lost it.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:56.498 align:middle line:90%
There was no carryover.

00:13:56.498 --> 00:13:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: That's
really the question

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.170 align:middle line:84%
for me, George, of what
I'm trying to figure out.

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:02.690 align:middle line:84%
There's enough evidence
to show that we've

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:05.300 align:middle line:84%
been losing this
knowledge gradually

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.070 align:middle line:84%
for thousands of
years as we proceeded

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.110 align:middle line:90%
into the last dark age.

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Coming out of that dark
age, we have Renaissance,

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:13.910 align:middle line:90%
Galileo, Copernicus.

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:16.250 align:middle line:84%
Wait a minute, earth
isn't the center.

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:17.600 align:middle line:90%
We're orbiting the sun.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.610 align:middle line:84%
Wait a minute,
precession is telling us

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:21.500 align:middle line:90%
that there's a larger cycle.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:25.200 align:middle line:84%
So this knowledge is lost to
us through some natural process

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.700 align:middle line:84%
that I'm still
trying to figure out.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.158 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I can give the
Twitter version of explaining

00:14:29.158 --> 00:14:32.780 align:middle line:84%
it is there's possibly
something tied to precession

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:34.370 align:middle line:90%
that we actually have two suns.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:36.240 align:middle line:90%
That we're a binary system.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And if you think of all
the energy and enthusiasm

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:43.670 align:middle line:84%
we feel in summertime because
of the sun's strength, what if,

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:46.220 align:middle line:84%
in a binary system if
we have two suns, what

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.560 align:middle line:84%
if there's a point in our
past where there's not just

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.750 align:middle line:84%
one sun in the sky,
but there's two,

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:54.500 align:middle line:84%
and the energy provided
by these two sources

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.020 align:middle line:84%
enlightens us or allows
us to evolve faster

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.150 align:middle line:90%
and we're in a golden age?

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:02.600 align:middle line:84%
So when we come out of
that, this natural process

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.840 align:middle line:84%
of our second sun
being too far away,

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.160 align:middle line:90%
it's a very complex topic.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.730 align:middle line:84%
But astronomical movements
seem to affect our ability

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:13.890 align:middle line:84%
to retain and know
things faster.

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:16.610 align:middle line:84%
So maybe when we're in
the last golden age it's

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:18.830 align:middle line:84%
super easy for us to
have advanced knowledge,

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.920 align:middle line:84%
talk to extraterrestrials,
advanced beings.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.393 align:middle line:84%
Then we forget
all that knowledge

00:15:23.393 --> 00:15:25.310 align:middle line:84%
and they're not as
interested in talking to us

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:27.000 align:middle line:84%
until we relearn
that information.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This
binary star system,

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.480 align:middle line:84%
which some people have
said is indeed the fact,

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:35.760 align:middle line:84%
would have that other star way,
way out in the solar system

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:36.560 align:middle line:90%
somewhere.

about this for a long time.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.160 align:middle line:84%
a Planet X, if there
is another star,

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.350 align:middle line:84%
could there be another
planet like Sitchin talked

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:46.310 align:middle line:90%
about that's coming around?

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:47.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: But this
other star system, again,

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.180 align:middle line:90%
there's knowledge there.

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:52.700 align:middle line:84%
The other star system
best candidate is probably

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Sirius, Sirius A and B.
That star system connected

00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:00.860 align:middle line:84%
to our star system in a binary
rotation around each other

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.990 align:middle line:84%
make for an interesting
dance of understanding

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:06.650 align:middle line:84%
that Sirius has its own
planets and life evolving.

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And lots of ancient
cultures point

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:12.020 align:middle line:84%
to that as the source of
extraterrestrials visiting us.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of
experts have said, Jason,

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:19.070 align:middle line:84%
that past civilizations go
back way farther than we think.

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:24.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Up until recently, archeology
placed the origins of what we

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.900 align:middle line:10%
would call civilization
back about 3,000,

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:32.840 align:middle line:10%
3,500 BC with the rise of
Sumer and Egypt and India.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.350 align:middle line:10%
China as well.

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:37.250 align:middle line:10%
But over the last
four or five decades,

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:40.130 align:middle line:10%
it's becoming clear
that there was plenty

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:42.410 align:middle line:10%
going on before that.

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:45.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Recent discoveries of complex
structures near Hamoukar,

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:50.740 align:middle line:10%
Syria are estimated to date
back almost 6,000 years.

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:54.220 align:middle line:10%
Still more startling, a team
of Indian oceanographers

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:57.160 align:middle line:10%
has found the remains
of a huge city submerged

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.140 align:middle line:10%
in the Gulf of Cambay.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:02.350 align:middle line:10%
An astounding 10 square
miles in size, the city

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:07.230 align:middle line:10%
has been carbon dated
at 9,500 years old.

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:10.500 align:middle line:10%
And in Nabta Playa,
Egypt a circle of stones

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:14.760 align:middle line:10%
acts as a calendar star map that

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.520 align:middle line:10%
and possibly their distances.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:23.780 align:middle line:10%
Archeologists believe the site
might be as old as 10,000 BC.

bit of archaeological evidence

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.382 align:middle line:90%
back.

00:17:42.382 --> 00:17:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm waiting
for James Earl Jones

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:46.430 align:middle line:90%
to say "Luke, I'm your father."

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:47.900 align:middle line:90%
Great voice.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.100 align:middle line:90%
Great voice indeed.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:51.500 align:middle line:84%
What does that tell
you, what we just saw?

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: It tells
me that there's

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:56.750 align:middle line:84%
evidence of ancient cultures
going back much further than we

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:58.340 align:middle line:90%
currently attribute time.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:05.390 align:middle line:84%
So we see sites like Giza
and Nazca, and ancient Sumer,

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:08.180 align:middle line:84%
and wonder, are they
aligned to the cultures

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.430 align:middle line:84%
that we're saying
built those structures?

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And it appears that a
lot of these structures

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:16.040 align:middle line:84%
are being given
fresh coats of paint

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:20.450 align:middle line:84%
or just redone by that
current civilization.

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:22.280 align:middle line:84%
But some of these
structures are going back

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.490 align:middle line:84%
to a time period which is
off the current records

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:28.790 align:middle line:90%
of our history, 10,000 BC plus.

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:31.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's really
starting to, I think,

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.340 align:middle line:84%
force us to look
further back in time,

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:38.180 align:middle line:84%
and try and make new connections
and understandings to explain

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.978 align:middle line:84%
what before, scholars and
archaeologists would say,

00:18:40.978 --> 00:18:43.020 align:middle line:84%
those are connections that
we just want to ignore

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.420 align:middle line:90%
because we can't explain.

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there purposes
behind these structures?

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:51.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, who would make
them for no reason?

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:53.780 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be something
specific why they're there.

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:54.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: I think
there is, and there's

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:55.970 align:middle line:90%
a couple of ways to look at it.

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:58.010 align:middle line:84%
When we look at some of
these megalithic sites,

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Giza, Stonehenge, even Nan
Madol in the middle of nowhere.

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:08.450 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these sites show
a type of brilliance,

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:13.220 align:middle line:84%
and they're geodetically
placed that somehow in the past

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:15.830 align:middle line:84%
they could have been sharing
some type of subtle energy.

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, I theorize
that when we talk

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:21.110 align:middle line:84%
about the idea of a
golden age and then

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:24.470 align:middle line:84%
descending out of a golden age,
the advances they could have

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:28.970 align:middle line:84%
been making in saying wow,
this natural energy keeps us

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:31.400 align:middle line:84%
at this highest
state of evolution.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.950 align:middle line:84%
We need to somehow naturally
harness this energy.

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:37.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's very possible that a lot
of these ancient sites, which

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:41.580 align:middle line:84%
we still don't understand how,
Giza as a power plant perhaps,

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.380 align:middle line:90%
were generating--

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
Christopher Dunn's theory.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: That's right.

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they were generating
this natural energy

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.500 align:middle line:84%
and trying to hold
onto the essence that

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.410 align:middle line:84%
allows us to stay in
a higher evolved state

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:53.400 align:middle line:90%
and pump that around the planet.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.150 align:middle line:84%
That's one idea, is
to keep the golden age

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.980 align:middle line:90%
energies as long as we can.

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:01.820 align:middle line:84%
The other idea is that it was
literally a shared energy.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Craft or vessels of
any kind traveling

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.300 align:middle line:84%
to these ancient sites would
be able to "power up" somehow

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.312 align:middle line:84%
from the stored energy
at these locations.

00:20:10.312 --> 00:20:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would
they know this, Jason?

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.300 align:middle line:90%
How would they know this?

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: You know, these
are all theories right now,

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:17.060 align:middle line:84%
but what we see, George,
is that all the brilliance

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:20.390 align:middle line:84%
at these locations add up
to something being more

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:23.300 align:middle line:84%
than just a tomb, more
than just a monument that

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.820 align:middle line:90%
was dedicated to a god.

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:27.290 align:middle line:90%
They had purposes.

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And if we dig deeper, like
Erich von Daniken has done.

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:33.470 align:middle line:84%
He's actually found that
some of these sites,

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:35.310 align:middle line:84%
in Mexico for instance,
these pyramids.

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:38.150 align:middle line:84%
They found things underground
where they opened it up

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:42.380 align:middle line:84%
and it's a huge vat of
mica, that crystalline-like

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.570 align:middle line:84%
substance, mica,
very bright white.

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And it used to coat the
whole surface of the pyramid.

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:49.220 align:middle line:84%
So there's pieces
of the past, how

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.020 align:middle line:84%
we can look at a lot
of these structures,

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.150 align:middle line:84%
and try and figure out
what they were used for.

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:55.550 align:middle line:84%
We just need to continue
to dig deeper and use

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:58.858 align:middle line:84%
current technology to make
better connections as to how

00:20:58.858 --> 00:20:59.900 align:middle line:90%
they were being utilized.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:01.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you could
jump into a time machine

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:06.330 align:middle line:84%
and go back into time, what
era would you go back to?

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: I'd probably want
to go back to around 4,000 BC.

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:16.730 align:middle line:84%
We see a lot of advances with
Sumer, Mesopotamia, Babylon,

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:18.230 align:middle line:90%
the evolution in that area.

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And also Giza, you
know, what we see

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:24.040 align:middle line:84%
there is just a time when
even the pharaohs would

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.520 align:middle line:84%
be able to walk
down the pyramid,

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:29.260 align:middle line:84%
be right at the banks of
the Nile, get on a boat,

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.375 align:middle line:90%
do their thing.

00:21:30.375 --> 00:21:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And now we see
thousands of years

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:35.770 align:middle line:84%
later that the Nile has moved
miles away from the pyramid,

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:38.080 align:middle line:84%
and we wonder how long
the pyramids and the Nile

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.250 align:middle line:90%
have actually been there.

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:40.720 align:middle line:84%
How long,
geographically, does it

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:44.320 align:middle line:84%
take for those types of
changes to take place?

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The ancient
civilization of the Dogon tribe

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:51.010 align:middle line:84%
talked about the
Sirius star system

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:53.620 align:middle line:84%
that you mentioned earlier,
and talked about it

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:55.810 align:middle line:90%
as a binary star system.

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:59.590 align:middle line:84%
How in God's name
would primitive tribes

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:03.670 align:middle line:84%
have known there was a binary
star system when we didn't know

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:06.272 align:middle line:90%
it hundreds of years later?

00:22:06.272 --> 00:22:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: It really
raises a lot of questions,

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:10.090 align:middle line:84%
and when people visit
the Dogon tribe,

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:14.950 align:middle line:84%
they see that they're still
surrounded by their own process

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:16.210 align:middle line:90%
of evolution.

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:18.430 align:middle line:90%
They haven't really let inside--

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:21.640 align:middle line:84%
they haven't actually let
technology into their culture.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.160 align:middle line:84%
So they're not using
advanced mathematics,

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.470 align:middle line:84%
they're not using telescopes,
all the things that

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:30.640 align:middle line:84%
would be needed to be able to
identify that Sirius is made up

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.662 align:middle line:90%
of two stars A and B.

00:22:32.662 --> 00:22:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And having this advanced
knowledge not only of Sirius

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:37.030 align:middle line:84%
but also of the
Orion constellation,

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:40.150 align:middle line:84%
and tracking this
knowledge, what we see here

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:42.700 align:middle line:84%
is that the Dogon tribe
actually attributes

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:46.930 align:middle line:84%
a lot of this knowledge to these
gods that come from Sirius.

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And there seems to be a pattern
when we look at other cultures

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.640 align:middle line:84%
around not only are these
beings coming from Sirius,

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.430 align:middle line:84%
but how they describe
these beings.

00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Amphibious beings, somehow
water-like creatures,

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:04.360 align:middle line:90%
almost mermen, if you will.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a
look at the Dogon tribe.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:10.640 align:middle line:90%


00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:14.570 align:middle line:10%
>> The Dogon tribe of West
Africa were discovered in 1935

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:18.260 align:middle line:10%
by two French anthropologists,
Griaule and Dieterlen were

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:20.930 align:middle line:10%
their names.

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:23.690 align:middle line:10%
These two anthropologists
eventually

00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:26.870 align:middle line:10%
gained the respect
of the Dogon shaman

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:31.460 align:middle line:10%
and were allowed to hear
their sacred knowledge.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.650 align:middle line:10%
What amazed these
anthropologists

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:37.130 align:middle line:10%
was that the Dogon tribe
possessed knowledge

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:41.120 align:middle line:10%
of the Sirius star system that
no ancient people should ever

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.530 align:middle line:10%
have possessed.

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:47.960 align:middle line:10%
The Dogon tribe told them
that not only was there

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.510 align:middle line:10%
a relationship between
Sirius and our star,

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:53.570 align:middle line:10%
but they claim that a
group of what could only

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:57.230 align:middle line:10%
be described as alien
creatures, called the Nommos,

00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:59.570 align:middle line:10%
descended down to earth.

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:03.770 align:middle line:10%
And that this group of
beings imparted to them

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:07.040 align:middle line:10%
the knowledge that they then
possessed about the Sirius star

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:07.940 align:middle line:10%
system.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:10.010 align:middle line:10%
What they couldn't
understand was

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:13.280 align:middle line:10%
how it was they had
knowledge of Sirius B, which

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:14.930 align:middle line:10%
is a white dwarf star.

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:18.740 align:middle line:10%
It's the smallest form of
visible star that we know of,

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:22.160 align:middle line:10%
and we can barely see it
with modern day telescopes.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.550 align:middle line:10%
And yet, they knew of
its absolute existence

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:30.350 align:middle line:10%
and they called it Po Tolo,
which is a tiny seed found

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:31.880 align:middle line:10%
in West Africa.

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:35.080 align:middle line:10%
And they said it's a tiny star,
but it's the heaviest thing

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:35.880 align:middle line:10%
that there is.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:38.990 align:middle line:10%
Well, they were
alluding to the fact

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:41.780 align:middle line:10%
that white dwarf stars
have some of the highest

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:46.130 align:middle line:10%
density of any stellar
bodies that we know of.

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:48.830 align:middle line:10%
And that's not something
an ancient people should

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:50.075 align:middle line:10%
have known anything about.

00:24:50.075 --> 00:24:51.700 align:middle line:90%


00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's one of the
most incredible stories

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:55.820 align:middle line:90%
I've ever heard.

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:57.710 align:middle line:84%
There's no other
way that they would

00:24:57.710 --> 00:25:00.343 align:middle line:84%
possess this kind of knowledge
unless they were told it.

00:25:00.343 --> 00:25:01.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: I think so.

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:02.635 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And who
would tell them?

00:25:02.635 --> 00:25:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Well, the Nommoly.

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:06.410 align:middle line:10%
Their gods that they
depict are actually

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:08.930 align:middle line:10%
the ones that they're saying
bequeathed this knowledge

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:09.380 align:middle line:10%
to them.

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:10.190 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They came down.

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:12.023 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTELL: And as you'll
see, other cultures

00:25:12.023 --> 00:25:16.610 align:middle line:10%
seem to share in this knowledge
of some type of mermen

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:20.270 align:middle line:10%
or some type of a god
that has aquatics attached

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:22.430 align:middle line:10%
to it coming from Sirius.

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:26.308 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could they have learned
this through astral projection?

00:25:26.308 --> 00:25:27.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: A lot of the--

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But if they did,
they would have said that.

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: I think
it's interesting,

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.270 align:middle line:84%
though, that a lot of
the ancient cultures

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:36.980 align:middle line:84%
did use a trance-like
state, either meditative or

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:40.640 align:middle line:84%
chemically-induced, and they
actually have very constructive

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:44.210 align:middle line:84%
conversations and pulled data
out of that Akashic record

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:46.970 align:middle line:84%
somehow and apply it into the
physical term where they then

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:50.120 align:middle line:84%
have complex mathematical
understandings and things

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.730 align:middle line:84%
that they say they gained
from their spiritual journey.

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:55.880 align:middle line:84%
So maybe, but no, they
write on the walls

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:59.750 align:middle line:84%
and make descriptions of saying
these beings came from Sirius.

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:02.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about
the Dagon of Mesopotamia.

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Right, so what's
an interesting correlation

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:09.920 align:middle line:84%
is we see not only the Dogon
coming from Sirius and the idea

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:13.010 align:middle line:84%
that Sirius is also
known as the dog star.

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:15.770 align:middle line:84%
So we see the Dogon
tribe, possibly

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:20.600 align:middle line:84%
referencing dog star Sirius,
but other cultures as well.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Even going back to Mesopotamia,
of the god Dagon, which

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:28.250 align:middle line:84%
is a derivative of the
earliest Sumerian god,

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:30.693 align:middle line:84%
Enki and Enlil,
these two versions.

00:26:30.693 --> 00:26:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And so when we look
at this, we actually

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:36.020 align:middle line:84%
see that there's a version
of the Sumerian god depicted

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:38.120 align:middle line:90%
as a merman, a fish.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the
same representation

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.340 align:middle line:90%
of what we have of Dagon.

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:43.880 align:middle line:84%
He's depicted as
a merman, a fish.

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:47.810 align:middle line:84%
So we see these same connections
referencing Sirius, but also

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:48.800 align:middle line:90%
verbally.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Could it have been some race
that came from the dog star

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:55.970 align:middle line:84%
and it has been influencing
the Dogon tribe?

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Or is it the Dagon
Mesopotamian god?

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And various other
cultures, as you'll see.

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
the Dagon like Japan?

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:03.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: That's right.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:07.220 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the Dogu statues
that we have in Japan.

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:10.460 align:middle line:84%
Again, we have these
references of their gods,

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:12.020 align:middle line:84%
and if you look at
the Dogu statues,

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:13.097 align:middle line:90%
they look like spacemen.

00:27:13.097 --> 00:27:14.680 align:middle line:84%
They look like they're
in space suits.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
look human at all.

00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: What's
really interesting, too,

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:20.030 align:middle line:84%
George, is that we always
have been theorizing up

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:24.860 align:middle line:84%
to this point, Dogu,
Dagon, dog star.

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:26.150 align:middle line:90%
Could these be spacemen?

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:29.180 align:middle line:84%
They all have a
water god reference.

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:33.350 align:middle line:84%
However, if you look at these
statues of the Dogu from Japan,

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:36.440 align:middle line:84%
they also could be--
look like the 1800s dive

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:39.750 align:middle line:84%
suits, ancient dive suits
with the big helmets

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:41.000 align:middle line:90%
where you would be underwater.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:41.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:42.680 align:middle line:90%
Scuba divers.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Scuba divers.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.220 align:middle line:84%
So it could be that maybe, we
haven't made this connection

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:48.470 align:middle line:84%
yet, but it could be that
all these ancient gods being

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:50.600 align:middle line:84%
depicted as merman
and then being

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.390 align:middle line:84%
designed in these big suits,
maybe they weren't spacemen.

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:56.060 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they were underwater
gods that somehow

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.290 align:middle line:90%
were rising to the surface.

00:27:57.290 --> 00:27:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
the Chinese culture?

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: So again, we have the
same trade-off there of Dogu,

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Dagon, and in China
we have dragon,

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:11.660 align:middle line:84%
a certain slight derivative of
the word Dagu, Dagon, dragon.

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And all the references
of the various emperors

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:17.510 align:middle line:84%
that were able to take a
dragon-like form actually

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:21.320 align:middle line:84%
came from some type of
reptilian background.

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And again, if we look into
the origins of a dragon,

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:28.143 align:middle line:84%
it started as an amphibious
creature in the water.

00:28:28.143 --> 00:28:29.560 align:middle line:84%
A lot of connections
there when we

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:34.120 align:middle line:84%
start to realize many cultures
referencing Sirius and then

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:37.652 align:middle line:84%
using this derivative of
Dagon, Dogu, dog star,

00:28:37.652 --> 00:28:39.610 align:middle line:84%
to describe the beings
that were visiting them.

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:43.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why isn't modern
science more into this?

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:46.410 align:middle line:84%
There should be 100
Jason Martells out there,

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:47.362 align:middle line:90%
and there aren't.

00:28:47.362 --> 00:28:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: You know, I don't
know the answer to that,

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:51.370 align:middle line:84%
George, only to
compare it to what

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:55.480 align:middle line:84%
we see happening now with like
ATIP, Advanced Aerial Threat

00:28:55.480 --> 00:29:00.900 align:middle line:84%
Intercept Program, and
the Navy's changing view

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:02.080 align:middle line:90%
on saying this stuff.

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.060 align:middle line:84%
I think up till now
there's been a reluctance

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:07.210 align:middle line:84%
to talk about these topics
from mainstream science.

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And political standpoint is
just to simply ignore it.

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:13.270 align:middle line:84%
We don't have an answer,
let's sweep it under the rug

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:14.170 align:middle line:90%
and ignore it.

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:16.060 align:middle line:90%
That seems to be changing now.

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And so just like the advances
in our modern ufology and making

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:23.530 align:middle line:84%
changes, I think to
the past, we also

00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:25.960 align:middle line:84%
need to just be a
little more open-minded,

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.660 align:middle line:84%
dig a little deeper, and
look for the connections that

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:32.380 align:middle line:84%
do exist but still
elude us slightly.

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's dramatic, it's
puzzling, is it frustrating?

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Yeah, it's
a little frustrating.

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Up till now, the people who have
had the keys to these sites,

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:47.220 align:middle line:84%
and not that I would fault
them, but like Giza and someone

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:48.633 align:middle line:90%
like Zahi Hawass--

00:29:48.633 --> 00:29:49.883 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's out now, though.

00:29:49.883 --> 00:29:50.683 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Yeah.

00:29:50.683 --> 00:29:53.600 align:middle line:84%
They've always been very tied
to their historical background

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.730 align:middle line:90%
to represent that area.

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:58.860 align:middle line:90%
Mayan, Egyptian, Sumerian.

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Even in India, the
lost city of Dwarka.

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:06.562 align:middle line:84%
Right off the coast there's
a 13-mile sunken city.

00:30:06.562 --> 00:30:08.520 align:middle line:84%
But if you ask the people
on the land in India,

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.812 align:middle line:84%
they're all political about
what's that city's meaning,

00:30:10.812 --> 00:30:13.260 align:middle line:84%
and who was using
it, what it means.

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:18.030 align:middle line:84%
So we just we just need to
rally up and cross-culturally

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:20.220 align:middle line:84%
start to compare our
evidence a little better.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:22.790 align:middle line:84%
Thankfully, shows like
Ancient Aliens and other--

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:25.110 align:middle line:84%
the internet, obviously,
we're starting

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:27.450 align:middle line:84%
to collaborate a lot more
on these ancient sites

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:30.450 align:middle line:84%
and not just look at from
our own historical background

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:32.970 align:middle line:84%
from that culture, but
cross-culturally, you

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:36.630 align:middle line:84%
can see that under the
theory of ancient astronauts,

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:40.050 align:middle line:84%
all cultures have these
references of sky beings,

00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:42.180 align:middle line:90%
seeing people flying around.

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Holistically, it starts to
give us a better picture.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well Zahi
Hawass, as you mentioned,

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:50.780 align:middle line:84%
who used to head up Egypt's
Antiquities Department,

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:53.010 align:middle line:84%
he'd be incensed
if you brought up

00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:57.030 align:middle line:84%
any kind of extraterrestrial
happenings around the pyramids.

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:58.350 align:middle line:90%
Everything was all Egyptian.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:00.392 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: I literally
think like 10 years ago he

00:31:00.392 --> 00:31:02.460 align:middle line:84%
was on your show, and I
called in and asked him

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:05.070 align:middle line:84%
about the face on Mars,
saying, look, there's

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:08.700 align:middle line:84%
pyramids and a Sphinx in Egypt,
and you have a Sphinx-like face

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.450 align:middle line:90%
and pyramids on Mars.

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, show me
one piece of evidence.

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:13.950 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's fine,
and I respect Zahi

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:18.325 align:middle line:84%
and that he is entrenched
in his beliefs,

00:31:18.325 --> 00:31:19.950 align:middle line:84%
but what I just think
is interesting is

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:23.010 align:middle line:84%
that those traditional
entrenched set of beliefs

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:25.020 align:middle line:84%
that we have for
many other experts

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:26.100 align:middle line:90%
are now being challenged.

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Because from a
culture perspective,

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:30.480 align:middle line:84%
you might have some
validity, but you

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.540 align:middle line:84%
can't fight all the global
cultures aligning together

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:36.720 align:middle line:84%
to say, we see patterns that
exist beyond just what you're

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:37.560 align:middle line:90%
seeing locally.

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I also asked him
about Cairo, because Cairo

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:44.540 align:middle line:90%
means Mars, and he went nuts.

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: That's great.

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But that's
what it means in Arabic.

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.650 align:middle line:90%
Cairo means Mars.

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:48.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: That's
a great connection.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:49.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's good stuff.

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, how
could that happen?

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:54.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: There's got to
be something to it for sure.

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:55.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:59.010 align:middle line:84%
Talking about Mars,
when we go there,

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:01.680 align:middle line:84%
when we send astronauts
to Mars, what do you

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.390 align:middle line:90%
think we're going to find?

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:04.765 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well
that's the thing,

00:32:04.765 --> 00:32:07.440 align:middle line:84%
George, is looking at all
these ancient cultures, Mayans,

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.850 align:middle line:90%
Egyptians, Aztec.

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:12.660 align:middle line:84%
They all seem to have references
in their ancient past to using

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:13.470 align:middle line:90%
Mars.

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:16.740 align:middle line:84%
Even the Sumerians, with
Zecharia Sitchin's research,

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:19.080 align:middle line:84%
talk about Mars
as a way station.

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:22.482 align:middle line:84%
They would mine gold on
earth, transported it to Mars,

00:32:22.482 --> 00:32:24.690 align:middle line:84%
and then they would take it
to where they were going,

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:26.310 align:middle line:90%
Nibiru or whatever.

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:middle line:84%
So what I think
is interesting is

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.060 align:middle line:84%
that all across our
cultures, there's

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:32.910 align:middle line:84%
references of Mars
being used by the gods.

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:35.103 align:middle line:84%
So when we travel
to Mars, I think

00:32:35.103 --> 00:32:37.020 align:middle line:84%
we're finally going to
be able to uncover some

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:39.390 align:middle line:84%
of the myths that
have been there,

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:44.773 align:middle line:84%
even since Schiaparelli
seeing canali.

00:32:44.773 --> 00:32:47.190 align:middle line:84%
I think they're all going to
be validated once we actually

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:50.700 align:middle line:84%
go there and see that, yeah,
life's been there, is there.

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And the [INAUDIBLE] to be able
to have life today probably

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:56.250 align:middle line:84%
still exists with some
type of atmosphere.

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:58.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is NASA holding
back information on Mars,

00:32:58.830 --> 00:32:59.760 align:middle line:90%
in your opinion?

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Yes, I do
believe that NASA, not

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:05.130 align:middle line:84%
for some cover-up
reason, they're

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:07.470 align:middle line:90%
just been aggregating data.

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the data they've
been taking in over the last 20

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:14.310 align:middle line:84%
years from landers and orbiters
shows that the surface of Mars

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:19.770 align:middle line:84%
is generating methane gas like
dying plants, plant material

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:21.180 align:middle line:90%
dying, methane gas.

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Standing bodies of
water, flowing water.

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:27.060 align:middle line:84%
So I think at some point they've
been building enough evidence

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:30.900 align:middle line:84%
to now we see even our current
President, Trump, backing

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:32.400 align:middle line:90%
a space race.

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.460 align:middle line:84%
The moon in five
years, and Mars in 10.

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:37.020 align:middle line:90%
Permanent settlements.

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:38.190 align:middle line:90%
So I take that to heart.

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:40.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I want to go there
for my own personal reasons.

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would you go to Mars?

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:44.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Not to live.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You would not.

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Maybe to visit.

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:46.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would
want to come back.

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:46.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Yes.

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:47.558 align:middle line:90%
But I definitely feel--

00:33:47.558 --> 00:33:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a couple
year trip, isn't it?

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: It is, unless
we change the paradigm

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.220 align:middle line:90%
of the technology we're using.

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:55.447 align:middle line:84%
You can ask people at
Lockheed Martin Skunk

00:33:55.447 --> 00:33:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Works about what they've been
doing in the F-117 and the B-2.

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:02.610 align:middle line:84%
Ask them what they're building
now, and they'll tell you,

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:03.740 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you in 25 years.

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we ever going to
get speed of light technology?

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: I think
we already have it.

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:09.270 align:middle line:84%
When it becomes a
consumer product,

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:13.530 align:middle line:84%
it's something that, again,
we see a changing paradigm

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:16.260 align:middle line:84%
right now, George, with a
lot of these companies that

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:20.760 align:middle line:84%
are military-backed
aerospace companies having

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:24.547 align:middle line:84%
the paradigm changed in
how they can now report.

00:34:24.547 --> 00:34:25.380 align:middle line:90%
You can Google this.

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:27.210 align:middle line:90%
It was just released.

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Forward-facing
Raytheon attack cameras

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:35.130 align:middle line:84%
are now driven by
new software to help

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:38.010 align:middle line:90%
pilots see threats quicker.

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:41.310 align:middle line:84%
But as a nice little side
note in the article publicly

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:44.025 align:middle line:84%
announcing, it also
helps us identify UFOs.

00:34:44.025 --> 00:34:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Unidentified aerial phenomena
is now also picked up

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:48.210 align:middle line:84%
by our advanced radar
system and allows

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:50.020 align:middle line:90%
us to track it much faster.

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:50.820 align:middle line:90%
Just the fact--

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:52.199 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We couldn't
do that 10 years ago.

00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:54.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Or they
wouldn't tell us about it.

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
that's a good point.

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.758 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: So the
fact that they're

00:34:55.758 --> 00:34:57.510 align:middle line:84%
letting all these
things out of the bag

00:34:57.510 --> 00:35:00.630 align:middle line:84%
makes me optimistic
that the space race

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:03.660 align:middle line:84%
is going to change
in the next 20 years

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.390 align:middle line:84%
very quickly,
allowing us to start

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:10.410 align:middle line:84%
to see beyond this veil of
space that the DOD and NSA have

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:12.330 align:middle line:90%
controlled for a long time.

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:14.290 align:middle line:84%
That veil is starting
to lift for some reason.

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:15.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Robert Zubrin of course
heads up the Mars Society,

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:20.570 align:middle line:90%
and he wants to go to Mars.

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Yes he does.

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:24.510 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Do we even have a
space program today, Robert?

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:27.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh yeah, we have
a space program.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.060 align:middle line:10%
But only parts of
it are functional.

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:32.850 align:middle line:10%
The robotic planetary
exploration program

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:36.000 align:middle line:10%
is quite functional and is
returning exciting results

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.490 align:middle line:10%
from their various probes
to Mars and Jupiter.

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:42.690 align:middle line:10%
The space astronomy program is
very functional with the Hubble

00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:45.540 align:middle line:10%
Space Telescope, with the
Kepler Space Telescope.

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:50.520 align:middle line:10%
And this year we may launch
TESS, a new space telescope,

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.560 align:middle line:10%
and then the Webb
Space Telescope.

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:53.700 align:middle line:10%
They've got great stuff.

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:56.910 align:middle line:10%
But the human spaceflight
program is completely adrift.

00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:59.700 align:middle line:10%
It's been operating
without meaningful goals

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:01.710 align:middle line:10%
basically since
the end of Apollo.

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:03.480 align:middle line:10%
We have enough
money we're putting

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.980 align:middle line:10%
into the human
spaceflight program

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:07.230 align:middle line:10%
to be sending people
to the moon and Mars.

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:09.900 align:middle line:10%
But instead they're just going
up and down to earth orbit

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:13.170 align:middle line:10%
and being used as test subjects
by guinea pig scientists

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:16.830 align:middle line:10%
to measure the effects of zero
gravity on human physiology.

00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:18.120 align:middle line:10%
This is just crazy.

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:20.910 align:middle line:10%
Astronauts should not be guinea
pigs, they should be explorers.

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:22.200 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right, right.

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:25.280 align:middle line:10%
It's got to be frustrating
for somebody like you.

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:26.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, certainly.

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.460 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Because I mean, you
have developed your career

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:31.550 align:middle line:10%
to try to get us to explore.

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:32.940 align:middle line:10%
And we're not
doing that anymore.

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:33.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:39.210 align:middle line:10%
We need a goal-driven
human spaceflight program.

00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:42.700 align:middle line:10%
And the primary goal at this
point should be humans to Mars.

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:46.140 align:middle line:10%
Mars is where the science is,
it's where the challenge is,

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:47.670 align:middle line:10%
it's where the future is.

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:50.615 align:middle line:10%
And I must say that if we build
a hardware set that can take us

00:36:50.615 --> 00:36:51.990 align:middle line:10%
to Mars, we'll
also be able to do

00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:53.970 align:middle line:10%
the moon and the near-earth
asteroids as well.

00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I have an old saying.

00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:57.500 align:middle line:90%
We won't know unless we go.

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:58.863 align:middle line:90%
And that's true.

00:36:58.863 --> 00:37:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: I'm so ready,
George, and that clip

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:03.365 align:middle line:84%
is a great one in the sense
that someone like Robert

00:37:03.365 --> 00:37:05.615 align:middle line:84%
has got to be so frustrated
with the political backup.

00:37:05.615 --> 00:37:06.415 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh yeah.

00:37:06.415 --> 00:37:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: The entrepreneurial
doors are opening.

00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about it
there's-- and you can Google

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:11.930 align:middle line:90%
this too, it was just released.

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:13.305 align:middle line:84%
There is an asteroid
floating out

00:37:13.305 --> 00:37:15.675 align:middle line:84%
by the moon that's
worth, like, so much

00:37:15.675 --> 00:37:17.800 align:middle line:84%
money that everyone on
earth would be a billionaire

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:18.807 align:middle line:90%
if they were to mine it.

00:37:18.807 --> 00:37:19.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It could be gold.

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:21.265 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: There's
floating balls

00:37:21.265 --> 00:37:24.570 align:middle line:84%
of gold and precious minerals
that in the next five to 10

00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:28.290 align:middle line:84%
years we can send drones,
start to mine this,

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:30.300 align:middle line:84%
and then that
earth-based $4 trillion

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:32.580 align:middle line:90%
won't be spent on earth.

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:36.928 align:middle line:84%
We'll start building in space,
on the moon, and in Mars.

00:37:36.928 --> 00:37:38.970 align:middle line:84%
That's where I personally
want to invest my money

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:41.280 align:middle line:84%
and be a part of those
aerospace companies.

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.905 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where
we're going to go.

00:37:42.905 --> 00:37:46.320 align:middle line:84%
It's not moving to space, it's
opening the doors to space.

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and
you know, here we

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:52.950 align:middle line:84%
are 50 years since we
landed on the moon, 50 years

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:55.260 align:middle line:90%
with that kind of technology.

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:57.600 align:middle line:84%
We should probably be able
to get to the Moon and Mars

00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.460 align:middle line:84%
again like that,
don't you think?

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.253 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: I feel
somewhat sad too,

00:38:01.253 --> 00:38:02.670 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that
I feel like it's

00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:05.280 align:middle line:84%
a three-ring circus of what
we're watching with NASA

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.600 align:middle line:90%
and the space program.

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:10.500 align:middle line:84%
The real game is being played
by a black budget of what,

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.180 align:middle line:84%
$9 trillion missing
that has built--

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:13.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Many have said that.

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:14.505 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: --a space
program that's in existence.

00:38:14.505 --> 00:38:16.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Actually $21
trillion missing now.

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:17.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Amen.

00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:19.727 align:middle line:84%
So there's something that's
been going on for a long time.

00:38:19.727 --> 00:38:22.510 align:middle line:84%
The best place to point
to where that money went?

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:23.310 align:middle line:90%
In space.

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:27.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Should we be
working as a unified planet,

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:29.558 align:middle line:84%
or do we go at
this by ourselves?

00:38:29.558 --> 00:38:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: I think we're already
doing it as a unified planet

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:34.260 align:middle line:84%
and that what we see at
a political level, what

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:38.580 align:middle line:84%
we see on the news, a lot of it
is engineered and fabricated.

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And if you see what we're doing,
like with the International

00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:42.810 align:middle line:84%
Space Station and
the presence there

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:44.930 align:middle line:84%
of many different
countries, I'm sure there's

00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:46.680 align:middle line:84%
other efforts going
on that we're just not

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:50.490 align:middle line:84%
privy to at the public level
where there is collaboration.

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Even since the Star Wars
program with Reagan, you know,

00:38:53.370 --> 00:38:56.280 align:middle line:84%
that system wasn't developed
to attack the Russians.

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.720 align:middle line:90%
Those missiles weren't pointed--

00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:59.803 align:middle line:84%
or those lasers weren't
pointed at Earth.

00:38:59.803 --> 00:39:01.470 align:middle line:84%
They were pointed out
at something else.

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:01.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were pointed out.

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:02.220 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:04.740 align:middle line:84%
We've seen some strange
videos about stuff like that,

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:05.190 align:middle line:90%
haven't we?

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:06.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Yes, we have.

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:07.433 align:middle line:90%
And so I want to go.

00:39:07.433 --> 00:39:08.850 align:middle line:84%
I want to see it
with my own eyes,

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:10.398 align:middle line:84%
and I feel like
Trump's saying we're

00:39:10.398 --> 00:39:11.940 align:middle line:84%
going to be at the
moon in five years

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:15.457 align:middle line:84%
permanently, and then at
Mars permanently in 10 years.

00:39:15.457 --> 00:39:17.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to hold
them to their money,

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:20.250 align:middle line:84%
because as an entrepreneur,
I want to push this forward

00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:22.290 align:middle line:90%
by actually being involved.

00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:24.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The late remote
viewer, Ingo Swann,

00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:28.050 align:middle line:84%
whom the government used during
their own Stargate program

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:31.050 align:middle line:84%
with other remote
viewers, claimed

00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:35.130 align:middle line:84%
that there was a
series of structures,

00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:37.927 align:middle line:84%
artificial, on the
far side of the moon.

00:39:37.927 --> 00:39:39.010 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:41.177 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: I think the
astronauts that went up there

00:39:41.177 --> 00:39:44.190 align:middle line:84%
in their space buggy
said, Houston, why'd

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:47.580 align:middle line:84%
you send us here in baby toys
when the military is here

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:49.440 align:middle line:90%
in Ferraris?

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:51.150 align:middle line:84%
They've known this
for a long time

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:53.220 align:middle line:84%
that there's another
presence on the moon,

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:56.730 align:middle line:84%
most likely not only human,
but it could be also human,

00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:59.792 align:middle line:84%
some lost presence that even
has a German part to it,

00:39:59.792 --> 00:40:00.750 align:middle line:90%
or we could speculate--

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:02.632 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Absolutely,
or even further back.

00:40:02.632 --> 00:40:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Even further back.

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, there
were these old time movies

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:10.290 align:middle line:84%
that we had gone to the
moon, way gone back,

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:11.970 align:middle line:90%
with past civilizations.

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:13.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we
can count that out.

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: No, and there was
a funny one done in like,

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.720 align:middle line:84%
the '60s called
Alternative 3, where

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.823 align:middle line:84%
they made fun of missing
scientists and people,

00:40:21.823 --> 00:40:24.240 align:middle line:84%
and then they showed color
footage of the Russians landing

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:26.290 align:middle line:90%
on the moon in 1969.

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:27.870 align:middle line:84%
It's a clip called
Alternative 3,

00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:29.520 align:middle line:84%
and the highlight
of the clip is them

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.800 align:middle line:84%
landing as you see
something scurrying

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.340 align:middle line:90%
under the surface of the land.

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, my god,
we've discovered life on Mars!

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:38.970 align:middle line:84%
What they're alluding to
I think is already fact,

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:40.740 align:middle line:84%
and they're kind of
just desensitizing us

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:44.040 align:middle line:84%
to what we're already
going to pretty much know

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:46.410 align:middle line:84%
is there, that there
is life on Mars,

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:48.990 align:middle line:84%
and that there is this
ancient presence of a history

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:50.100 align:middle line:90%
connecting Earth and Mars.

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:52.642 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think that will
be the next dramatic thing we

00:40:52.642 --> 00:40:53.610 align:middle line:90%
find out?

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:55.410 align:middle line:84%
That there might have
been life on Mars

00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:57.900 align:middle line:84%
and that there might have
been an alien presence there?

00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: I think we might
make some steps before that.

00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:05.280 align:middle line:84%
There are things happening now
on Earth, under our own oceans,

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.490 align:middle line:84%
under the landmasses,
Antarctica.

00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:10.560 align:middle line:84%
We might find some
discoveries here on Earth

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:13.740 align:middle line:84%
or some things might be
made public that would then

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:16.500 align:middle line:84%
start to question even
further, wow, let's start

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:19.170 align:middle line:84%
to look at sites like Mars
and other sites with a little

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:20.370 align:middle line:90%
more scrutiny.

00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Michael
Cremo's always said

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:24.210 align:middle line:84%
we are much older
than we think we are.

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:25.020 align:middle line:90%
Do you agree?

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:26.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Very much so.

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:28.440 align:middle line:84%
He is one of the
masters of finding

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.080 align:middle line:84%
these forbidden artifacts and
pieces of information that

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:34.650 align:middle line:84%
show there are pieces
of evidence, footprints

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:40.040 align:middle line:84%
with dinosaur embedded in
stone, some little, you know,

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.110 align:middle line:84%
bolt or something
embedded in a rock that's

00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:43.580 align:middle line:90%
a billion years old.

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:47.000 align:middle line:84%
There's pieces of evidence that
if we put it all on the table,

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.190 align:middle line:84%
there's been some type of
a technological presence

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:51.200 align:middle line:84%
on earth for at least
a billion years.

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: So I mean, it's a
seven billion year old planet

00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:55.640 align:middle line:90%
or so.

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:57.710 align:middle line:84%
There are literally
hundred-million-year gaps

00:41:57.710 --> 00:42:01.820 align:middle line:84%
of time where a civilization
could have evolved, left

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:05.190 align:middle line:84%
the planet, and then we've
never even known about them.

00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:08.450 align:middle line:84%
So things like the
dinosaurs evolving,

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:11.330 align:middle line:84%
or even dolphins evolving to
a point where they could have

00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:13.432 align:middle line:90%
been technological and left.

00:42:13.432 --> 00:42:15.140 align:middle line:84%
These are all in the
realm of possibility

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:17.600 align:middle line:84%
when we analyze how long
this earth has been here.

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.017 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think will be

00:42:19.017 --> 00:42:21.680 align:middle line:84%
the next evolution
of knowledge for us,

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:24.410 align:middle line:84%
Jason, something dramatic
that might happen?

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:25.650 align:middle line:90%
And when might that be?

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, I
feel like there's

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:33.110 align:middle line:84%
been this quickening effect
around our field with ufology.

00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:35.750 align:middle line:84%
I almost want to say that
within the next 20 years,

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:38.960 align:middle line:84%
hopefully the doors to space
are going to finally open up.

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:41.680 align:middle line:84%
We haven't been to the moon
since 50 years, as you said.

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:42.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, we haven't.

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: I think that's just
a public umbrella of information

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.700 align:middle line:84%
and that we've been
doing things quietly

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:48.735 align:middle line:90%
in space for a long time.

00:42:48.735 --> 00:42:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And when they open
these doors, there's

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:54.920 align:middle line:84%
going to be a Renaissance
age of understanding that,

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:58.970 align:middle line:84%
boy, the limits are now
much further out there

00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:01.820 align:middle line:84%
than we thought by just
saying we're on earth,

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:04.100 align:middle line:84%
and we're wasting our
natural resources,

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:06.350 align:middle line:84%
and the population
is getting too big.

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:07.880 align:middle line:90%
We can change that.

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:10.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
look at your research

00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:11.810 align:middle line:90%
over the next few years?

00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:13.040 align:middle line:90%
Where do you go next?

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: My
research is encoupled

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:17.670 align:middle line:90%
with being an entrepreneur.

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:19.800 align:middle line:90%
So I love ancient technology.

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.950 align:middle line:90%
I love looking at ancient sites.

00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:23.540 align:middle line:84%
What I'd like to
push for is being

00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:27.450 align:middle line:84%
able to utilize more technology
and access into the aerospace

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:28.250 align:middle line:90%
programs.

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:30.440 align:middle line:90%
So I'm a civilian.

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:33.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm-- you and I talk about
these topics, Ancient Aliens,

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:36.050 align:middle line:84%
but nothing stops me from
getting security clearances

00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:39.440 align:middle line:84%
and using my professional
skill set to help the aerospace

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.280 align:middle line:90%
industry.

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what I want to do.

00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:44.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
just be a Ufologist,

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:46.230 align:middle line:84%
I want to be a
hands-on researcher.

00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And there are companies
that are doing this now,

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:51.740 align:middle line:84%
SAIC, Raytheon,
Lockheed Martin, and I

00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:53.450 align:middle line:90%
could keep going on and on.

00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:56.660 align:middle line:84%
They all have an agenda
to be pushing things

00:43:56.660 --> 00:44:00.290 align:middle line:84%
in space for consumer products
and to open up the idea

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:03.107 align:middle line:84%
that we can be a civilization
beyond just the earth.

00:44:03.107 --> 00:44:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
interested in your skills?

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: They are.

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:09.080 align:middle line:84%
This goes beyond just
building spaceships.

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:13.310 align:middle line:84%
There's software development,
there's infrastructure,

00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:18.320 align:middle line:84%
there's business, there's
actual support systems

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:22.440 align:middle line:84%
that we'll be needing for
just consumerism in general,

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:25.550 align:middle line:84%
when we extend the space
station to be, you know,

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:27.290 align:middle line:90%
10 times what it is.

00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:30.830 align:middle line:84%
So funny enough, you think about
like, Starbucks, and Disney,

00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:31.640 align:middle line:90%
and McDonald's.

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:34.250 align:middle line:84%
These companies are
already talking to,

00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:37.520 align:middle line:84%
and thinking of ways to
have a presence in space.

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A franchise of
McDonald's on the moon.

00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:41.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: There you go.

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would you
say has been your biggest

00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:46.490 align:middle line:90%
contribution to all of this?

00:44:46.490 --> 00:44:49.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: I think my biggest
contribution, thankfully,

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:53.420 align:middle line:84%
is that with business
success and having

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:55.670 align:middle line:84%
a professional career,
I've been able to open

00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:59.240 align:middle line:84%
the doors to utilizing
technology or being

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:01.220 align:middle line:84%
able to look at some
of these ancient sites

00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:03.320 align:middle line:84%
with the utilization
of technology

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:06.145 align:middle line:84%
so that we can just have
hopefully a clearer picture.

00:45:06.145 --> 00:45:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
to continue to be

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.020 align:middle line:84%
able to do this
with the advances

00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:12.440 align:middle line:84%
in ground penetrating radar,
the aerial packages of things

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:16.400 align:middle line:84%
that you can put onto a drone
and not have to have a plane,

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:18.842 align:middle line:84%
and get into these tight
spaces and see things.

00:45:18.842 --> 00:45:20.300 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
there's going to be

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:22.610 align:middle line:84%
some very interesting
advances with technology

00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:25.160 align:middle line:84%
that I'd like to be a part
of that will help us push

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:27.432 align:middle line:84%
the lens of seeing
deeper into the past

00:45:27.432 --> 00:45:28.640 align:middle line:90%
and making these connections.

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:30.557 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will we ever
get to the point, Jason,

00:45:30.557 --> 00:45:34.550 align:middle line:84%
where we simply
say I told you so?

00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: I kind
of feel like that's

00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:40.040 align:middle line:84%
happened a few times already,
with what we see with ATIP

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:42.800 align:middle line:84%
and shows like Unidentified
now exposing the fact

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:45.920 align:middle line:84%
that there have been programs
well beyond Project Blue

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:48.460 align:middle line:90%
Book going on for decades.

00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:50.420 align:middle line:84%
The I told you so moments
have been happening

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:54.470 align:middle line:84%
for kind of a while now with
shows like Ancient Aliens

00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:57.570 align:middle line:84%
allowing people to start
to realize, wait a minute,

00:45:57.570 --> 00:45:59.510 align:middle line:84%
this has all been going
on for a long time.

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:02.360 align:middle line:84%
It was you who just chose
not to pay attention.

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the public,
are they accepting this?

00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Well, yeah.

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:06.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Starting to?

00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:07.937 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTELL: I think they are.

00:46:07.937 --> 00:46:10.903 align:middle line:10%
I think what we see is, again,
just like the whole idea

00:46:10.903 --> 00:46:13.070 align:middle line:10%
that we've just moved, where
the Mayan calendar says

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:15.290 align:middle line:10%
we've moved out of
the age of Pisces

00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:16.940 align:middle line:10%
into the Age of Aquarius.

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:18.590 align:middle line:10%
The whole idea of
the Age of Aquarius

00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:21.360 align:middle line:10%
is the quickening of
knowledge and learning.

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:23.360 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what's
been happening, especially

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:27.500 align:middle line:84%
with the idea that all the
world religions, Christianity,

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:31.460 align:middle line:84%
Judaism, have all been impacted
by the world becoming a smaller

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:32.318 align:middle line:90%
place.

00:46:32.318 --> 00:46:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And shows like
"Ancient Aliens" allow

00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:37.940 align:middle line:84%
us to really see the brilliance
and dynamic understandings

00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:40.280 align:middle line:84%
of other cultures and
just how really close

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:41.840 align:middle line:90%
we are at the core.

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:44.660 align:middle line:84%
We all had interactions
with beings that

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:46.040 align:middle line:90%
came down from the heavens.

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:49.190 align:middle line:84%
We all have this lost
history with our ancestors

00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:52.190 align:middle line:84%
that seems to go much farther
back than we understand.

00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:54.733 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very optimistic
about the future.

00:46:54.733 --> 00:46:56.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief".

00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:58.192 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: My pleasure, George.

00:46:58.192 --> 00:47:01.550 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Fascinating discussion
about ancient civilizations.

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:03.080 align:middle line:10%
Something to it.

00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:04.730 align:middle line:10%
Will we ever get the answers?

00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:08.210 align:middle line:84%
With people like Jason
Martell, you better believe it.

00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:11.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for being on "Beyond Belief."

00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:17.782 align:middle line:90%
