>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:27.550 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.780 align:middle line:10%
And our special guest
is Dr. Joe Dispenza.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.659 align:middle line:84%
He is an international
lecturer, researcher,

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.390 align:middle line:84%
corporate consultant,
author, educator,

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.730 align:middle line:84%
and has been invited to speak
to more than 32 countries

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.120 align:middle line:84%
at various continents
all around this planet.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.830 align:middle line:84%
As a lecturer and educator,
he is driven by the conviction

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.270 align:middle line:84%
that each of us has the
potential for greatness

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.540 align:middle line:90%
and unlimited abilities.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.740 align:middle line:10%
His latest book is called
"Becoming Supernatural."

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.870 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Joe Dispenza, welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE DISPENZA: Thank
you so much, George.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's always
good to see you.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Pleasure
to be with you.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I get so many great
comments about you when

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.920 align:middle line:84%
you're on "Coast to Coast"
and things that you do--

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.050 align:middle line:90%
absolutely marvelous.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.880 align:middle line:10%
How did you get
started in all this?

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.370 align:middle line:10%
>>DISPENZA: Well, in
1986, I got run over

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.210 align:middle line:10%
by a truck in a triathlon.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.010 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Ouch!

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.530 align:middle line:10%
>>DISPENZA: I broke six
vertebrae in my spine.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.410 align:middle line:10%
And I had bone fragments
on my spinal cord.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And the neural arch of
one of the vertebrae

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.770 align:middle line:90%
was broken like a pretzel.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.230 align:middle line:84%
So the typical
procedure for that

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.500 align:middle line:84%
is Harrington rod surgery,
which is cutting off

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.840 align:middle line:84%
the back parts of your
vertebrae and screwing

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.520 align:middle line:84%
in these long
stainless steel rods.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They slip
them right up?

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I had four
opinions from four

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.090 align:middle line:84%
of the leading surgeons
in Southern California.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And I decided
against the surgery.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
I'm not going anywhere.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doing anything.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.675 align:middle line:84%
And maybe my mind could
influence my body.

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of the four
opinions, how many

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.920 align:middle line:90%
told you to not do the surgery?

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: All four of them
said Harrington rod surgery

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.080 align:middle line:90%
is the only option.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.410 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise you'd be paralyzed.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.360 align:middle line:84%
So you went against
the total grain there.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.068 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So I went
against convention.

00:02:01.068 --> 00:02:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And in 1986, that
wasn't too common.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.630 align:middle line:90%
And it worked.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I just made
a deal with myself

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.190 align:middle line:84%
that if I was ever
able to walk again,

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.392 align:middle line:84%
I'd spend the rest of my life
studying mind over matter

00:02:13.392 --> 00:02:14.600 align:middle line:90%
and the mind-body connection.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.482 align:middle line:90%
I've been doing that since 1986.

00:02:16.482 --> 00:02:17.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You healed yourself.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do you feel now?

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: I never
have pain in my back.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm super active.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.250 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not wired
for pain, either.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And that got me on the journey
to ask bigger questions,

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.740 align:middle line:90%
like, how did that happen?

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't
find the answers in

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.370 align:middle line:84%
typical conventional
journals or books.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.250 align:middle line:84%
I had to start studying the new
sciences, like quantum physics

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.660 align:middle line:84%
and neuroscience and
neuroplasticity and epigenetics

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.100 align:middle line:90%
and psychoimmunology.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And all of those sciences point
the finger at possibility.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And it has become the
contemporary language

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.740 align:middle line:90%
of mysticism.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And when you combine those
different branches of sciences,

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.890 align:middle line:84%
you begin to realize
that people can

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.867 align:middle line:84%
begin to make significant
changes in their life

00:03:06.867 --> 00:03:07.700 align:middle line:90%
and in their health.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.710 align:middle line:84%
We're not hardwired
to be a certain way

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.210 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of our lives.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.740 align:middle line:90%
We're not doomed by our genes.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.870 align:middle line:84%
We're marvels of
adaptability and change.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And so the next question
is, how do you do it?

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.210 align:middle line:84%
So I started
studying people that

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.590 align:middle line:90%
had spontaneous remissions.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.170 align:middle line:84%
I thought, if it
happened to me, could it

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.230 align:middle line:90%
happen to anybody else?

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I traveled to
17 different countries

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.680 align:middle line:84%
and interviewed hundreds
and hundreds of people that

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.250 align:middle line:90%
were treated unconventionally.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.540 align:middle line:84%
They were staying the same
health-wise or getting worse.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.287 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
they got better.

00:03:39.287 --> 00:03:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to
know what the cause was

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.270 align:middle line:90%
that produced that effect.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So I
wrote my first book,

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.282 align:middle line:90%
called "Evolve your Brain--

00:03:47.282 --> 00:03:48.740 align:middle line:84%
The Science of
Changing Your Mind."

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.500 align:middle line:10%
And I talk about what those
principles are in terms

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.210 align:middle line:10%
of how people can heal.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.850 align:middle line:84%
The mind and body
are so connected.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.130 align:middle line:84%
So then I thought
after that, well,

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.790 align:middle line:84%
if I now know what those people
are doing, and it's common

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:02.624 align:middle line:90%
and it's unanimous--

00:04:02.624 --> 00:04:04.998 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're seeing
some denominators, aren't you?

00:04:04.998 --> 00:04:06.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah, exactly.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.550 align:middle line:90%
So now can we reproduce it?

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.730 align:middle line:84%
Because science is
about replication.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.020 align:middle line:90%
So then I started teaching it.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.900 align:middle line:90%
I started saying, OK.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.150 align:middle line:90%
These are the four principles.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if we
can demystify it,

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.529 align:middle line:84%
and gave people the opportunity
to begin to practice it.

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:21.470 align:middle line:90%
And it took a couple of years.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.960 align:middle line:84%
But then all of a
sudden, we started

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.020 align:middle line:84%
seeing some really big changes
not only in people's health,

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.240 align:middle line:90%
but in their lives.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And now I knew then that
when they were beginning

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.290 align:middle line:84%
to have those effects,
like in a weekend workshop,

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.860 align:middle line:84%
that there were some internal
changes that were going on.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.700 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, if there's a
subjective experience where

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.740 align:middle line:84%
a person's having a
transcendental moment,

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.590 align:middle line:84%
can we begin to
study it objectively?

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.630 align:middle line:84%
So I gathered a team
of neuroscientists

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.310 align:middle line:90%
and researchers.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.870 align:middle line:90%
And we began the measurements.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And in the last six years, we've
done thousands and thousands

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.830 align:middle line:90%
of measurements.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.450 align:middle line:84%
We've done 8,500 brain scans,
measuring people's brains

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.510 align:middle line:84%
before they come to a
four and a half day event

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.040 align:middle line:84%
to see what their brain
is like when they start--

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what it is later.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: --and then go
through four days of training

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.760 align:middle line:84%
and see what it's
like at the end.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I bet it's illuminated
at the end, isn't it?

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, illuminated--
we can talk about that.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.050 align:middle line:84%
But there were
significant changes

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.180 align:middle line:84%
that were taking
place that showed me

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.040 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't just in their mind.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.300 align:middle line:90%
It was in their brain.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.790 align:middle line:10%
And then we started
measuring people

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.580 align:middle line:10%
during the
transformational process.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.110 align:middle line:90%
What's going on in their mind?

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.690 align:middle line:90%
Can we see changes in real time?

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And we started gathering more
information about how to do it.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And when people start to
understand what they're doing

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.330 align:middle line:84%
and why they're doing
it, the how gets easier.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.396 align:middle line:84%
And I also realized what
doesn't work as well.

00:05:43.396 --> 00:05:46.450 align:middle line:10%
And so then we've done
thousands and thousands

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.700 align:middle line:10%
of HRV measurements
and teaching people

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.579 align:middle line:10%
how to self-regulate and begin
to create more heart coherence.

00:05:51.579 --> 00:05:53.620 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So you're getting
a science out at this,

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.420 align:middle line:10%
aren't you?

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.639 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well,
science is the language--

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.180 align:middle line:84%
the moment you start
talking religion

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.160 align:middle line:84%
or culture or tradition, you're
going to divide an audience.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.897 align:middle line:84%
Because soon as someone hears
a word that intimidates them,

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:05.980 align:middle line:90%
they're going to shut off.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.360 align:middle line:90%
They tune in or tune out.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Right.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.630 align:middle line:84%
But science is just a great
way to create community.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.140 align:middle line:84%
So we've measured
immune responses.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen that people
can literally in four days

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.790 align:middle line:84%
begin to strengthen their
immune system by 50%.

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.640 align:middle line:90%
We've measured gene expression.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.080 align:middle line:84%
We now know that in four and
a half days that people can

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.860 align:middle line:84%
signal the gene that
reduces cancer in tumors

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.780 align:middle line:84%
in people's bodies, the
gene for neurogenesis,

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.960 align:middle line:84%
to grow new neurons in
response to novel experiences

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.250 align:middle line:84%
and learning-- not just
making new connections,

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.535 align:middle line:90%
but growing new neurons--

00:06:39.535 --> 00:06:42.250 align:middle line:84%
the gene for stem
cells to become

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.680 align:middle line:84%
activated to go to damaged
tissues and repair them.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It really is amazing.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah, all kinds
of significant changes.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And we've measured
telomere lengths.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen
that people who do

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.500 align:middle line:90%
meditation for just 60 days--

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.500 align:middle line:84%
74% of those people
lengthen their telomeres.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.604 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 74%?

00:07:03.604 --> 00:07:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And telomeres
are the little shoestrings

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.720 align:middle line:84%
on the end of your
DNA that tells you

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.070 align:middle line:90%
your true biological age.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.060 align:middle line:84%
So imagine if somebody's
telomere is lengthened by 10%.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.470 align:middle line:90%
They get 10% of their life back.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And so we're
beginning to realize

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.320 align:middle line:84%
that you don't have
to be a Buddhist

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.310 align:middle line:84%
monk, that you don't have to
be an academic or a scholar.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.550 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to be
a minister or a rabbi.

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.260 align:middle line:84%
The common people around the
world are doing the uncommon.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And I now know that
if you give people

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.840 align:middle line:90%
sound scientific information--

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.370 align:middle line:90%
and they begin to learn it.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.825 align:middle line:84%
Every time you
learn something new,

00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:40.450 align:middle line:84%
you make new connections
in your brain.

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:41.290 align:middle line:90%
That's what learning is.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:41.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:42.100 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.558 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And
the latest research

00:07:43.558 --> 00:07:47.080 align:middle line:84%
shows that just one hour of
concentration on one topic

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.760 align:middle line:84%
doubles the number
of connections

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.680 align:middle line:90%
in certain areas of your brain.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.000 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't review
that information,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.330 align:middle line:84%
you don't repeat it, you
don't think about it,

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.740 align:middle line:84%
those circuits prune apart
within hours or days.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:58.690 align:middle line:90%
So learning is--

00:07:58.690 --> 00:07:59.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So they fade away.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:07:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Right.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.330 align:middle line:84%
So if learning is making
new synaptic connections,

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.591 align:middle line:84%
then remembering is maintaining
and sustaining them.

00:08:04.591 --> 00:08:05.590 align:middle line:90%
So what's the relevance?

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:08.620 align:middle line:10%
Well, if you get a community
of people together in a room,

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.775 align:middle line:10%
and you deliver the
proper information,

00:08:10.775 --> 00:08:13.150 align:middle line:10%
and then you tell them to turn
to the person next to them

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.550 align:middle line:10%
and explain what
they're learning,

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.880 align:middle line:10%
once they start engaging
the other person

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.320 align:middle line:10%
and they start thinking about
it and talking about it,

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.780 align:middle line:10%
they're causing
their brain to fire

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.887 align:middle line:10%
in new sequences and new
patterns and new combinations.

00:08:25.887 --> 00:08:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And whenever you make your
brain work differently,

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:29.800 align:middle line:84%
you're changing your
mind because the mind

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.120 align:middle line:90%
is the brain in action.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.539 align:middle line:84%
So if you keep reminding them of
what they're learning, in time,

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:36.940 align:middle line:84%
they begin to install
the neurological hardware

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.480 align:middle line:84%
in their brain in preparation
for the experience.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you set up the
conditions in the environment,

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.767 align:middle line:84%
and you give them the
proper instruction--

00:08:45.767 --> 00:08:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's important.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: That's important.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.360 align:middle line:84%
They have to get their behaviors
to match their intentions--

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.475 align:middle line:90%
just like any skill--

00:08:51.475 --> 00:08:53.292 align:middle line:84%
get their actions equal
to their thoughts,

00:08:53.292 --> 00:08:55.000 align:middle line:84%
get their mind and
body working together.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.240 align:middle line:84%
When they do, they are going
to have a new experience.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.710 align:middle line:90%
And it's going to change them.

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And experience
enriches the circuits

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.610 align:middle line:90%
in their brain philosophically.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden, the
end product of an experience

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:07.150 align:middle line:90%
is an emotion.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you feel more
whole, the moment you feel more

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:13.260 align:middle line:84%
unlimited, the moment
you feel more worthy,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.100 align:middle line:84%
the moment you feel
that emotion, now

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.160 align:middle line:84%
you're teaching
your body chemically

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.220 align:middle line:84%
to understand what your mind
has intellectually understood.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:22.990 align:middle line:84%
So we say knowledge
is for the mind,

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:24.490 align:middle line:90%
but experience is for the body.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:25.324 align:middle line:90%
And in that moment--

00:09:25.324 --> 00:09:26.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They work together.

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: --they're
embodying the truth.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Mind and body are
now working together.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And the end product
of that is we

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.060 align:middle line:84%
begin to change our
genetic expression.

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:35.610 align:middle line:90%
So here's the point.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.859 align:middle line:84%
If you've done it once, you
should be able to do it again.

00:09:38.859 --> 00:09:39.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You would think.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So as you begin
to repeat the experience over

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.790 align:middle line:84%
and over again, you're
going to neurochemically

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:48.930 align:middle line:84%
condition your mind and body
to begin to work as one.

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And when you've done
something so many times

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:54.430 align:middle line:84%
that your body now knows how
to do it as well as your mind,

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:55.720 align:middle line:90%
now it's innate in you.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.980 align:middle line:90%
It's second nature.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:57.780 align:middle line:90%
It's who you are.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:58.580 align:middle line:90%
It's automatic.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:09:59.800 align:middle line:90%
It's effortless.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Now you're beginning to
master that philosophy.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.600 align:middle line:90%
And it's who you are.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.500 align:middle line:90%
You're being it.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Our job, then, is to
go from philosopher

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:12.340 align:middle line:84%
to initiate to master, from
knowledge to experience

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.430 align:middle line:84%
to wisdom, from mind
to body to soul,

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:18.940 align:middle line:84%
from thinking to doing to being,
to learning it with your head,

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.575 align:middle line:84%
applying it with your hands,
and knowing it by heart.

00:10:21.575 --> 00:10:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And we have all the biological
and neurological machinery

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:24.765 align:middle line:90%
to do it.

00:10:24.765 --> 00:10:26.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go to one
of your workshops, Joe.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Stepping into the
practicum and the skill--

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:34.050 align:middle line:10%
and it's one thing to
study rodents in a changing

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:35.040 align:middle line:10%
environment.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.830 align:middle line:84%
It's another thing
studying people, changing

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.200 align:middle line:84%
their internal states,
and being able to sustain

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.130 align:middle line:90%
those internal states.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
practicum that leaves

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.420 align:middle line:90%
the philosophical behind.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.790 align:middle line:84%
So you have
philosophy, a theory.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.140 align:middle line:90%
And you initiated it.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.140 align:middle line:84%
That initiation, then,
should lead to some type

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.520 align:middle line:90%
of mastery or skill.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:11:01.240 align:middle line:90%


00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:06.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So what happens internally
when the energy hits the head?

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.850 align:middle line:90%
There's light.

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:10.945 align:middle line:90%
There's a very bright light.

00:11:10.945 --> 00:11:13.680 align:middle line:10%
You no longer need your vision.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.840 align:middle line:84%
But because you're human,
you're still trying to see.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.570 align:middle line:84%
It's really hard to
describe what happens.

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:20.650 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of light.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:22.570 align:middle line:90%
You can feel the currents.

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:24.370 align:middle line:90%
You can feel the blast.

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.380 align:middle line:90%
You can feel the movement.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:30.610 align:middle line:84%
But you can't really
put a name to it.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>> They are having an inward
experience that's greater than

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:37.750 align:middle line:84%
their trauma, their
diagnosis, their fear.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:40.240 align:middle line:84%
Whatever's happening
between their ears

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.340 align:middle line:84%
is more real than
anything that's happened

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:44.500 align:middle line:90%
in their external environment.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Her sympathetic nervous
system has switched on.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And instead of switching on
like being chased by a predator,

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:52.300 align:middle line:84%
it's taking all that
energy stored in the body,

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.834 align:middle line:84%
and it's driving
it up to the brain.

00:11:53.834 --> 00:11:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And when it goes on, all
of a sudden the brain

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:56.560 align:middle line:90%
goes into gamma.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And she's aroused from
the inner experience.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.740 align:middle line:84%
But it's not from a
predator or from a danger.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:03.760 align:middle line:90%
It's from the divine.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:04.240 align:middle line:90%

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a great audience.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.550 align:middle line:90%
Now, what was going on there?

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, when we
started on this journey--

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.950 align:middle line:84%
and I have a great
research team.

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.410 align:middle line:90%
You saw some of them there--

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:21.010 align:middle line:84%
we never thought that
we would be recording

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:22.570 align:middle line:90%
what we're recording today.

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, there's a formula
now that we've figured out.

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And we could actually
predict the moment

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:32.350 align:middle line:84%
a person is going to go
into a superconscious state.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:36.460 align:middle line:84%
So we do certain
different meditations

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:40.610 align:middle line:84%
to begin to activate latent
centers in the brain.

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:43.660 align:middle line:84%
So let's say a
person has a betrayal

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.210 align:middle line:90%
or a trauma or a shock.

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:48.160 align:middle line:84%
The stronger the
emotion that you

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.430 align:middle line:84%
feel from some situation
in your life, the more

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:53.590 align:middle line:90%
altered you feel inside of you.

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:55.390 align:middle line:84%
The more altered you
feel inside of you,

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:57.100 align:middle line:84%
the more you pay
attention to the cause.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And the brain freezes the
image and takes a snapshot.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.310 align:middle line:90%
And that's called a "memory."

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:03.610 align:middle line:84%
So the stronger the
emotion you feel,

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:06.130 align:middle line:84%
the more long-term
memories you create.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:09.100 align:middle line:84%
So now that's branded
neurologically in the brain.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's emotionally
conditioned in the body.

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.320 align:middle line:84%
So people tend to
think neurologically

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.230 align:middle line:84%
within the circuits of
those past experiences.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And then they tend
to feel emotionally

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:23.320 align:middle line:84%
within the boundaries of
those chemical events.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And how we think
and how we feel,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.860 align:middle line:90%
George, is our state of being.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:30.070 align:middle line:84%
So most people are
defined as an identity

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:31.780 align:middle line:90%
by their past memories.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.150 align:middle line:84%
So then the question is,
how do you change that?

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Because the strong emotion could
actually downregulate a gene

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:41.590 align:middle line:84%
that can begin to
signal a disease.

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:47.410 align:middle line:84%
So then when we begin to induce
these states where a person is

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:50.950 align:middle line:84%
going to have a
transcendental moment,

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:53.590 align:middle line:84%
there's this very
significant change

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:55.540 align:middle line:90%
that takes place in the brain.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:14:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden now, 95%
of who we are as a personality

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.660 align:middle line:84%
by the time we're
35 years old is

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:07.660 align:middle line:84%
a set of memorized behaviors,
emotional reactions,

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:10.480 align:middle line:84%
unconscious attitudes, and
beliefs and perceptions

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.180 align:middle line:84%
that function like
a computer program.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.820 align:middle line:84%
So most of the mind
is stored in the body.

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:19.030 align:middle line:84%
So 5% of our conscious
mind is working

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:23.072 align:middle line:84%
against 95% of what we've
memorized subconsciously.

00:14:23.072 --> 00:14:24.280 align:middle line:90%
So what's an example of that?

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, an example is you may
not remember a phone number.

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:29.320 align:middle line:90%
We're old enough to know this.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.330 align:middle line:84%
You pick up the phone,
you look at the receiver,

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:32.649 align:middle line:90%
and you dial the number.

00:14:32.649 --> 00:14:34.190 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't remember
it consciously.

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:35.980 align:middle line:84%
But your body did
it so many times

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.750 align:middle line:84%
that it knew how to do it
as well as your mind, right?

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:41.310 align:middle line:84%
So that's who we
are subconsciously.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:45.040 align:middle line:84%
So the trauma is stored in the
body, as well as in the brain.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:49.660 align:middle line:84%
So then when a person begins to
activate these latent systems,

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.310 align:middle line:84%
energy begins to travel
right up the spine.

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And we can actually predict
the moment is going to happen.

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:59.290 align:middle line:84%
When scientists come
and study us, we'll say,

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:01.102 align:middle line:90%
she's going to pop.

00:15:01.102 --> 00:15:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
watch that happen.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: I always
say, and she's going

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:05.020 align:middle line:90%
to pop in five minutes here.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:05.920 align:middle line:90%
You watch.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, that
energy that's stored in the body

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:11.292 align:middle line:84%
begins to move
right up the spine.

00:15:11.292 --> 00:15:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And it goes to a little gate
at the brain stem called

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.100 align:middle line:90%
the "thalamic gate."

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.416 align:middle line:90%
And that gate opens up.

00:15:17.416 --> 00:15:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And the sympathetic
nervous system switches on.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And now the body is driving
energy up into the brain.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:26.360 align:middle line:84%
It hits certain
areas of the brain.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And the brain goes into
what's called "gamma brainwave

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:29.480 align:middle line:90%
patterns."

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.460 align:middle line:90%
That is a superconscious state.

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
amazing, Doctor, is

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:36.800 align:middle line:84%
you're one of the few people,
if not the only one, who

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.350 align:middle line:90%
he explains how this works.

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:40.760 align:middle line:90%
Nobody else is doing that.

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well,
you should sit in

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.430 align:middle line:84%
on some of our brain
science meetings

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:46.190 align:middle line:84%
because there is cussing
going on and arguing.

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:50.080 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't find
this in textbooks.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:51.140 align:middle line:90%
It's not there.

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: This is
supernatural, right?

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.520 align:middle line:10%
So once that energy
goes into the brain--

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.420 align:middle line:10%
I'll give you an example--

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:00.890 align:middle line:10%
the brain switches
on to such a degree

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:03.320 align:middle line:10%
that those measurements--
you can't find

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.960 align:middle line:10%
in any neuroscience research.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:10.550 align:middle line:84%
These people are going into
such coherence in their brain.

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:12.920 align:middle line:90%
Now, coherence is order.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:16.040 align:middle line:84%
But like most normal coherence
in the brain-- picture

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.260 align:middle line:84%
a room of 1,000
people and everybody

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:19.430 align:middle line:90%
clapping at the same time.

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:21.410 align:middle line:90%
They're applauding at a show.

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:22.830 align:middle line:90%
That's incoherence, right?

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:23.630 align:middle line:90%
It's noise.

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:26.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I love that sound,
by the way, if I'm on stage.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yes, of course.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, normal coherence--
picture the room.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And every fifth person in that
room claps at the same time.

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:37.640 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of a brain that has
a normal amount of coherence.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.760 align:middle line:84%
But when we were measuring
this supercoherence,

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:45.110 align:middle line:84%
picture the entire 1,000 people
clapping at the same time

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:47.450 align:middle line:90%
to the same rhythm very quickly.

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:50.720 align:middle line:84%
That orderliness creates a lot
of energy, too, in the room.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.630 align:middle line:84%
So the brain goes into
these ecstatic states.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:56.870 align:middle line:84%
That person is having a
full-on sensory experience

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:58.130 align:middle line:90%
without their senses.

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:02.144 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine if your senses were
heightened by 25% right now.

00:17:02.144 --> 00:17:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Everything you're seeing,
everything you're hearing,

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:05.119 align:middle line:90%
everything you're smelling--

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:06.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is heightened by 25%.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: --everything
you're tasting,

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:08.160 align:middle line:90%
everything you're feeling.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.494 align:middle line:84%
If your senses are
heightened by 25%,

00:17:10.494 --> 00:17:12.410 align:middle line:84%
so is your awareness of
everything around you.

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:13.099 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that's huge

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:14.089 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And you
can't have awareness

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:15.000 align:middle line:90%
without consciousness.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.833 align:middle line:84%
You can't have consciousness
without energy.

00:17:16.833 --> 00:17:19.170 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden,
the brain switches on.

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:22.160 align:middle line:84%
They go into these
high states of gamma.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And the amount of
energy in the brain--

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.579 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:29.600 align:middle line:10%
Most people, if we're
measuring their vision,

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.380 align:middle line:10%
if we're measuring
their liver enzymes,

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.530 align:middle line:10%
if we're measuring their
height-- if we took 1,000

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:35.300 align:middle line:10%
people and we measured
them, you would

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:38.637 align:middle line:10%
see this curve called a
Z curve or a bell curve.

00:17:38.637 --> 00:17:40.220 align:middle line:10%
You draw a line right
down the middle.

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.680 align:middle line:10%
And you divide it
equally in threes.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.530 align:middle line:84%
That's three standard
deviations above normal,

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:47.630 align:middle line:84%
three standard
deviations below normal.

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:50.279 align:middle line:84%
That makes up 99.7%
of the population.

00:17:50.279 --> 00:17:51.570 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter what we measure.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Doesn't matter.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:53.400 align:middle line:90%
It's just there.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: OK.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.320 align:middle line:84%
So our measurements in
energy and the brain

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.660 align:middle line:84%
is 200 standard
deviations outside

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:03.140 align:middle line:84%
of normal, 300 standard
deviations outside of normal,

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.630 align:middle line:84%
400 standard deviations
outside normal.

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:09.620 align:middle line:84%
That means you have to
draw another 197 blocks.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And that line just keeps
getting smaller and smaller.

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:15.110 align:middle line:84%
That amount of
energy, that person--

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:19.700 align:middle line:84%
that inward event is going
to reorganize the circuitry

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.650 align:middle line:84%
in their brain because
that's what experience does.

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to produce
a profound feeling.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.830 align:middle line:90%
Now, that feeling is not fear.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.240 align:middle line:90%
It's not anger.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.390 align:middle line:90%
It's not hostility.

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:31.190 align:middle line:90%
It's not pain.

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:32.860 align:middle line:90%
It's not sadness.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.320 align:middle line:90%
It is bliss.

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.550 align:middle line:10%
So now the moment the person
feels this elevated emotion,

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:40.070 align:middle line:10%
their heart goes
into supercoherence.

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:42.160 align:middle line:10%
They're feeling tremendous love.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:46.640 align:middle line:10%
And the strong emotion is
causing them to pay attention

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.430 align:middle line:10%
to the pictures in their mind.

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And in an instant, it's like
their past is washed away.

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:55.710 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, we're
seeing instantaneous changes

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:56.510 align:middle line:90%
with health.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:19:01.910 align:middle line:84%
A person's psoriasis
goes away in an instant.

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:05.080 align:middle line:84%
A person working with
a spinal cord injury

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.440 align:middle line:90%
is now walking without crutches.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.360 align:middle line:84%
People with
Parkinson's disease--

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.120 align:middle line:84%
their conditions are
returning back to normal

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.370 align:middle line:84%
because the level
of energy that's

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:14.870 align:middle line:84%
running through
their nervous system

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:16.580 align:middle line:84%
is giving them a
biological upgrade.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And now we're seeing
the same patterns.

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:21.530 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing the
same brain scans.

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.160 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing the same
changes in health.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And the side effect of it
is the person is completely

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:29.930 align:middle line:90%
changed as an individual.

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:31.940 align:middle line:90%
They're saying, I feel so whole.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:32.990 align:middle line:90%
I feel so happy.

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:34.490 align:middle line:90%
I feel so free.

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is the
natural state of being.

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: From your
workshop, there's

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:41.060 align:middle line:90%
a lot of experiences like this.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:45.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Imagine 750
people in the room.

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:47.400 align:middle line:10%
They're overcoming themselves.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And they start
activating this center,

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:52.310 align:middle line:84%
their center of oneness,
their center of wholeness.

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And as the heart
starts getting coherent

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:59.540 align:middle line:84%
and it starts creating elevated
emotions, like gratitude,

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:03.160 align:middle line:84%
people are feeling the
emotions of their future

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.470 align:middle line:84%
that begin to create
holism and oneness.

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:09.440 align:middle line:84%
If the environment
signals the gene,

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.980 align:middle line:84%
and the end product of an
experience in the environment

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.800 align:middle line:84%
is called an "emotion,"
when you embrace

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.590 align:middle line:84%
these elevated emotions,
you are literally

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:22.290 align:middle line:84%
selecting and instructing new
genes ahead of the environment.

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And we are going to
turn on new lights

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.470 align:middle line:84%
and turn off old
lights, signaling

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.630 align:middle line:90%
new genes and new ways.

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>> During meditation,
my heart just opened up.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.060 align:middle line:90%
I was sobbing with joy.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And I was having these
waves and waves and waves

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:39.380 align:middle line:90%
of love and gratitude.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I can only
describe it as a bolt,

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:44.780 align:middle line:84%
like a lightning bolt of
energy arrived in my heart.

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't come up
through the center and down.

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:52.400 align:middle line:84%
It just came out through my
heart and up through my head.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I was very conscious of the
fact that I don't expect to see

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:56.880 align:middle line:90%
anything.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, I don't know.

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:02.990 align:middle line:84%
I started feeling this
weird, strange shaking

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.990 align:middle line:90%
all over my body.

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:06.590 align:middle line:84%
But it was getting stronger
and getting stronger.

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And there are tears of
joy rolling down their face.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.880 align:middle line:84%
They are being
baptized by the divine.

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And when that occurs,
they feel so whole

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:19.910 align:middle line:84%
and so in love with life and
so in love with themselves,

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:22.610 align:middle line:90%
it's impossible to want.

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:25.340 align:middle line:84%
How can you want
when you feel whole?

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:27.230 align:middle line:84%
You feel like you
have everything.

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's the moment the magic
happens over and over again.

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And there is a biological,
neurological, genetic upgrade

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:38.820 align:middle line:90%
in that person.

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And when that occurs, you will
feel so connected and so whole,

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:47.460 align:middle line:84%
you no longer
experience separation.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.030 align:middle line:84%
Imagine your heart
is in supercoherence.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And when that heart
starts to beat in rhythm

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.450 align:middle line:84%
and they're sustaining it,
all of a sudden, that field

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:57.800 align:middle line:90%
starts to expand.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.980 align:middle line:84%
That energy starts to
become very coherent,

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:05.540 align:middle line:84%
like dropping a pebble in water
after pebble after pebble.

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:06.707 align:middle line:90%
And it's creating this wave.

00:22:06.707 --> 00:22:07.506 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:22:07.506 --> 00:22:09.507 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Joe, why is it
so emotional for people?

00:22:09.507 --> 00:22:10.306 align:middle line:90%
My God.

00:22:10.306 --> 00:22:11.690 align:middle line:90%
They were breaking down, crying.

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:12.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah, I know.

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And it probably scares
a lot of people.

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:15.710 align:middle line:84%
But they're not in
any type of pain.

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:17.900 align:middle line:90%
It looks like it's glee.

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yes.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:23.060 align:middle line:10%
God, we spend so much
of our lives, George--

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:26.180 align:middle line:10%
70% of the time, according
to the research--

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:28.940 align:middle line:10%
living in survival,
living in stress.

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And living in stress
and living in survival

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.920 align:middle line:84%
is when your brain and
body are out of balance.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in
survival, you're

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:39.650 align:middle line:84%
always anticipating the worst
thing to happen in your life.

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:43.765 align:middle line:84%
So most people live by the
emotions of fear or anger

00:22:43.765 --> 00:22:46.190 align:middle line:84%
or hostility or
aggression or competition

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:47.960 align:middle line:90%
or envy or jealousy.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.120 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know
how to open their heart

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:54.549 align:middle line:84%
because in survival, it's not
a time to open your heart.

00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:56.090 align:middle line:84%
If you're being
chased by a predator,

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:57.260 align:middle line:90%
it's not a time to learn.

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:58.550 align:middle line:90%
It's not a time to sit still.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:00.350 align:middle line:90%
It's not a time to go within.

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.730 align:middle line:84%
The survival gene
is switched on.

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:02.730 align:middle line:90%
You have three choices--

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:05.000 align:middle line:90%
you run, you hide, or you fight.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.920 align:middle line:84%
People then close
down their heart

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.620 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
want to be vulnerable.

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:11.909 align:middle line:90%
So we teach them.

00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:13.700 align:middle line:10%
We partnered with the
Heart Math Institute,

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.160 align:middle line:10%
and we teach them
how to self-regulate.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.800 align:middle line:10%
We teach them how to
activate the center

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:23.150 align:middle line:10%
and how to begin to trade
guilt or sadness or pain

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:27.380 align:middle line:10%
for gratitude and worthiness
and a love for life

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:28.550 align:middle line:10%
and a joy for existence.

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And just like anything else,
if you start practicing

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:35.810 align:middle line:84%
and you're knocking on the
door, once that center begins

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:39.350 align:middle line:84%
to open up and your
heart begins to change,

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:40.920 align:middle line:90%
it's an amazing phenomenon.

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:44.250 align:middle line:84%
The heart begins to release
a chemical called "oxytocin."

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:45.050 align:middle line:90%
Oxytocin--

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Makes you
feel good, doesn't it?

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: It's
the love chemical.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, we've measured
oxytocin in our students.

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:54.080 align:middle line:84%
In four days, some of them
have 200 times the amount

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.282 align:middle line:90%
of oxytocin.

00:23:55.282 --> 00:23:59.320 align:middle line:10%
Now, oxytocin-- according
to the research--

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.360 align:middle line:10%
once it's in the
circulatory system

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.410 align:middle line:10%
rushes right into the amygdala.

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:05.479 align:middle line:10%
The amygdala is the survival
center in the brain.

00:24:05.479 --> 00:24:07.270 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's our
reptilian brain, right?

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:10.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: It's that
little almond-shaped part

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:13.660 align:middle line:84%
of the brain that's always
scanning the environment

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.370 align:middle line:90%
to determine danger.

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And so there's four
different emotions

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:19.600 align:middle line:90%
that the amygdala is wired for--

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:25.750 align:middle line:84%
aggression and anger, fear and
anxiety, pain and suffering,

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:27.370 align:middle line:90%
and joy and love.

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:29.770 align:middle line:84%
So the moment
oxytocin is released

00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:32.680 align:middle line:84%
into the circulatory system,
it shuts the lights out

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.150 align:middle line:90%
for anger and aggression.

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:37.030 align:middle line:84%
It cools the circuits
off for fear and anxiety.

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And it lowers the volume
to pain and suffering.

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And the only emotion
the person can feel

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.260 align:middle line:90%
is a true love for life.

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:48.160 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the research shows
that when oxytocin levels are

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:52.660 align:middle line:84%
elevated just slightly, it's
impossible to hold a grudge.

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:54.670 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
why would you want

00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:58.620 align:middle line:84%
to trade this feeling
for anyone or anything?

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:02.430 align:middle line:84%
You would say, I feel
so great that I don't

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:03.580 align:middle line:90%
want to lose this feeling.

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:07.740 align:middle line:84%
So when oxytocin is released,
it signals a chemical

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:09.790 align:middle line:90%
called "nitric oxide."

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Nitric oxide signals a chemical
called "endothelial-derived

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:14.629 align:middle line:90%
relaxing factor."

00:25:14.629 --> 00:25:16.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's just a
big word that just

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:17.760 align:middle line:90%
means it causes the arteries--

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To expand, right?

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: --and your heart
and your brain just to open up.

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:25.050 align:middle line:84%
So you're getting more
energy and more blood flow.

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And your heart is
literally feeling full.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And with that comes an
energy or an emotion.

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:33.380 align:middle line:84%
So you feel so grateful,
you feel so blessed,

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:36.774 align:middle line:84%
you feel so whole that
you can't want anything.

00:25:36.774 --> 00:25:38.190 align:middle line:84%
You feel like you
have everything.

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:39.430 align:middle line:90%
You feel blessed.

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:42.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, I call that the
natural state of being.

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:46.380 align:middle line:84%
So most people don't
want to take the time

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:47.590 align:middle line:90%
to get beyond their fear.

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:48.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:52.769 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Because
many people--

00:25:52.769 --> 00:25:54.060 align:middle line:90%
they get caught in these loops.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.710 align:middle line:84%
They have those
events in their life

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:57.420 align:middle line:90%
that cause the strong emotions.

00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:58.950 align:middle line:90%
Let's say it's fear.

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:00.630 align:middle line:90%
Or let's say it's failure.

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:01.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or failure.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.480 align:middle line:90%
Something goes wrong.

>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.960 align:middle line:90%
So if you feel like a failure--

>>NOORY: You're going to be one.

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:08.331 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: --you're going to
think you are a failure, right?

00:26:08.331 --> 00:26:11.310 align:middle line:84%
So if you can't think
greater than how you feel,

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:13.080 align:middle line:84%
or feelings become
the means of thinking,

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.910 align:middle line:84%
then you're thinking
in the past.

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:16.410 align:middle line:84%
So people get caught
in these loops.

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:17.790 align:middle line:90%
They think certain thoughts.

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Those thoughts makes
certain chemicals.

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:20.581 align:middle line:90%
They feel like a failure.

00:26:20.581 --> 00:26:22.830 align:middle line:84%
The moment the brain checks
in with the body and says,

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:25.080 align:middle line:84%
yeah, you're feeling
pretty much like a failure,

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.960 align:middle line:84%
you'll generate more thoughts
equal to how you're feeling.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.170 align:middle line:84%
So the thinking and feeling
and feeling and thinking

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:32.730 align:middle line:90%
creates a state of being.

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:37.230 align:middle line:84%
So then when people get caught
in these loops, what happens

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:39.810 align:middle line:90%
is they get happy being unhappy.

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Because the hardest
part about change

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:46.350 align:middle line:84%
is not making the same choice
as you did the day before.

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:49.170 align:middle line:84%
So then the moment you say,
I'm going to give up my guilt,

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:52.230 align:middle line:84%
that means you're going to leave
everything familiar and known

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:53.080 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
step into the unknown.

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
be uncomfortable.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.330 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be unfamiliar.

00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:58.530 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be
some uncertainty.

00:26:58.530 --> 00:26:59.460 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
be able to predict

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.220 align:middle line:84%
the next moment because
you're no longer in the known.

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:03.210 align:middle line:90%
You're in the unknown.

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:06.840 align:middle line:84%
So people, they feel
that uncomfortableness.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.240 align:middle line:84%
They can't predict or know
what's going to happen.

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:10.560 align:middle line:90%
They're in this void.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And the body, which has been
conditioned to be the mind,

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:18.070 align:middle line:84%
says, you've been feeling this
way for the last 25 years.

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And so the body starts sending
signals back to the brain

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:22.590 align:middle line:90%
to influence our thoughts.

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:25.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we respond to those
thoughts as if they're true,

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:27.840 align:middle line:84%
those same thoughts lead
to the same choices.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.000 align:middle line:84%
The same choices lead
to the same behaviors.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.470 align:middle line:84%
The same behaviors create
the same experiences.

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And the same experiences
produce that same feeling

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.480 align:middle line:90%
or an emotion.

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And a person says,
this feels right.

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:37.890 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:39.540 align:middle line:90%
That feels familiar.

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Going from the old
self to the new self

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:45.600 align:middle line:84%
is a neurological, biological,
chemical, hormonal death

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:46.460 align:middle line:90%
of the old self.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And most people don't know how
to change their internal states

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:53.070 align:middle line:84%
without relying on
something outside of them.

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:55.490 align:middle line:84%
They'd rather take the
pill, the drug, the drink.

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:57.840 align:middle line:84%
They'd rather go shopping,
gambling, whatever.

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.810 align:middle line:84%
They'd rather distract
them from the true essence

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:03.360 align:middle line:84%
of how to change because
most people don't understand

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.310 align:middle line:84%
that they have the
ability to change.

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:08.610 align:middle line:84%
So when people start
to connect, when

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:11.390 align:middle line:84%
that heart starts to
become more coherent

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:13.660 align:middle line:84%
and it starts to
beat more orderly,

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:15.450 align:middle line:84%
the energy is moving
into their body.

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:16.800 align:middle line:90%
And they feel lifted.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.780 align:middle line:90%
And if it opens up all the way--

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:21.280 align:middle line:84%
we've seen this
thousands of times--

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.340 align:middle line:84%
the heart will all of
a sudden be filled.

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And that energy will
continue right to the brain.

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:27.090 align:middle line:90%
And then they'll be in ecstasy.

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are these permanent
changes for people?

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:33.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, we've seen
so many permanent changes

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:38.910 align:middle line:84%
when this particular
experience happens.

00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:44.640 align:middle line:84%
We've seen people that were
blind from birth see again.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:48.030 align:middle line:84%
We've had plenty of people that
have lost their hearing get

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:48.830 align:middle line:90%
their hearing back.

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:51.540 align:middle line:84%
We've seen tumors
disappear in one week.

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:57.710 align:middle line:84%
We've seen people with crutches
come with all kinds of ataxias

00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:00.150 align:middle line:84%
and spinal cord
injuries leave an event

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:03.720 align:middle line:90%
without any assistance.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.850 align:middle line:84%
So we're seeing all
kinds of crazy things.

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a
biological upgrade.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's huge.

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: It's huge.

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:14.040 align:middle line:84%
So I have to tell
you that I'm probably

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.992 align:middle line:84%
more shocked than
anybody, number one.

00:29:15.992 --> 00:29:17.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You didn't expect
it to work this way?

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:19.366 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: I
didn't expect that I

00:29:19.366 --> 00:29:21.380 align:middle line:90%
would see this in my lifetime.

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a
four-minute mile.

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Once the four-minute
mile was broken,

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:28.556 align:middle line:84%
George, everybody
broke it after.

00:29:28.556 --> 00:29:29.930 align:middle line:84%
It was a change
in consciousness.

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:33.410 align:middle line:84%
So we're seeing we've
pierced this veil.

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And people are no longer saying,
it's impossible for me to heal.

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:40.200 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if we get
somebody on the stage

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.900 align:middle line:84%
like you saw, and they tell
their story of how they've

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:46.440 align:middle line:84%
overcome stage four cancer, and
they don't look like a movie

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.597 align:middle line:84%
star, and they don't look
young and buffed and dressed

00:29:49.597 --> 00:29:51.180 align:middle line:84%
perfectly, look like
a normal person--

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's the real deal.

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:53.401 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: It's the real deal.

00:29:53.401 --> 00:29:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And you're listening
that it wasn't pretty,

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.390 align:middle line:90%
that they lost a lot of things.

00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:58.680 align:middle line:90%
They lost their job.

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.540 align:middle line:90%
They went bankrupt.

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And they were at the
bottom of the barrel.

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And they turned that
battleship around.

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:07.320 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
to scratch your head.

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.710 align:middle line:90%
And we put up the brain scans.

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And we put up all
the measurements

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:12.060 align:middle line:90%
to show that it's possible.

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:14.520 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to scratch
your head and think, well,

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.240 align:middle line:90%
a fat person can do it.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.290 align:middle line:90%
So can I.

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:21.062 align:middle line:84%
So just like an infection
spreads amongst the community

00:30:21.062 --> 00:30:23.520 align:middle line:84%
and creates disease, if you
get a group of people together,

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.350 align:middle line:84%
I believe that health
and wellness can

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:27.460 align:middle line:90%
be as infectious as disease.

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, there's
a moment in our workshops.

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:33.870 align:middle line:84%
I now know that when we get
a group of people together,

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:36.070 align:middle line:84%
the first day is about
overcoming yourself.

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you after looking
at all those brain scans,

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.950 align:middle line:84%
you and I are at
our absolute best

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:42.360 align:middle line:90%
when we get beyond ourselves.

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And the process of
getting beyond the self,

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:48.090 align:middle line:84%
getting beyond and disentangling
from those programs and those

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:51.750 align:middle line:84%
emotions-- it creates a lot
of disturbance, biologically

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:52.860 align:middle line:90%
and energetically.

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And so most people--
when they come up

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:58.420 align:middle line:84%
in this process of change
and there's all this chaos,

00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:59.430 align:middle line:90%
they quit.

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:00.880 align:middle line:90%
They say, I just can't do it.

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:01.320 align:middle line:90%
It's too much.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.819 align:middle line:84%
But if they're with a group of
people, and I'm pushing them,

00:31:03.819 --> 00:31:06.450 align:middle line:84%
and they get numerous
opportunities to connect,

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:09.750 align:middle line:84%
all that disorder,
all that chaos

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:11.970 align:middle line:90%
is just unpredictable order.

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:14.790 align:middle line:84%
There's going to come a
moment after that first day

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:16.530 align:middle line:84%
where it's going to
start to organize.

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And when it does, it's
like lights going on.

00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:22.850 align:middle line:10%
All of a sudden, everybody
starts in training.

00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:24.110 align:middle line:10%
Everybody starts resonating.

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:26.669 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden now we
start creating the miraculous.

00:31:26.669 --> 00:31:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And we start seeing it
over and over again.

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, by the
end of the event, people

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:34.460 align:middle line:84%
are doing really uncommon
or supernatural things.

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
that's our birthright.

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:39.650 align:middle line:84%
I believe that's who
we are when we're not

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:41.120 align:middle line:90%
caught up in our programs.

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who is Anouk?

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Anouk is a woman
that I met about 10 years ago

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:55.750 align:middle line:84%
whose husband went to the
tallest building in Rotterdam

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:58.675 align:middle line:84%
and jumped off the top of the
building and committed suicide.

00:31:58.675 --> 00:31:59.815 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my God.

00:31:59.815 --> 00:32:01.450 align:middle line:90%
And she never saw that coming?

00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: She
never saw it coming.

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:05.380 align:middle line:84%
He just left on a Sunday
morning and had never said

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:08.060 align:middle line:84%
goodbye to her, just said a
quick goodbye to the kids.

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:09.280 align:middle line:90%
She was in the shower.

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:11.886 align:middle line:90%
He was a successful attorney.

00:32:11.886 --> 00:32:14.030 align:middle line:90%
And he just took his life.

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And the event threw her
into a very strong tailspin.

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, that makes sense
because an event

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:24.480 align:middle line:84%
like that is going to change
your internal state, right?

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Forever.

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Forever--
well, almost forever.

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going to
remember the event where

00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:33.200 align:middle line:84%
the police officers show
up and deliver the news.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is that
the shock or the trauma

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.510 align:middle line:84%
like that causes you to
continuously remember

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:40.310 align:middle line:90%
the event.

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.875 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my God.

00:32:40.875 --> 00:32:41.675 align:middle line:90%
And it's painful.

00:32:41.675 --> 00:32:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And so you start
producing the same chemistry

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.700 align:middle line:84%
in your brain and body
as if the event was--

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Over and over.

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a quick look at
a Anouk from "Supernatural."

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:51.500 align:middle line:90%

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:56.100 align:middle line:10%
>> I made a decision to
start meditating daily.

00:32:56.100 --> 00:33:00.110 align:middle line:10%
And I started the
work first on my own.

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And then I started talking
with people about it.

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.920 align:middle line:90%
And they were supporting me.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:08.780 align:middle line:84%
I would start meditating
in the evening around 9:30.

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And then I would sit with it
till I really felt I'm whole.

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm having more energy.

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:17.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm joyful.

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:19.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm a happy person.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.600 align:middle line:90%
I can do this.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:25.460 align:middle line:84%
It will work-- all these changes
that I had to tell myself.

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:29.445 align:middle line:84%
If not the chemo, then why
not try to heal myself?

00:33:29.445 --> 00:33:30.245 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:33:30.245 --> 00:33:32.328 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Joe, that doesn't
look like a woman whose

00:33:32.328 --> 00:33:33.764 align:middle line:90%
husband jumped off a building.

00:33:33.764 --> 00:33:35.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: I'll tell you
what, that woman-- it took

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:37.650 align:middle line:90%
her a couple years to change.

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:42.470 align:middle line:84%
But after that whole event,
she wound up in the hospital,

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:46.490 align:middle line:84%
was paralyzed in both legs
with a very serious neuropathy.

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:51.260 align:middle line:84%
Then she developed these
esophageal and mucous

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:55.367 align:middle line:84%
membranes, ulcerations
in her mouth,

00:33:55.367 --> 00:33:56.450 align:middle line:90%
her throat, her esophagus.

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:58.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She was falling apart.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:01.100 align:middle line:90%
Then she developed cancer.

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors told her
that she had a certain amount

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:05.600 align:middle line:90%
of time to live.

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:09.050 align:middle line:90%
And she came to an event.

00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:12.350 align:middle line:84%
She's a psychotherapist, a
very brilliant psychotherapist.

00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:14.510 align:middle line:90%
And it all made sense to her.

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:19.909 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I am just going
to practice this and overcome

00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:21.739 align:middle line:84%
myself a little
bit more every day.

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to be very clear
here that the road for her

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:28.340 align:middle line:90%
wasn't a linear process.

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:32.929 align:middle line:84%
I want you to know that there
were days where she didn't feel

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:34.880 align:middle line:84%
like doing her
meditations because she

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:37.310 align:middle line:90%
was so sick and so depressed.

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:38.900 align:middle line:90%
But she did them anyway.

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:39.860 align:middle line:90%
And she overcame.

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She did them
even during those days?

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: During those days.

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:46.190 align:middle line:84%
There were days where
she was filled with fear

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:48.350 align:middle line:84%
because the doctors
told her she was stupid

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:49.400 align:middle line:90%
and she was going to die.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that normal
to feel that way?

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:52.026 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Of course.

00:34:52.026 --> 00:34:54.859 align:middle line:84%
But she overcame her fear by
continuously doing the work.

00:34:54.859 --> 00:34:56.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, pushing herself.

00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:56.389 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:58.880 align:middle line:84%
There were days that she
had a lot of self-doubt,

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.040 align:middle line:84%
and she didn't believe
it was possible.

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.840 align:middle line:90%
But she did the work anyway.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And there were days
that she was busy.

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:07.580 align:middle line:90%
And she had three children.

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:09.767 align:middle line:84%
She could have said, I
have to excuse myself.

00:35:09.767 --> 00:35:10.850 align:middle line:90%
I can't do the meditation.

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:13.940 align:middle line:84%
But she found time every
day to do the work.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And every day, she overcame,
she overcame, she overcame

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:20.480 align:middle line:90%
until she became somebody else.

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, the disease no longer
exists in that personality.

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She looked happy.

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: The disease existed
in the old personality that

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:32.010 align:middle line:84%
was thinking a certain
way, acting a certain way,

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:33.230 align:middle line:90%
and feeling a certain way.

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And how you think, how
you act, and how you feel

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:38.060 align:middle line:90%
is called your personality.

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And your personality creates
your personal reality.

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:45.020 align:middle line:84%
So it means that if you want to
change your personal reality--

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:48.140 align:middle line:84%
your life-- that means you've
got to change your personality.

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:51.210 align:middle line:84%
You got to start thinking about
what you've been thinking about

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:52.050 align:middle line:90%
and change it.

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:54.560 align:middle line:84%
You got to become conscious
of your unconscious habits

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.840 align:middle line:90%
and behaviors and modify them.

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to look
at certain emotions that

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.910 align:middle line:84%
keep you anchored
to the past and ask

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:03.740 align:middle line:90%
the most important question--

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:07.340 align:middle line:84%
do these emotions
belong in my future?

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And the problem with
those survival emotions

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:11.810 align:middle line:90%
is they're like a narcotic.

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:13.080 align:middle line:90%
They're like a drug.

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:16.480 align:middle line:84%
They give the brain and
body a rush of energy.

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And people, over time, become
addicted to the very rush

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:22.190 align:middle line:90%
of those survival chemicals.

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And they use the people
and problems in their life

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:27.450 align:middle line:84%
and in their past to
reaffirm their addiction

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:28.250 align:middle line:90%
to that emotion.

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:29.857 align:middle line:84%
That means they
need the bad job.

00:36:29.857 --> 00:36:31.190 align:middle line:90%
They need the poor relationship.

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:32.731 align:middle line:84%
They need the bad
memories because it

00:36:32.731 --> 00:36:34.326 align:middle line:90%
makes them feel something.

00:36:34.326 --> 00:36:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even though
it's not a good feeling.

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:37.616 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: That
means they become

00:36:37.616 --> 00:36:39.530 align:middle line:84%
addicted to the life
they don't even like.

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
change is so hard.

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:45.760 align:middle line:84%
So then just like an
addict overcoming drug,

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.510 align:middle line:84%
when people start
to change, they

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:49.130 align:middle line:84%
have to go through
these periods where

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:50.600 align:middle line:90%
they're in the withdrawal.

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:54.080 align:middle line:84%
But the next question is,
what thoughts do you want

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.120 align:middle line:90%
to fire and wire in your brain?

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Close your eyes and begin
to review those thoughts.

00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:02.470 align:middle line:84%
What behaviors do you want
to change or demonstrate

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:03.970 align:middle line:90%
in one day?

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And the act of closing your eyes
and rehearsing your behaviors--

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.210 align:middle line:84%
the latest research
in neuroscience

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:13.440 align:middle line:84%
says that you begin
to change your brain

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.030 align:middle line:84%
to look like that experience
has already happened.

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:17.850 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
you're installing

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:19.750 align:middle line:84%
the neurological
hardware in your brain.

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you keep doing
it over and over again,

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:24.240 align:middle line:84%
the hardware becomes
a software program.

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:25.340 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:27.000 align:middle line:84%
You start acting
like a happy person.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:27.410 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:28.368 align:middle line:90%
There's no magic there.

00:37:28.368 --> 00:37:29.792 align:middle line:90%
You installed the circuits.

00:37:29.792 --> 00:37:31.500 align:middle line:84%
You start thinking in
more unlimited ways

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.330 align:middle line:90%
because you put those in place.

00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:35.796 align:middle line:90%
And now here's the tough part.

00:37:35.796 --> 00:37:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Can you teach your
body emotionally

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:41.400 align:middle line:84%
what that future
is going to feel

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.050 align:middle line:90%
like before it's made manifest?

00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:45.360 align:middle line:84%
That means you can't
wait for your healing

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:47.340 align:middle line:90%
to feel gratitude and wholeness.

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:49.140 align:middle line:84%
You can't wait for
your wealth to feel

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:50.880 align:middle line:90%
abundance and worthiness.

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:53.340 align:middle line:84%
You can't wait for the
mystical moment to feel awe.

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:56.280 align:middle line:84%
That's the old model of
reality of cause and effect.

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.110 align:middle line:90%
That's Newtonian physics.

00:37:58.110 --> 00:38:00.575 align:middle line:84%
But the new model of reality,
the quantum model of reality,

00:38:00.575 --> 00:38:01.950 align:middle line:84%
is about causing
an effect, which

00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:04.350 align:middle line:84%
means the moment you start
feeling gratitude and whole,

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:05.760 align:middle line:90%
your healing begins.

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:08.290 align:middle line:84%
The moment you start
feeling worthy and abundant,

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:09.720 align:middle line:90%
you're generating wealth.

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.800 align:middle line:84%
The moment you're
in awe of life,

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.010 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
a mystical experience.

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:17.370 align:middle line:84%
So then your body is
your unconscious mind.

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:20.910 align:middle line:84%
It does not know the difference
between an actual experience

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:23.580 align:middle line:84%
in your life that creates
an emotion and an emotion

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:25.690 align:middle line:84%
that you can create
by thought alone.

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:27.030 align:middle line:90%
So the body is believing.

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:30.030 align:middle line:84%
It's living in that future
reality in the present moment.

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And what's the
significance of that?

00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:34.320 align:middle line:84%
As I said, the latest
research in genetics

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:37.240 align:middle line:90%
says genes don't create disease.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:38.700 align:middle line:84%
It's the environment
that signals

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:41.290 align:middle line:90%
the gene that creates change.

00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, if the end product of an
experience in the environment

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:47.736 align:middle line:84%
is an emotion, the moment you
embrace an elevated emotion,

00:38:47.736 --> 00:38:49.860 align:middle line:84%
you're signaling the gene
ahead of the environment.

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:51.180 align:middle line:90%
Now, what do genes do?

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:52.290 align:middle line:90%
Genes make proteins.

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And what are proteins
responsible for?

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:56.310 align:middle line:84%
The structure or
function of your body.

00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And the expression of proteins
is the expression of life.

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you keep knocking
on that genetic door

00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:03.420 align:middle line:84%
over and over
again, you are going

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:05.970 align:middle line:84%
to begin to upregulate
the genes for health.

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:08.564 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to downregulate
the genes for disease.

00:39:08.564 --> 00:39:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, you're
going to wake up in your dream

00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:13.020 align:middle line:84%
and realize that you're
a different person.

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:16.744 align:middle line:84%
And the personality now that had
the disease is no longer you.

00:39:16.744 --> 00:39:18.660 align:middle line:84%
It's like a person with
a multiple personality

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:22.260 align:middle line:84%
disorder that has an allergy
to nylon stockings in one

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:23.640 align:middle line:90%
personality and a normal--

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This normal again.

00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Are there some people, Joe,
who have an innate ability

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:31.860 align:middle line:84%
to make people feel better
because of what they are,

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:33.810 align:middle line:84%
their personality,
or who they are?

00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:37.860 align:middle line:84%
Because I've noticed that some
people, you flock around them.

00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Other people, you
run away from them.

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:40.890 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:42.515 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well,
that's a great point.

00:39:42.515 --> 00:39:45.700 align:middle line:84%
I think we'll have to step
out of the realm of biology

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:46.950 align:middle line:90%
and into the realm of physics.

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:51.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the body is always
emitting light and information.

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:55.570 align:middle line:84%
Every cell in the body
emits energy and light.

00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:59.899 align:middle line:84%
So if a person is
negative and frustrated--

00:39:59.899 --> 00:40:01.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
feel that from them.

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:02.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: You can feel it.

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.290 align:middle line:84%
So you have your waves
working with their waves,

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:05.130 align:middle line:90%
and they cancel out.

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And you feel that
destructive interference.

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:13.290 align:middle line:84%
But if we're sharing the same
energy, and our energy unifies

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:15.900 align:middle line:84%
and it creates bigger
waves, it's constructive.

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:17.160 align:middle line:90%
And we feel connected.

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:18.555 align:middle line:90%
And that's healthy.

00:40:18.555 --> 00:40:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think that many
people shut that off.

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:25.230 align:middle line:84%
But I think that we're
innately sensitive to energy.

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:28.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can a person who has
higher levels of this energy

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:31.580 align:middle line:84%
affect somebody who has
a lower level and kind

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:32.430 align:middle line:90%
of bring them up?

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:33.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Absolutely.

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And listen-- we're doing these
week-long events, George.

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And we were teaching people
how to heal other people.

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:45.420 align:middle line:10%
Now, there was research
done at Yale University

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:48.930 align:middle line:10%
back in the '40s by this
great scientist named

00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:50.730 align:middle line:10%
Harold Saxton Burr.

00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:52.230 align:middle line:10%
And what Burr was
interested in was

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:55.042 align:middle line:10%
studying the electromagnetic
fields around things.

00:40:55.042 --> 00:40:57.000 align:middle line:10%
So he started with all
kinds of different eggs,

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.630 align:middle line:10%
like salamander eggs, lizard
eggs, chicken eggs, bird eggs.

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And what he noticed was
that every single time,

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:04.830 align:middle line:84%
the most positive,
strongest charge

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:06.420 align:middle line:90%
was always where the head was.

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And the weakest charge was
always where the tail was.

00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And he noticed that there was
this invisible electromagnetic

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:15.010 align:middle line:84%
field like a magnet
surrounding the organism.

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:16.647 align:middle line:90%
So then he said, OK.

00:41:16.647 --> 00:41:17.980 align:middle line:90%
That's 100% percent of the time.

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:20.460 align:middle line:84%
So then he started
studying rodents

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:23.840 align:middle line:84%
that had a proclivity
for uterine cancer.

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And what he noticed was
that every single rodent

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:31.470 align:middle line:84%
had the same electromagnetic
signature that had the cancer

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:33.250 align:middle line:90%
100% of the time.

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:34.680 align:middle line:90%
But here's the cool part.

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:38.100 align:middle line:84%
There were rodents that
didn't have the cancer

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:39.990 align:middle line:84%
but had the signature
in the field.

00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And every single one
of them ultimately

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:43.650 align:middle line:90%
developed the cancer.

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:46.840 align:middle line:84%
That means that it's not
matter that emits a field.

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:49.290 align:middle line:84%
It's the field that
creates matter.

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:52.350 align:middle line:84%
Change the field,
change the matter.

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:53.610 align:middle line:90%
So we take a group of people.

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:55.110 align:middle line:90%
We call it the cage.

00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:57.450 align:middle line:10%
People come that have
health conditions.

00:41:57.450 --> 00:41:58.560 align:middle line:10%
They lay on the floor.

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:00.750 align:middle line:10%
Now, our students have
been working all week long.

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:01.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is at a workshop.

00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:02.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:02.870 align:middle line:90%
They're connecting.

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:04.380 align:middle line:90%
They spend the whole week.

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:05.650 align:middle line:90%
They're getting better.

00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:06.858 align:middle line:90%
They're getting more refined.

00:42:06.858 --> 00:42:08.472 align:middle line:90%
They're creating more coherence.

00:42:08.472 --> 00:42:12.420 align:middle line:84%
It only requires them to
get beyond their body,

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:14.870 align:middle line:84%
get beyond their environment,
and get beyond time.

00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And they connect to
that quantum field.

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And we teach them how to lay a
coherent signature in the field

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.040 align:middle line:90%
of the person laying there.

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Once they do?

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: I have
seen tumors disappear.

00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:28.790 align:middle line:90%
I've seen people's bodies--

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:31.250 align:middle line:84%
nothing but the back of
their head and their heels

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:33.677 align:middle line:84%
touching the ground
coming off the floor.

00:42:33.677 --> 00:42:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you in shock?

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: I am very surprised.

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:38.120 align:middle line:90%
And those people come up.

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And they have a very significant
change in their health.

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
makes it work, Joe?

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:44.560 align:middle line:90%
What does it?

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:46.550 align:middle line:90%
What is it about what you say--

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:48.970 align:middle line:90%
and I have no doubts about that.

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:52.110 align:middle line:84%
But what is it about
that that makes it work?

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: I'm going to
answer it on two levels

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:57.470 align:middle line:90%
because I want to be very clear.

00:42:57.470 --> 00:43:06.730 align:middle line:84%
There is an absolute physical,
scientific explanation to it.

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:08.940 align:middle line:84%
There is energy
that is beginning

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:13.350 align:middle line:84%
to create coherent patterns
that are literally disorganizing

00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:16.250 align:middle line:84%
anything incoherent and
reorganizing wholeness

00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:17.050 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:18.580 align:middle line:90%
We see that.

00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:21.960 align:middle line:84%
But for the people,
the healers--

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:24.570 align:middle line:84%
they have to get
energy into their heart

00:43:24.570 --> 00:43:28.320 align:middle line:84%
because that's the center where
the field begins to expand.

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:31.339 align:middle line:84%
They can't be thinking about
how long they're doing it.

00:43:31.339 --> 00:43:32.880 align:middle line:84%
They can't be thinking
about, my back

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:34.767 align:middle line:90%
hurts, am I doing this right.

00:43:34.767 --> 00:43:36.350 align:middle line:84%
They've got to get
beyond all of that.

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:39.480 align:middle line:84%
They've got to connect to
that field of information.

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, what makes
them get there is

00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:47.690 align:middle line:84%
the instruction, the
repetition, the experience,

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:52.010 align:middle line:84%
and a certain level of trust
or belief that it's the truth.

00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:56.570 align:middle line:84%
So we have to step into
the unknown in order

00:43:56.570 --> 00:43:58.350 align:middle line:90%
for the unknown to happen.

00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And we've got to
be able to execute

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:04.160 align:middle line:84%
with a certain amount of skill,
just like any skill you learn.

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:06.500 align:middle line:84%
When it comes time
to do this, you

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:09.080 align:middle line:84%
have to have certain
skill sets in place.

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
you have to trust.

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:13.670 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
you can't control it.

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:14.570 align:middle line:90%
You can't predict it.

00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:16.650 align:middle line:84%
You can't try to make
it happen because--

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:17.901 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But it's so powerful.

00:44:17.901 --> 00:44:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: It's unbelievable.

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did Jesus
have this ability?

00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:21.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Absolutely.

00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:22.428 align:middle line:90%
And what was he saying?

00:44:22.428 --> 00:44:23.410 align:middle line:90%
He said, hey, look.

00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:26.780 align:middle line:84%
If I could do this,
you could do it, too.

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
we're witnessing

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:32.580 align:middle line:84%
miracles in our workshops that
are of biblical proportion.

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:37.580 align:middle line:84%
They are really amazing,
powerful miracles.

00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There is a part of the
brain called the "pineal gland"

00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:42.660 align:middle line:90%
that I think is important.

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:44.040 align:middle line:90%
Let's hear more about it first.

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:44.515 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:44:44.515 --> 00:44:45.315 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:44:45.315 --> 00:44:48.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Near the center of the brain,
we find a tiny pine cone-shaped

00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:50.960 align:middle line:84%
gland, which may be one
of the most wondrous parts

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.520 align:middle line:90%
of our physical body.

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:55.010 align:middle line:10%
We know that the
pineal gland produces

00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:58.010 align:middle line:10%
serotonin and melatonin
neurotransmitters, which

00:44:58.010 --> 00:45:01.100 align:middle line:10%
regulate waking and sleeping
cycles, as well as playing

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:03.590 align:middle line:10%
a crucial role in mood.

00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:06.150 align:middle line:84%
But it may also be true
that the pineal produces

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:09.950 align:middle line:84%
DMT, or Dimethyltryptamine,
a neurotransmitter which

00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:13.350 align:middle line:84%
creates a natural psychedelic
state of consciousness.

00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:16.160 align:middle line:84%
If so, then this little
gland plays not only

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:18.950 align:middle line:84%
a crucial role in our
psychological well-being.

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:21.290 align:middle line:84%
But it may hold the
key for unlocking

00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:23.570 align:middle line:90%
the true potential of humanity.

00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:26.810 align:middle line:84%
Any ancient esoteric
traditions and mystical schools

00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:29.240 align:middle line:84%
knew of the potential
of the pineal.

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:32.120 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Greeks believed
it to be our connection

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.740 align:middle line:90%
to the realms of thought.

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:37.300 align:middle line:84%
Buddhists know it as a symbol
of spiritual awakening.

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:40.490 align:middle line:84%
In Hinduism, the pineal
connects with the third eye

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:44.180 align:middle line:84%
chakra, the seat of
intuition and clairvoyance.

00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Jesus proclaimed that the
eye is the lamp of the body.

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:50.660 align:middle line:84%
So then if your eye is
clear, your whole body

00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:52.175 align:middle line:90%
will be full of light.

00:45:52.175 --> 00:45:55.370 align:middle line:84%
If René Descartes is right
and the pineal gland is indeed

00:45:55.370 --> 00:45:59.270 align:middle line:84%
the seat of the human soul, then
these predictions are correct

00:45:59.270 --> 00:46:02.390 align:middle line:84%
in believing that it serves
as the connecting link between

00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:03.960 align:middle line:84%
the physical and
spiritual worlds.

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:04.760 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:06.385 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Joe, how
does the pineal gland

00:46:06.385 --> 00:46:08.490 align:middle line:90%
work in these mystical ways?

00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, when
we wake up in the morning

00:46:12.850 --> 00:46:17.730 align:middle line:84%
and we begin to perceive
light, the wavelength of light

00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:19.480 align:middle line:84%
from the sun, wavelength
from these lights

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:22.780 align:middle line:84%
here signals a
nucleus in the brain

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:25.090 align:middle line:84%
called a "superchiasmatic
nucleus," which signals

00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:28.130 align:middle line:84%
the sympathetic nervous system,
signals the pineal gland.

00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And the pineal gland
begins to make serotonin.

00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's our waking
neurotransmitter.

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:35.410 align:middle line:84%
When there's an inhibition
of light and it gets dark,

00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:38.980 align:middle line:84%
the lack of the wavelength of
light does the same pattern.

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And all of a
sudden, serotonin is

00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:44.580 align:middle line:84%
turned into melatonin in
the pineal gland as well.

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:52.340 align:middle line:84%
But the pineal gland has tiny,
little rhombohedron crystals.

00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:55.010 align:middle line:10%
And they're stacked
on top of each other.

00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:58.880 align:middle line:10%
And those crystals act
like a radio receiver.

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And when the pineal gland
gets activated, what it does

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:07.180 align:middle line:84%
is it begins to create
a resonant field,

00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:10.030 align:middle line:84%
an invisible field just
like a radio antenna,

00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:12.760 align:middle line:84%
that can tune in to
different frequencies

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:14.180 align:middle line:90%
beyond the speed of light.

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:16.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, Einstein said E
equals mc squared, which

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:19.020 align:middle line:84%
means nothing in this
three-dimensional reality

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:20.770 align:middle line:84%
can travel faster than
the speed of light.

00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:23.311 align:middle line:84%
Anything material that travels
faster than the speed of light

00:47:23.311 --> 00:47:24.580 align:middle line:90%
is going to turn into energy.

00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:27.250 align:middle line:84%
So the ceiling of this
three-dimensional reality

00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:28.820 align:middle line:90%
is the speed of light.

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:31.210 align:middle line:84%
So when the pineal
gland gets activated

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:35.170 align:middle line:84%
and it begins to resonate at
a frequency faster than light,

00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:39.040 align:middle line:84%
now all of a sudden
now, melatonin

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:41.140 align:middle line:90%
is going to get an upgrade.

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And there are derivatives
or metabolites, George,

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:45.610 align:middle line:90%
of melatonin.

00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And those metabolites
produce some

00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:51.010 align:middle line:84%
of the most powerful
antioxidants known to man--

00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:53.710 align:middle line:84%
anti-cancer, anti-aging,
anti-heart disease,

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:56.020 align:middle line:84%
anti-stroke,
anti-neurodegenerative,

00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:58.930 align:middle line:84%
anti-inflammatory,
anti-microbial.

00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And take the molecule,
tweak it again,

00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:02.770 align:middle line:90%
and you make a benzodiazepine.

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:03.570 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:04.420 align:middle line:90%
That's Valium.

00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:07.610 align:middle line:84%
It's going to sedate
the analytical mind.

00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:09.970 align:middle line:84%
It's going to sedate
those survival centers.

00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, melatonin
causes us to relax.

00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:12.790 align:middle line:90%
This is going to cause--

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:13.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It puts you to sleep.

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: It's going to
cause us to really relax.

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:16.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Too much.

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:17.388 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: No, not too much.

00:48:17.388 --> 00:48:19.120 align:middle line:84%
It's just going to
make us no longer be

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:22.530 align:middle line:84%
preoccupied by fear or any
of those survival emotions.

00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:25.000 align:middle line:84%
You take that molecule,
you tweak it again, you

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.880 align:middle line:84%
have the same chemical found
in hibernating animals--

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:29.820 align:middle line:84%
no sex drive, no
appetite, no interest--

00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:30.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It shuts them down.

00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:32.770 align:middle line:84%
So then the body
goes into stasis.

00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:34.840 align:middle line:84%
You take that molecule,
you tweak it again--

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:37.240 align:middle line:84%
same chemical found
in an electric ell.

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:40.130 align:middle line:84%
That's what causes those
high amplitudes in the brain.

00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:42.410 align:middle line:84%
You take the molecule, you
tweak it one more time,

00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:44.740 align:middle line:84%
and you get dimethyltryptamine,
the most powerful

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:46.480 align:middle line:90%
hallucinogenic known to man.

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:49.000 align:middle line:90%
So now think about this.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.479 align:middle line:90%
There are realms that exist--

00:48:50.479 --> 00:48:53.020 align:middle line:84%
quantum physics will tell you
there's the many worlds theory.

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:55.145 align:middle line:84%
There's infinite dimensions
that are stacked up

00:48:55.145 --> 00:48:56.020 align:middle line:90%
on top of each other.

00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And literally,
we're living right

00:48:57.970 --> 00:49:02.740 align:middle line:84%
in one of those, one slice
of infinite slices in bread.

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:05.770 align:middle line:84%
So then the moment
you begin to tune

00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:09.090 align:middle line:84%
into a frequency faster
than the speed of light,

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:10.630 align:middle line:84%
and the pineal
gland is resonating

00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:12.370 align:middle line:84%
with that frequency,
what's going

00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:14.290 align:middle line:84%
to connect the
physics of that energy

00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:16.090 align:middle line:90%
to the biology of our brain?

00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:17.230 align:middle line:90%
And it's the pineal gland.

00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:19.700 align:middle line:84%
So the pineal gland
takes the input--

00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:22.300 align:middle line:90%
and it's called a "transducer."

00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:25.147 align:middle line:84%
They actually call it in
medical texts a transducer.

00:49:25.147 --> 00:49:26.230 align:middle line:90%
What does a transducer do?

00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:28.540 align:middle line:84%
A transducer is a
television antenna.

00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:31.510 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take a frequency
and turn it into a picture.

00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:35.340 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, once the
pineal gland becomes activated

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:39.100 align:middle line:84%
and it's picking up that energy,
that stream of consciousness

00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:42.336 align:middle line:84%
is going to produce a
very profound vision.

00:49:42.336 --> 00:49:43.960 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's called
the "third eye."

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And that vision is
going to be more real

00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:47.650 align:middle line:90%
than you and I sitting here.

00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:51.640 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be so real that
this three-dimensional reality

00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:53.170 align:middle line:90%
is going to disappear.

00:49:53.170 --> 00:49:55.446 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to be
transported to another place.

00:49:55.446 --> 00:49:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we
activate the pineal gland?

00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well we have
a series of meditations

00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:01.234 align:middle line:90%
that we do.

00:50:01.234 --> 00:50:02.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Geared
straight for that?

00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:04.108 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Just
straight for that.

00:50:04.108 --> 00:50:07.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, the first thing we
do is melatonin levels

00:50:07.210 --> 00:50:11.890 align:middle line:84%
are at their height between
1:00 and 4:00 in the morning.

00:50:11.890 --> 00:50:13.435 align:middle line:84%
Guess when we start
our meditation?

00:50:13.435 --> 00:50:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 1:00 and
4:00 in the morning.

00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: We're on the
floor at 4:00 in the morning.

00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You got them up
at 4:00 in the morning,

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:19.660 align:middle line:84%
probably after my
radio show, right?

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Right
after your radio show.

00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:21.570 align:middle line:90%
Now, why?

00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:23.430 align:middle line:84%
Not because I want
to torture them,

00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:27.040 align:middle line:84%
but because that's when the
raw material is at its height.

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:28.750 align:middle line:90%
And brainwaves are just right.

00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:29.710 align:middle line:90%
You're kind of groggy.

00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:31.932 align:middle line:84%
And you're somewhere
between alpha and theta.

00:50:31.932 --> 00:50:33.640 align:middle line:84%
You don't really care
what you look like.

00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And you get enough
people in the room.

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And then we go through a
series of steps to activate it.

00:50:41.110 --> 00:50:43.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the
things that we do

00:50:43.450 --> 00:50:45.980 align:middle line:84%
is we do this very
particular breath.

00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And when we do this
breath, what we're doing

00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:52.540 align:middle line:84%
is we're working on pulling
energy from our lower centers

00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:54.460 align:middle line:90%
all the way up into our brain.

00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:56.210 align:middle line:90%
And it's a practice.

00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:59.166 align:middle line:84%
And when we do it, we bring
it all way to the top.

00:50:59.166 --> 00:51:00.390 align:middle line:90%
We bring it to the top.

00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And then we squeeze
our intrinsic muscles.

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:04.680 align:middle line:90%
And we just hold our breath.

00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that,
we increase what's

00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:08.475 align:middle line:90%
called "intrathecal pressure."

00:51:08.475 --> 00:51:10.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, at the base of
the third ventricle

00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:12.707 align:middle line:90%
sits the pineal gland.

00:51:12.707 --> 00:51:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And how big is it, Joe?

00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:14.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: It's
the size of a grain

00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:16.070 align:middle line:84%
of rice, a little bigger
than a grain of rice.

00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:16.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's that small?

00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: It's
that small, yeah.

00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Now, when we inhale
and we squeeze like that,

00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:26.570 align:middle line:84%
there's fluid inside this
closed system between our brain

00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:29.600 align:middle line:90%
and our spinal column.

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:32.270 align:middle line:10%
Inside the skull and
the spinal column

00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:34.380 align:middle line:10%
sits the brain and the
central nervous system.

00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:37.320 align:middle line:10%
And it's bathed in this fluid
called "cerebrospinal fluid."

00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:39.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, cerebrospinal
fluid acts as a way

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:41.630 align:middle line:84%
to cushion the brain
if there's trauma.

00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:43.567 align:middle line:90%
It creates buoyancy.

00:51:43.567 --> 00:51:44.900 align:middle line:90%
It helps to transport nutrients.

00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
a shock absorber.

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:46.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's a conduit for
electrical charges.

00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:51.830 align:middle line:84%
So when we start
breathing, we start

00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:54.094 align:middle line:84%
to accelerate the
cerebral spinal fluid.

00:51:54.094 --> 00:51:55.010 align:middle line:90%
It's what we're doing.

00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:57.800 align:middle line:84%
When we hold our
breath and we squeeze,

00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:59.810 align:middle line:84%
we increase
intrathecal pressure.

00:51:59.810 --> 00:52:03.560 align:middle line:84%
We start to put a
mechanical stress up

00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:06.420 align:middle line:84%
against those crystals
in the pineal gland.

00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:08.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's research--
and I have the articles--

00:52:08.830 --> 00:52:12.444 align:middle line:84%
that says the pineal gland
has piezoelectric properties.

00:52:12.444 --> 00:52:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, what the hell
does that mean?

00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:17.180 align:middle line:84%
Piezoelectric-- take
a mechanical stress

00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:19.310 align:middle line:84%
and turn it into an
electrical charge.

00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:22.880 align:middle line:84%
So by applying that stress
against the pineal gland,

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:25.250 align:middle line:84%
you begin to tap
against those crystals.

00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And it begins to produce
an electrical field.

00:52:28.110 --> 00:52:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And that field begins to
stretch out as far as it can.

00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:34.880 align:middle line:84%
When the crystals can't stretch
any more, the field reverses.

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And when the field reverses, it
compresses the crystal again.

00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:39.459 align:middle line:84%
And when the crystals
are compressed,

00:52:39.459 --> 00:52:40.500 align:middle line:90%
it creates another field.

00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And now you've got a
little antenna going there.

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:44.540 align:middle line:84%
So as you keep
practicing this, you

00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:48.200 align:middle line:84%
keep causing that little gland
to become like a radio antenna.

00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:53.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And all of a sudden,
the person goes super lucid.

00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:55.190 align:middle line:84%
They have a
transcendental moment.

00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And that transcendental moment
typically changes them forever.

00:52:58.410 --> 00:53:01.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How could a little
gland be so powerful?

00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Thank
god it's little.

00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:05.540 align:middle line:84%
80% of the people
in the Western world

00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:10.850 align:middle line:84%
have calcified pineal glands
because of fluoride, in fact.

00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:13.220 align:middle line:84%
The negative charge
of the fluoride ion

00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:16.290 align:middle line:84%
binds with the positive
calcium crystals.

00:53:16.290 --> 00:53:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And so it tends to
create this toothpaste

00:53:19.850 --> 00:53:22.300 align:middle line:84%
kind of calcification
in the pineal gland.

00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:25.322 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Joe, what
are you seen worldwide

00:53:25.322 --> 00:53:27.970 align:middle line:84%
with people these
days with everything

00:53:27.970 --> 00:53:29.440 align:middle line:90%
they're being bombarded with?

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:31.755 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a very strange
time period right now.

00:53:31.755 --> 00:53:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: It is
really strange.

00:53:33.130 --> 00:53:35.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you seeing
that with people?

00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:36.030 align:middle line:90%
They're frustrated.

00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:36.430 align:middle line:90%
They're angry.

00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: They're irritated.

00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:38.149 align:middle line:90%
They're more frustrated.

00:53:38.149 --> 00:53:39.190 align:middle line:90%
They're more impatient.

00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:42.742 align:middle line:90%
They have less attention spans.

00:53:42.742 --> 00:53:43.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they're out of balance.

00:53:43.950 --> 00:53:46.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you help them
calm down a little bit.

00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:52.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, the process
of them setting their cellphone

00:53:52.330 --> 00:53:55.330 align:middle line:84%
down, shutting off
their computer,

00:53:55.330 --> 00:53:57.700 align:middle line:84%
disconnecting from
their Facebook

00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:00.160 align:middle line:90%
is part of the retreat.

00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:01.602 align:middle line:84%
Because all of
those things remind

00:54:01.602 --> 00:54:03.185 align:middle line:84%
them of who they are
as a personality.

00:54:03.185 --> 00:54:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So at the workshop,
that stuff is gone.

00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:06.780 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Gone.

00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And we do walking meditation,
standing meditations,

00:54:09.490 --> 00:54:11.180 align:middle line:84%
laying down meditations,
sitting there.

00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:11.980 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Because I want people
to keep practicing it

00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:15.760 align:middle line:90%
in every single way they can.

00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:19.240 align:middle line:84%
So when they leave the
event, they've become it.

00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not about
people's wealth.

00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:22.790 align:middle line:90%
It's not about their health.

00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:25.081 align:middle line:84%
It's not about their new
relationship or their new job.

00:54:25.081 --> 00:54:27.540 align:middle line:84%
It's who they become because
no one can take that away

00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:28.340 align:middle line:90%
from you.

00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:30.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you've been
doing this for a long time.

00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever think
when you started it

00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:35.750 align:middle line:84%
that you would be
healing people this way?

00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:36.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: No.

00:54:36.550 --> 00:54:36.850 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:54:36.850 --> 00:54:37.900 align:middle line:90%
I actually didn't.

00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And I keep telling
my staff I feel

00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:43.270 align:middle line:90%
like I'm waking up in my dream.

00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:44.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm so blessed and so--

00:54:44.730 --> 00:54:47.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it happened to
you, and you changed your life.

00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:49.363 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: I wouldn't
be sitting here

00:54:49.363 --> 00:54:50.950 align:middle line:90%
if I never had that experience.

00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:57.595 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you say to
somebody who is angry, unhappy,

00:54:57.595 --> 00:54:59.972 align:middle line:90%
their life is miserable?

00:54:59.972 --> 00:55:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
out there with that.

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:04.472 align:middle line:90%
What do you tell them?

00:55:04.472 --> 00:55:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: I tell them you
got to start at some point.

00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:12.690 align:middle line:84%
All those emotions, all
those limited emotions--

00:55:12.690 --> 00:55:15.070 align:middle line:84%
they're not hurting
anybody else but you.

00:55:15.070 --> 00:55:17.340 align:middle line:90%
And it's a scientific fact.

00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:20.940 align:middle line:84%
The long-term effects of
those stress chemicals

00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:23.610 align:middle line:84%
push the genetic buttons
that create disease.

00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And so sooner or later,
you've got to give that up.

00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:30.060 align:middle line:84%
Sooner or later, you have to
decide that there's another way

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:31.240 align:middle line:90%
to live.

00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:33.220 align:middle line:90%
And people are doing it.

00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:35.745 align:middle line:84%
And if anybody else can
do it, you can do it.

00:55:35.745 --> 00:55:38.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
have no doubts at all

00:55:38.130 --> 00:55:40.810 align:middle line:90%
at this point that this works?

00:55:40.810 --> 00:55:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: You know, I
think I do have doubts.

00:55:43.170 --> 00:55:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think I have
healthy doubts.

00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:48.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that we can
live forever, although we

00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:51.330 align:middle line:90%
have the gene for immortality.

00:55:51.330 --> 00:55:53.220 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:57.880 align:middle line:84%
I think it's healthy, George,
to take a methodical approach.

00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:00.540 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
you heal yourself.

00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And then you ask, can
I heal somebody else?

00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Then you witness
somebody else be healed.

00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:09.720 align:middle line:84%
Then the next question
is, can I heal somebody

00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:11.053 align:middle line:90%
on the other side of the planet?

00:56:11.053 --> 00:56:12.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, consciousness
is non-local.

00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:14.820 align:middle line:84%
What piece of knowledge
or information

00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:17.660 align:middle line:84%
can I integrate into
my next experience?

00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:20.220 align:middle line:90%
So I think it's an evolution.

00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:23.284 align:middle line:84%
It's unrealistic to say you're
going to be an astronaut

00:56:23.284 --> 00:56:25.200 align:middle line:84%
or go to the moon without
the training, right?

00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:28.710 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very careful
about a very methodical--

00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:29.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You have to be ready.

00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And
step by step, right?

00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:33.370 align:middle line:84%
You've got to go
methodically step by step.

00:56:33.370 --> 00:56:38.430 align:middle line:84%
So I've been super patient in
this process in getting people

00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:41.460 align:middle line:84%
to certain levels
without going too fast.

00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:43.560 align:middle line:84%
Because the moment you
do that, it's going

00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:44.826 align:middle line:90%
to shut certain people down.

00:56:44.826 --> 00:56:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Or it's going to
discourage them.

00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:49.529 align:middle line:84%
So I do my best to move a
community of people all at once

00:56:49.529 --> 00:56:50.820 align:middle line:90%
without leaving anybody behind.

00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you do a
good job at doing that.

00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:54.150 align:middle line:84%
You know, I wanted to be
a national broadcaster

00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:57.110 align:middle line:84%
all my life since
I was 19 years old.

00:56:57.110 --> 00:57:00.600 align:middle line:84%
It never would have happened if
I didn't prepare myself for it.

00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:01.560 align:middle line:90%
I had a goal.

00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:02.730 align:middle line:90%
I had a direction.

00:57:02.730 --> 00:57:04.000 align:middle line:90%
That was all fine.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.459 align:middle line:84%
But you really have to be ready
for it when the time comes,

00:57:06.459 --> 00:57:07.258 align:middle line:90%
don't you?

00:57:07.258 --> 00:57:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Absolutely.

00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:10.710 align:middle line:90%
And life is the stage.

00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:13.380 align:middle line:10%
And taking a little time every
day and closing your eyes

00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:15.450 align:middle line:10%
and disconnecting
from your environment,

00:57:15.450 --> 00:57:18.210 align:middle line:10%
sitting your body down and
making it be in one place

00:57:18.210 --> 00:57:21.750 align:middle line:10%
without eating or smelling or
tasting or feeling or seeing,

00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:23.910 align:middle line:10%
and not being on
a schedule to rush

00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:26.910 align:middle line:10%
to any events in your future
or think about your past--

00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:28.540 align:middle line:10%
that is the meditative process.

00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:32.130 align:middle line:10%
And just like an actor
rehearsing her role

00:57:32.130 --> 00:57:35.520 align:middle line:10%
or his role, who do you want
to be when you open your eyes?

00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:38.970 align:middle line:10%
And just get into that
state and then maintain

00:57:38.970 --> 00:57:42.010 align:middle line:10%
that modified state of mind
and body your entire day.

00:57:42.010 --> 00:57:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And if you can,
you're going to see

00:57:43.770 --> 00:57:46.174 align:middle line:84%
those synchronicities
and those serendipity

00:57:46.174 --> 00:57:48.090 align:middle line:84%
and those opportunities
and those coincidences

00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:49.000 align:middle line:90%
happening around you.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And now you don't have
to go anywhere to get it.

00:57:51.150 --> 00:57:52.460 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of coming to you.

00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:52.740 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's the thing.

00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:53.823 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's right there.

00:57:53.823 --> 00:57:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And before you heal the body,
you heal the mind, don't you?

00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: You cannot have
a healing without a spiritual

00:57:59.470 --> 00:58:00.270 align:middle line:90%
healing.

00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:01.617 align:middle line:90%
It just isn't possible.

00:58:01.617 --> 00:58:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Joe, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: You're welcome.

00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
one-of-a-kind, my friend.

00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:05.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Thank you.

00:58:05.850 --> 00:58:08.183 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people have
you helped in your career?

00:58:08.183 --> 00:58:10.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Oh my goodness.

00:58:10.610 --> 00:58:12.110 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:58:12.110 --> 00:58:13.310 align:middle line:90%
I actually have no idea.

00:58:13.310 --> 00:58:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Whether it's
one or a million,

00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:16.650 align:middle line:90%
that's all that matters.

00:58:16.650 --> 00:58:17.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:58:17.470 --> 00:58:20.180 align:middle line:84%
