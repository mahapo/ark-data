>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.397 align:middle line:10%
You're going to hear
an incredible story

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:23.580 align:middle line:10%
with Chris Bledsoe.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.350 align:middle line:10%
He is one of a kind.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.200 align:middle line:10%
He has a new book out
called UFO of God.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.530 align:middle line:10%
It's a story of
his UFO experience

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.070 align:middle line:10%
with what he calls the
phenomenon and a divine entity

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.820 align:middle line:10%
that he refers to as The Lady,
that changed his entire life.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.150 align:middle line:84%
He has been healed
several times and has

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.500 align:middle line:90%
been a conduit to heal others.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.920 align:middle line:90%
Chris, welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRIS BLEDSOE: Thank
you for having me, George.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.207 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How are you
feeling these days?

00:00:48.207 --> 00:00:49.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: I'm feeling great.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.670 align:middle line:84%
After some of the
things I've been through

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.960 align:middle line:84%
with Crohn's disease
or rheumatoid,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.300 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't be in a better place.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That miracles
have just cured you of.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yes.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.120 align:middle line:90%
Miracles.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.580 align:middle line:90%
I was-- I was on a cane in 2019.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And if I traveled anywhere,
I was in a wheelchair.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.470 align:middle line:90%
My wife pushed me about.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.500 align:middle line:90%
And 2019 something changed.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.170 align:middle line:90%
I had an experience.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They keep
changing for you.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: And then suddenly
this whole thing went away.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.265 align:middle line:84%
And my daughters are,
like, trying to figure out

00:01:26.265 --> 00:01:27.065 align:middle line:90%
where it all went.

00:01:27.065 --> 00:01:30.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, back in 2007,
this all started for you.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.930 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: It was January
of 2007, the 8th, which is--

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.035 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You
remember the exact--

00:01:40.035 --> 00:01:42.743 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: I remember it because
it was Elvis Presley's birthday.

00:01:42.743 --> 00:01:43.710 align:middle line:90%
I'll never forget that.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.918 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thank you very much.

00:01:44.918 --> 00:01:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:56.640 align:middle line:84%
I was just suffering the worst
part of my life at that time.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.560 align:middle line:84%
I had lost a business building
100 homes a year and the 9/11

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.730 align:middle line:84%
World Trade Center disaster shut
the market down in Fayetteville,

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.509 align:middle line:84%
and I ended up watching a
slow motion train wreck.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And five years' time
I had no money left

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.660 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't pay the interest.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.060 align:middle line:84%
So it spelled one
thing, and that

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.480 align:middle line:84%
was I'm having to start
over at 46 years old.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And the Crohn's disease I had
was tremendous at that time.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.855 align:middle line:90%
It got worse.

00:02:30.855 --> 00:02:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you had all
this coming down on you?

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: All at once.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.320 align:middle line:84%
So I was sick with Crohn's,
stressed at death over this job,

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.420 align:middle line:84%
trying to build these houses
and to manage the warranties.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.020 align:middle line:90%
And 400 people working and--

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.620 align:middle line:90%
it took a toll on me.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And so here I am,
fast forward to '07.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm having to apply for
free lunches for my children

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.700 align:middle line:90%
at school.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.137 align:middle line:84%
And I had no income and
unable to work sick.

00:03:04.137 --> 00:03:05.845 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ought you do
what you got to do.

00:03:05.845 --> 00:03:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: I know.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.710 align:middle line:84%
So I was crying out
to whoever's up there.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.620 align:middle line:84%
Took my son and three
friends fishing on the river.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.860 align:middle line:84%
It was more of a
celebration for them

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.770 align:middle line:84%
because they had just
finished a job out of town.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.510 align:middle line:84%
They wanted-- four months
of being on the road,

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.440 align:middle line:90%
they were glad to be home.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I took them down
to the river to fish.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I walked
away before dark.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.320 align:middle line:84%
I told them I'd be
back just about dark.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where'd you go?

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: I walked up to
the field, a corn field,

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.810 align:middle line:84%
which is we come across going
down into the river bottom.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.660 align:middle line:84%
My excuse to them was I was
going to walk up to the field

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.700 align:middle line:90%
and sit and look for wildlife.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Didn't tell them what I
was really struggling.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.356 align:middle line:90%
Lord, help me, whatever.

00:03:50.356 --> 00:03:51.218 align:middle line:90%
What do I do?

00:03:51.218 --> 00:03:52.385 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you depressed?

00:03:52.385 --> 00:03:54.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: I was
very depressed, yeah.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.890 align:middle line:90%
I was--

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you just
needed to get away?

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.275 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yes.

00:03:57.275 --> 00:03:58.075 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:03:58.075 --> 00:04:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: And I was
talking to the sky.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And next thing I know, I walked
about a quarter of a mile away

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.640 align:middle line:84%
up to this field, and there
were these two big giant balls

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.690 align:middle line:90%
of fire, huge, like 40-50 round.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:14.800 align:middle line:90%
A two-story house.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.610 align:middle line:90%
That's how big, but round.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:17.410 align:middle line:90%
Huge.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.640 align:middle line:90%
And it scared me when I saw him.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.600 align:middle line:90%
It was daylight.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.650 align:middle line:84%
It was 5:15, 5:30 in
the evening in January.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:25.460 align:middle line:90%
Don't get dark.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.500 align:middle line:90%
About 6:00.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.670 align:middle line:90%
Sunsets about 5:30.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.080 align:middle line:84%
So the sun was behind the
trees and these things

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.400 align:middle line:84%
were sitting right on the
trees, right on the top,

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.630 align:middle line:90%
about 300 yards away.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.770 align:middle line:84%
So I turned to run
after watching them

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.040 align:middle line:90%
for a good 10 minutes.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how far away
are you from the others?

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: I'm a quarter mile.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.700 align:middle line:90%
So I got to go downhill.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.615 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pretty good poke.

00:04:47.615 --> 00:04:48.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.250 align:middle line:84%
I got to run downhill through
mud and weeds and overgrown

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:90%
grass.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.855 align:middle line:84%
Just a little narrow,
two rut dirt road.

00:04:55.855 --> 00:04:56.655 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:04:56.655 --> 00:04:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: And no flashlight.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.560 align:middle line:84%
So that was going to be a
chore to keep my feet dry.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Next thing I know I'm coming up
to the fire, and they're like,

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.000 align:middle line:90%
where have you been?

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.190 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what do you mean?

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.750 align:middle line:90%
I was just up at the field.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.450 align:middle line:84%
You won't believe
what I just saw.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.570 align:middle line:90%
I told them that.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.225 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, man, we've
been looking you all night.

00:05:15.225 --> 00:05:16.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow!

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: My son was missing.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.170 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't there with them.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, well, I
just realized that.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.640 align:middle line:84%
So I'm like, where's
Chris Junior?

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.200 align:middle line:90%
They said, well, he went--

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.000 align:middle line:90%
he's been gone two hours.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.620 align:middle line:90%
We went looking for you.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Two of us did while one
guy stayed at the fire.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And Chris Junior went on
foot and in the woods looking

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.160 align:middle line:90%
for you.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.140 align:middle line:84%
Where I had gone earlier
that day for a little while,

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.640 align:middle line:84%
I walked into the back of the
cul-de-sac, just killing time.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I left them
immediately looking for him.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And when I found
him, he was in shock.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:56.020 align:middle line:84%
He was hiding under some
real thick shrubbery.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.023 align:middle line:84%
And he was crying and he was
asking me, where have you been?

00:06:00.023 --> 00:06:01.190 align:middle line:90%
Why did you leave me, daddy?

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.065 align:middle line:90%
Why did you leave me?

00:06:02.065 --> 00:06:02.990 align:middle line:90%
I said, I didn't, son.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.550 align:middle line:90%
I just walked up to the field.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.020 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't gone 20 minutes.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.760 align:middle line:84%
He said, no, you've
been going all night.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.060 align:middle line:84%
We've been looking
you all night.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.393 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How long were you gone?

00:06:10.393 --> 00:06:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Four hours.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And I thought 20
minutes had passed.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And now my son is in shock and
he's telling me about creatures

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.690 align:middle line:90%
that he had seen.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:22.890 align:middle line:90%
They thought they were--

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.780 align:middle line:84%
what he first
thought when he saw

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.750 align:middle line:84%
them were these two balls
of light, little red balls.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.630 align:middle line:90%
And he described it as--

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.145 align:middle line:90%
He thought a flashlight.

00:06:32.145 --> 00:06:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Somebody was carrying
a red flashlight.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.607 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These were the
same balls of light you saw?

00:06:36.607 --> 00:06:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah, but
these were small.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:38.990 align:middle line:90%
He'd seen them--

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like orbs?

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:40.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.630 align:middle line:84%
He could see them way down
the path, the way I went.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:48.580 align:middle line:84%
He could see a good 500 yards
down that path, 400 yards.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And he saw two red
lights across the road.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.800 align:middle line:90%
Small ones.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.110 align:middle line:84%
So he runs over to
the fire to tell

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.510 align:middle line:84%
the guys that he
had seen somebody

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.370 align:middle line:84%
with a flashlight
crossed the road.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:00.870 align:middle line:90%
Red, he said.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.610 align:middle line:84%
Then he went back
to where he was.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And when he went back,
these same lights

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.080 align:middle line:84%
came out of the woods,
came back out on the road

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.820 align:middle line:90%
and started towards him.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And when they got
within 25 yards of him,

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.580 align:middle line:84%
he began to see there were these
little beings about this high.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:18.955 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
they look like?

00:07:18.955 --> 00:07:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: They were
glowing like plasma

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.750 align:middle line:84%
with red, glowing eyes,
like, about this big round.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will they look
more animal or more human?

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:31.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: More human.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Like a little child,
three or four years old.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.060 align:middle line:84%
But they were plasma,
like, glowing.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:38.645 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did it scare him?

00:07:38.645 --> 00:07:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: It scared
him really bad.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.380 align:middle line:90%
In fact, that started--

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.270 align:middle line:84%
if you read the
book, you'll read

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.610 align:middle line:84%
about his journey
from that point

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:51.460 align:middle line:84%
because it got hard when
I came home to tell it.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any more Crohn's
because the next day when

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.100 align:middle line:90%
I got up, it was gone.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.175 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your Crohn's disease
was gone the next day?

00:07:59.175 --> 00:08:00.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Gone.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.690 align:middle line:90%
Overnight it went away.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'd suffered almost
18 years with it.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:08.006 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what had happened
to you during these four hours?

00:08:08.006 --> 00:08:09.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: I didn't know, Geoge.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:13.390 align:middle line:84%
I had no clue until a
year and a half later.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:17.370 align:middle line:84%
I met a Harvard
trained hypnotherapist,

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.070 align:middle line:90%
trained under Dr. John Mack.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:23.140 align:middle line:84%
The Discovery Channel
brought him and move on,

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.330 align:middle line:90%
and he did a regression on me.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:26.430 align:middle line:90%
And he said--

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At your request or his?

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Oh, at my request.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:33.330 align:middle line:84%
His too, but it was-- to begin
with, the first thing he did

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:37.080 align:middle line:84%
was to unlock whatever
they did to me.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you're
going to remember it all,

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:45.480 align:middle line:84%
but I programmed it to
be over a period of time

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.380 align:middle line:84%
instead of all
coming right away.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:52.950 align:middle line:84%
So it just started coming back
over the years and exactly

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.190 align:middle line:90%
a part of what happened.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:55.800 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember it all, but--

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somewhere along
the line they cured you.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:08:59.806 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:08:59.806 --> 00:09:01.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they took it away.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:06.280 align:middle line:84%
I was taking medicine for 17
and half years for Crohn's.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I
never took another pill.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.820 align:middle line:84%
Then I developed
rheumatoid arthritis

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.470 align:middle line:84%
and they thought maybe the
Crohn's came back as rheumatoid.

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.640 align:middle line:84%
So I went through
all the testing.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:24.190 align:middle line:84%
I went to Chapel Hill
hospital to do testing on that

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:27.360 align:middle line:84%
and they found out
it has no relevance.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.160 align:middle line:90%
It didn't.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.420 align:middle line:84%
It's gone and never
came back as rheumatoid.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now the people
you went fishing with,

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:36.130 align:middle line:90%
including your son.

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:37.195 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Right.

00:09:37.195 --> 00:09:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They went nuts because
you were gone for four hours.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.840 align:middle line:90%
You think it's 20 minutes.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.390 align:middle line:90%
What has happened to them?

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: Well,
they got there, they

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.595 align:middle line:90%
got their eyes full that night.

00:09:50.595 --> 00:09:51.395 align:middle line:90%
They--

00:09:51.395 --> 00:09:54.085 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Reminds me, by the
way, of the Travis Walton case.

00:09:54.085 --> 00:09:54.885 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:09:54.885 --> 00:09:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: Where he was with his
logging buddies and everything

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.980 align:middle line:90%
happened to him.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:09:59.780 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is
where it got crazy.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.350 align:middle line:84%
I led Christopher back
to the fire when I--

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Your son.

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: When I found him.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And they were about 40
yards from where he was.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:11.960 align:middle line:84%
He was in the back
of the cul-de-sac.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.680 align:middle line:84%
They were sitting
on the riverbank.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.778 align:middle line:84%
So I dragged him over to where
they were, and he's in shock.

00:10:17.778 --> 00:10:19.070 align:middle line:90%
He's saying, I want to go home.

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:19.910 align:middle line:90%
I want to go home.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.220 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be here.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And they were
really freaked out.

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:24.560 align:middle line:90%
These are grown men now.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.600 align:middle line:84%
They were more my age, a
little younger than me.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.080 align:middle line:84%
But much older than
Chris Junior, was 17.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.650 align:middle line:84%
But they weren't
saying a whole lot.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:36.100 align:middle line:84%
They were very quiet, but they
were vocal of why I walked away.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.910 align:middle line:90%
You've been gone all night.

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:41.790 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't compute
that I had missing time.

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.330 align:middle line:84%
They thought I'd
just walked off.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And I began to tell
them about what I'd

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:48.780 align:middle line:90%
seen at the top of the hill.

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And Chris Jr. is constantly
talking about what

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:53.730 align:middle line:90%
just happened to him.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.410 align:middle line:90%
And so they got very spooked.

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And about that time, one of
the guys shout pointing up

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:03.060 align:middle line:84%
and we look up and there's
eight or nine of the brightest

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.230 align:middle line:84%
stars you ever see just
appeared and they flew out away

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:09.370 align:middle line:84%
from each other and
they come back together.

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And then three of them
landed on the ground

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.878 align:middle line:90%
across the river in front of us.

00:11:13.878 --> 00:11:15.295 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
you call them?

00:11:15.295 --> 00:11:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Well, they were orbs.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.180 align:middle line:90%
They looked like orbs of light.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we got some
video of one of these orbs.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:21.850 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:23.750 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.200 align:middle line:90%
So I'm filming it now.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SPEAKER: --close.

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:30.116 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: It appeared over the
pond and it's going east now.

00:11:30.116 --> 00:11:30.918 align:middle line:90%
>>SPEAKER: Hold on.

00:11:30.918 --> 00:11:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Actually reading
your book right now,

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:33.627 align:middle line:90%
but I want to tell her that.

00:11:33.627 --> 00:11:35.956 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: He's
right over the pond.

00:11:35.956 --> 00:11:38.628 align:middle line:90%
[CHATTER]

00:11:38.628 --> 00:11:40.800 align:middle line:90%


00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.600 align:middle line:90%
Now are two.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.020 align:middle line:90%
Wow!

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:42.820 align:middle line:90%
Two.

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.425 align:middle line:84%
Another one just come
up beside it and lit up.

00:11:45.425 --> 00:11:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Ryan, you're not
going to believe this.

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:48.545 align:middle line:90%
There's two together.

00:11:48.545 --> 00:11:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SPEAKER: And you're going
to really want to hear what--

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.236 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: Number 3,
it's got to be in there.

00:11:53.236 --> 00:11:55.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, Chris, this
was from a different night

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.220 align:middle line:90%
as well, right?

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:57.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Right, right.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:01.540 align:middle line:84%
This is pretty much every
night that I go out now as--

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This assembled
a group of witnesses?

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.740 align:middle line:84%
Other people come out
and see these now?

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:07.573 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yes, sir.

00:12:07.573 --> 00:12:09.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do they say?

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: Well,
it's changing lives.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.600 align:middle line:84%
It's really growing,
that's for sure.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:20.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing people's lives
change completely to the better.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.800 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.210 align:middle line:84%
I had 75 people
at Easter standing

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:30.179 align:middle line:84%
on the beach at Wrightsville
Beach on a Sunday.

00:12:30.179 --> 00:12:31.596 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Any
government officials?

00:12:31.596 --> 00:12:32.929 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: That could have been.

00:12:32.929 --> 00:12:34.920 align:middle line:84%
But I have government
officials all the time.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.500 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I was with--

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.170 align:middle line:84%
I was in Washington,
DC last week

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:44.840 align:middle line:84%
with a diplomat from the NSA,
very high ranking diplomat.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.280 align:middle line:90%
She was standing beside me.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And I looked up and
this orb appeared.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And she happened to see
it right when I did.

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:54.053 align:middle line:90%
And it put on a really big show.

00:12:54.053 --> 00:12:55.345 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're following you.

00:12:55.345 --> 00:12:57.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah, everywhere.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.875 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happened to the
other three fishing buddies?

00:12:59.875 --> 00:13:01.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: They're still there.

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.675 align:middle line:90%
They--

00:13:01.675 --> 00:13:02.575 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Still friends?

00:13:02.575 --> 00:13:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: They're
still friends.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Their children are
my children's age.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And so they caught the
same issues that we did,

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.860 align:middle line:84%
and they vowed to
never talk about it

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.800 align:middle line:84%
publicly again because
of what happened.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:22.560 align:middle line:84%
After I told it, it got really
difficult with the community

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.100 align:middle line:84%
and with the religious
community, the church.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.680 align:middle line:84%
I was raised in the
church and they all

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.570 align:middle line:84%
believed this stuff is
demonic, which is not.

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could be religious?

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: It's more
about what it is, I think.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.396 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are elementals?

00:13:37.396 --> 00:13:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: Elementals
are spirits

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:45.910 align:middle line:84%
that take the form of smoke
or wind or rain, water, fire,

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:47.040 align:middle line:90%
earth.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.500 align:middle line:84%
The elements that these
spirits can take that form.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We got a
couple of pictures.

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:56.250 align:middle line:84%
I want you to describe them
for us, if you would, Chris.

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:57.205 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:13:57.205 --> 00:13:59.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: That is a--

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:03.180 align:middle line:84%
what you see in the back is
a tree, a pretty famous tree

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:04.420 align:middle line:90%
in the book.

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:08.070 align:middle line:84%
It's called the burning tree,
which it just spontaneously

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:08.890 align:middle line:90%
combusted.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:13.000 align:middle line:84%
But after that tree
caught on fire,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.500 align:middle line:90%
weird stuff started happening.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.460 align:middle line:84%
Orbs around it all
the time, people

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:21.180 align:middle line:84%
would come and bring
clothing for their loved ones

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.890 align:middle line:84%
and place it in a tree
for the sick ones.

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:25.655 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
smoke from the fire?

00:14:25.655 --> 00:14:26.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: No.

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:29.380 align:middle line:84%
That what you see
is an elemental.

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And how I was able
to see it is--

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Looks like a person.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, you see it
going toward the tree

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.170 align:middle line:90%
and it wraps around the tree.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:42.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's-- and there should be
another one in there similar

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:43.290 align:middle line:90%
to that.

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:47.400 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, you can see it
winding around the tree.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.050 align:middle line:90%
You see the gifts in the tree.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:53.710 align:middle line:84%
That's where people--
very sick loved ones and--

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:55.928 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is the
tree split like that?

00:14:55.928 --> 00:14:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: That's the
one that caught fire.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:01.060 align:middle line:84%
It caught on fire
from the inside out.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:03.770 align:middle line:84%
Just spontaneously
caught fire one night.

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.870 align:middle line:90%
It was October 13 of 2013.

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:10.580 align:middle line:84%
I walked outside
about 9:30 at night.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.600 align:middle line:84%
We had rain for two
days and my wife

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.030 align:middle line:84%
was sitting with me
watching TV and I stopped.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:18.783 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I was
a smoker, and I said,

00:15:18.783 --> 00:15:19.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go smoke.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:22.600 align:middle line:84%
So I paused the TV and I
walked out the back door.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.410 align:middle line:84%
We live out in
the country there.

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And so the property's
really deep.

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And that tree set very way back
in the back of the property.

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:31.690 align:middle line:90%
And I saw--

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:33.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
happened to your dog?

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: With the Dog was--

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:37.720 align:middle line:90%
that was a weird one.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.455 align:middle line:90%
Grant Cameron, which--

00:15:39.455 --> 00:15:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I know Grant.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Grant.

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:42.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, investigator.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.580 align:middle line:84%
He was there and
witnessed what happened.

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:48.180 align:middle line:84%
We were out looking at
that tree and my Labrador

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.870 align:middle line:90%
was walking with us.

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And when we'd stop,
she would stop.

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:55.750 align:middle line:84%
So after he got all his photos,
we went back to the house

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.960 align:middle line:84%
and I said, Grant, do
you want to stay tonight?

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.560 align:middle line:84%
We'll get your clothes
because he just drove up.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.700 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yeah.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And when he turned to go toward
the house, this dog stood up,

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:10.080 align:middle line:84%
was laying on the ground,
and suddenly there

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:14.010 align:middle line:84%
was a hole in her neck, this
big inch and a half gaping hole

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:16.048 align:middle line:84%
that deep and blood was
flying out of her neck.

00:16:16.048 --> 00:16:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where'd
the blood come from?

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: Come from-- how she
got cut, we don't know at all.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.680 align:middle line:90%
Have no clue.

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.015 align:middle line:90%
But she had a major gash there.

00:16:25.015 --> 00:16:26.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She OK?

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Well, yeah.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:28.690 align:middle line:90%
I ran and I grabbed her.

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:30.010 align:middle line:90%
She ran by Grant.

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Grant was in front of me,
and she ran in the house

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:35.110 align:middle line:84%
and bled all over the house,
the floor at the back door.

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And I ran in and
pulled her outside

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.550 align:middle line:90%
and set her on the ground.

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:41.180 align:middle line:90%
Put my hand on her neck.

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.635 align:middle line:84%
And I thought she
was going to die.

00:16:43.635 --> 00:16:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
have to take her

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:47.128 align:middle line:84%
to a veterinary
hospital or anything?

00:16:47.128 --> 00:16:48.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: No, I knew it.

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:49.165 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have time.

00:16:49.165 --> 00:16:51.790 align:middle line:84%
She was bleeding so bad, I knew
she'd be dead in a few minutes.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you patch her up?

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: Well, I just
put my hand on her neck,

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.300 align:middle line:84%
and I looked up at the sky and I
said, Lord, she's going to die.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:00.880 align:middle line:90%
Somebody's got to help her.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.430 align:middle line:90%
And immediately she went limp.

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I took that
picture or Grant did, with her.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.859 align:middle line:84%
She got still and
just laid there.

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And when I picked the cloth
up, that hole was gone.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.665 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The hole was gone?

00:17:13.665 --> 00:17:14.465 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Gone.

00:17:14.465 --> 00:17:16.660 align:middle line:90%
Disappeared.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:17.660 align:middle line:90%
Grant saw it.

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:18.560 align:middle line:90%
He witnessed it.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.760 align:middle line:90%
He filmed it.

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.151 align:middle line:84%
A half a dozen other people
were there watching it.

00:17:23.151 --> 00:17:24.484 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now, who is Tim Taylor?

00:17:24.484 --> 00:17:27.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Tim Taylor is a NASA.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.890 align:middle line:90%
Scientist.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:32.260 align:middle line:90%
He's codenamed The Dragon.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And he runs all the
launches for the government.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened to him?

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:39.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: Well, there's
nothing really happened to him

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:44.930 align:middle line:84%
other than I became
friends with him in 2013.

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:50.290 align:middle line:84%
He reached out to me and came
by and he briefed my family,

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:51.770 align:middle line:90%
all my children and my wife.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:52.795 align:middle line:90%
He tested me with metal.

00:17:52.795 --> 00:17:53.595 align:middle line:90%
They had--

00:17:53.595 --> 00:17:56.632 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did he
think was going on?

00:17:56.632 --> 00:17:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: He told me--

00:17:58.510 --> 00:17:59.910 align:middle line:90%
because we were afraid.

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:02.490 align:middle line:84%
At that time my kids were
terrified of the government

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:05.980 align:middle line:84%
because men in black was all
over television in 2008, right?

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:09.190 align:middle line:90%
And so move on.

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:11.710 align:middle line:84%
We had gone to a few
meetings and they were like,

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:13.920 align:middle line:84%
these government people,
they'll kill you.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:17.800 align:middle line:84%
Some of these friends that
I met were saying that.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.960 align:middle line:90%
Stay away from the men in black.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.010 align:middle line:84%
So when he drives
up to my house,

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:23.865 align:middle line:84%
my children are
absolutely terrified.

00:18:23.865 --> 00:18:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're panicking.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:25.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:27.320 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, why are you here?

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.910 align:middle line:84%
You've got all the rockets
and all the equipment

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:34.340 align:middle line:84%
and the money,
spaceships, satellites.

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.210 align:middle line:90%
Why do you need me?

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:41.350 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, we see it,
but it has absolutely nothing

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:42.440 align:middle line:90%
to do with us.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.730 align:middle line:90%
But we know it likes you.

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:46.840 align:middle line:84%
So we'd like to work
with you a little bit

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.570 align:middle line:84%
and figure out
what's going on here.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:52.040 align:middle line:90%
And so that's how it started.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.465 align:middle line:84%
And to this day,
I'm friends still

00:18:54.465 --> 00:18:55.590 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of those people.

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, there
was a boy that you

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:01.730 align:middle line:90%
healed in Washington, DC.

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:04.030 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about the kid
and what happened.

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:07.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: This was right
after the dog happened.

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:09.110 align:middle line:84%
The dog was a
complete shock to me.

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:11.160 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea that
this could be.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.520 align:middle line:90%
And Tim Taylor heard about it.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.140 align:middle line:90%
When it happened, I told him.

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, man,
you may have a talent.

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:21.390 align:middle line:84%
You need to be looking
to try to help people.

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the phenomenon
gave you that, the lady.

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And so he got me thinking
that and word got around

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:30.800 align:middle line:84%
in the government
because I've been

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.170 align:middle line:84%
around a lot of different
people in the government.

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And I get a phone call and on
the 3rd of July, 2nd of July,

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:44.250 align:middle line:84%
and it's this guy in
Pennsylvania and he's like,

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:45.730 align:middle line:90%
what are you doing tomorrow?

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:47.470 align:middle line:90%
I said, tomorrow is 4th of July.

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:48.490 align:middle line:90%
It's Friday.

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:50.045 align:middle line:90%
My kids are coming from college.

00:19:50.045 --> 00:19:51.045 align:middle line:90%
We're going to hang out.

00:19:51.045 --> 00:19:51.845 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:19:51.845 --> 00:19:57.126 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: He said, there's
a young boy in DC that's very

00:19:57.126 --> 00:19:59.550 align:middle line:90%
sick, that--

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.663 align:middle line:84%
they've used every option they
got to try to help this child.

00:20:02.663 --> 00:20:04.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was
wrong with him, Chris?

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:05.872 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: He was
born with something

00:20:05.872 --> 00:20:09.240 align:middle line:84%
called mitochondrial DNA
disease, meaning he couldn't

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.050 align:middle line:90%
eat, couldn't digest food.

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:14.130 align:middle line:84%
So when he tried to eat,
he'd throw it up profusely.

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:16.780 align:middle line:84%
President Obama gave
him his make-a-wish.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:20.610 align:middle line:84%
He was in the White House with
him and very well thought-of

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:22.340 align:middle line:90%
family.

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And so they reached out to
me through backchannels,

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:28.430 align:middle line:90%
flew me to DC.

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:30.480 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea what I was doing.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.955 align:middle line:90%
Terrified.

00:20:31.955 --> 00:20:33.360 align:middle line:90%
A dog got healed.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know how
the dog got healed.

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:37.227 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you didn't
know you were healing?

00:20:37.227 --> 00:20:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: No, not at all.

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:41.577 align:middle line:84%
And here I'm asked
to go to DC in July.

00:20:41.577 --> 00:20:43.160 align:middle line:84%
This was in May when
the dog happened.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.368 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To look at this kid.

00:20:44.368 --> 00:20:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah, in July.

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:49.290 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't even tried to
exercise whatever happened.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.530 align:middle line:90%
So this is my biggest thing now.

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:52.710 align:middle line:90%
I've got to deal with this.

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:56.410 align:middle line:84%
So I talked all night to
the heavens, what do I do?

00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:57.210 align:middle line:90%
What do I do?

00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:02.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, anyhow, when I got
there in the afternoon--

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:07.490 align:middle line:84%
We stayed until 1:00 in the
morning and his mom asked me

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:11.030 align:middle line:84%
to spend the night and I'm like,
no, I've got a hotel downtown.

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:12.700 align:middle line:84%
My driver took me
down to the hotel.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:16.700 align:middle line:84%
At 1:30 she called me and
she said, he's eating.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.765 align:middle line:84%
He's eating two plates
of food tonight already.

00:21:18.765 --> 00:21:20.015 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Lord, it's a miracle.

00:21:20.015 --> 00:21:22.825 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: And he had a feeding
tube and he was just 11.

00:21:22.825 --> 00:21:23.875 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did you do?

00:21:23.875 --> 00:21:26.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: I just reached
out and hugged him.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:27.690 align:middle line:90%
I sat beside him--

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:28.875 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you pray?

00:21:28.875 --> 00:21:33.645 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: Well, I did it in a--
yeah, in a meditative prayer,

00:21:33.645 --> 00:21:34.445 align:middle line:90%
asking.

00:21:34.445 --> 00:21:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How was he
now and how old is he?

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: He's 20-- soon be 22.

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:43.272 align:middle line:84%
And he's in college now at
the American University.

00:21:43.272 --> 00:21:44.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How was he today?

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: I was
called, my wife and I,

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:51.560 align:middle line:84%
to come up on Memorial
Day of 2023, last year,

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:56.070 align:middle line:84%
because he was first time
going to leave from home.

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:58.830 align:middle line:84%
He'd never been away from home
under-- his mom's a doctor,

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:00.350 align:middle line:90%
his grandpa's a doctor.

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:02.470 align:middle line:10%
So he was always
babied to death.

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:05.830 align:middle line:10%
He's very sick, unable
to function as a kid.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, now he's going
to college and he has

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:12.160 align:middle line:90%
applied for overseas exchange.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:18.240 align:middle line:84%
So he's going off to Israel
and to Sweden, Switzerland

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.732 align:middle line:90%
to work for three months.

00:22:19.732 --> 00:22:20.940 align:middle line:90%
And his family was terrified.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.815 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he's eating
and everything else?

00:22:22.815 --> 00:22:31.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah, but the person
that I'm connected to him with

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:33.360 align:middle line:84%
is the guy that wrote
the foreword in my book.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.390 align:middle line:90%
His name is Jim Semivan.

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:39.350 align:middle line:84%
Jim is director of operations,
or was, of the CIA.

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:44.450 align:middle line:84%
So Jim calls and wants
Yvonne and I to come to DC,

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:48.060 align:middle line:84%
or to actually his
beach house in Delaware.

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And hang out and have a
cookout and be with Brandon

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:54.010 align:middle line:84%
before he leaves for
three months overseas.

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And Jim's like, we just
know he's it's good for him

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.930 align:middle line:90%
to be around you.

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And we want you to be
here before he goes away

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:02.520 align:middle line:90%
for three months.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.535 align:middle line:84%
So they were all biting
their nails, as he's--

00:23:05.535 --> 00:23:07.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chris, in your
book you are full of God.

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:09.485 align:middle line:90%
You talk about The Lady.

00:23:09.485 --> 00:23:10.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Right.

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
you meet The Lady

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:13.590 align:middle line:90%
and who do you think she is?

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: Well,
that's a big question.

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:17.650 align:middle line:90%
Who I think she is--

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:19.780 align:middle line:90%
I go through that.

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:21.910 align:middle line:90%
I think she's Gaia.

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:24.055 align:middle line:90%
I think she is the--

00:23:24.055 --> 00:23:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mother Earth?

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:26.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Mother Earth, yeah.

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:28.132 align:middle line:90%
Holy Spirit, something--

00:23:28.132 --> 00:23:30.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I think she might
be the Blessed Virgin Mary.

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:31.840 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Very well could be.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.880 align:middle line:90%
Very well could be.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.480 align:middle line:84%
None of us know, but
she fits that parameter.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:37.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You've seen her?

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: I've seen
her more than once.

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:40.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
she look like?

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:41.030 align:middle line:90%
Describe her.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: She's the
most beautiful human.

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:47.150 align:middle line:90%
She looks human, but she glows.

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:49.160 align:middle line:84%
She glows this
bluish white glow.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And when I see her, her
feet are not on the ground,

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:52.400 align:middle line:90%
she's hovering.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.192 align:middle line:84%
Her feet would be this
high off the ground.

00:23:54.192 --> 00:23:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When did
you first see her?

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:59.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: I saw her
on Easter of 2012.

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give you the
context of the story.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:07.010 align:middle line:84%
When I was taken in
'07 for the four hours,

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:09.830 align:middle line:84%
they put something
in my head that was--

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:14.250 align:middle line:84%
I liken it to the movie Close
Encounters of the Third Kind,

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:16.303 align:middle line:84%
where they were making
the mashed potatoes on--

00:24:16.303 --> 00:24:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, he was obsessed
with the mashed potato.

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: And I was obsessed--

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:21.055 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Making him the
size of the Mountain.

00:24:21.055 --> 00:24:21.855 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:24:21.855 --> 00:24:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And so after I was
taken, I was that way.

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.070 align:middle line:90%
I was obsessed.

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:28.200 align:middle line:84%
My wife thought,
I'm going crazy.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.020 align:middle line:84%
I was staring
outside every night

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:33.380 align:middle line:84%
waiting for him to
come back and wondering

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:36.492 align:middle line:84%
what happened because I
couldn't remember anything.

00:24:36.492 --> 00:24:38.490 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm healed.

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:40.400 align:middle line:90%
I don't have Crohn's anymore.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.620 align:middle line:84%
But now my whole
life is wrecked.

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:47.420 align:middle line:84%
My children, poor children,
I'm suffering for them

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:50.170 align:middle line:84%
because they're coming
home from school.

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And the teachers have
made fun of them.

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everybody
is bullying them.

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:56.275 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: All for five
years this is going on.

00:24:56.275 --> 00:24:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: My little
daughter, 10 years old,

00:24:58.670 --> 00:24:59.810 align:middle line:90%
coming home crying.

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:03.080 align:middle line:90%
And kids-- my boys, 14 and 15.

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because of
your financial woes?

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: Well, that
and because of the church

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:10.088 align:middle line:84%
and the community
turned on us and--

00:25:10.088 --> 00:25:11.505 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because
of what happened?

00:25:11.505 --> 00:25:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, they said it was--

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They
didn't believe you.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Right.

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.660 align:middle line:84%
So they came in and
tried to divide my home.

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:21.730 align:middle line:84%
They wanted me out of the house
because I'm bringing the devil

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:23.300 align:middle line:90%
in and around my family.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My God.

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:26.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah, this
is what happened.

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:middle line:90%
And I'm crying out.

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.670 align:middle line:84%
I was born and
raised in the church.

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:32.130 align:middle line:90%
It was much greater.

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:34.260 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't-- so it did no good.

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And so 2012, fast
forward five years.

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.170 align:middle line:84%
My daughter come home
crying the last time

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:45.150 align:middle line:84%
and I just got angry
with that obsession.

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:46.290 align:middle line:90%
I had to tell it.

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:49.760 align:middle line:84%
I walked out on Easter that
night and I looked up at the sky

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.340 align:middle line:84%
on Saturday night
before Easter, and I

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.320 align:middle line:90%
started shouting, just mad.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.120 align:middle line:90%
I said--

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.135 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mad at who?

00:25:56.135 --> 00:25:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Whoever they were.

00:25:57.690 --> 00:25:59.690 align:middle line:90%
They came and they healed me.

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:02.940 align:middle line:84%
But now my life's in
worse shape than ever.

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:04.380 align:middle line:90%
Not mine, but my kids.

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:07.140 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm a big boy, but
this is my children now.

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for coming,
but now I'll never

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:11.800 align:middle line:90%
speak about you again ever.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.330 align:middle line:84%
I made a vow I'll never
talk about this again.

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:18.660 align:middle line:84%
3:00 in the morning,
I hear a voice.

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Woke me out of a dead sleep and
a real deep, manly voice that

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:23.550 align:middle line:90%
said, arise.

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And next thing I know, I'm led
outside by these shadowy beings.

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
I met The Lady.

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:33.812 align:middle line:90%
She appeared

00:26:33.812 --> 00:26:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did she
ever talk to you?

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:36.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:39.530 align:middle line:84%
She came out of the-- she
came at me like the wind.

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:42.130 align:middle line:84%
That was the weirdest
thing, George, the wind.

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:43.090 align:middle line:90%
Physical.

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:45.655 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't-- it was
a physical thing.

00:26:45.655 --> 00:26:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you tell me about
this glow you say she had.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.735 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: She was
glowing this bluish white.

00:26:51.735 --> 00:26:53.035 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like an aura?

00:26:53.035 --> 00:26:56.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: Aura around her, but
it lit the floor on the ground

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:58.970 align:middle line:90%
in about a 20 foot circle.

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Around her was this
bluish lit area.

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:06.130 align:middle line:90%
And I'm on my knees.

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Probably a good 8 feet from
her at the furthest point.

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:14.570 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't reach and touch, but
her feet were about my chin.

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:17.620 align:middle line:84%
She's about four feet tall,
four and a half feet tall.

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And she looked at me and she
said, you know why I'm here.

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:23.780 align:middle line:84%
This is your burden
you must bear.

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:25.750 align:middle line:90%
You got to tell what you know.

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:27.650 align:middle line:90%
And if you do, I'll help you.

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:31.610 align:middle line:84%
I'll help you take
videos and film us,

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:36.940 align:middle line:84%
and I'll help you share our
presents with other people.

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:39.400 align:middle line:84%
Before that I could
never get a picture.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:43.430 align:middle line:84%
Before that I could never share
with my mom who lived next door.

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:46.250 align:middle line:84%
But after that, it
opened the floodgates.

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And now that's how
everybody knows me,

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:52.670 align:middle line:84%
because I pretty much
filmed this stuff every day.

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might she have
been an extraterrestrial?

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:57.552 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Possibly.

00:27:57.552 --> 00:28:03.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had to decide
between The Blessed Virgin

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:08.475 align:middle line:84%
Mary and extraterrestrial
or some other entity,

00:28:08.475 --> 00:28:09.275 align:middle line:90%
what would you say?

00:28:09.275 --> 00:28:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: The Virgin Mary.

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:11.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I would agree.

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:13.960 align:middle line:90%
Holy Spirit.

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.130 align:middle line:90%
Virgin Mary.

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:17.290 align:middle line:90%
Gaia.

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:23.010 align:middle line:84%
Something that cares about
humanity very much so.

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:23.810 align:middle line:90%
Blessed.

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:26.060 align:middle line:90%
Blessed my life.

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:31.790 align:middle line:84%
I had a rheumatoid arthritis so
bad I was almost crippled from--

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My God, the things that
have happened to you, Chris.

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:37.340 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned that
burning tree that burst

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:39.300 align:middle line:90%
into flames on your property.

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.390 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at some
of the video tied into that.

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:46.907 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll have you
explain it afterwards.

00:28:46.907 --> 00:28:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRIS JR: This tree just
spontaneously combusted

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:50.570 align:middle line:90%
in our backyard.

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:53.596 align:middle line:90%
>>YVONNE: Burn up with--

00:28:53.596 --> 00:28:55.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRIS JR: This is so weird.

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.160 align:middle line:90%
There's Emily coming home.

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>>YVONNE: Yeah.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.120 align:middle line:84%
I told Steven to come
out here and look at it.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.920 align:middle line:84%
It had been thundering
or lightning or--

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRIS JR: No.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't even think
it rained today.

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:05.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Today.

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:06.970 align:middle line:90%
How's it burning?

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:08.048 align:middle line:90%
It's been wet.

00:29:08.048 --> 00:29:09.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRIS JR: We're all standing.

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.065 align:middle line:84%
We've all been standing
out here looking.

00:29:11.065 --> 00:29:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Ran as fast as we could in
the backyard and the tree just

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.010 align:middle line:90%
spontaneously combusted.

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:17.722 align:middle line:90%


00:29:17.722 --> 00:29:21.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nobody lit that
with gasoline or anything?

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Back in MIT--

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.160 align:middle line:84%
there were samples
taken and sent

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.000 align:middle line:84%
to MIT by a young lady
named Chase Kloetzke.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:29.800 align:middle line:90%
If you know--

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:30.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I know Chase.

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:31.260 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Chase came out and did
the work on that tree.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:38.720 align:middle line:84%
They found out there was
no reason, no accelerants

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:39.520 align:middle line:90%
or any reason.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, had you seen The
Lady prior to this burning tree?

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:44.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yes.

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:48.250 align:middle line:84%
This happened in
October of 2013.

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:53.645 align:middle line:84%
I saw her on Easter of 2012
and then Easter of 2013

00:29:53.645 --> 00:29:54.445 align:middle line:90%
she came again.

00:29:54.445 --> 00:29:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
this represented, if anything?

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Well, I'll tell you.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:05.860 align:middle line:84%
The story behind it
is Dr. Diana Pasulka,

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.420 align:middle line:84%
which wrote a book
called American Cosmic.

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:11.150 align:middle line:84%
She's a religious
professor at UNC.

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:15.190 align:middle line:84%
She was consulting on a
movie called The Conjuring,

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.990 align:middle line:90%
in Wilmington.

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.805 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great movie.

00:30:16.805 --> 00:30:17.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:19.950 align:middle line:84%
The writers, Chad
and Carey Hayes.

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Chris, they
want to meet you bad.

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.700 align:middle line:90%
They really want to meet you.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.730 align:middle line:84%
I said, Diana, it
would take a miracle

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:30.120 align:middle line:84%
to get me to come talk
to anybody about being

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:34.810 align:middle line:84%
on television because of
what had happened in 2008.

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:37.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, we did a little
Discovery Channel show

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:40.060 align:middle line:84%
and they made me
look like a liar.

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's what got the
whole community on me.

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:45.493 align:middle line:84%
And it really--
everybody knew then.

00:30:45.493 --> 00:30:46.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They turned on you.

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:47.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I told her, I
said, it'd take a miracle.

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:56.730 align:middle line:84%
I said, in fact I'm going to
ask the phenomenon, The Lady.

00:30:56.730 --> 00:31:00.580 align:middle line:84%
She told me at Easter when
she came, I will be with you,

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:03.555 align:middle line:90%
I'll help you and protect you.

00:31:03.555 --> 00:31:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You still see her?

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked her
that night for a sign.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And this was on a
Monday or Tuesday night.

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.950 align:middle line:84%
Diana calls me two or
three times that week.

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:15.710 align:middle line:90%
Are you coming to Wilmington?

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:17.520 align:middle line:84%
I said, I haven't
got a sign yet.

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:21.780 align:middle line:84%
So Thursday night I walk out,
my wife and I and this tree

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:24.840 align:middle line:84%
just lit itself on fire
and I picked the phone up

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.010 align:middle line:84%
while my son was
making that recording.

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:28.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm calling Diana.

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:30.670 align:middle line:84%
Said, tell Chad and Carey
I'll see them in the morning.

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:31.500 align:middle line:90%
I got my sign--

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that tree
is still with you, right?

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: Well, I
moved since then.

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it alive, though?

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: Last time
I was there it was.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We got another video
of it, of the tree blossoming.

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah, yeah.

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: After the fire.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.330 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: It killed it.

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:48.135 align:middle line:90%
It looked dead to us.

00:31:48.135 --> 00:31:48.935 align:middle line:90%
It's growing.

00:31:48.935 --> 00:31:56.560 align:middle line:90%


00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:57.360 align:middle line:90%
There's limbs.

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.390 align:middle line:90%
A lot of those three.

00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:01.160 align:middle line:84%
They just sprouted
out this year.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Got big and-- there's
10 to 12 feet.

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:10.930 align:middle line:90%


00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:15.880 align:middle line:84%
All that was not
on there last year.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:33.772 align:middle line:90%


00:32:33.772 --> 00:32:35.555 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
sold that property?

00:32:35.555 --> 00:32:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah, we got
rid of that property.

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:42.430 align:middle line:84%
I moved up to a little 15
acre piece with a pond on it

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:43.345 align:middle line:90%
and a gate going in.

00:32:43.345 --> 00:32:44.595 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A little more serene.

00:32:44.595 --> 00:32:46.536 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: A little
more private, yeah.

00:32:46.536 --> 00:32:49.385 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you think this
is happening to you, Chris?

00:32:49.385 --> 00:32:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: I wish
I knew, George.

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:58.430 align:middle line:84%
All I know is I feel a duty
to share what's happening

00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:01.290 align:middle line:90%
with whoever wants to hear it.

00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:03.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm very cautious
about labeling this

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:06.480 align:middle line:84%
because I think the
more we label it,

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:08.570 align:middle line:90%
the less credibility we have.

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:11.016 align:middle line:90%
We really don't know, right?

00:33:11.016 --> 00:33:15.170 align:middle line:84%
But what I can do is
share the patterns

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:17.520 align:middle line:84%
and the data that
I've collected.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully one day we
can get a lot closer to what

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:22.160 align:middle line:90%
it is we're dealing with.

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:26.725 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does The Lady
tell you anything?

00:33:26.725 --> 00:33:28.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:30.700 align:middle line:84%
She told me when
she came in 2012--

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:32.650 align:middle line:90%
2013.

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:35.150 align:middle line:90%
She told me about an alignment.

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:38.990 align:middle line:84%
She said when she came in
2013, the very next year,

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:43.580 align:middle line:84%
the first year she came
2012, the next year,

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:47.890 align:middle line:84%
2013 at Easter, two weeks
later, the dog was healed.

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And then that fall,
the tree caught fire.

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And from then on, that same
year, the child in Washington,

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:54.580 align:middle line:90%
DC.

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:59.320 align:middle line:84%
So it all started really
ramping up after she came.

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:03.570 align:middle line:84%
She told me, she
said in 2019, when

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:08.400 align:middle line:84%
I was at my really sickest
point with rheumatoid,

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:11.190 align:middle line:84%
unable to hardly walk
at all, I mean, bad.

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My God.

00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:16.279 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: And taking medicine
that was $25,000 a month.

00:34:16.279 --> 00:34:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How much?

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:18.880 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: $25,000 a month.

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.110 align:middle line:90%
That's what they had me on.

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Anywhere from $17
to $25, according

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:24.270 align:middle line:90%
to how many shots I was taking.

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:26.590 align:middle line:84%
But it was very
expensive treatment.

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:27.610 align:middle line:90%
Chemotherapy.

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:31.920 align:middle line:84%
I was on chemo and
these biological agents.

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:36.610 align:middle line:84%
So she came in 2019 and I
wandered my way out that night,

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:39.110 align:middle line:90%
it was Easter, to the backyard.

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:41.620 align:middle line:84%
The pond is-- our little
cabin sits on the pond.

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:43.150 align:middle line:90%
I can fish off the back porch.

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:45.219 align:middle line:84%
So I just open the door
and there's the pond.

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And when I did hear, this
orb appears above me.

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:49.170 align:middle line:90%
Flash, flash.

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And it came all the
way down to the ground

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:54.920 align:middle line:90%
and hovered over the pond.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And it came up
within 20 feet of me

00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:00.600 align:middle line:84%
and it was really
putting on a show.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And there-- her in a translucent
figure of her was there.

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:09.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How tall was it?

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: She was about seven
or eight foot tall the whole--

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.270 align:middle line:90%
what I was seeing.

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With the
light and everything.

00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:16.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: The light.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.830 align:middle line:84%
The orb-- what happened
was is the orb--

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:20.340 align:middle line:90%
and I've got this on video.

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:24.310 align:middle line:90%
I was able to share this.

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:26.500 align:middle line:84%
When these orbs appear,
they're beings--

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.990 align:middle line:84%
they're beings, sometimes
more than one in these orbs.

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:32.950 align:middle line:84%
But when they flash,
they come out of the orb

00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:36.250 align:middle line:84%
and now the orb is inside
a translucent being

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:39.370 align:middle line:84%
and it's jumping up
and down in its body.

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:42.230 align:middle line:90%
So I'm looking at this.

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:44.480 align:middle line:84%
I pulled my camera
out and I thought

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:48.450 align:middle line:84%
I was filming this whole
thing for about eight minutes.

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:51.000 align:middle line:84%
And when I realized
that on record,

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.020 align:middle line:84%
that I never hit record,
the minute I reached up

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:58.130 align:middle line:84%
and I'm watching her for seven,
eight minutes, when I hit

00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:00.030 align:middle line:90%
the record button, it went out.

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:01.290 align:middle line:90%
It vanished immediately.

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:02.625 align:middle line:90%
It knew I punched that button.

00:36:02.625 --> 00:36:04.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It didn't
want to be recorded.

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:05.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:06.420 align:middle line:90%
And then it came back on.

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And so for 18 minutes longer,
I filmed her over the pond.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:16.920 align:middle line:84%
But she said-- she
said, troubles come.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:24.100 align:middle line:84%
Warn the people that trouble's
coming, to stay inside

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:26.790 align:middle line:90%
and store up until it's over.

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:28.775 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea what
she was talking about.

00:36:28.775 --> 00:36:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think it was now?

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:31.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: It was COVID.

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's what
I was going to say.

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah, it was COVID.

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.880 align:middle line:90%
Millions of people died from it.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:37.720 align:middle line:84%
She didn't tell me
that's what it was.

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.430 align:middle line:84%
She just said there
was trouble coming.

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:44.960 align:middle line:84%
But from that point forward is
when my friend in Washington

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.130 align:middle line:84%
called me and said,
if you get COVID,

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:49.250 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
be in bad trouble.

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And you need to get
off all the medication.

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:52.470 align:middle line:90%
So I quit it.

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:54.290 align:middle line:90%
I called my doctor.

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:57.170 align:middle line:84%
She put me on one
pill called plaquenil,

00:36:57.170 --> 00:37:00.540 align:middle line:84%
took me off all these thousands
of dollars of medication,

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:04.640 align:middle line:84%
thinking I was going to
go downhill and get worse.

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:06.770 align:middle line:90%
The doctors couldn't believe it.

00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And now when I go to the
doctor, which I go next week,

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:13.790 align:middle line:84%
I go every three months, they
bring a whole corral of people

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:16.262 align:middle line:84%
out there, interns and
all, and they question me.

00:37:16.262 --> 00:37:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're a
scientific study.

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:18.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:19.250 align:middle line:90%
Where did it go?

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:20.050 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has become of
your brain with all of this?

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:25.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: Well,
they've been studying

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:27.700 align:middle line:90%
that at the Monroe Institute.

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:29.465 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I know
that Institute well.

00:37:29.465 --> 00:37:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: Probably
giving them six or eight

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:32.585 align:middle line:90%
hours of brain scans.

00:37:32.585 --> 00:37:33.875 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: What do they see?

00:37:33.875 --> 00:37:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: Well,
the newer scientists

00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:40.230 align:middle line:84%
on last year's episode
of Beyond Skinwalker,

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:42.552 align:middle line:84%
I did the eight
episode last year.

00:37:42.552 --> 00:37:43.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, you did.

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:45.218 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: And they
had this helmet on me

00:37:45.218 --> 00:37:47.330 align:middle line:90%
and sitting in a chair.

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And I just asked the
phenomenon to come from the sky

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:51.540 align:middle line:90%
to the ground.

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:52.350 align:middle line:90%
And it did.

00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:54.260 align:middle line:84%
It came out of the
sky flash flash

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:57.060 align:middle line:84%
and came down about eight
feet off the ground,

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.583 align:middle line:90%
and it passed right by us.

00:37:58.583 --> 00:37:59.750 align:middle line:90%
They filmed the whole thing.

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:02.280 align:middle line:84%
They filmed it
with three cameras.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:06.550 align:middle line:84%
They've had my brain
scan at the same time.

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:08.290 align:middle line:84%
So this is the first
time in history--

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:11.030 align:middle line:84%
John Alexander says
this over and over.

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's paying
attention, but on camera

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:18.440 align:middle line:84%
with scientists, with the
PhDs, with 17 witnesses,

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:22.250 align:middle line:84%
we recorded his brain in
communication with that orb

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:25.970 align:middle line:84%
as they could tell by the
algorithms and the brainwaves

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:29.810 align:middle line:84%
that the communication
center of my brain

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:31.825 align:middle line:90%
was communicating with that orb.

00:38:31.825 --> 00:38:35.472 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chris, did you
ever ask yourself why you?

00:38:35.472 --> 00:38:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I've had
1,000 asked me that.

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:41.640 align:middle line:90%
And I have no idea.

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:45.330 align:middle line:84%
It's been-- It's not
a glorious thing.

00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:50.000 align:middle line:84%
It's been a burden more
than it has anything else.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.327 align:middle line:84%
But it's still a
wonderful thing to me.

00:38:52.327 --> 00:38:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has the Vatican
gotten involved with you?

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:56.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah,
they've investigated me.

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:57.143 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do they say?

00:38:57.143 --> 00:38:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: They sent
me some paintings

00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:02.100 align:middle line:90%
of angels coming out of orbs.

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:04.340 align:middle line:84%
Three paintings they
have in the Vatican.

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And all three of them are
Saint Francis of Assisi.

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And it shows these angels coming
from orbs and zapping his hands,

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:15.280 align:middle line:84%
giving him what's
called the stigmata.

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:16.080 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which were the
marks of Christ where

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:20.000 align:middle line:90%
he got nailed and speared?

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.330 align:middle line:90%
And he died from it.

00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Saint Francis died from his
wounds about two years--

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:27.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Padre
Pio had them, too.

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:27.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:31.032 align:middle line:84%
And my hands were so bad, I
couldn't even use my hands.

00:39:31.032 --> 00:39:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
have the stigmata?

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: I had it so bad in
my hands that I couldn't even

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:37.410 align:middle line:90%
touch that without screaming.

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had blood
coming out of your hands?

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: No blood,
but my hands swole up.

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And Doctor Pasulka and
all-- they told us--

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Tim Taylor was there
at the Vatican.

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:50.720 align:middle line:84%
They allowed him into
the Vatican archives,

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.110 align:middle line:90%
and he did it in my honor.

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:55.260 align:middle line:84%
They put a picture of me
inside the Pope's picture.

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:57.200 align:middle line:84%
They actually placed
a picture of me

00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:00.230 align:middle line:84%
in between the books of
Galileo and Copernicus

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:04.280 align:middle line:84%
in the Vatican libraries
there forever in the archives.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:09.570 align:middle line:84%
But they told me that they
didn't mean to hurt us.

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:12.990 align:middle line:84%
But the plasma for these
orbs can harm the human body.

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And they knew that
Saint Francis had what--

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:19.700 align:middle line:84%
he said nothing more than
rheumatoid arthritis,

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:22.335 align:middle line:90%
based on today's medical lenses.

00:40:22.335 --> 00:40:24.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Didn't you see
the attempted assassination

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:25.510 align:middle line:90%
of the Pope?

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:26.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I did.

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:27.670 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:28.962 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And did you warn them?

00:40:28.962 --> 00:40:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I warned them.

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:31.940 align:middle line:84%
That's the first
chapter of my book.

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:33.120 align:middle line:90%
Pretty interesting.

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.375 align:middle line:84%
That's how I met John
Alexander, by the way.

00:40:35.375 --> 00:40:36.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good guy.

00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: I was standing
out at the burning tree

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:42.400 align:middle line:84%
with two scientists from
Wake Forest University.

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:45.330 align:middle line:84%
They were doing spirit
ghost hunting, right?

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:46.500 align:middle line:90%
These scientists.

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea what this
was, what she was doing.

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:51.260 align:middle line:84%
But she hands me
this little box that

00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:54.900 align:middle line:84%
makes a noise called a voice
ghost box or something.

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:58.370 align:middle line:84%
It makes a static noise and
sweeps through a million

00:40:58.370 --> 00:41:00.630 align:middle line:90%
frequencies or something.

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:02.560 align:middle line:90%
She said, you hold this.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.760 align:middle line:90%
Hooked it to a recorder.

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.890 align:middle line:84%
So I'm leaning against
the burning tree.

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And these two scientists
and my wife and another lady

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:12.250 align:middle line:90%
are watching and she said, talk.

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Just ask questions and
see if you get a response.

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, I started
talking and this thing

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.820 align:middle line:84%
started talking
back in a big way.

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:18.365 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Through the box?

00:41:18.365 --> 00:41:19.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Through the box.

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:20.310 align:middle line:90%
And we got it.

00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:25.680 align:middle line:84%
We had 350 recordings that
she recorded actual clips,

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:29.000 align:middle line:84%
and I have it on a
PowerPoint presentation.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.330 align:middle line:90%
But I said--

00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:33.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what I
said to get the response

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:35.390 align:middle line:84%
for that particular
response, but it said,

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:38.150 align:middle line:90%
Chris, the Pope is in trouble.

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:40.840 align:middle line:90%
You've got to help him.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:41.910 align:middle line:90%
Me help the Pope?

00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:42.760 align:middle line:90%
How is that even--

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:44.650 align:middle line:90%
Why is this thing even talking?

00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:46.140 align:middle line:90%
It said it three or four times.

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Next thing, I called
somebody that--

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:51.430 align:middle line:84%
that's connected to the
government, told them

00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:52.610 align:middle line:90%
what it said.

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And two days later, I was in
a meeting with John Alexander

00:41:56.770 --> 00:42:00.570 align:middle line:84%
and working on remote
viewing, the Pope

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:02.740 align:middle line:84%
because he was coming
to Philadelphia.

00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:04.060 align:middle line:90%
So he came to Washington.

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:05.380 align:middle line:90%
He came to New York.

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:10.050 align:middle line:84%
But his trip to Philly
is where heard that he

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:11.650 align:middle line:90%
was going to be in danger.

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I started remote
viewing with John's help.

00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And Joe McMoneagle,
he did the same.

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.990 align:middle line:90%
He--

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Remote viewer.

00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:19.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yep.

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And we discovered
that there was going

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:24.700 align:middle line:90%
to be an assassination attempt.

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And he would be coming from
highway 70 East across the Ben

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:29.720 align:middle line:90%
Franklin Bridge.

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:33.170 align:middle line:84%
So they shut the whole bridge
down from the New Jersey side.

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Everybody had to walk
across that long bridge.

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:37.580 align:middle line:90%
Made them all mad, everybody.

00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:40.330 align:middle line:84%
But they shut Philadelphia
down because--

00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:41.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You may have saved him.

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:42.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:45.270 align:middle line:90%
First chapter of the book.

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:46.385 align:middle line:90%
Pretty amazing.

00:42:46.385 --> 00:42:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you feel
personally that you're

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:52.626 align:middle line:90%
being groomed for something?

00:42:52.626 --> 00:42:56.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: I do in a
way because of the way

00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:59.280 align:middle line:90%
the phenomenon reacts at times.

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Just-- it's so
interactive and around me.

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:09.708 align:middle line:84%
Like, it's liable to appear in
here, but right between us or--

00:43:09.708 --> 00:43:10.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dramatic.

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:11.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:13.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The name of
your book, UFO of God.

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.100 align:middle line:10%
People have been
able to get it where?

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:21.170 align:middle line:10%
>>BLEDSOE: You can get it on
Amazon or Spotify, Audible.

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:24.770 align:middle line:10%
We have it in a hardback,
paperback, electronic,

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:26.590 align:middle line:10%
and audible.

00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:28.745 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chris, thanks for
being on Beyond Belief.

00:43:28.745 --> 00:43:30.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BLEDSOE: Thank you
for having me, George.

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:31.220 align:middle line:90%
It's my pleasure.

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chris Bledsoe
seems to be chosen.

00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:36.580 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:40.820 align:middle line:84%
We don't know yet, but maybe
one day we'll find out.

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
Beyond Belief.
