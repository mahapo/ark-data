>>JIMMY CHURCH: Welcome.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jimmy Church.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.400 align:middle line:10%
You've probably seen me on Into
the Vortex right here on Gaia.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.160 align:middle line:10%
And I'm honored to be sitting in
for George Noory on this episode

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.800 align:middle line:10%
of Beyond Belief.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.800 align:middle line:84%
Today's guest is
Mike Ricksecker,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.400 align:middle line:84%
author of over a dozen
books on the paranormal

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.880 align:middle line:90%
and ancient mysteries.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And today, he's here to talk
about his new book, Portals

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.480 align:middle line:84%
to the Stars, and the idea
that ancient civilizations once

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.620 align:middle line:84%
used Earth's energy to access
real portals and stargates.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.120 align:middle line:90%
Mike, welcome to the show.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE RICKSECKER:
Thanks, Jimmy.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Great to be back here
on Beyond Belief.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Let's
go deep right now.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.448 align:middle line:84%
What is the difference between
a portal and a stargate?

00:00:59.448 --> 00:01:00.740 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:10%
So a portal, these are
naturally occurring phenomenon

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.000 align:middle line:10%
across the universe
that are basically

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.680 align:middle line:10%
gateways to other
locations, whether it's

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.340 align:middle line:10%
across the cosmos, could
be to another dimension,

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.200 align:middle line:10%
could even be to
another point in time.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.960 align:middle line:84%
A stargate is an
intelligent being's ability

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.840 align:middle line:84%
to harness the power of a
portal and use it at their will.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.780 align:middle line:10%
And when I say
intelligent being,

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.120 align:middle line:10%
I don't just mean human,
that could be maybe

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.160 align:middle line:10%
it's extraterrestrial
beings or interdimensional

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.040 align:middle line:10%
beings across the
universe that could also

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.840 align:middle line:10%
be harnessing this as well.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Then we have vortex.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And these terms, I think,
are a little freely used

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.800 align:middle line:84%
inside of the community without
a really firm understanding

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.560 align:middle line:84%
or definition about
what these things are.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.608 align:middle line:84%
And then we throw in
vortex, what's a vortex?

00:01:55.608 --> 00:01:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: And you're right.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.260 align:middle line:84%
We do freely use a lot
of these different terms.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.320 align:middle line:84%
So a vortex is really what
the energy is creating.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.720 align:middle line:84%
When I mean energy I'm talking
about the Earth's energy.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.960 align:middle line:10%
And we have to go
all the way back down

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.840 align:middle line:10%
to the core of the
Earth when we start

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.560 align:middle line:10%
talking about this, a molten
ball of iron spinning around

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.360 align:middle line:10%
and around, creating
the magnetic shield

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.000 align:middle line:10%
that protects our planet.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And this is a good thing
because it does protect us

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.000 align:middle line:84%
from the harmful rays of the sun
and all these different things.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.040 align:middle line:84%
But as it's rising up through
the mantle and the crust

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.440 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, it's interacting
with different metals

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.940 align:middle line:84%
and minerals in
different quantities.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And as it's rising up, it's
creating that vortex effect,

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.400 align:middle line:84%
which is really if you think
of a tornado or a whirlpool

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.720 align:middle line:84%
or something like this,
this is that type of energy

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.920 align:middle line:84%
that's spiraling up
from the Earth's core.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And depending on that metal or
mineral and the quantity of it,

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.280 align:middle line:84%
it creates these different
localized electromagnetic fields

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.560 align:middle line:90%
where interesting things happen.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Now, with your
background intelligence,

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.200 align:middle line:84%
the Air Force, certainly
working with the NSA,

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.640 align:middle line:84%
allows you to approach things
a little bit differently when

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.280 align:middle line:84%
you're investigating
and researching.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.680 align:middle line:84%
So throwing in that
background, what

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.040 align:middle line:84%
was the inspiration for
writing a book like Portals

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.383 align:middle line:90%
to the Stars?

00:03:20.383 --> 00:03:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER:
Portals to the Stars

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.240 align:middle line:84%
is really a culmination
of many years of work

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.760 align:middle line:84%
that I've been conducting
for a long, long time,

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.400 align:middle line:84%
really dating back
to those years

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.340 align:middle line:84%
that I was in Alaska when I was
in the United States Air Force.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.020 align:middle line:10%
I started noticing
across the world,

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.520 align:middle line:10%
and a lot of other researchers
have at these different,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.740 align:middle line:10%
what we call hotspot locations.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.600 align:middle line:10%
A lot of these different
strange phenomena occur.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.440 align:middle line:84%
So over the past
several years, I've

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.440 align:middle line:84%
been conducting tours
to Egypt and really got

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.000 align:middle line:84%
fascinated by the stargates
and stargate symbolism that

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.400 align:middle line:90%
are littered throughout Egypt.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was originally
going to write

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.920 align:middle line:84%
a book called Energized
Earth to really talk

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.100 align:middle line:90%
about the Earth energy.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.320 align:middle line:10%
But the last time that I
was out there in Egypt,

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.720 align:middle line:10%
it's one of those
where the land inspires

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.440 align:middle line:10%
you to do different things.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.840 align:middle line:10%
And I got inspired
to OK, I'm going

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.720 align:middle line:10%
to talk about the Earth
energy and energized Earth

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.820 align:middle line:10%
within this book.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.760 align:middle line:10%
But this is the time
right now to talk

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.519 align:middle line:10%
about portals and
stargates, where

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.280 align:middle line:10%
we find these in the
world, and how we

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.440 align:middle line:10%
may be able to use these today.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: How does reality
get involved with this

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.960 align:middle line:84%
because if you have a pragmatic
investigative intelligence

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.300 align:middle line:84%
background versus getting into
this ancient civilizations,

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.000 align:middle line:84%
portals, vortexes, time travel,
stargates, and then having this

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.040 align:middle line:84%
represented through
cross-culturally

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.280 align:middle line:84%
around the world, how do these
two realities mix with you?

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And how are you able to accept
the possibility of a portal

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.118 align:middle line:90%
and a vortex and a stargate?

00:05:00.118 --> 00:05:02.160 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Well, what's
interesting about that

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.840 align:middle line:84%
is when you look at
a lot of the material

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.000 align:middle line:84%
that science has been
providing of late,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.420 align:middle line:84%
they are acknowledging
that portals do exist.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.600 align:middle line:84%
You have a lot of
material from NASA

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.320 align:middle line:84%
that's come out over
the last 10 to 15 years

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.700 align:middle line:84%
where outside the planet, they
talk about portals in space.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And when they first
announced this,

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.100 align:middle line:84%
they did say, yes,
these are portals.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.800 align:middle line:84%
They ended up calling
them X points.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Now they have other terms
that they're starting to use.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.940 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to break away
from that portal terminology,

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.580 align:middle line:84%
but they have
acknowledged that, yes,

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.000 align:middle line:84%
these are portals in space
that are allowing protons

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.020 align:middle line:84%
and electrons from the sun
to enter into the Earth much,

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.820 align:middle line:90%
much faster.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And we see that
even other sciences

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.640 align:middle line:84%
are starting to do things like
create portals and wormholes

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.520 align:middle line:90%
and things like this in the lab.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Now, portals
transporting particles

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.190 align:middle line:84%
and protons is one
thing, but can that

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:04.030 align:middle line:84%
be expanded into a
body, an entity, or even

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.568 align:middle line:90%
say, a spacecraft?

00:06:05.568 --> 00:06:06.610 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Absolutely.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're talking
about the building blocks

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.090 align:middle line:90%
of this type of technology.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And when you have in the
lab that they are actually

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.850 align:middle line:84%
on a quantum level
at this point,

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.470 align:middle line:84%
creating two miniature
black holes, connecting them

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:20.770 align:middle line:90%
with a wormhole.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.510 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this is really just our
modern beginnings of something

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.470 align:middle line:10%
I believe the ancients were
already doing thousands

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.550 align:middle line:10%
and thousands of years ago.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:35.750 align:middle line:10%
When that experiment was
made public, immediately

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.110 align:middle line:10%
the press was asking,
well, can you send a living

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.970 align:middle line:10%
being through that?

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.637 align:middle line:84%
They actually used the example,
can you just send a dog through?

00:06:41.637 --> 00:06:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And at this point, no, we're
sending messages back and forth,

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:45.490 align:middle line:90%
and things like this.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.430 align:middle line:84%
But this is the end game
to be able to send humans

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:53.570 align:middle line:84%
and humanity through this portal
or stargate to somewhere else.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Now, that's
modern science.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.890 align:middle line:84%
Our level of understanding
grows every single day,

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.090 align:middle line:84%
and we start to look at
the possibilities of this.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.470 align:middle line:84%
Interdimensional has become
a buzzword, for sure.

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.910 align:middle line:84%
But the ancients
appeared to be doing

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.230 align:middle line:84%
exactly this, where they
were transporting and moving

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:14.810 align:middle line:90%
around the planet.

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:19.670 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing to have something
that's artificially created out

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.390 align:middle line:84%
in space and science
working on that today,

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:26.390 align:middle line:84%
but it appears that this
was happening naturally

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.350 align:middle line:84%
back in ancient history,
or did the ancients

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.015 align:middle line:90%
create these portals?

00:07:31.015 --> 00:07:32.390 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: I
believe what they

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.510 align:middle line:84%
were doing was they were
harnessing that energy that

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:36.730 align:middle line:90%
was already there.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And when we talk
about going back

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:42.210 align:middle line:84%
to what NASA has
acknowledged here,

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:46.470 align:middle line:84%
that interaction of the
solar wind and the magnetism

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.870 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth to
create these portals.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:51.730 align:middle line:84%
Now they're recognizing
that out in space.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:55.725 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Earth's magnetism
and the solar wind

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:58.350 align:middle line:84%
are interacting with each other
all the way down to the ground.

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:02.990 align:middle line:84%
So we have different
naturally occurring portals

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.790 align:middle line:84%
all over the world on the
ground, also in the air.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that the
ancients recognized this,

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.230 align:middle line:84%
that you had these energetic
locations that they could

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:13.530 align:middle line:90%
detect, they could harness.

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:14.510 align:middle line:84%
That's why they
were building things

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.410 align:middle line:84%
like the pyramids in
the stone circles,

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:19.430 align:middle line:84%
and these things was so that
they could harness that energy

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.530 align:middle line:84%
in the ground for a lot
of different things,

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.680 align:middle line:90%
and not just the portals.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.550 align:middle line:10%
These were healing
centers, these

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:29.710 align:middle line:10%
were places of entering
altered states of worship

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:31.870 align:middle line:10%
and these different solar
alignments and things

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:34.470 align:middle line:10%
like this, but also for
opening these portals.

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Did they use
it for transportation?

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:39.270 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: I believe so.

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:44.550 align:middle line:84%
We find too many
coincidences across the globe

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:48.470 align:middle line:84%
where you have pyramids, Chichén
Itza, the step pyramid there

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.930 align:middle line:84%
at Saqqara that look
really, really similar.

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.570 align:middle line:84%
You have symbolism all
across the world, cultures

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.070 align:middle line:84%
that were not
supposed to, according

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:56.807 align:middle line:84%
to traditional
academia, they were not

00:08:56.807 --> 00:08:58.890 align:middle line:84%
supposed to have had any
connection to each other.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:01.030 align:middle line:84%
But we find the
symbol of the spirals

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:03.505 align:middle line:84%
all over the world, which is
the ancient symbol for portal.

00:09:03.505 --> 00:09:05.630 align:middle line:84%
You have the pine cones,
you have the handbags, all

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:09.033 align:middle line:84%
of these different things
all over the world that they

00:09:09.033 --> 00:09:10.450 align:middle line:84%
were not supposed
to be connected,

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:11.565 align:middle line:90%
but you can see they are.

00:09:11.565 --> 00:09:13.190 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, how would
we be finding this

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.070 align:middle line:90%
in so many different locations?

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:19.550 align:middle line:10%
>>CHURCH: The representation
of doorways apparently going

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:24.630 align:middle line:10%
to nowhere, that don't make
any sense with every culture

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.630 align:middle line:10%
on the planet throughout
ancient history,

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:32.350 align:middle line:10%
were these markings of
a geographical location,

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:35.270 align:middle line:10%
or was this truly an
entrance to a portal?

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.610 align:middle line:10%
And if it was, how
did you enter it?

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.510 align:middle line:10%
Did you say magic words?

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:43.625 align:middle line:84%
Was there something
else involved?

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:45.750 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: I believe
there are multiple methods.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:49.390 align:middle line:84%
The idea of saying magic
words is interesting.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:52.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not like abracadabra, open
sesame, or something like that,

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:56.430 align:middle line:84%
but words have power,
words have a resonance.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:10:00.550 align:middle line:84%
When those words are vocalized,
those tones are coming out

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:02.570 align:middle line:84%
of your mouth, it's
creating a vibration,

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:04.510 align:middle line:84%
it's creating a
resonance toward whatever

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.590 align:middle line:90%
object is in front of you.

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:10.270 align:middle line:84%
So yes, when we talk
about maybe some chant

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.130 align:middle line:84%
or something like
this, then yeah,

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:15.310 align:middle line:84%
that could be
opening some doorway.

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:19.030 align:middle line:84%
The prime example for me
that this really hit home

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:23.470 align:middle line:84%
was Drombeg Stone Circle in
Ireland, a smaller stone circle.

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And when you stand in the middle
of this thing and you just talk,

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:32.530 align:middle line:84%
you hear this amazing resonance
come right back at you.

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:34.830 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like you're
in a bubble or almost

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.190 align:middle line:90%
like a fishbowl effect thing.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.990 align:middle line:84%
But I just thought
back to, OK, this thing

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:42.470 align:middle line:90%
is thousands of years old.

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Not all the stones are
here, and I'm just talking.

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:47.242 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine this thing
in its full glory,

00:10:47.242 --> 00:10:49.450 align:middle line:84%
all the stones are there,
they're not weathered down,

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:51.570 align:middle line:84%
and you're doing
some sort of chant.

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:54.510 align:middle line:84%
This is going to have
an effect on whomever

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:55.847 align:middle line:90%
is within that circle.

00:10:55.847 --> 00:10:58.430 align:middle line:84%
So this could have been used for
healing, could have been used

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:01.030 align:middle line:90%
to open these sorts of portals.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Today when we
talk about technology,

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:07.470 align:middle line:84%
we think of something easy, like
a cell phone or the internet,

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:09.030 align:middle line:90%
television.

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:13.470 align:middle line:84%
But when we come into
that aspect of it

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:16.570 align:middle line:84%
and we look at ancient history,
let's go with the A word,

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:20.430 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis, for instance,
was that technology

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.550 align:middle line:84%
to them not
necessarily a hardware

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:29.710 align:middle line:84%
based technology, but something
that was maybe more mental?

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:32.310 align:middle line:84%
What we would call
magical today,

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:34.270 align:middle line:84%
was that their
technology and they just

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:38.250 align:middle line:84%
went down a different
technological path than we did?

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:41.950 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: I think that's
what happened is traditional

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:44.670 align:middle line:84%
academia today, when we start
talking about the ancients

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.070 align:middle line:84%
having quote unquote,
"high technology,"

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:49.630 align:middle line:84%
and they get spooked by that
because when they think of high

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:51.970 align:middle line:84%
technology, they're thinking
cell phones, computers,

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:53.030 align:middle line:90%
these sorts of things.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.830 align:middle line:10%
And in our community,
when we refer

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:57.310 align:middle line:10%
to ancients having
high technology,

00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:59.310 align:middle line:10%
we're not talking about
cell phone and computers

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:02.130 align:middle line:10%
and these sorts of things, it
was a different technology.

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:05.690 align:middle line:10%
Their civilization grew
up differently than ours.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:07.750 align:middle line:10%
When that civilization
was wiped out

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.930 align:middle line:10%
by the great cataclysm, or at
least the last great cataclysm

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:14.870 align:middle line:10%
because there have been
many over the millennia,

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:19.710 align:middle line:10%
we came up in our way, just a
different path that we took.

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:22.670 align:middle line:84%
So yes, their technology
that they had back

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:26.070 align:middle line:84%
then could have
been more mental,

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:27.670 align:middle line:84%
we could look at it
almost like magic.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:30.470 align:middle line:84%
They were using sound
technology or a different way

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:33.350 align:middle line:84%
to use magnetics and
electromagnetism.

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:36.670 align:middle line:84%
We see, like in ancient Egypt,
a lot of these different wall

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.590 align:middle line:84%
friezes where the priests are
using the scepters to do things

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.845 align:middle line:90%
like raise up the temple.

00:12:42.845 --> 00:12:44.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, that could have
been a technology

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:48.510 align:middle line:84%
that the ancient Atlanteans
had, that if we were to go back

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:51.970 align:middle line:84%
in time instead of seeing
scaffolding around a building,

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.670 align:middle line:84%
we might see a bunch
of guys and gals

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:58.030 align:middle line:84%
with these scepters raising up
blocks that are floating in air.

00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: When we look at
typical media presentations

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:06.230 align:middle line:84%
of what a wormhole or stargate
or portal may look like,

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:10.770 align:middle line:84%
it differs from the description
that we see in ancient texts

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:12.190 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:16.990 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at the movie
Interstellar, that wormhole,

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.950 align:middle line:84%
the entrance to
that was a sphere.

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:21.390 align:middle line:90%
It was a ball.

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:24.910 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't the entrance
to a tunnel, if you will.

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:27.590 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain the
differences with that

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:30.318 align:middle line:84%
and how an entrance to
a portal may look like?

00:13:30.318 --> 00:13:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Absolutely, yeah.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Because prior to
Interstellar, most films

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:38.490 align:middle line:84%
like Contact or
the film Stargate,

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:42.890 align:middle line:84%
even Star Wars will show a
tunnel going to someplace.

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:47.430 align:middle line:84%
So Kip Thorne, who's a
world renowned physicist,

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:50.250 align:middle line:84%
consulted on Interstellar
with Christopher Nolan.

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is basically how he
presented a wormhole would

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:55.370 align:middle line:90%
really look like in space.

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Because if you take
Einstein-Rosen bridge,

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:01.310 align:middle line:84%
you're folding space and time
to bring two points together

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:03.450 align:middle line:84%
and connect them
through a tunnel.

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And so we traditionally see
that as basically this long tube

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:09.703 align:middle line:84%
in space that has
a circular opening.

00:14:09.703 --> 00:14:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: It's an
easy thing to imagine.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.203 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: It's an
easy thing to imagine.

00:14:13.203 --> 00:14:14.847 align:middle line:84%
Stargate had the
big circle, and you

00:14:14.847 --> 00:14:16.930 align:middle line:84%
walk through the water
that's in the middle of it,

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:18.970 align:middle line:84%
and you get whisked off
through this tunnel.

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:20.030 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:25.390 align:middle line:10%
But a circle, you take that
two dimensional representation

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:28.830 align:middle line:10%
and we're in 3D space,
that becomes a sphere.

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:30.710 align:middle line:84%
So they call it a
spherical hole, and that's

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:33.910 align:middle line:84%
what we would be traveling
through to these other places

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.770 align:middle line:84%
in the cosmos or
other dimensions.

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Now this is
where it connects directly

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:41.310 align:middle line:84%
into our community,
in my opinion.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:43.990 align:middle line:90%
We have orbs all over the place.

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And the ancients which have
talked about these orbs

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:52.070 align:middle line:84%
would reference a
spiritual connection

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.690 align:middle line:84%
to that, which is
also easy to do.

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:58.030 align:middle line:84%
It's the level of knowledge
that you have at that time.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Could these orbs that we see
not only in the sky and maybe

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:05.390 align:middle line:84%
see it as an energy
ship, could these

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:07.098 align:middle line:84%
be portals that are
right in front of us?

00:15:07.098 --> 00:15:09.390 align:middle line:10%
>>RICKSECKER: Absolutely,
and this is one of the points

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:11.610 align:middle line:10%
that I make in
Portals to the Stars,

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:15.190 align:middle line:10%
is that taking this
concept of the spherical

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:19.550 align:middle line:10%
hole that many of these
orbs that are seen

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:22.973 align:middle line:10%
could be alongside Sasquatch,
ETs out in the forest,

00:15:22.973 --> 00:15:23.890 align:middle line:10%
these sorts of things.

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:25.150 align:middle line:10%
Yes, up in the sky.

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Just recently here
with the drone flap,

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:31.970 align:middle line:84%
and I know our government
said, well, that was us.

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:35.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, they never addressed
a lot of these people,

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:38.410 align:middle line:84%
even government
officials are saying,

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:41.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing the drones come
out of these balls of light

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:42.840 align:middle line:90%
in the sky.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.590 align:middle line:84%
These would be the
portals for these craft

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:46.150 align:middle line:90%
to come in and out of.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:47.110 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: I've seen one
orb and it was, as you say,

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:54.950 align:middle line:84%
it was two dimensional
and it was large.

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, when it appeared
in front of us,

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:01.910 align:middle line:84%
there was about 75 other
people there, we all saw it,

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:04.590 align:middle line:84%
and it was probably
50 yards away.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:09.750 align:middle line:10%
It was maybe 40 feet tall,
it grew in front of us,

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:12.990 align:middle line:10%
but it was two
dimensional, like a coin.

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:18.190 align:middle line:10%
It was flat, gray at night, and
it's right there in front of us.

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:21.830 align:middle line:84%
Should I have ran and
jumped through that?

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.400 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: I get
asked the question a lot.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.770 align:middle line:84%
I saw portal in front of
me, would I walk through it?

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And my answer is
always yes, but.

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And that but is, I'm
going to leave a note

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:34.710 align:middle line:84%
and let you know what
I'm doing and where

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:37.710 align:middle line:84%
I think I might be going because
there are too many people that

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:40.230 align:middle line:84%
get lost in the
woods and you have

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:41.530 align:middle line:90%
no idea what happened to them.

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:44.182 align:middle line:90%
And we speculate, did they go--

00:16:44.182 --> 00:16:46.390 align:middle line:84%
Sure, some of them could
have gotten eaten by a bear,

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.970 align:middle line:84%
but did some of these people
actually pass through a portal?

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Because some of
them do come back

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:55.110 align:middle line:84%
and they will say things like
I was walking in the woods

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:58.995 align:middle line:84%
and I'm on the path, I heard
a noise off to the side of me.

00:16:58.995 --> 00:17:01.370 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to go check it out,
took two steps off the path,

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:03.358 align:middle line:84%
took a look and
didn't find anything

00:17:03.358 --> 00:17:04.650 align:middle line:90%
that would have made the noise.

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:07.150 align:middle line:84%
Turn around and get back on
the path, the path is gone.

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:08.250 align:middle line:90%
What happened to it?

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.010 align:middle line:90%
And now I'm lost in the woods.

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:13.050 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, did they step
through a portal to somewhere,

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:15.310 align:middle line:84%
to maybe another place
within the wilderness

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:17.630 align:middle line:90%
or to another point in time?

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:18.930 align:middle line:90%
It's possibly the case.

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:20.849 align:middle line:84%
So yes, I would walk
through that portal,

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:22.950 align:middle line:84%
but let people know
where I'm going.

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:25.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: The portal
phased out in front of us,

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:30.590 align:middle line:84%
it lasted for maybe 15 or 30
seconds and then was gone.

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to myself,
first off, OK, it's

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:37.910 align:middle line:84%
my first experience,
but it's obviously real.

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:42.430 align:middle line:10%
We've heard too many experiences
and encounters and testimony

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:46.220 align:middle line:10%
over the years about exactly
what we just witnessed witness.

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And you have to back up and
say, well, wait a minute.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:53.600 align:middle line:84%
This was an invitation,
it was right there

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:58.020 align:middle line:84%
and then it just went away and
none of us took the invitation.

00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.860 align:middle line:84%
The other part is,
what if something

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.100 align:middle line:90%
would have stepped out of it?

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Could governments use
portals like this?

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.380 align:middle line:90%
Could they be accessing--

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:11.280 align:middle line:84%
In almost a Stargate fashion,
referencing the TV series,

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:16.180 align:middle line:84%
of course, is this an easy
way to get from point A

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:21.180 align:middle line:84%
to point B over vast
distances instantly?

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah, that's the
whole idea of these portals

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.420 align:middle line:84%
and stargates and whatever other
term you want to use for them.

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:31.180 align:middle line:84%
This is the idea to be able to
travel those vast distances.

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:33.420 align:middle line:84%
It could be to somewhere
else on the planet,

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.220 align:middle line:84%
could be to another
place in the cosmos,

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:38.520 align:middle line:84%
could be to another dimension
or even another point in time.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.780 align:middle line:84%
That is exactly what we
would be using this for.

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: The other aspect,
when we look at orbs and portals

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:50.080 align:middle line:84%
moving and appearing and
disappearing in front of people

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.080 align:middle line:84%
that there might be an
intelligence behind this

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:57.640 align:middle line:84%
or they may be sentient
or conscious itself.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.680 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.138 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah,
I think there's

00:19:00.138 --> 00:19:03.280 align:middle line:84%
a variety of different orbs
that we are talking about.

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:05.260 align:middle line:84%
So I do believe
some are actually

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:09.440 align:middle line:84%
the portal that these beings are
using to travel back and forth.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.380 align:middle line:84%
I've also experienced
orbs that did

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:16.540 align:middle line:84%
seem to have their own
sentient nature about them.

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:20.740 align:middle line:84%
I had an experience
where early on in

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:25.900 align:middle line:84%
the evening, this was at a
Hinsdale house in New York,

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:29.520 align:middle line:84%
around the Finger Lakes area,
and it was just bouncing around

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.320 align:middle line:90%
in the woods.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.180 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't go back
there because it

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.440 align:middle line:90%
was somebody else's property.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And we were trying to
call, hey, come closer?

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.500 align:middle line:90%
That thing.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:36.820 align:middle line:90%
Didn't come closer.

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Later on in the evening,
we're down there

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.040 align:middle line:84%
by the fire pit
and just chatting.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
down from the woods

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:47.740 align:middle line:84%
come all these little sprinkles
of light, all these little balls

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:48.660 align:middle line:90%
of light.

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And now this is an area that
we're talking New York, late

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:54.020 align:middle line:90%
September.

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.520 align:middle line:84%
I've told this story, people
say, well, were they fireflies?

00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And blue fireflies do
exist in the Carolina's.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.600 align:middle line:90%
Blue fireflies.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Blue fire--

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.380 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: They're rare,
but they do exist down

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.340 align:middle line:90%
in the Carolina's in June.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.740 align:middle line:84%
This was late
September in New York.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And with all these little
lights coming down,

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:13.740 align:middle line:84%
and we're down there
on our hands and knees

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.380 align:middle line:84%
trying to communicate with
them because they're doing

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.463 align:middle line:90%
really interesting things.

00:20:16.463 --> 00:20:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were
twinkling in the night.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were slowly
morphing into existence,

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.980 align:middle line:84%
and then they're
dissipating away.

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:28.640 align:middle line:84%
So they had a really, really
interesting nature about them,

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.720 align:middle line:84%
and they seemed very,
very interactive as well.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.778 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Was it physical
or was it energy?

00:20:32.778 --> 00:20:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: They seemed
physical in nature, the

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.200 align:middle line:90%
that they were moving about.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.200 align:middle line:84%
But then when we're down
on our hands and knees,

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.880 align:middle line:84%
looking at the ones on
the ground trying to see,

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.240 align:middle line:90%
is this some bug or something?

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Got the flashlights
out and all that.

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.103 align:middle line:84%
Nothing, there is
no bug or anything.

00:20:45.103 --> 00:20:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: How do
you explain that?

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: What I
used to say some years

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:52.780 align:middle line:84%
ago was the big
blue ball of light

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.760 align:middle line:84%
out in the woods, maybe that was
all of them bunched up together,

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.600 align:middle line:90%
whatever it was.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And they unformed
from that great ball

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.140 align:middle line:90%
and came down to visit us.

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:04.020 align:middle line:84%
But over the past several years,
doing more of this research

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:10.000 align:middle line:84%
into portals, stargates, and
the nature of these energy orbs,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.243 align:middle line:84%
like this possibly
being portals, I mean,

00:21:12.243 --> 00:21:13.660 align:middle line:84%
that blue ball of
light could have

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:15.540 align:middle line:84%
been the portal for
these other little beings

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.540 align:middle line:84%
to come down that we might
even call them fairies.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: What
about this happening

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:25.140 align:middle line:84%
in front of other people,
like Alaska's Mount Marathon

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Race that may have had a
portal disappearance right

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:29.640 align:middle line:90%
there in front of everybody?

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.000 align:middle line:90%
How do you explain that?

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.917 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: This was
really, really bizarre.

00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:36.940 align:middle line:84%
Back in 2012, the Mount
Marathon Race, Michael Lemaitre,

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.140 align:middle line:84%
right in the middle
of a very public race,

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.670 align:middle line:84%
he'd gotten up to
the checkpoint.

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:43.600 align:middle line:84%
You have different
checkpoints along the way,

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.140 align:middle line:84%
got to the top of
the mountain there

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:49.460 align:middle line:84%
and nobody ever saw him
again after that checkpoint,

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.700 align:middle line:90%
completely disappeared.

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:54.120 align:middle line:84%
They had the state
troopers come out,

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:58.100 align:middle line:84%
they had the dogs come
out, sniff around all this.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:00.145 align:middle line:84%
Search went on for weeks,
nothing was ever found.

00:22:00.145 --> 00:22:02.520 align:middle line:84%
People were starting to wonder,
did he fall off the path,

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.380 align:middle line:84%
break a leg, end
up in a crevasse

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:05.860 align:middle line:90%
somewhere, these things?

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.040 align:middle line:90%
Nothing was ever found of him.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Disappeared in the
middle of a public race.

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Last night you
and I went to dinner.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Two grown men having dinner
in a nice restaurant,

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:22.740 align:middle line:84%
and we talked about
fairies all night long.

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And I said to you, I do
what I do, I am what I am.

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:30.602 align:middle line:90%
But fairies are real.

00:22:30.602 --> 00:22:31.560 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: They are.

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:35.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: And your
response was, they are.

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And we started to
talk about this.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, fairies, and I shared a
story with you of a photograph

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:46.727 align:middle line:84%
that I saw of what appeared
to be crystal clear,

00:22:46.727 --> 00:22:48.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there was
a question about it.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.980 align:middle line:90%
It was who was it?

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:55.380 align:middle line:84%
But of a fairy inside of
an orb of a bubble that you

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.920 align:middle line:90%
would blow with a bubble wand.

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:02.140 align:middle line:84%
A bubble with a
fairy inside of it

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:06.140 align:middle line:84%
that was taken right next
to where I was sitting.

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:10.420 align:middle line:84%
This is an experience
that is shared by so many.

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:13.780 align:middle line:84%
Have people interacted with
fairies and have fairies

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:17.638 align:middle line:84%
pulled people into these
portals into fairy land?

00:23:17.638 --> 00:23:19.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah,
these are stories

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:22.100 align:middle line:84%
that we've been hearing for
hundreds, if not thousands

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.320 align:middle line:84%
of years, just in a
variety of different forms.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And we have today the
ET abduction scenarios

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.220 align:middle line:84%
where people get taken
onto the mothership.

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:35.140 align:middle line:84%
Jack Vallée wrote Passport
to Magonia, fantastic work.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And he pointed out
that we've actually

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:41.720 align:middle line:84%
been hearing these stories
just in a different fashion.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And so the ancient
fairy lore, great story

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:47.360 align:middle line:84%
out of Wales, Rhys
and Llewellyn.

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.120 align:middle line:10%
And they're walking down the
road after working in the fields

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.480 align:middle line:10%
one day, they have
a horse with them,

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.145 align:middle line:10%
and Rhys started hearing
some music off in the woods,

00:23:56.145 --> 00:23:57.520 align:middle line:10%
and he wanted to
go check it out.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.940 align:middle line:10%
And he's telling
Llewellyn, go on ahead,

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:02.380 align:middle line:10%
I'll be with you
in a few minutes.

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:03.980 align:middle line:84%
So Llewellyn was a
little skeptical.

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:04.960 align:middle line:90%
All right, but fine.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:05.840 align:middle line:90%
I'll go.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.580 align:middle line:90%
And so he heads back.

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Rhys does not show
back up that night.

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And the next morning, the
owners of the property, wherever

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Rhys and Llewellyn
were working, starts

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.360 align:middle line:84%
asking Llewellyn,
what happened to Rhys?

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:23.420 align:middle line:90%
He didn't show up.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And Llewellyn says, well,
he went to check out

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:27.240 align:middle line:90%
the music in the woods.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And immediately they're
skeptical of this.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.040 align:middle line:84%
They think maybe Llewellyn
has done something to Rhys,

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.680 align:middle line:84%
maybe he's murdered him
or something like this.

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And Llewellyn said, no,
no, no, I will take there.

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:41.285 align:middle line:84%
So they all go to this
spot where Rhys disappeared

00:24:41.285 --> 00:24:42.660 align:middle line:84%
and they're
searching around, not

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:44.035 align:middle line:84%
find anything,
not find anything.

00:24:44.035 --> 00:24:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Finally, Llewellyn starts
hearing the music a little bit

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:49.980 align:middle line:84%
and he steps into the
woods and all of a sudden

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:53.180 align:middle line:84%
before him is Rhys and
he's dancing around

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.860 align:middle line:84%
with these little folk,
having a great time.

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And Llewellyn is like,
what are you doing?

00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:59.525 align:middle line:90%
You need to come.

00:24:59.525 --> 00:25:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And Rhys is like, what
are you talking about?

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.680 align:middle line:90%
I just got here.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.640 align:middle line:90%
No, you've been gone for a day.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.468 align:middle line:84%
Rhys had only been
like five minutes

00:25:06.468 --> 00:25:07.760 align:middle line:90%
and wouldn't believe Llewellyn.

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.260 align:middle line:84%
So basically, he
had to drag him out

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:10.900 align:middle line:84%
of this very circle,
which really, I

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:15.240 align:middle line:84%
believe, because of this
different abstract of time,

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.900 align:middle line:84%
was really some other
dimension in time and space

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:19.620 align:middle line:84%
where time would
work differently.

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: So I should have
jumped through that orb,

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:22.980 align:middle line:90%
is what you're saying?

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:28.180 align:middle line:84%
But this sounds
natural to me where

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
it's geographical,

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:34.820 align:middle line:84%
if there's ley lines, if
it's different crystals

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:38.840 align:middle line:84%
and quartz in the ground,
or it could be granite,

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.920 align:middle line:84%
it could be a lot
of different things,

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.820 align:middle line:84%
but these are
natural occurrences

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:45.460 align:middle line:84%
that are happening
out in the wilderness.

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And one would say, OK, all
right, it sounds supernatural.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.380 align:middle line:84%
It just doesn't
sound quite right.

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:56.760 align:middle line:84%
But then we have Bigfoot
and we have these reports,

00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:03.080 align:middle line:84%
one after another of a portal,
an orb, a vortex, and a Bigfoot

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:03.880 align:middle line:90%
sighting.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.620 align:middle line:90%
Do you think they're connected?

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:08.380 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: I absolutely do.

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:12.280 align:middle line:84%
People get a little put off
by the term supernatural.

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Hans Holzer, who coined
the term ghost hunter way back

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:19.880 align:middle line:84%
in the 1950s, '60s wrote
over 150 books, did a lot,

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.320 align:middle line:90%
a lot of research in the area.

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And a quote that
I love from him is

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:27.220 align:middle line:84%
that there is no supernatural
world, everything that exists

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:28.420 align:middle line:90%
is natural.

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And I love that
because it's so true.

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:32.820 align:middle line:84%
These experiences that
we're having that we dub

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:36.820 align:middle line:84%
"supernatural," they are
just more rare occurrences

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:40.200 align:middle line:84%
of something that is very
natural that is happening here.

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:43.400 align:middle line:84%
So when we start talking about
Sasquatch, extraterrestrials,

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.420 align:middle line:84%
fairies, these are things that
are very natural to our universe

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.620 align:middle line:90%
that we just don't normally see.

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: So is it just
outside of our frequency range,

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:56.400 align:middle line:84%
on our time scale, but it's
just existing around us,

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.620 align:middle line:90%
we just need a way to get there?

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:01.467 align:middle line:84%
There could be something
right here with us right now?

00:27:01.467 --> 00:27:02.800 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Essentially, yeah.

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Oh, there are all kinds of
things around us right now.

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.540 align:middle line:84%
We only seem to a
very, very narrow band

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:10.400 align:middle line:90%
of the entire spectrum.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.708 align:middle line:84%
When you look at your
dogs and your cats,

00:27:12.708 --> 00:27:15.000 align:middle line:84%
we know that they are able
to see and hear things much,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.470 align:middle line:90%
much better than we.

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:18.220 align:middle line:84%
So when your cat staring
up in the corner,

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:21.020 align:middle line:84%
is it looking at
something that we can't?

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And so, yes, things resonate
at different frequencies.

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:28.330 align:middle line:84%
The human standing resonance
is only between 9 and 16

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:32.620 align:middle line:84%
hertz, but much more expansive
throughout the entire universe

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:33.840 align:middle line:90%
of what's really out there.

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:37.840 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it's a matter of tuning
into the correct frequency,

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.580 align:middle line:84%
whether that is
to use some portal

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:43.200 align:middle line:84%
to go to another dimension
or another point in time.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.940 align:middle line:84%
I covered a lot of this in
my time travel work as well.

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: So with
your background,

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:52.000 align:middle line:84%
intelligence, investigations,
the Air Force, secret agent,

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.100 align:middle line:84%
all that stuff that
you have is a very

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:57.750 align:middle line:84%
pragmatic, black and white
way to approach things.

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:02.060 align:middle line:84%
But then we have regressions
and hypnotic sessions,

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:07.300 align:middle line:84%
and you brought us the
audio of a session that

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:10.220 align:middle line:84%
involves two of our subjects
that we're talking about right

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:13.200 align:middle line:90%
now, Sasquatch and portals.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.120 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.412 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:28:15.412 --> 00:28:19.940 align:middle line:84%
So this particular session,
these are two QHHT practitioners

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.380 align:middle line:84%
that neither one of
which had any interest

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.400 align:middle line:90%
whatsoever in Sasquatch.

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:28.540 align:middle line:84%
So Katherine Swinn was running
this particular session,

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:31.380 align:middle line:84%
and Elis Joudalova
was the subject

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:32.840 align:middle line:90%
that was being regressed.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And what came out of this
about Sasquatch and portals

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:38.210 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely phenomenal.

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: So we
have the audio here.

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:42.370 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a listen,
tell me what's happening.

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:44.670 align:middle line:10%
>>ELIS JOUDALOVA: I'm
not going down as such,

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:50.642 align:middle line:10%
it keeps me in this
weird funnel thing.

00:28:50.642 --> 00:28:52.850 align:middle line:84%
>>KATHERINE SWINN: And now
tell me about this funnel.

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>>JOUDALOVA: It's purpley
pink, more like energy.

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:03.130 align:middle line:84%
I feel like above it
or I'm looking down

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:06.550 align:middle line:90%
and it goes thinner down.

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And I can't perceive anything
around this funnel big tunnelly

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:12.770 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SWINN: Is it still
or is it moving?

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>>JOUDALOVA: It's
turning and spinning

00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:22.610 align:middle line:84%
and almost like if you were to
get sucked into the tornado.

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:24.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SWINN: Is it like a wormhole?

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:25.110 align:middle line:90%
>>JOUDALOVA: Yes.

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:26.850 align:middle line:90%
Something like that.

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:29.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SWINN: What are you
experiencing right now?

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>>JOUDALOVA: I'm seeing
it as a physical body now.

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:35.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SWINN: And how would
you describe your face?

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>>JOUDALOVA: Half humanish,
half animalish, furry eyes,

00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:44.770 align:middle line:84%
their mouth is bit
more like human,

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:50.690 align:middle line:84%
nose is bit more like animalish,
a little bit different.

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:53.113 align:middle line:84%
>>SWINN: And what
are your eyes like?

00:29:53.113 --> 00:29:56.130 align:middle line:90%
>>JOUDALOVA: Brown quite--

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:59.010 align:middle line:84%
It seems the face
is a bit furry.

00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:03.450 align:middle line:84%
I think something just
gone not as planned

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:11.410 align:middle line:84%
and I ended up on Earth,
but in the physical body.

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm just saying it's being
in this mountains or forest

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:21.130 align:middle line:84%
on Earth and quite freaked out,
as in I'm in the body, which

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:25.270 align:middle line:84%
is meaning everyone can
see me and I can hide,

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:30.430 align:middle line:84%
but that's not helpful because
something that the mission is,

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:33.410 align:middle line:84%
or what I need to
find out or look at

00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:36.570 align:middle line:84%
is this what is happening
with people still worried

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:39.940 align:middle line:84%
that somebody will
see me, but I can't

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:41.910 align:middle line:90%
do what I came there to do.

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:46.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm just in a wrong
place, a bit lost.

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SWINN: What do you do?

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:49.450 align:middle line:90%
Where do you go next?

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>JOUDALOVA: Someone saw me,
some sort of hunters or someone

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:55.710 align:middle line:84%
in a forest like
rangers or someone

00:30:55.710 --> 00:31:01.710 align:middle line:84%
got a big pistol baton thing,
I think he saw me, freaked out.

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And he was there in
a car, like big Jeep.

00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:09.150 align:middle line:84%
I think he tried to shoot me,
and I was trying to run away.

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:13.010 align:middle line:84%
But don't think I can run away
very easily because that's not

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:14.190 align:middle line:90%
normally what--

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:15.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm not used to
being in the body.

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:18.708 align:middle line:90%
It's very heavy and slow.

00:31:18.708 --> 00:31:20.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SWINN: Do you get
a sense that they

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:24.610 align:middle line:84%
knew that you were there, or
did you take them by surprise?

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>>JOUDALOVA: No, they were
doing their hunting, I think.

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And I just feel maybe
they thought I was--

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:31.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SWINN: An animal.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.317 align:middle line:90%
>>JOUDALOVA: --animal.

00:31:32.317 --> 00:31:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: You know what
it sounds like there

00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:42.530 align:middle line:84%
that for us humans and our
reality, this is shocking.

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:48.210 align:middle line:84%
But for those that are using
this portal and this technology,

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:52.450 align:middle line:84%
this is just Tuesday, this
is just a normal thing.

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:55.250 align:middle line:90%
We were surprised they were not.

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah, it's
really, really fascinating,

00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:00.670 align:middle line:84%
and that whole session
is much more expansive.

00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:02.610 align:middle line:84%
Katherine has it up
on her YouTube channel

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:04.930 align:middle line:84%
and it gets into a lot
of different aspects.

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:07.630 align:middle line:84%
This portal system
that they were using,

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:10.810 align:middle line:84%
and this is how they move
in and out of our world

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:12.350 align:middle line:90%
into other dimensions.

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:16.270 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole inner Earth
aspect to this where they live,

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:18.570 align:middle line:84%
and they have
crystals there that

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:21.210 align:middle line:84%
actually have knowledge of
the universe embedded with it.

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:22.910 align:middle line:90%
It's really, really expansive.

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, jumping into
these portals for them

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:29.170 align:middle line:84%
and moving around like you
said is just like Tuesday.

00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: So the ancients
have been doing this forever.

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Is ET taking advantage of these
same ancient sites, and again,

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:46.750 align:middle line:84%
just a normal way of traveling,
and then you throw in fifth,

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:51.270 align:middle line:84%
sixth, seventh, eighth, 11th
dimension in another world,

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:55.970 align:middle line:84%
another parallel dimension
alongside us that are using this

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:57.530 align:middle line:90%
to go back and forth?

00:32:57.530 --> 00:32:58.850 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Even our theoretical
physics has shown us

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:03.730 align:middle line:84%
that we have up to 11
hyperspatial dimensions

00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:05.310 align:middle line:90%
0 through 10.

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:08.005 align:middle line:84%
Our consciousness right now is
in the fourth dimension of time,

00:33:08.005 --> 00:33:10.630 align:middle line:84%
and then we have access to all
those other dimensions below us,

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:13.370 align:middle line:90%
but 5, 6, 7, 8 onward.

00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:15.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we don't
really understand

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:17.950 align:middle line:84%
as humans what exactly
are in those dimensions.

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:19.450 align:middle line:84%
We have ideas, but
there are going

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:21.450 align:middle line:84%
to be other beings and
other entities living

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:23.010 align:middle line:90%
within those dimensions.

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:26.730 align:middle line:84%
ETs, we might call
them if they are living

00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:28.470 align:middle line:84%
on this planet in
those other dimensions,

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:31.150 align:middle line:84%
we call them ultraterrestrials
rather than extraterrestrials.

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:33.890 align:middle line:84%
But extraterrestrials
outside of our planet

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:35.790 align:middle line:90%
could be using this as well.

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And you have to keep in mind
that the Earth in relationship

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:46.070 align:middle line:84%
to the rest of the universe is a
lot younger, 4.5 billion years.

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:47.892 align:middle line:10%
Intelligent life or
semi-intelligent life

00:33:47.892 --> 00:33:49.850 align:middle line:10%
has only been around for
a couple billion years

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:52.890 align:middle line:10%
on this planet, where
other solar system's,

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:56.270 align:middle line:10%
other planets out there have
billions and billions more,

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:58.222 align:middle line:10%
honestly.

00:33:58.222 --> 00:34:01.203 align:middle line:84%
The universe is somewhere
around 14 billion years,

00:34:01.203 --> 00:34:03.370 align:middle line:84%
but there's actually a
recent scientific report that

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:05.210 align:middle line:84%
came out here some
months back and said,

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:08.270 align:middle line:84%
it might be closer
to 27 billion years.

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:12.530 align:middle line:84%
So imagine if some civilization
had more than 20 billion years

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:15.969 align:middle line:84%
ahead of us, they could be
doing a lot more than we

00:34:15.969 --> 00:34:17.350 align:middle line:90%
could even possibly imagine.

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Is it possible
that time travel

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:28.530 align:middle line:84%
comes into this and then an
Atlantean thousands of years ago

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:34.489 align:middle line:84%
steps through and then
appears here in our timeline

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:36.510 align:middle line:90%
and accessing a portal that way?

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
Einstein certainly

00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:42.250 align:middle line:84%
addressed this possibility to as
well, would that surprise you?

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:43.050 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah.

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:45.650 align:middle line:10%
Einstein with his idea of
the block universe, and that

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:49.550 align:middle line:10%
was part of the premise for
my book, Travels Through Time,

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:52.530 align:middle line:10%
where time doesn't really exist.

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:55.250 align:middle line:10%
Past, present, and future
are all here concurrently.

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:59.250 align:middle line:10%
And looking at time from the
fifth dimension and onward,

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:00.910 align:middle line:10%
it's all one object.

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:05.650 align:middle line:10%
So some intelligent being
that can take themselves out

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:07.490 align:middle line:10%
of the fourth dimension
into these others

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:10.150 align:middle line:10%
could access all of
those moments in time.

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:12.770 align:middle line:84%
So could the
Atlanteans have done

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:15.190 align:middle line:84%
something like that
thousands of years ago?

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:16.430 align:middle line:90%
It's entirely possible.

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:19.410 align:middle line:84%
Were their portals, their
stargates, actually,

00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:22.270 align:middle line:84%
methods of moving into
those other frames,

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:26.250 align:middle line:84%
maybe there are survivors of
Atlantis that we haven't found

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:28.910 align:middle line:84%
yet because they're going to
show up 1,000 years from now,

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:30.090 align:middle line:90%
that's possible.

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:34.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: I have a neighborhood
watch app on my phone.

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:36.710 align:middle line:84%
I live in a great
neighborhood in a great town.

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:39.130 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, the
app is on my phone.

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:43.010 align:middle line:84%
One of the things besides
missing dogs and cats, which

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:47.450 align:middle line:84%
I get on the neighborhood
watch app all day long,

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:54.130 align:middle line:84%
there are reports daily, if
not hourly of explosions.

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:59.990 align:middle line:90%
Now I live in a very nice city.

00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:04.030 align:middle line:84%
But they're coming in
constantly, did you hear that?

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:05.110 align:middle line:90%
That was an explosion.

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:06.450 align:middle line:90%
Did you hear that?

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And from the frequency that
this appears in the neighborhood

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:13.210 align:middle line:84%
watch app, and I
am not in any way

00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:17.290 align:middle line:84%
exaggerating how
often this happens,

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:20.930 align:middle line:84%
you would think we were
living in a war zone.

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:24.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't hear them,
but other people are.

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Is this an example of
portals and wormholes

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:33.310 align:middle line:84%
opening and closing that
are happening locally,

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:35.830 align:middle line:90%
and only a few people hear them?

00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: There are a couple
of different things going on

00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:37.890 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:40.590 align:middle line:84%
So there's also the mysterious
hum that a lot of people hear.

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:44.550 align:middle line:84%
I hear that where I live at in
Ohio and throughout the world,

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:46.502 align:middle line:84%
you have reports from
Wisconsin, from Ireland,

00:36:46.502 --> 00:36:47.710 align:middle line:90%
a lot of different locations.

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:51.843 align:middle line:84%
I hear the mysterious hum,
some droning that's going on.

00:36:51.843 --> 00:36:53.760 align:middle line:84%
Is the government doing
something underground?

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: The tower hum.

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:56.190 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah, exactly.

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And then, yes, you have
the phantom explosions.

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:03.910 align:middle line:84%
We talked about it earlier
that drone flap in New Jersey,

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:05.590 align:middle line:84%
which actually was
all over the world,

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:08.210 align:middle line:84%
wasn't just New Jersey,
although there were a lot there.

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:11.190 align:middle line:84%
There were reports of
phantom explosions as well.

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:13.683 align:middle line:84%
So you have balls of light,
drones, phantom explosions,

00:37:13.683 --> 00:37:15.350 align:middle line:84%
all these different
things are going on.

00:37:15.350 --> 00:37:17.267 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, those phantom
explosions could very well

00:37:17.267 --> 00:37:20.750 align:middle line:84%
be the expulsion of the
energy to open these portals.

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:22.770 align:middle line:84%
I had this happen
place that I lived

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:25.450 align:middle line:84%
at in Maryland for a while,
Pasadena, Maryland, just

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:26.770 align:middle line:90%
South of Baltimore.

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And we would just be sitting
out there on lawn chairs,

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:32.345 align:middle line:84%
enjoying the afternoon
or the evening,

00:37:32.345 --> 00:37:33.970 align:middle line:84%
you all of a sudden
hear this explosion

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:36.230 align:middle line:84%
and you're looking, what
in the world is going on?

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:38.850 align:middle line:84%
We used to joke around because
there was a little of a suspect

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:41.690 align:middle line:90%
house on the one corner.

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:43.570 align:middle line:84%
It was around the
time of Breaking Bad

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:45.190 align:middle line:90%
and we were just joking around.

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:48.710 align:middle line:84%
Oh yeah, they blew up a batch
of crack or something like that.

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:50.730 align:middle line:84%
It was the crack
house boom explosion.

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:54.090 align:middle line:84%
It blew up another batch
and that was just a joke.

00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:57.650 align:middle line:84%
But there was this one morning,
the bedroom was up on the second

00:37:57.650 --> 00:38:02.717 align:middle line:84%
floor, and it was just like
groggy time, 7:30, 8:00 AM,

00:38:02.717 --> 00:38:03.550 align:middle line:90%
something like this.

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, boom, there
was this massive explosion sound

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:10.170 align:middle line:84%
right outside the
bedroom window,

00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:13.230 align:middle line:84%
and there was a telephone pole
with a transformer out there.

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:15.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking a
transformer blew up.

00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:17.633 align:middle line:84%
It was that loud,
that explosive.

00:38:17.633 --> 00:38:19.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking power is
going to be out all day,

00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:20.530 align:middle line:90%
something happened.

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:22.850 align:middle line:84%
I take a look out the
window, at the transformer,

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:24.610 align:middle line:90%
it's perfectly fine.

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:27.350 align:middle line:84%
Power hasn't gone out, there are
a couple people down the street.

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:30.690 align:middle line:84%
They're looking up, looking
around, what the heck was that?

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:32.490 align:middle line:90%
Explosion out of nowhere.

00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Heard
it, didn't see it.

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER:
Didn't see a thing.

00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:38.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: What about
Earth cosmically

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:40.990 align:middle line:84%
being at the right
place at the right time,

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:45.560 align:middle line:84%
and maybe having the energy to
open up a wormhole or a portal?

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: And
that's a great question,

00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:50.590 align:middle line:84%
because the universe
is ever expanding.

00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:54.730 align:middle line:84%
So what sort of fields
are we experiencing

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:58.630 align:middle line:84%
as our planet is passing
through the greater universe?

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:02.170 align:middle line:84%
There are all interstellar
gases and these things

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:05.570 align:middle line:84%
that our solar system
would be interacting with.

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:09.090 align:middle line:84%
Astronomers are discovering more
and more interstellar objects

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:11.390 align:middle line:84%
that are coming into
our solar system.

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:13.530 align:middle line:84%
So that's a viable
question, is there

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:16.530 align:middle line:84%
something that we
might be running into

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:21.497 align:middle line:84%
to create more energy here on
Earth that we can't control?

00:39:21.497 --> 00:39:23.330 align:middle line:84%
It's totally out of our
control because it's

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:24.350 align:middle line:90%
the greater universe.

00:39:24.350 --> 00:39:26.430 align:middle line:84%
So that is something that
could certainly happen,

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:28.730 align:middle line:84%
different magnetized
particles that we're

00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:30.410 align:middle line:90%
interacting with for sure.

00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Could the
sun be a stargate?

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:34.370 align:middle line:90%
Could the sun be a portal?

00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:36.370 align:middle line:84%
There's been so many
reports of craft

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:40.050 align:middle line:84%
entering and exiting
the sun, but we don't

00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:42.670 align:middle line:90%
see them traveling to the sun.

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:48.330 align:middle line:84%
We only hear the reports
of these craft and things

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:51.310 align:middle line:84%
leaving and entering,
but nothing from there,

00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:52.507 align:middle line:90%
is that a possibility?

00:39:52.507 --> 00:39:54.590 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: It could
certainly be a possibility,

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:55.630 align:middle line:90%
hard to confirm.

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:58.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so much
energy coming out of the sun.

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting when did
a lot of my time travel work

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:07.370 align:middle line:84%
and a couple of
ideas for science,

00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:09.730 align:middle line:84%
the scientists have come
up with about how can we

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:11.030 align:middle line:90%
make time travel possible?

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:13.490 align:middle line:84%
One of the ideas was we
could build a machine

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:16.770 align:middle line:84%
and harness the power of the
sun into the machine, which

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:20.970 align:middle line:84%
would blow up the planet so
inadvisable, but we could do it.

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And so, yeah, it's possible
that energy from the sun

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:29.600 align:middle line:84%
like that going to it
could project us somewhere.

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:32.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I would
advise trying it though.

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: All of this
reminds me of one

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.520 align:middle line:84%
of my favorite personalities,
Ivan T. Sanderson

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:41.280 align:middle line:90%
and his vile vortices.

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.540 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: The vile vortices,
he was onto something there,

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:47.360 align:middle line:90%
absolutely.

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And he was a biologist
by trade, but he

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:55.560 align:middle line:84%
had a very, very firm interest
in the supernatural, organized

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:58.200 align:middle line:84%
one of the very first
supernatural paranormal

00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.467 align:middle line:90%
societies.

00:41:00.467 --> 00:41:02.800 align:middle line:84%
He really got inspired by all
the reports of the Bermuda

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:05.592 align:middle line:84%
Triangle and started looking
more and more and more

00:41:05.592 --> 00:41:08.300 align:middle line:84%
to this strange phenomena of the
Bermuda Triangle and discovered,

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:10.200 align:middle line:84%
wait a minute, there
are other locations

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.460 align:middle line:90%
around the globe that have this.

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:17.143 align:middle line:84%
And so he came up with
his 12 vile vortices,

00:41:17.143 --> 00:41:18.560 align:middle line:84%
well, he had five
along the Tropic

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:20.860 align:middle line:84%
of Cancer, the other along
the Tropic of Capricorn,

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:22.820 align:middle line:90%
and then North and South Pole.

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And what's great about that
and really fascinating,

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:27.660 align:middle line:84%
is if you connect all the
dots throughout the globe,

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:31.220 align:middle line:84%
it creates a perfect
icosagon, a 20-sided polygon.

00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:33.640 align:middle line:84%
So here you have
some sacred geometry.

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And I say he was on to something
because it doesn't just

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:38.020 align:middle line:90%
stop at the vile vortices.

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:41.000 align:middle line:84%
It includes the Bermuda
Triangle, the Dragon Triangle,

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.700 align:middle line:84%
some of these other really
hotspot areas across the globe,

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:46.020 align:middle line:84%
but it excludes a
lot of other ones.

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:49.080 align:middle line:84%
We know of a lot of
the phenomena happening

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:53.180 align:middle line:84%
around the American Southwest,
Sedona and throughout that,

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:55.840 align:middle line:84%
of course, the Alaska Triangle,
many, many other locations

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:58.700 align:middle line:84%
across the world that the
vortices don't include.

00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:04.360 align:middle line:84%
So I think Sanderson's research
was one of those stepping blocks

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:05.568 align:middle line:90%
to get to where we are today.

00:42:05.568 --> 00:42:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And the research
that we're doing now

00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:09.320 align:middle line:84%
is another stepping stone
to whatever they're going

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:12.480 align:middle line:90%
to discover 50 years from now.

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: We don't have
to necessarily look

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:19.640 align:middle line:84%
at the Bermuda Triangle
or other stuff that has

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.640 align:middle line:90%
been spoken about in the past.

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:24.920 align:middle line:84%
We have the MH370
disappearance that

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:27.720 align:middle line:84%
happened in real
time for everybody

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:31.440 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, a plane
that is still not located.

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:34.960 align:middle line:84%
When I bring that up and we
talk about the possibilities

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:39.280 align:middle line:84%
of portals or stargates
or vortices and vortexes,

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:44.120 align:middle line:84%
this is in the modern age
of GPS and geolocation

00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:49.800 align:middle line:84%
and a modern airliner,
radar systems tracked

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:53.840 align:middle line:84%
from when it took off
to just vanishing,

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:55.580 align:middle line:90%
seemingly over the ocean.

00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:59.920 align:middle line:84%
When all of this should have
been tracked in real time,

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:02.098 align:middle line:84%
and we still lost the
plane and it's still gone.

00:43:02.098 --> 00:43:03.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah,
and that actually

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:07.080 align:middle line:84%
wasn't too far from one of
Sanderson's vile vortices.

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:09.160 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and it is
fascinating that we

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:12.400 align:middle line:84%
have all this modern
technology, satellites, GPS,

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:15.560 align:middle line:84%
all these things and yet
we still lose airplanes,

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:17.420 align:middle line:90%
just vanish out of nowhere.

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:18.580 align:middle line:90%
Still happens in Alaska.

00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:22.100 align:middle line:84%
It is different these
days than say in 1950.

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And you lose a Douglas
Skymaster up there in Alaska,

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:26.980 align:middle line:84%
and the last thing he had
was a radio communication.

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:28.938 align:middle line:84%
And now you're searching
around the whole area,

00:43:28.938 --> 00:43:30.920 align:middle line:84%
and we do suspect that
it may have disappeared

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:32.560 align:middle line:90%
through some portal.

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:37.740 align:middle line:84%
But there are too many questions
that you have to, OK, maybe.

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:42.400 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, with
Malaysia 370, there's

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.800 align:middle line:84%
too much modern technology
these days at our disposal

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:46.380 align:middle line:84%
that we shouldn't
have lost that.

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: I'm not pointing
fingers at anybody or anything

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:55.680 align:middle line:84%
specific there, but when
you have an engine, a jet

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:59.200 align:middle line:84%
engine, and a leased
aircraft and you

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:03.520 align:middle line:84%
have the telemetry,
real time monitoring

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:07.680 align:middle line:84%
all of the systems on that
plane because it's leased,

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:10.586 align:middle line:90%
it's covered under warranty.

00:44:10.586 --> 00:44:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And all of this is being
monitored in real time.

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, that telemetry
and that data collection

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:21.240 align:middle line:84%
just stops with the
amount of satellites

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:27.720 align:middle line:84%
that we have up to do just that,
it doesn't explain anything

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:32.540 align:middle line:84%
at all to just say, we don't
know, it just disappeared.

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:35.760 align:middle line:84%
It was in a section of
ocean that we don't cover.

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:39.900 align:middle line:84%
We cover every square
inch of planet Earth,

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:42.500 align:middle line:84%
but yet that plane
managed to disappear.

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:45.120 align:middle line:10%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah,
and if there was--

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:48.280 align:middle line:10%
something faulty was going on
in the plane, the communication

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:51.120 align:middle line:10%
from the plane back to
air traffic control, just

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:56.360 align:middle line:10%
the automatic stuff, not just
the pilots radioing things in,

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:59.612 align:middle line:10%
that data would have been sent
to air traffic control to,

00:44:59.612 --> 00:45:03.260 align:middle line:10%
OK, we're losing altitude,
none of that happened.

00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:05.108 align:middle line:90%
It's just gone.

00:45:05.108 --> 00:45:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Mike, another
fascinating conversation, and I

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:10.160 align:middle line:84%
look forward to the next
