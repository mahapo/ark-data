00:00:19.071 --> 00:00:21.400 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief," I'm

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.200 align:middle line:10%
George Noory.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.380 align:middle line:10%
We have a very different
program for you today,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.610 align:middle line:10%
and you will enjoy it.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.600 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Garrett Lisi with us, a
physicist who kind of went down

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.820 align:middle line:10%
the other path, and
we're going to explain

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.930 align:middle line:10%
why in just a moment.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.700 align:middle line:84%
Garrett, welcome
to "Beyond Belief".

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GARRETT LISI:
Thank you George.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.090 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This path
that you have chosen

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.580 align:middle line:84%
to go down, as
Robert Frost would

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.340 align:middle line:84%
write, "two roads
diverged in a yellow wood.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.200 align:middle line:90%
I took the one less traveled by.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.250 align:middle line:84%
That has made all
the difference."

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.650 align:middle line:90%
I think you took that path.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.820 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Indeed, it has
made all the difference.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.400 align:middle line:10%
It was back in graduate
school in theoretical physics

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.530 align:middle line:10%
that I was really loving
general relativity and particle

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.330 align:middle line:10%
physics.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.585 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
what I was learning

00:01:03.585 --> 00:01:06.474 align:middle line:84%
in particle physics wasn't
geometric the same way what

00:01:06.474 --> 00:01:07.890 align:middle line:84%
I was in general
relativity, which

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.810 align:middle line:84%
is Einstein's theory of
gravity, was geometric.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And I knew there had to be
some geometric theory that

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.350 align:middle line:84%
would also describe
particle physics,

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.240 align:middle line:84%
but nobody seemed interested
in answering that problem.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.210 align:middle line:90%
They didn't see it as a problem.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.250 align:middle line:84%
But clearly the universe
is just one thing.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's right there
in the name, universe.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.100 align:middle line:84%
So I set about trying to look
for a geometric description

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.450 align:middle line:90%
of elementary particles.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.565 align:middle line:84%
And the most popular one at
the time was in string theory.

00:01:33.565 --> 00:01:34.440 align:middle line:90%
The whole community--

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.231 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Michio Kaku's
theories too, right?

00:01:36.231 --> 00:01:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Yes, very much
involved in that theory.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And the whole physics community
in high-energy theoretical

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.454 align:middle line:84%
physics was going into
string-theory research,

00:01:43.454 --> 00:01:45.120 align:middle line:84%
and they were trying
to pull me into it.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And I took a couple
of courses in it.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.980 align:middle line:84%
But the more I looked into
string theory, the more

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.360 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't believe that
was the right way to go.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.390 align:middle line:84%
I thought they had made a bunch
of unjustified assumptions.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you
didn't believe in it.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.210 align:middle line:90%
You didn't accept it.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: That's right.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.220 align:middle line:84%
I was very skeptical
of string theory.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.303 align:middle line:84%
I thought they were making
unjustified assumptions

00:02:01.303 --> 00:02:03.330 align:middle line:84%
and they were overconfident
in the theory.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And are you still?

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.055 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Yes, I still felt that
way even more strongly now

00:02:07.055 --> 00:02:10.580 align:middle line:84%
because it's 20 years
later and the predictions

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.080 align:middle line:84%
they were hoping for-- they
were hoping for super particles.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.280 align:middle line:84%
They were hoping for
some stringification--

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hasn't happened yet.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.324 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: --has not happened.

00:02:16.324 --> 00:02:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And so they're getting
more and more desperate

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.640 align:middle line:90%
whereas I'm getting happier.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You may be
the one who was right.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.825 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: At least I
wasn't as wrong perhaps,

00:02:24.825 --> 00:02:26.515 align:middle line:90%
which in physics is important.

00:02:26.515 --> 00:02:27.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.210 align:middle line:84%
What is the big
difference between what

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.900 align:middle line:84%
you were going after and what
they've been going after?

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Well, essentially we
are going after the same thing.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.920 align:middle line:84%
We're going after a
mathematical description

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.280 align:middle line:84%
of the fundamental nature
of our universe, all right?

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.310 align:middle line:84%
It's just we're coming about
it from different perspectives.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.985 align:middle line:84%
They were coming at it
from a model of, well,

00:02:46.985 --> 00:02:49.110 align:middle line:84%
we can solve these problems
in quantum-field theory

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.710 align:middle line:84%
by having extended particles,
have them be strings

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.570 align:middle line:90%
instead of point particles.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And by having vibrations
of those strings

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.850 align:middle line:84%
in various shapes,
various dimensions,

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.280 align:middle line:84%
we can reproduce the properties
of the known particles.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.970 align:middle line:90%
So that's the string model.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And they can also reproduce
string's description

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.104 align:middle line:90%
of gravity.

00:03:10.104 --> 00:03:12.270 align:middle line:84%
But I was coming at it from
a different perspective.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.853 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at, OK, we already
have a very successful theory

00:03:14.853 --> 00:03:16.770 align:middle line:84%
of particle physics and
quantum-field theory,

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.780 align:middle line:84%
and we have a very
successful theory of gravity

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.040 align:middle line:90%
in general relativity.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.590 align:middle line:84%
What's the most
minimal possible way

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.890 align:middle line:84%
without doing any other damage
to the conceptual framework

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.110 align:middle line:90%
to combine the two?

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And the geometry
of particle physics

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.005 align:middle line:84%
is wrapped up in these
geometric objects called

00:03:33.005 --> 00:03:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Lie groups which are these
high-dimensional twisting

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:36.854 align:middle line:90%
surfaces.

00:03:36.854 --> 00:03:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And you can also describe
gravity during Lie groups.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.430 align:middle line:84%
So it was when I brought those
two together in a way that

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.800 align:middle line:84%
was copacetic, they
actually matched up

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.110 align:middle line:84%
in this very beautiful
mathematical structure

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.400 align:middle line:84%
that mathematicians are quite
fond of called the E8 Lie

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.530 align:middle line:90%
group.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Science
Channel talked a little bit

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.580 align:middle line:84%
about your life, so let's
take a look at that.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MORGAN FREEMAN: 400 years ago
the great astronomer Galileo

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.240 align:middle line:84%
Galilee had a
groundbreaking insight--

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.920 align:middle line:84%
nature's grand book is written
in the language of mathematics.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.460 align:middle line:84%
From that time to this,
scientific geniuses

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.160 align:middle line:84%
like Newton and
Einstein used math

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.010 align:middle line:84%
to dig deep into the
working of nature.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.505 align:middle line:84%
The latest mind hoping to
join these illustrious ranks

00:04:20.505 --> 00:04:22.590 align:middle line:90%
is Garrett Lisi.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: The universe
can very successfully

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.000 align:middle line:90%
be described mathematically.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.430 align:middle line:84%
You have to imagine
how the world's working

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.380 align:middle line:84%
in certain
circumstances and then

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.990 align:middle line:84%
use reason and mathematics to
develop a description of how

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.990 align:middle line:90%
that might be happening.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.834 align:middle line:84%
But it's imagination that breaks
a trail before reason enters.

00:04:41.834 --> 00:04:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>>FREEMAN: After
earning his PhD,

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Garrett escaped the confines of
academia in search of adventure

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.290 align:middle line:90%
and a space in which to think.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Rather than go into
a normal academic-track job,

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.170 align:middle line:84%
I just split off for
Maui, became a surf bum,

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.830 align:middle line:84%
and did the research
I wanted to.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.818 align:middle line:84%
Mostly spent time doing
physics research and surfing.

00:05:03.818 --> 00:05:07.860 align:middle line:90%


00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting
life Garrett.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Yeah, I pretty much
BASE jumped off the ivory tower.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just about.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: Yeah.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.410 align:middle line:84%
I was doing quite well in
school all the way through it.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.140 align:middle line:90%
I got my PhD.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And instead of going
to get a postdoc--

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.960 align:middle line:84%
the only postdocs available were
in string theory at the time,

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.030 align:middle line:84%
and I wasn't interested
in going that way.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.110 align:middle line:84%
So I had saved up some
money during graduate school

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.490 align:middle line:90%
by investing.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.470 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't spending very much.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And so I was to a postdoc--
used to a graduate-student

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:35.800 align:middle line:90%
lifestyle.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.260 align:middle line:84%
So I took off for Maui
and became a surf bum,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.900 align:middle line:84%
learned to windsurf, and worked
on the physics I wanted to.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.890 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of a crazy
decision to make,

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:44.400 align:middle line:90%
but it has gone really well.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.775 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well I
was going to say,

00:05:45.775 --> 00:05:47.230 align:middle line:90%
you somehow combined both--

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:48.730 align:middle line:84%
and we'll get into
that a little bit

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.000 align:middle line:84%
later on-- because it
worked for you, didn't it?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: I got really lucky.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.841 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
else to describe it.

00:05:54.841 --> 00:05:57.070 align:middle line:84%
I seem to have gotten
lucky my whole life

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.160 align:middle line:84%
both with my investments,
with my research in physics.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.319 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard not to
get lucky when you're

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:03.610 align:middle line:90%
spending a lot of time surfing.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As a physicist today,
what are you looking for?

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.180 align:middle line:84%
What answers are
you trying to seek?

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Well, the whole
reason I got into physics

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.440 align:middle line:84%
is to figure out
what this universe is

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.870 align:middle line:90%
that we're in, fundamentally.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And when I found
out as a young man

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.760 align:middle line:84%
that the mathematics I
was learning and really

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.040 align:middle line:84%
enjoying in an
abstract way actually

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.020 align:middle line:84%
applies to describe
how our universe

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.880 align:middle line:84%
functions, on a very
deep level it was just

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.320 align:middle line:90%
intoxicating and addicting.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And I just became obsessed
with the puzzle of figuring out

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.730 align:middle line:84%
how our universe
works mathematically

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:38.530 align:middle line:90%
and fundamentally.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
I'm going to ask

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.540 align:middle line:84%
you some nonphysics-type
questions

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.600 align:middle line:84%
because we're not physicists
and most of us watching

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.960 align:middle line:84%
aren't, but maybe you can
explain it to us in terms

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.580 align:middle line:90%
that we would understand.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.750 align:middle line:90%
What the heck is the Big Bang?

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.810 align:middle line:84%
Haven't found one
explanation yet in the years

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:01.360 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing "Coast to
Coast" and "Beyond Belief",

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.730 align:middle line:84%
I have not gotten
one explanation

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.140 align:middle line:90%
that makes sense to me.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: All right,
well, I'll do my best.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.630 align:middle line:84%
I can start out by
telling you what it isn't.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.240 align:middle line:84%
The Big Bang is not
an explosion of matter

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.750 align:middle line:90%
from a point in space.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:18.580 align:middle line:84%
What the Big Bang is is we
look out into the cosmos

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:23.390 align:middle line:84%
and we see distant galaxies
moving away from us.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And not only are they
moving away from us

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.270 align:middle line:84%
but they're moving away from
us at an accelerating rate.

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Aren't we
moving with them?

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:30.853 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: We're also moving.

00:07:30.853 --> 00:07:36.020 align:middle line:84%
So it's as if everything
is moving away from itself.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.510 align:middle line:84%
So the entire
universe is expanding,

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:40.680 align:middle line:84%
and that expansion
is accelerating.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.220 align:middle line:84%
So the main idea of
the Big Bang is, well,

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.400 align:middle line:90%
if you look back in time--

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If it was going out.

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: --if it's
going out now--

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.606 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then somehow
it came in, right?

00:07:50.606 --> 00:07:52.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Right, then
we know it came

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.772 align:middle line:84%
from all being very
compressed and hot together.

00:07:55.772 --> 00:07:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Logic
would tell you that.

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:57.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: Yes.

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:58.530 align:middle line:90%
And it's not just logic.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:00.900 align:middle line:84%
We also have Einstein's
theory of general relativity,

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.360 align:middle line:90%
which describes gravity.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And Einstein describes
this expanding universe

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:11.600 align:middle line:84%
as an expanding fabric
of space itself.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.830 align:middle line:90%
And it looks like--

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're not
at the center of it

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.430 align:middle line:90%
because there is no center.

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.760 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it appears to be
an infinitely flat expanse

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.700 align:middle line:84%
of space that is
expanding, and our place

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.360 align:middle line:84%
in it of the Milky Way
is not at all special.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.790 align:middle line:84%
But since it's the
space itself that

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.980 align:middle line:84%
seems to be expanding,
from our perspective

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.070 align:middle line:84%
it just looks like everything
is expanding away from us.

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:37.640 align:middle line:84%
But if you go back in time
about 14 billion years,

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.900 align:middle line:84%
then it all looks like
everything was extremely close

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:40.700 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
call the Big Bang.

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:42.289 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do
you think it was?

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:43.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: Yes.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the evidence for Big
Bang now is incontrovertible.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What causes
the expansion?

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Well, so matter
itself gravitates.

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.480 align:middle line:84%
So you would think matter
would bring everything back in.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And 50 years ago the
predominant theory

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:00.590 align:middle line:84%
was that we had
a closed universe

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:03.290 align:middle line:84%
where there was some
initial expansion

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:07.220 align:middle line:84%
but that the gravitational pull
would pull everything back in.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:12.080 align:middle line:84%
But we looked out into space
and only about 15 years ago

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.140 align:middle line:84%
discovered that not only is
matter not putting itself back

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:19.130 align:middle line:84%
in but it's actually
accelerating out faster.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:20.180 align:middle line:90%
And that was a shock.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How far out can it go?

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: There's
no limit, George.

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:25.240 align:middle line:90%
So it can expand out forever.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's what's
so bizarre to me.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:27.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Right,
there are infinities

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:29.810 align:middle line:90%
all over our universe.

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:33.650 align:middle line:84%
It looks like our universe
will expand out forever in time

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:35.329 align:middle line:90%
and forever in space.

00:09:35.329 --> 00:09:37.120 align:middle line:84%
As far as we can tell,
this is how it work.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And newer systems
are being created and born,

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:42.470 align:middle line:90%
new star systems--

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: New star systems--

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:43.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --new solar systems?

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:44.511 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: --are being born.

00:09:44.511 --> 00:09:47.300 align:middle line:84%
However with this
expansion, as these stars

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:52.850 align:middle line:84%
are born they burn hydrogen.
They fuse hydrogen and helium.

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the nuclear
fuel that fuels our sun

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:57.820 align:middle line:90%
comes from and other stars.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:58.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They'll
burn out one day.

00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: They'll burn out.

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:00.260 align:middle line:90%
So they burn out.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:01.160 align:middle line:90%
They go supernova.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.240 align:middle line:90%
They form other stars.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.440 align:middle line:90%
Those burn out.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.634 align:middle line:90%
They form black holes.

00:10:05.634 --> 00:10:06.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: When they burn out.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: After they burn out,
they attract gravitationally.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.547 align:middle line:84%
Within galaxies, we'll
have giant black holes

00:10:12.547 --> 00:10:13.505 align:middle line:90%
formed within galaxies.

00:10:13.505 --> 00:10:15.046 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Basically
they're sucked in.

00:10:15.046 --> 00:10:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Yep, but
then those radiate.

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:19.850 align:middle line:84%
So Hawking figured out
that black holes actually

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:21.740 align:middle line:90%
emit radiation.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.750 align:middle line:84%
That radiation goes out into the
universe and then just expands.

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:27.380 align:middle line:84%
So that all that matter that
was sucked into the black hole

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.727 align:middle line:84%
goes away and you just
have radiation coming out.

00:10:29.727 --> 00:10:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And that happens
everywhere in the universe.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.890 align:middle line:84%
So if you go down the line
trillions and trillions

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:36.320 align:middle line:84%
of years, you have
nothing in the universe

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.430 align:middle line:84%
but dark blackness, and
that's all there is.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:39.680 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing else going on.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.596 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hawking also
says though the universe

00:10:41.596 --> 00:10:42.560 align:middle line:90%
is going to burn out.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: This is what
it means to burn out.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.746 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, there
will be nothing left,

00:10:45.746 --> 00:10:47.473 align:middle line:90%
total darkness one day.

00:10:47.473 --> 00:10:51.191 align:middle line:84%
The last star, the last
person, shut the light off.

00:10:51.191 --> 00:10:52.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Yeah, that's
exactly what happens.

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:54.440 align:middle line:90%
So this is our future.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.730 align:middle line:90%
It's not a very bright future.

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:59.300 align:middle line:84%
But trillions and trillions of
years, that's a lot of time--

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like dead universe.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.422 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: That's where things are
heading, yes, I'm afraid so.

00:11:03.422 --> 00:11:04.880 align:middle line:84%
That's what our
cosmology tells us.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But other ones are
being born, other universes?

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:09.740 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe in the
multiverse theory?

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: I don't
believe in anything.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean as a physicist, I have
degrees of belief in things.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.950 align:middle line:90%
So you flip a coin.

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:21.440 align:middle line:84%
So you flip a coin
and you look at it

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.600 align:middle line:84%
and before you
remove your hand you

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.640 align:middle line:84%
have some confidence
that it's heads or tails.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And you have to have a
50% likelihood of each

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.990 align:middle line:90%
if you have a reasonable coin.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.182 align:middle line:84%
You also have to have the
likelihood that, look,

00:11:32.182 --> 00:11:33.390 align:middle line:90%
there's no coin there at all.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.560 align:middle line:84%
There's also always
the weird option.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.340 align:middle line:84%
But for the most
part, as a physicist,

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.450 align:middle line:84%
you have degrees of
belief in things.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I don't
have a high degree

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.950 align:middle line:84%
of belief in other
universes being

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:49.550 align:middle line:84%
born because we don't have good
mathematical models for it.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Philosophically, it's
not a terrible idea.

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:54.512 align:middle line:84%
But scientifically, it
doesn't have a lot of content.

00:11:54.512 --> 00:11:55.970 align:middle line:84%
We can't test it
one way or another

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:59.050 align:middle line:84%
since we can only do
tests in this universe.

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's borderline
whether it's even science

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.930 align:middle line:84%
to consider instances
of other universes.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:04.644 align:middle line:84%
But as a philosophical
idea, it's

00:12:04.644 --> 00:12:06.060 align:middle line:84%
certainly interesting
to consider.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well how in the
world, Garrett, did it start?

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:11.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: Well, if you go back--

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we bringing
God into the equation here?

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: If by we you mean
the royal we of you--

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:16.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You and me--

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:17.720 align:middle line:90%
you and me.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: --then you
can, but I'm not.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not, OK.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.360 align:middle line:90%
We'll get into that--

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: We can get into that.

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:23.055 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --in a moment too.

00:12:23.055 --> 00:12:24.180 align:middle line:90%
But in your opinion--

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: In my personal opinion--

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:25.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --how did it start?

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:26.970 align:middle line:90%
I mean, my god.

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Yeah, and it's
funny, you fall back

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.320 align:middle line:90%
to using my god as the answer.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's an
easy solution, right?

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.670 align:middle line:90%
You blame it on god.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:36.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: Right, god did it.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.090 align:middle line:84%
It's always the easiest
solution until you have

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:40.530 align:middle line:90%
to explain where she came from.

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:44.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
right, or he, or it.

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: So if you follow the
expansion of the universe

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.340 align:middle line:84%
and you go back in
time 14 trillion years

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:55.260 align:middle line:84%
or so to where it was very
hot, it's not impossible

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.830 align:middle line:84%
that you can just keep going
back in time before the Big

00:12:58.830 --> 00:12:59.850 align:middle line:90%
Bang.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually have
models for our universe

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:06.270 align:middle line:84%
where it expands
indefinitely forever in time.

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
what you think.

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: I personally
hold that opinion.

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:10.758 align:middle line:84%
I have a higher degree
of belief in that.

00:13:10.758 --> 00:13:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But that still
doesn't explain how it started.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.267 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: It wouldn't
have had a beginning.

00:13:16.267 --> 00:13:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everything
needs a beginning.

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:19.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: That's because
we're used to existing

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:20.580 align:middle line:90%
in this flow of time.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.510 align:middle line:84%
We're used to our
personal flow of time.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:23.310 align:middle line:90%
We're born.

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:24.070 align:middle line:90%
Things happen.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:24.870 align:middle line:90%
We see that.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:27.609 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yes, I'm thinking in
very logical stages of time.

00:13:27.609 --> 00:13:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Well, in this
model of the universe

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.660 align:middle line:84%
there always would
have been a before.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:32.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So you're saying--

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.123 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Whatever there is,
there would have been a

00:13:34.123 --> 00:13:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --that whatever
happened to the expansion,

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.490 align:middle line:90%
it was there.

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:42.020 align:middle line:90%
It was always there.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:44.064 align:middle line:90%
But how did it get there?

00:13:44.064 --> 00:13:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Well, this
is the question

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.440 align:middle line:90%
of what is the universe?

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.840 align:middle line:84%
So if you consider that time
extended forever before the Big

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:56.490 align:middle line:84%
Bang and it will extend
forever into our future,

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:59.280 align:middle line:84%
then you can look at this
as a whole in spacetime

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.435 align:middle line:90%
as one whole thing in spacetime.

00:14:03.435 --> 00:14:06.360 align:middle line:84%
The name of this is called
the block universe model.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.650 align:middle line:90%
You look at it as a whole.

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:10.200 align:middle line:84%
Now if you look at
this as a whole,

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:14.064 align:middle line:84%
it looks like a
four-dimensional hyperbola

00:14:14.064 --> 00:14:15.980 align:middle line:84%
where you have something
expanding for forever

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.250 align:middle line:84%
and then out like a
giant expanding horn.

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:20.000 align:middle line:84%
It looks like a
four-dimensional hyperbola

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.180 align:middle line:84%
where our spatial slices
are flat but expanding.

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.670 align:middle line:84%
So it looks sort of
like a big giant horn

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:28.250 align:middle line:84%
in four dimensions-- of
four-dimensional space,

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:29.760 align:middle line:90%
not in four dimensions.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:34.460 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at this,
this is a familiar geometry.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.620 align:middle line:84%
It goes by the
name of someone who

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.030 align:middle line:90%
described it named de Sitter.

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.400 align:middle line:90%
So it's a de Sitter spacetime.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out a
de Sitter spacetime

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:45.950 align:middle line:84%
can be described as a
four-dimensional surface

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:50.380 align:middle line:84%
inside a larger mathematical
geometry called a Lie group.

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:51.760 align:middle line:84%
So you can describe
this geometry

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.656 align:middle line:90%
inside other geometries.

00:14:53.656 --> 00:14:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
same geometries

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:56.830 align:middle line:84%
that are used to describe
particle physics.

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:59.500 align:middle line:84%
If we model it this
way, we can see

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.050 align:middle line:84%
our cosmological,
four-dimensional spacetime

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:07.280 align:middle line:84%
universe as existing inside
a Lie group that is excited,

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.080 align:middle line:90%
that's deforming.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:12.400 align:middle line:84%
The idea is you have to start
with some ultimate object.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.540 align:middle line:90%
So there has to be something.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:20.770 align:middle line:84%
So to start with something--
it's very satisfying to me

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:24.340 align:middle line:84%
to start with the most
beautiful mathematical geometric

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.980 align:middle line:90%
structure you can consider.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.450 align:middle line:84%
It's this
high-dimensional, twisting,

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:33.430 align:middle line:84%
very intricately twisted knot
of beautiful, high-dimensional

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:35.350 align:middle line:90%
geometry.

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And then see that inside that
are all the subgeometries

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:42.520 align:middle line:84%
we need to describe
particle physics

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.820 align:middle line:84%
and to embed our
four-dimensional universe.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And then if that
somehow got excited

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:51.100 align:middle line:84%
in a quantum-mechanical
way, then we

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:54.680 align:middle line:84%
could see all the interactions
happening that we see around us

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:55.480 align:middle line:90%
in our universe.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.910 align:middle line:84%
We can model that, but we
have to start with something.

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:01.300 align:middle line:84%
So for me, philosophically,
it's more satisfying--

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:04.870 align:middle line:84%
I have a higher degree of belief
that our universe fundamentally

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:07.660 align:middle line:84%
is a very beautiful
high-dimensional geometric

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:10.119 align:middle line:84%
object that has become excited
in a quantum-mechanical way.

00:16:10.119 --> 00:16:10.993 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:16:10.993 --> 00:16:12.835 align:middle line:84%
10 years ago you spoke
at a TED conference.

00:16:12.835 --> 00:16:15.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: Yes.

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:18.850 align:middle line:84%
This particular pattern of
charges in eight dimensions

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:21.400 align:middle line:84%
is actually part of the most
beautiful geometric structure

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.560 align:middle line:90%
in mathematics.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:27.550 align:middle line:84%
It's a pattern of the largest
exceptional Lie group E8.

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:29.590 align:middle line:10%
This Lie group is a
smooth curved shape

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:31.570 align:middle line:10%
with 248 dimensions.

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.850 align:middle line:84%
Each point in this
pattern corresponds

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:37.540 align:middle line:84%
to a symmetry of this very
complex and beautiful shape.

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.610 align:middle line:84%
One small part of
this E8 shape can

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:41.890 align:middle line:84%
be used to describe the
curved spacetime of Einstein's

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:45.010 align:middle line:84%
general relativity,
explaining gravity.

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:47.741 align:middle line:84%
Together with quantum mechanics,
the geometry of this shape

00:16:47.741 --> 00:16:49.990 align:middle line:84%
could describe everything
about how the universe works

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:51.720 align:middle line:90%
at the tiniest scales.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.920 align:middle line:10%
And the pattern of
the shape, living

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.140 align:middle line:10%
in eight-dimensional
charge space,

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.840 align:middle line:10%
is exquisitely beautiful.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And it summarizes thousands
of possible interactions

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.071 align:middle line:84%
between these elementary
particles, each of which

00:17:03.071 --> 00:17:07.026 align:middle line:84%
is just a facet of
this complicated shape.

00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:09.609 align:middle line:10%
As we spin it, we can see many
of the other intricate patterns

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:12.838 align:middle line:10%
contained in this one.

00:17:12.838 --> 00:17:15.094 align:middle line:10%
And with a, particular
rotation, we

00:17:15.094 --> 00:17:16.510 align:middle line:10%
can look down
through this pattern

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:19.300 align:middle line:10%
in eight dimensions
along our symmetry axis

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.130 align:middle line:10%
and see all the
particles at once.

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:22.750 align:middle line:10%
It's a very beautiful object.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:26.079 align:middle line:10%
And, as with any unification,
we can see some holes

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:29.680 align:middle line:10%
where new particles are
required by this pattern.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.380 align:middle line:10%
There are 20 gaps when
new particles should be,

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:35.140 align:middle line:10%
two of which have been filled
by the [INAUDIBLE] particles.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.086 align:middle line:10%
From their location
in this pattern,

00:17:37.086 --> 00:17:39.460 align:middle line:10%
we know that these new particles
should be scalar fields,

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:42.250 align:middle line:10%
like the Higgs particle, but
have color charge and interact

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:43.990 align:middle line:10%
with the strong force.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:46.300 align:middle line:10%
Filling in these new particles
completes this pattern,

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:47.980 align:middle line:10%
giving us the full E8.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.710 align:middle line:10%
This E8 pattern has very
deep mathematical roots,

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:53.440 align:middle line:10%
and it's considered by many to
be the most beautiful structure

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.090 align:middle line:10%
in mathematics.

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:57.490 align:middle line:84%
It's a fantastic
prospect that this object

00:17:57.490 --> 00:17:59.727 align:middle line:84%
of great mathematical
beauty could describe

00:17:59.727 --> 00:18:01.810 align:middle line:84%
the truth of particle
interactions at the smallest

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:03.160 align:middle line:90%
scales imaginable.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, so that
was an interesting portion

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:07.450 align:middle line:90%
of your entire TED talk.

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:09.890 align:middle line:90%
What did that mean?

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Well, the
meaning to me is

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:16.270 align:middle line:84%
that, ultimately, elementary
particle physics comes down

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:17.590 align:middle line:90%
to geometry.

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's all beautiful
mathematical geometry

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.370 align:middle line:84%
behind elementary particles
and their interactions,

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:25.840 align:middle line:84%
including gravitational
interactions between particles.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.530 align:middle line:84%
So for me, this is very
inspiring philosophically

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:31.420 align:middle line:84%
because I like the
idea that we live

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:34.600 align:middle line:84%
in this very intricate,
elegant, beautiful universe.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.614 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We do.

00:18:35.614 --> 00:18:36.780 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt about that.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: And it's the
chaos of interactions

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.520 align:middle line:84%
between the myriad
of particles that

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.970 align:middle line:84%
produce life and nature and
everything we see around us.

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't think God
had anything to do with that?

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Well, if you're going
to go back and think of some

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:56.920 align:middle line:84%
supernatural entity that
would bring everything

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.540 align:middle line:90%
into existence--

00:18:58.540 --> 00:18:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can you accept that?

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: Can I accept it?

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:02.860 align:middle line:90%
I can consider it as a model.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you?

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:05.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: The closest
thing I can come

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:09.850 align:middle line:84%
to that is that it would
be that we would actually

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:11.809 align:middle line:90%
be in a simulated universe.

00:19:11.809 --> 00:19:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
some people think that.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.183 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Some people think that,
and that's not an unreasonable

00:19:16.183 --> 00:19:19.060 align:middle line:84%
thing to consider,
and that something

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.490 align:middle line:84%
that we might primitively
have considered

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:24.460 align:middle line:84%
as a supreme being might be
someone or something running

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.200 align:middle line:90%
the simulation.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:30.280 align:middle line:84%
However, when we go back
and look throughout history

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.610 align:middle line:84%
and our current
investigations into science,

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:37.690 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing at all
that strays significantly

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:42.110 align:middle line:84%
from what we know scientifically
how the universe should behave.

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:46.120 align:middle line:84%
So right now we have scientific
models for elementary particles

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:49.090 align:middle line:84%
down to enormously
small scales, and we

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:52.560 align:middle line:84%
have models for the cosmos up
to enormously large scales,

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.977 align:middle line:84%
and we know
everything in between.

00:19:53.977 --> 00:19:56.310 align:middle line:84%
We know everything that can
happen in between physically

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:57.190 align:middle line:90%
and scientifically.

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:59.380 align:middle line:90%
We know what can happen.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And nowhere in there is anything
where, and then the hand of God

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:05.852 align:middle line:84%
comes in and twiddles this
and that made this happen.

00:20:05.852 --> 00:20:07.310 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing in
there like that.

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:10.660 align:middle line:84%
It's always, these were the
forces, this was the balance,

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:12.970 align:middle line:84%
this was the acceleration
of the particle out,

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:15.040 align:middle line:84%
these were the force
fields in place,

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.710 align:middle line:84%
and all this describes
everything that happens,

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:18.760 align:middle line:90%
absolutely everything.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:22.720 align:middle line:84%
We see the grandeur
of nature come out

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:26.170 align:middle line:84%
from the interactions of all
these fairly primitive pieces,

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:27.460 align:middle line:90%
but we see it emerge.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.440 align:middle line:84%
This is the magic of emergence
in our universe as we--

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did get
so much order, Garrett?

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:34.280 align:middle line:90%
Because it is order.

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.670 align:middle line:84%
There's no randomness
here at all.

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:38.650 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: We started out with
a very ordered beginning.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And things interact and
self-interact, and quantum

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:50.660 align:middle line:84%
mechanically it spreads
into all possibilities.

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:53.180 align:middle line:84%
So if you interpret quantum
mechanics in the simplest

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:56.210 align:middle line:84%
possible way, it tells
us that we started out

00:20:56.210 --> 00:21:00.260 align:middle line:84%
with an ordered universe
that got excited.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And then from that
excited state it

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:04.700 align:middle line:84%
expanded into all
possible interactions

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:07.520 align:middle line:84%
of all these existing particles
and all new particles that

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:12.140 align:middle line:84%
could pop into existence so
that all universes are happening

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:13.814 align:middle line:90%
quantum mechanically.

00:21:13.814 --> 00:21:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And we find ourselves
in this one.

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:17.406 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is
it so difficult--

00:21:17.406 --> 00:21:20.000 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not singling
you out, by any means--

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.530 align:middle line:84%
but why is it so difficult
for scientists to accept

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:29.150 align:middle line:84%
the possibility that there's a
divine intelligence behind all

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:33.150 align:middle line:84%
of this, whether it's
consciousness, whatever--

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:35.270 align:middle line:90%
because I don't know what it is.

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:38.640 align:middle line:84%
But why is it so difficult
for scientists to accept that?

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: But it's not a
matter of acceptance.

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.320 align:middle line:84%
Remember, I said I
don't believe in things.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.330 align:middle line:84%
I have degrees of
belief in things.

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:49.250 align:middle line:84%
I process via likelihoods
of what is the likelihood

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:51.030 align:middle line:90%
something's going to be true?

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:54.104 align:middle line:84%
And when you're a scientist
and you spend time in labs,

00:21:54.104 --> 00:21:56.270 align:middle line:84%
you do experiments, you
read about other experiments

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:58.250 align:middle line:84%
that other scientists
have done, and you

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:01.246 align:middle line:84%
build up all of this
knowledge of ways

00:22:01.246 --> 00:22:02.870 align:middle line:84%
the universe has been
probed and tested

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:06.990 align:middle line:84%
and understood, going back
hundreds and hundreds of years,

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:09.530 align:middle line:84%
and you take that knowledge
and you look at it,

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:13.140 align:middle line:90%
and it all makes sense.

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:16.562 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing in
there that says, oh,

00:22:16.562 --> 00:22:18.270 align:middle line:84%
and then this we don't
really understand.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:21.310 align:middle line:84%
It must have been some supreme
power that set this up.

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:23.170 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing in
there like that.

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:24.759 align:middle line:90%
There's no need for it.

00:22:24.759 --> 00:22:26.550 align:middle line:84%
There's no evidence
that anything like that

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:28.020 align:middle line:90%
has ever happened.

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And as scientists, we
look for that stuff.

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:32.220 align:middle line:90%
So we want--

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Theologians
would go crazy

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:35.300 align:middle line:90%
if they heard you right now.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: No, we, as scientists,
we want to find new stuff.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:43.050 align:middle line:84%
We want to find any
variation from known science

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:45.090 align:middle line:90%
because that makes your career.

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:48.660 align:middle line:84%
If you can find something
that's a little bit off

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:52.110 align:middle line:84%
from what is described by
known physics, you're golden.

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:53.340 align:middle line:90%
That's great as a scientist.

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:54.381 align:middle line:90%
That's what you look for.

00:22:54.381 --> 00:22:56.490 align:middle line:90%
So scientists look for ESP.

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:57.787 align:middle line:90%
They look for telekinesis.

00:22:57.787 --> 00:22:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they
never agree with it.

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: It's not that
they don't agree with it.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But maybe
you're looking for it--

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:01.725 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: --and we fail--

00:23:01.725 --> 00:23:02.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --but
you can't find it?

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:02.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: --to find it.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.270 align:middle line:84%
We get negative result
after negative result.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But then how do you
explain these incredible things

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:07.580 align:middle line:90%
that happen?

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:10.560 align:middle line:90%
How do you explain miracles?

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.630 align:middle line:84%
How do you explain
people who have

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:16.200 align:middle line:84%
these telepathic
experiences and they're

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.540 align:middle line:84%
able to say things that
haven't happened yet

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:21.210 align:middle line:84%
and they do and
they're documented?

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:22.890 align:middle line:90%
How do you explain all that?

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:24.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not randomness.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.217 align:middle line:90%
It's not lock.

00:23:25.217 --> 00:23:26.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: No, it's not randomness.

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:27.350 align:middle line:90%
It's not luck.

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I don't believe
in coincidences at all.

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: It's not
extraordinary coincidence.

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:39.390 align:middle line:84%
The simplest explanation
in 99.9% of the cases

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:41.070 align:middle line:90%
are that people are lying.

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:42.270 align:middle line:90%
They're telling stories.

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:43.530 align:middle line:90%
And most often--

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:44.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They can all be lying.

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: --when they're
most convincing,

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:47.370 align:middle line:84%
they're telling those
stories to themselves.

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:48.570 align:middle line:90%
They've convinced themselves--

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:49.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've got
to have you on a--

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: --that what
they believe is true.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:52.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --debate panel one day.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: I'm quite happy
to investigate things.

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:59.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you explain
what we're doing here?

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.520 align:middle line:84%
I'll accept the fact that the
universe had all these things,

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:06.260 align:middle line:84%
these quantum particles and all
that stuff that you work on.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.980 align:middle line:90%
I'll accept that.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:12.210 align:middle line:84%
How do you explain us, what
you're doing here with me right

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:14.110 align:middle line:90%
now, how we get by?

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:14.910 align:middle line:90%
We eat.

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:16.110 align:middle line:90%
We sleep.

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:17.610 align:middle line:90%
We procreate.

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:19.094 align:middle line:90%
How do you explain all that?

00:24:19.094 --> 00:24:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Yeah, this is all so
complex and rich and detailed

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:25.050 align:middle line:84%
and emotions are
involved and everything's

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:26.150 align:middle line:90%
crazy and going on.

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:26.950 align:middle line:90%
There's so much.

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:29.075 align:middle line:84%
How could this come from
just elementary particles?

00:24:29.075 --> 00:24:31.320 align:middle line:90%
The key is emergence.

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.830 align:middle line:84%
The key is we look at a handful
of elementary particles.

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And already just by
simulating the interaction

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.060 align:middle line:84%
of a handful of
elementary particles,

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.400 align:middle line:84%
it's beyond our capability
to predict everything

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.650 align:middle line:90%
that can happen from this.

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:45.000 align:middle line:90%
We can't predict.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.330 align:middle line:90%
It's chaotic what this produces.

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:52.320 align:middle line:84%
We can simulate it, but starting
from some initial condition,

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.960 align:middle line:84%
there's so much sensitivity
to that initial condition.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.287 align:middle line:84%
If you just simulate
that for a few seconds,

00:24:57.287 --> 00:24:59.370 align:middle line:84%
we don't know what state
it will be in after that.

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:00.990 align:middle line:90%
And that's just with a few.

00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:03.540 align:middle line:84%
When you start getting up,
you go from a few particles,

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:06.090 align:middle line:84%
then you start building
molecules, atoms,

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:09.630 align:middle line:84%
and organic molecules, long
chains of organic molecules.

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And these organic molecules
all interact in complex ways.

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And these can be assembled
into organelles inside cells.

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And then the cells,
biologically,

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:21.840 align:middle line:84%
can join into
multicellular organisms.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And you're talking
about trillions

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.525 align:middle line:90%
of interacting things.

00:25:28.525 --> 00:25:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And those interacting
things themselves

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:31.410 align:middle line:90%
can be fairly simple, right?

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:32.993 align:middle line:84%
A cell doesn't think
about what you're

00:25:32.993 --> 00:25:34.300 align:middle line:90%
going to have for breakfast.

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.200 align:middle line:10%
A cell's just thinking about its
neighbors and what's going on.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.290 align:middle line:10%
But you put trillions
of things together

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:41.790 align:middle line:10%
and these trillions of cells
are thinking about what they're

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:44.770 align:middle line:10%
going to have for breakfast.

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:45.580 align:middle line:90%
This emerges.

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:50.170 align:middle line:84%
So when you have vast numbers
of simple interacting things

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:52.750 align:middle line:84%
but they're interacting in
ways that lead to complexity,

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:54.790 align:middle line:84%
then we have the emergence
of complex behavior.

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:56.390 align:middle line:90%
And this is what we are.

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are other
physicists who

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:03.160 align:middle line:84%
do not accept your theories,
your th-- what do they

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.090 align:middle line:90%
think of all of this?

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:06.224 align:middle line:84%
Because they have
different thoughts too.

00:26:06.224 --> 00:26:08.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: I'm actually in
agreement for the most

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.280 align:middle line:90%
part with other physicists.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they with you?

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: What I have proposed is
some mathematical observations

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:17.350 align:middle line:84%
and a proposal about how
the universe might work,

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:18.790 align:middle line:84%
and I'm working
down those lines.

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And so far I haven't
met with huge success

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.960 align:middle line:84%
in the past few years
I've been working on it,

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.550 align:middle line:84%
but it's sufficiently
inspiring that I

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:27.520 align:middle line:84%
think something there is right,
which is what I'm pursuing.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had a chance to
have met and discussed things

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.520 align:middle line:84%
with Albert Einstein, what
would you have asked him?

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.704 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: Oh wow.

00:26:34.704 --> 00:26:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Sure, I would have
loved the opportunity

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:39.010 align:middle line:90%
to talk with Einstein.

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:43.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he passed
away in late '50s,

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:47.667 align:middle line:84%
and he passed away right before
a real explosion in knowledge

00:26:47.667 --> 00:26:48.500 align:middle line:90%
of particle physics.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.557 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And he did all
this without a computer.

00:26:50.557 --> 00:26:51.640 align:middle line:10%
>>LISI: Yeah, it was all--

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:52.473 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Chalkboard.

00:26:52.473 --> 00:26:55.160 align:middle line:10%
>>LISI: --chalkboard,
pencil and paper.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:27:00.197 align:middle line:84%
But he never really got to
see our current knowledge

00:27:00.197 --> 00:27:01.030 align:middle line:90%
of particle physics.

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:02.435 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would he be impressed?

00:27:02.435 --> 00:27:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: He'd be
impressed but he'd also

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:06.010 align:middle line:90%
be pretty baffled at first.

00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:08.074 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would he
be proven right?

00:27:08.074 --> 00:27:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: He has been proven
right over and over again

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.400 align:middle line:90%
for his theory of gravity.

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.242 align:middle line:84%
But there were so many
elementary particles,

00:27:14.242 --> 00:27:16.450 align:middle line:84%
the whole structure of the
standard model of particle

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:22.510 align:middle line:84%
physics, like the weak force was
just starting to be considered.

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And Gell-Mann had not come out
with his Lie group description

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:27.220 align:middle line:90%
of the strong force yet.

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:30.430 align:middle line:84%
So Einstein passed away before
we knew most of modern particle

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:31.540 align:middle line:90%
physics.

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.706 align:middle line:84%
And quantum-field theory
had been developed but just

00:27:33.706 --> 00:27:35.796 align:middle line:90%
to a very minimal degree.

00:27:35.796 --> 00:27:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't have this whole
zoo of elementary particles

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:39.400 align:middle line:90%
that we now know about.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.590 align:middle line:84%
So I would have
asked Einstein what

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:45.100 align:middle line:84%
he would make of this zoo
of elementary particles

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:47.290 align:middle line:84%
in the context of his theory
of general relativity.

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:48.665 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well
Garrett, what would

00:27:48.665 --> 00:27:51.130 align:middle line:84%
have caused this
explosion of knowledge

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:55.480 align:middle line:84%
from the Einstein days
to where we are now?

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.040 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: There were two
things that happened.

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:04.180 align:middle line:84%
One was the development in
mathematics of Yang-Mills

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:07.332 align:middle line:84%
theory or the idea of
Ehresmann connections

00:28:07.332 --> 00:28:09.790 align:middle line:84%
and principal bundles which
are these abstract mathematical

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:15.100 align:middle line:84%
things and basically
the use of Lie groups

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.560 align:middle line:90%
to describe complex geometries.

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.670 align:middle line:90%
So that happened in mathematics.

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:21.580 align:middle line:84%
So Einstein knew
about Lie groups,

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:24.592 align:middle line:84%
and he actually talked to
a friend of mine about them

00:28:24.592 --> 00:28:26.175 align:middle line:84%
shortly before he
passed away, thought

00:28:26.175 --> 00:28:27.716 align:middle line:84%
they were a very
interesting subject.

00:28:27.716 --> 00:28:29.440 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't have
time to investigate

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.480 align:middle line:84%
that area of mathematics
because it was so new,

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:34.180 align:middle line:84%
and it was just starting to
be considered for physics.

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.096 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Einstein
believed in God.

00:28:36.096 --> 00:28:36.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: No he didn't.

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:37.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think he did.

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: No, there's
no indication he--

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:41.920 align:middle line:84%
and he made reference
to something

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.210 align:middle line:90%
like Spinoza's god which is--

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Want a do over there?

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:46.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: --the god of nature.

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.940 align:middle line:84%
So he referred to
god as nature, which

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:51.340 align:middle line:84%
is sort of an amorphous,
impersonal way of considering

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:52.140 align:middle line:90%
the universe.

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:54.869 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, but
it was something.

00:28:54.869 --> 00:28:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: It was something but
it wasn't a supreme being.

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, I
don't know what God is.

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:01.660 align:middle line:84%
All I know is there's
something there

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:05.200 align:middle line:84%
that has helped jump
start all of this.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe-- and I
was raised a Catholic.

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:10.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe in
some guy sitting

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:14.260 align:middle line:84%
in a throne in the clouds,
which is how they taught us what

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:16.870 align:middle line:90%
God was in catechism classes.

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:20.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that
at all, anymore.

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:21.760 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.470 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is.

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:25.990 align:middle line:84%
If I were interviewing
the pope today,

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:27.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure he could
give me a good answer.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.760 align:middle line:90%


00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: It's a different
kind of model for reality.

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I find
scientific models of reality

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:37.720 align:middle line:90%
much more satisfying.

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:42.220 align:middle line:84%
I am very happy with mathematics
and mathematical descriptions.

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:43.780 align:middle line:90%
They're precise.

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And they are extraordinarily
successful for describing

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:50.020 align:middle line:84%
what happens when we
attempt to apply that.

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somewhere
along the line

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:56.800 align:middle line:84%
the physicist Garrett
decided to change.

00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And you picked up and
moved to Maui, surfed.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.430 align:middle line:84%
What caused that
metamorphosis for you?

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:05.425 align:middle line:84%
I mean, did you
give up on science?

00:30:05.425 --> 00:30:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Oh, it was
the exact opposite.

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:13.420 align:middle line:84%
So when I got my PhD,
rather than go and get

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:19.000 align:middle line:84%
a postdoc somewhere and continue
climbing the academic ladder,

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.680 align:middle line:84%
I decided I could
more thoroughly

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:23.409 align:middle line:84%
devote myself to
scientific investigation

00:30:23.409 --> 00:30:25.450 align:middle line:84%
if I just went to an island
and worked by myself.

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:28.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
so you did this.

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:30.400 align:middle line:90%
What did you do for a living?

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.554 align:middle line:90%
How did you exist?

00:30:31.554 --> 00:30:32.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: Good question.

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:34.870 align:middle line:90%
Why didn't I starve?

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:36.700 align:middle line:90%
What had happened is--

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:41.260 align:middle line:84%
well first of all, academia,
you have to understand,

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:43.910 align:middle line:84%
is in a very strange
situation right now.

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's in that situation
because of the way economics

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:49.540 align:middle line:90%
work within academia.

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:51.610 align:middle line:84%
There's a demand
for cheap labor.

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And cheap labor in academia
is graduate students.

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:57.032 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is
for the people who

00:30:57.032 --> 00:30:59.240 align:middle line:84%
graduate at the top of their
class as undergraduate--

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They grab
them, don't they?

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:02.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Yeah, so I graduated
at the top of my class

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:05.360 align:middle line:84%
as an undergraduate, and I got
invitations to go to schools,

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:07.110 align:middle line:84%
and they were going
to throw money at me--

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:08.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As a
teacher, professor?

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:10.912 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: As a research
assistant and graduate student

00:31:10.912 --> 00:31:11.870 align:middle line:90%
and teaching assistant.

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:12.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And pay you?

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: So I got a good offer.

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:16.930 align:middle line:90%
I went to UC San Diego.

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And I also like
playing with computers.

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:21.790 align:middle line:84%
I have ever since
I was a young kid.

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:23.290 align:middle line:90%
So I took a bunch of this money.

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:25.380 align:middle line:84%
I bought a really nice
computer called the NeXT.

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.370 align:middle line:10%
The NeXT was the
computer company

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:29.910 align:middle line:10%
started by Steve Jobs when
he was kicked out of Apple.

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:31.900 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And then
he came back again.

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.660 align:middle line:10%
>>LISI: What happened was the
operating system for the NeXT

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.470 align:middle line:10%
computer was based on Unix.

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:39.910 align:middle line:90%
And this was in the '90s.

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:43.190 align:middle line:84%
It was a great operating system,
very intuitive user interface,

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.990 align:middle line:90%
worked great.

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:47.970 align:middle line:84%
Apple, in the meantime,
was dealing with system 7,

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:49.960 align:middle line:90%
Mac OS-- you know, system 7.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.010 align:middle line:90%
And it was just terrible.

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:52.130 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't know what to do.

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:53.230 align:middle line:84%
They needed a new
operating system.

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:54.771 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They needed
Steve Jobs back.

00:31:54.771 --> 00:31:55.970 align:middle line:90%
That's what they needed.

00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: So what they did
is Apple bought NeXT.

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:01.270 align:middle line:84%
But really what happened
is NeXT bought Apple

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:04.630 align:middle line:84%
for a negative amount of money
because Steve Jobs became

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:05.430 align:middle line:90%
the interim--

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He came
right back in again.

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: --CEO.

00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:10.000 align:middle line:84%
He put his people from NeXT
into the head of Apple now.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And now essentially
Apple became NeXT.

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And the NeXTSTEP operating
system that I had been using,

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:18.430 align:middle line:84%
I knew that was going to
become the new operating

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:20.020 align:middle line:90%
system for Apple.

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:21.746 align:middle line:84%
So I took all that
money that I'd been

00:32:21.746 --> 00:32:22.870 align:middle line:90%
given for graduate school--

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:24.240 align:middle line:84%
because even though
I was cheap labor,

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.660 align:middle line:84%
it was more money
than I'd ever seen.

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:27.280 align:middle line:84%
I invested that in
Apple stock in the '90s

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.270 align:middle line:84%
when everybody thought it was
going to go out of business.

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:29.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you made
a home run with that.

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Yeah, I made a
bunch of money out of it.

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:32.410 align:middle line:84%
So that's what let
me move to Maui

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:34.960 align:middle line:84%
and work on physics on my
own and be a surf bum instead

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:35.920 align:middle line:90%
of going out to get a postdoc.

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.753 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what did
you do with your money?

00:32:37.753 --> 00:32:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Well, over
the years I've

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:41.740 align:middle line:90%
seen different waves coming.

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:43.480 align:middle line:84%
So it was actually
when I was here

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:48.220 align:middle line:84%
living in Colorado in Frisco
in Summit County trying out

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:51.220 align:middle line:84%
being a snowbird bum
for a couple seasons.

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ski bum, a surfer bum.

00:32:53.970 --> 00:32:58.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: And then I was really
enjoying using Netflix.

00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that Netflix was
well positioned, first of all,

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:03.490 align:middle line:84%
to take advantage
of the postal system

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:05.830 align:middle line:90%
for cheap mail of their DVDs.

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:07.242 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: DVDs at the time.

00:33:07.242 --> 00:33:08.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: And then also
they were very well

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:11.020 align:middle line:84%
positioned to take
advantage of the internet,

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:14.780 align:middle line:84%
to stream movies to people
for a very low cost.

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:16.590 align:middle line:84%
So my next investment
was Netflix,

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:18.520 align:middle line:90%
and I did quite well with that.

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And then more recently
in around 2010

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:26.650 align:middle line:84%
I caught wind of
this cryptocurrency,

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:28.485 align:middle line:84%
this digital currency
called Bitcoin.

00:33:28.485 --> 00:33:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have questions
about that stuff, but go ahead.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:32.554 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: That was
just getting started.

00:33:32.554 --> 00:33:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I put a
little bit of money

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:38.350 align:middle line:84%
in Bitcoin because it seemed
like a really cool idea

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:40.280 align:middle line:84%
and just sort of
let that sit there.

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.710 align:middle line:90%
And it's been a while.

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:43.870 align:middle line:90%
And that did unusually well.

00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't think it's
going to hold its value.

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:48.340 align:middle line:90%
What do you think, as of now?

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:52.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: At this point I'm
too scared to sell it.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:55.640 align:middle line:84%
You can make money if you
sold what you have now.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: I could.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:00.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't have enough Bitcoin
to make me a good kidnapping

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:02.270 align:middle line:90%
target.

00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:05.335 align:middle line:84%
I've got far less than
half a million dollars

00:34:05.335 --> 00:34:07.616 align:middle line:84%
of Bitcoin at current
valuation, far less than that.

00:34:07.616 --> 00:34:09.699 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, well
let's take a look at what

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:11.760 align:middle line:90%
cryptocurrency really is.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.382 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Certainly
happy to talk about it.

00:34:14.382 --> 00:34:16.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: There's
Bitcoin, there's Litecoin,

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:18.010 align:middle line:90%
there's Ethereum.

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:21.409 align:middle line:84%
So just what is cryptocurrency
and how does it work?

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Essentially it's digital money
that is bought and sold online.

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.730 align:middle line:10%
There are no bills
or coins, it's not

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:29.949 align:middle line:10%
based on another
asset like gold,

00:34:29.949 --> 00:34:32.020 align:middle line:10%
and it doesn't go through
traditional financial

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:34.420 align:middle line:10%
institutions like banks.

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:36.429 align:middle line:10%
Instead, these
currencies operate

00:34:36.429 --> 00:34:38.650 align:middle line:10%
in a completely
decentralized system

00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:41.020 align:middle line:10%
that uses so-called
blockchain technology

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:43.030 align:middle line:10%
to track transactions.

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:45.580 align:middle line:84%
To see how this works, let's
look at how you buy something

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:47.679 align:middle line:90%
with cryptocurrency.

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:51.010 align:middle line:84%
Say that Alice wants to buy a
bike from Dan using Bitcoin,

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:53.199 align:middle line:90%
her cryptocurrency of choice.

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:55.659 align:middle line:84%
Alice begins by logging
into her Bitcoin wallet

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:58.690 align:middle line:84%
with a private key, a unique
combination of letters

00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:00.280 align:middle line:90%
and numbers.

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.680 align:middle line:84%
With a traditional
financial transaction,

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:05.170 align:middle line:84%
the exchange gets sent
to banks on each side who

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:07.630 align:middle line:84%
record the money being
subtracted from one account

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:09.550 align:middle line:90%
and added to another.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:11.680 align:middle line:84%
But remember, in
this scenario, there

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.750 align:middle line:90%
are no banks or middlemen.

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:16.870 align:middle line:10%
Instead, Alice's transaction
is shared with everyone

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:18.670 align:middle line:10%
in the Bitcoin network.

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:21.230 align:middle line:84%
These networked computers
add Alice's transaction

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:25.330 align:middle line:84%
to a shared list of recent
transactions known as a block.

00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Every 10 minutes, the
newest block of transactions

00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:31.690 align:middle line:84%
is added on or chained to
all the previous blocks.

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:34.420 align:middle line:90%
That's how you get a blockchain.

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:37.060 align:middle line:10%
To ensure that each block
of transactions on the chain

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:39.580 align:middle line:10%
is verified, a subset
of Bitcoin's network

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:42.880 align:middle line:10%
joins a race to solve a
very difficult math puzzle.

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And if they solve it
first, their record

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:48.700 align:middle line:84%
of the block of transactions
becomes the official record.

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:50.920 align:middle line:84%
They're rewarded with
bitcoins of their own

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:54.160 align:middle line:84%
and the network gets a
new block on the chain.

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:56.710 align:middle line:84%
This entire process
is known as mining,

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:58.420 align:middle line:84%
but instead of
chipping away at rock,

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.880 align:middle line:90%
you're solving complex puzzles.

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:04.300 align:middle line:84%
The fact that many computers
are competing to verify a block

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:07.240 align:middle line:84%
ensures that no single computer
can monopolize the Bitcoin

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:08.560 align:middle line:90%
market.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:11.740 align:middle line:84%
To ensure the competition
stays fair and evenly timed,

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:15.550 align:middle line:84%
the puzzle becomes harder
when more computers join in.

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:17.440 align:middle line:84%
The Bitcoin protocol
says mining will

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:21.410 align:middle line:84%
continue until there are 21
million bitcoins in existence.

00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:24.010 align:middle line:84%
That's set to
happen around 2140,

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:27.960 align:middle line:90%
if Bitcoin lasts that long.

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:30.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sell your bitcoins.

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: So you think
they're tulips?

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:33.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I do.

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:37.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't think
there's legs to it.

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:39.352 align:middle line:90%
And it is going down.

00:36:39.352 --> 00:36:40.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: It's been going down.

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.366 align:middle line:90%
It's been going up.

00:36:41.366 --> 00:36:42.240 align:middle line:90%
It's been going down.

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.170 align:middle line:90%
It's been going on.

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean it's like
$6,000 $7,000 a coin now.

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.500 align:middle line:90%
It was at, what, $15,000?

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: So you
have to understand,

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:53.200 align:middle line:90%
in 2010 it was a few cents.

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.814 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right, but then the
craze caught on and pushed it.

00:36:55.814 --> 00:36:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: Well, wait a minute.

00:36:56.980 --> 00:37:02.140 align:middle line:84%
The craze caught on and it
went up to about $8.00 or so.

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And then it shot up to $20
and then back down to $10,

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:04.960 align:middle line:90%
and then it--

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:05.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What caused it--

00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: --stayed
there for a while.

00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:07.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --to go down?

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:09.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: There have been waves
of popularity of Bitcoin.

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not too
popular right now.

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:14.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Well, it's spread
into wider awareness.

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:17.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's a matter of how
fast this idea spreads.

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:20.530 align:middle line:84%
So there's no government
behind Bitcoin, right?

00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:23.890 align:middle line:84%
It's just a digital
currency between geeks?

00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do you do with it?

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: You could buy a house.

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:29.470 align:middle line:84%
You can go to a website,
find houses for sale.

00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:31.420 align:middle line:84%
There price is
listed in bitcoin.

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what about cars
and what about food, same thing?

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:36.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: Yes.

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:38.770 align:middle line:84%
Most grocery stores
won't accept it,

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:42.790 align:middle line:84%
but you can find stores
that will accept it.

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Bitcoin is better for
more largely priced items.

00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how do you exchange
the purchase of the bitcoin

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:51.800 align:middle line:90%
to the other individual?

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.082 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:37:53.082 --> 00:37:55.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: You have someone there
with the deed for the house.

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:56.350 align:middle line:90%
They sign the deed.

00:37:56.350 --> 00:37:57.641 align:middle line:90%
You're here with your computer.

00:37:57.641 --> 00:37:58.750 align:middle line:90%
You transfer your bitcoin.

00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:01.570 align:middle line:84%
They see that your bitcoin
shows up in their account.

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:03.559 align:middle line:84%
You don't even really
need an escrow agent.

00:38:03.559 --> 00:38:04.600 align:middle line:90%
It's a straight exchange.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you've got
the bitcoin it's yours.

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:07.120 align:middle line:90%
Can it be hacked?

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:08.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: You can see it transfer.

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:12.400 align:middle line:84%
If your passphrase or
password for your bitcoin

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:16.240 align:middle line:84%
falls into somebody else's
hands, they own your bitcoin.

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was
blockchain technology

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:20.380 align:middle line:84%
that they were talking
about on that tape?

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Yeah, so
this was actually

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:22.480 align:middle line:90%
quite a good description.

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:26.110 align:middle line:84%
The blockchain is the
ledger of what has

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:28.630 align:middle line:90%
happened to all the bitcoin.

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:33.157 align:middle line:84%
So every bitcoin is
tracked in this ledger.

00:38:33.157 --> 00:38:35.365 align:middle line:84%
And right now, currently,
with all the transactions--

00:38:35.365 --> 00:38:37.156 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like the
good book in heaven.

00:38:37.156 --> 00:38:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Essentially it's the
record of every transaction

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:41.860 align:middle line:90%
that has happened--

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:42.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ever?

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: --ever
with Bitcoin, going

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:47.890 align:middle line:84%
back to when it was first
started in 2009 or so.

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:50.992 align:middle line:84%
And right now the whole
ledger is about 145 gigabytes.

00:38:50.992 --> 00:38:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a
lot of gigabytes.

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Yeah, it's
a lot of gigabytes.

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:55.900 align:middle line:84%
But you know, terabyte drives
are like $100 right now,

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:58.702 align:middle line:90%
so it's still almost nothing.

00:38:58.702 --> 00:39:00.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But that's
the blockchain?

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:01.701 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: That's the
entire blockchain.

00:39:01.701 --> 00:39:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And every 10 minutes another
1 megabyte of transaction data

00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:06.735 align:middle line:90%
is added to that blockchain.

00:39:06.735 --> 00:39:07.610 align:middle line:90%
There's a block.

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:09.520 align:middle line:90%
Each block is 1 megabyte.

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What causes
it to go up or down--

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:12.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: The price?

00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:13.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --demand?

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: Yeah.

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:16.870 align:middle line:90%
The supply is capped.

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:20.150 align:middle line:84%
So unlike some country's
currency where they have a mint

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:22.600 align:middle line:84%
and they print currency,
however much they want,

00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:27.200 align:middle line:84%
the supply of bitcoin is
capped at 21 million total.

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it?

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: That's it.

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:29.978 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 21 million
coins you mean?

00:39:29.978 --> 00:39:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: 21 million
coins, it will not

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:33.160 align:middle line:90%
be more than that ever.

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:36.115 align:middle line:84%
You cannot increase the number
of bitcoin past 21 million.

00:39:36.115 --> 00:39:37.240 align:middle line:90%
It's built into the system.

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So 21
million will be it.

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: Yes.

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:42.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It'll be spread among
all the people on the planet

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.571 align:middle line:90%
who might want to buy bitcoins.

00:39:43.571 --> 00:39:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: Who want it, yes.

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And the transactions
happen purely

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:49.850 align:middle line:84%
in terms of new records
entering the ledger.

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:51.940 align:middle line:84%
So when I send
someone a bitcoin,

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.370 align:middle line:90%
that goes into this pool.

00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And there are many thousands
of computers distributed

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:01.789 align:middle line:84%
throughout the world who will
see my potential transaction as

00:40:01.789 --> 00:40:03.580 align:middle line:84%
well as a small fee
that I'm willing to pay

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:05.634 align:middle line:90%
to make that transition happen.

00:40:05.634 --> 00:40:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And then they will
take that transaction

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:11.320 align:middle line:84%
and put it in their block,
in their 1-megabyte block.

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And then they will try to, as I
said, solve this math problem.

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:19.450 align:middle line:84%
So what they're doing is they
take all these transactions

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:22.360 align:middle line:84%
from the pool that people want
to make with their bitcoin.

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And they get it in
their 1-megabyte block.

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And then they use
what's called a hash.

00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:29.722 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who's they?

00:40:29.722 --> 00:40:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: All the
thousands of people

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:33.250 align:middle line:84%
who are trying to
make money in Bitcoin.

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:35.290 align:middle line:90%
They're trying to mine bitcoin.

00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:37.960 align:middle line:84%
So by doing this process,
the winner of this process

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:40.310 align:middle line:90%
wins a few bitcoin.

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And bitcoin is, as you
said, worth $7,000 or $8,000

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:44.070 align:middle line:90%
a coin right now.

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And they win a few if
they can win this search.

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:49.510 align:middle line:84%
So basically they have
this 1-megabyte block

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:50.766 align:middle line:90%
of transactions.

00:40:50.766 --> 00:40:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And they're looking
for a magic number.

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:56.080 align:middle line:84%
That number is called
a nonce, which is

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.754 align:middle line:90%
short for a number used once.

00:40:57.754 --> 00:40:59.170 align:middle line:84%
So they're looking
for this nonce.

00:40:59.170 --> 00:41:02.770 align:middle line:84%
It will be the magic nonce
such that when they combine it

00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:06.720 align:middle line:84%
in a formula that scrambles
this information reversibility,

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:10.200 align:middle line:84%
it comes up with a certain
number of leading zeros.

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.990 align:middle line:84%
So you have this 1 megabyte of
data which you can represent

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:14.464 align:middle line:90%
in a computer as a number.

00:41:14.464 --> 00:41:16.380 align:middle line:84%
You combine it with a
number in a formula that

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:21.610 align:middle line:84%
gives other data that's a
megabyte through a set formula.

00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And if that formula
and that nonce

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:29.640 align:middle line:84%
produces a new set of data
with a set of leading zeros,

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:33.840 align:middle line:84%
say 8 to 20 leading
zeros or something,

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.395 align:middle line:90%
then they found the magic nonce.

00:41:35.395 --> 00:41:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And then they announce
that to the rest

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:39.061 align:middle line:84%
of the network and they
are rewarded with bitcoin

00:41:39.061 --> 00:41:41.354 align:middle line:84%
and that 1 megabyte
of transaction

00:41:41.354 --> 00:41:42.270 align:middle line:90%
is added to the block.

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:44.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a future
for cryptocurrency--

00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: Absolutely.

00:41:45.310 --> 00:41:45.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --in your opinion?

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:46.400 align:middle line:90%
You think it's going to be big?

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: It's such
an amazing thing.

00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:49.120 align:middle line:90%
It's decentralized.

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:50.820 align:middle line:84%
It's not owned by
any government.

00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:56.430 align:middle line:84%
It can cross borders,
international borders,

00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:59.260 align:middle line:90%
frictionlessly.

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:01.089 align:middle line:90%
And it's not secret.

00:42:01.089 --> 00:42:02.130 align:middle line:90%
It's all out in the open.

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:04.620 align:middle line:84%
Everything's on the
blockchain, every transaction,

00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:07.230 align:middle line:84%
but you don't know
who is associated

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:10.156 align:middle line:90%
with each transaction.

00:42:10.156 --> 00:42:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's confidential.

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:12.529 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: It's not confidential.

00:42:12.529 --> 00:42:14.610 align:middle line:90%
It's a wallet number.

00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:17.070 align:middle line:84%
So with each bitcoin
you have a wallet.

00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:21.360 align:middle line:84%
You have a wallet associated
with a bunch of bitcoin.

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And in order to make
transactions using that wallet

00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:25.560 align:middle line:90%
you need your key.

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And that key you can access
via password or passphrase.

00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:37.340 align:middle line:84%
So you could memorize 12 words,
12 random words, and use that

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:39.694 align:middle line:90%
to unlock your Bitcoin wallet.

00:42:39.694 --> 00:42:41.360 align:middle line:84%
Now if anybody else
gets those 12 words,

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.590 align:middle line:84%
they have access to
your Bitcoin wallet.

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:43.602 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:42:43.602 --> 00:42:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: But that's
what secures it.

00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:47.810 align:middle line:84%
It's secured by your own
ability to keep that information

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:48.830 align:middle line:90%
secret.

00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And with that secret you
can access and move bitcoin

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:52.910 align:middle line:90%
in and out of your wallet.

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:57.067 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
convenient thing to do.

00:42:57.067 --> 00:42:59.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've ever
tried to do a wire transfer.

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh yeah, I've
done those through banks.

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:01.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: It's a pain.

00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:02.635 align:middle line:84%
You've got to fill
out a form, all this.

00:43:02.635 --> 00:43:03.843 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You've got to go in.

00:43:03.843 --> 00:43:05.870 align:middle line:84%
You've got to sit
down with a bank.

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:07.100 align:middle line:90%
You've got to do it all.

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.440 align:middle line:84%
This you just say you do
online and that's it, huh?

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: It takes seconds
George, takes seconds.

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:15.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's wild.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:16.970 align:middle line:90%
It's wild.

00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: In principle,
digital currency

00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:20.330 align:middle line:84%
is such a practical
thing that, yes,

00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:21.700 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going to be
around for a very long time.

00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you don't
see it collapsing?

00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:24.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: I don't.

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:25.100 align:middle line:90%
I see it spreading.

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:27.647 align:middle line:84%
Right now there are hundreds
of different coins being used--

00:43:27.647 --> 00:43:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a
company, a brand-new one,

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.090 align:middle line:84%
that deals with
selling coins to people

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:34.100 align:middle line:90%
interested in the paranormal.

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:35.535 align:middle line:90%
It's called Onstellar.

00:43:35.535 --> 00:43:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: That's great.

00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:38.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's
what they're doing.

00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:40.670 align:middle line:84%
So they'll probably
be successful.

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:42.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: I wouldn't bet on it.

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:47.690 align:middle line:84%
So there's been such a success
with Bitcoin and Ethereum

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:49.395 align:middle line:90%
and Litecoin, as we mentioned.

00:43:49.395 --> 00:43:51.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all these things
have been very successful.

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:54.140 align:middle line:84%
They've gone up, so more and
more people are piling in.

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:56.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit
like a pyramid scheme.

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Actually it's a lot
like a pyramid scheme.

00:43:57.890 --> 00:43:59.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right,
it's a lot like it--

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:00.810 align:middle line:90%
a lot like it.

00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: But it does have
the practicality behind it

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:05.787 align:middle line:84%
of making for easy
digital transactions.

00:44:05.787 --> 00:44:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And these different
coins are designed

00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:10.110 align:middle line:84%
to be specialized for
different purposes.

00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And they can be very useful
for these different purposes.

00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:14.792 align:middle line:84%
You can keep track of
electrical power this way.

00:44:14.792 --> 00:44:16.250 align:middle line:84%
There's a coin
called Power Ledger.

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:18.041 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, there are all
these different coins

00:44:18.041 --> 00:44:20.026 align:middle line:84%
that can be used for
different purposes.

00:44:20.026 --> 00:44:21.650 align:middle line:84%
The problem is there's
so many, there's

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:23.892 align:middle line:90%
been such an explosion of coins.

00:44:23.892 --> 00:44:25.100 align:middle line:90%
They can't all be successful.

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:29.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's a physicist
doing dabbling in this stuff?

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: I gotta eat.

00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, so you're
doing it as an investment?

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.375 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: When I
see a wave coming,

00:44:34.375 --> 00:44:36.920 align:middle line:84%
you know, as an investment
wave, I try to get on it.

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:43.040 align:middle line:84%
So whether that's in real
estate or cryptocurrency--

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:45.520 align:middle line:84%
stocks is where I have
most of my experience--

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:47.390 align:middle line:90%
I try to ride those waves.

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I've been
financially successful

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:50.630 align:middle line:90%
throughout my life.

00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:52.484 align:middle line:84%
I'm not wildly successful,
but I eat well.

00:44:52.484 --> 00:44:53.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're
doing all that.

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:56.060 align:middle line:90%
You've moved to Maui.

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:57.590 align:middle line:90%
Have you given up physics?

00:44:57.590 --> 00:44:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: Absolutely not.

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:00.510 align:middle line:84%
This is just what
I do on the side

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:01.400 align:middle line:90%
to fund the physics research.

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.858 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, so you're
still doing physics research.

00:45:03.858 --> 00:45:07.400 align:middle line:84%
So by moving to Maui you
didn't give up on life.

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: No, I'm trying to
have as much life as I can.

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:11.900 align:middle line:90%
Life in Maui is fantastic.

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's take a
look at physics and surfing.

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:16.616 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: Sure.

00:45:16.616 --> 00:45:20.102 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:45:20.102 --> 00:46:05.870 align:middle line:90%


00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So this is
a little push there

00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:09.680 align:middle line:90%
to tie that in the physics.

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:13.360 align:middle line:84%
But where do you see,
Garrett, physics headed?

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:16.500 align:middle line:84%
What's the next
evolution for us?

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:19.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Well, ideally
what I'd like to do

00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:22.400 align:middle line:84%
is make more progress in
having a quantum description

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.150 align:middle line:84%
of the geometry that
I've used to describe

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:26.430 align:middle line:84%
elementary particles
and gravity and see

00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:29.225 align:middle line:84%
if I can get a quantized
description of the theory using

00:46:29.225 --> 00:46:30.850 align:middle line:84%
other advanced
mathematical structures.

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:32.808 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you going
to blow this planet wide

00:46:32.808 --> 00:46:35.335 align:middle line:90%
open with some new knowledge?

00:46:35.335 --> 00:46:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: I hope you're speaking
only in an abstract sense.

00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:38.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, of course.

00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:42.740 align:middle line:84%
We don't want you playing
around with protons and neutrons

00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:44.515 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:46:44.515 --> 00:46:46.026 align:middle line:90%
The atom, leave it alone.

00:46:46.026 --> 00:46:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Even though
I have a lair

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.410 align:middle line:84%
on a volcano in the middle
of the Pacific Ocean,

00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:51.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm not actually a supervillain.

00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:54.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm really just trying to solve
the ultimate puzzles of nature

00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:55.350 align:middle line:90%
as best I can.

00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But what do
we need on this planet

00:46:57.210 --> 00:47:00.240 align:middle line:84%
to find out that we don't
really know right now?

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:01.505 align:middle line:90%
What's the answer--

00:47:01.505 --> 00:47:03.005 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Well the
ultimate question--

00:47:03.005 --> 00:47:03.879 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --out there?

00:47:03.879 --> 00:47:05.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: The ultimate
question right now

00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:10.980 align:middle line:84%
is how to correctly
describe quantum gravity.

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:12.210 align:middle line:90%
We don't currently have a--

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:12.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does that mean?

00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:13.826 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: --description.

00:47:13.826 --> 00:47:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To a layman,
what's quantum gravity mean?

00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:18.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Well, currently we
have a good quantum description

00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:21.570 align:middle line:84%
of atoms and
elementary particles,

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:26.430 align:middle line:84%
and we have a good description
of strong gravitational fields.

00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Like around stars, black
holes, our whole cosmos,

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:34.040 align:middle line:84%
we have a good
description of that.

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:38.280 align:middle line:84%
What we don't have is we don't
have a microscopic description

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:39.630 align:middle line:90%
of gravity.

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:42.270 align:middle line:84%
When we try to use quantum
mechanics to describe gravity,

00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:43.560 align:middle line:90%
we don't get good answers.

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:46.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sir Isaac
Newton simply told us,

00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.780 align:middle line:84%
just drop two things,
that's gravity.

00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:50.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: People are trying that.

00:47:50.730 --> 00:47:55.260 align:middle line:84%
So they've done experiments
of microscopic objects dropped

00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:56.080 align:middle line:90%
in gravity.

00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And you can see how
quantum mechanics does

00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:00.750 align:middle line:84%
apply when things are in
a gravitational field,

00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:02.460 align:middle line:84%
but they can't have
a quantum description

00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:03.870 align:middle line:84%
of the gravitational
field itself.

00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:04.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Without gravity--

00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: There's no
such description.

00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Without
gravity could we exist?

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Not in our
current form, no.

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:11.357 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We'd be torn apart?

00:48:11.357 --> 00:48:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Well, you can think
of some organisms that

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:16.470 align:middle line:84%
could exist in a
nongravitating cloud of matter.

00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:19.740 align:middle line:84%
But our entire
existence has evolved

00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:23.340 align:middle line:84%
on this planet where we have
a strong gravitational field

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:25.590 align:middle line:84%
pulling us down towards
the center of the earth.

00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:29.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if we get this
answer to that question,

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:30.610 align:middle line:90%
what is the quantum gravity--

00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: How is
gravity quantized?

00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:34.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --what does
that mean to us?

00:48:34.310 --> 00:48:37.180 align:middle line:84%
How is that going to
change my day-to-day life?

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:41.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Well, there will be some
beautiful bit of mathematics

00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:44.650 align:middle line:84%
underneath it that describes
how our universe functions

00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:45.850 align:middle line:90%
on a very fundamental level.

00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:48.550 align:middle line:84%
We'll have a unified theory
that describes both gravity

00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:49.967 align:middle line:90%
and particle physics.

00:48:49.967 --> 00:48:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And I would think you would
find it more philosophically

00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:54.820 align:middle line:84%
satisfying to know
that there is--

00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it put
food on my table?

00:48:56.530 --> 00:48:59.290 align:middle line:90%


00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: That's more about
permaculture farming

00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:05.050 align:middle line:84%
and other very high-quality
methods of living

00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:07.120 align:middle line:90%
than about fundamental physics.

00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:09.299 align:middle line:84%
But why do you want
the food on the table?

00:49:09.299 --> 00:49:11.590 align:middle line:84%
You have food on the table
so you can eat it, enjoy it,

00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:13.910 align:middle line:84%
and then spend your time
enjoying life and thinking

00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:14.710 align:middle line:90%
about stuff.

00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:16.251 align:middle line:84%
So what are you
going to think about?

00:49:16.251 --> 00:49:18.640 align:middle line:84%
What I choose to think
about is the deepest

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:21.025 align:middle line:84%
puzzle I could find in the
universe, which is what is it?

00:49:21.025 --> 00:49:22.400 align:middle line:90%
What is the universe?

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:23.200 align:middle line:90%
That's why I eat.

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We may never
get that answer.

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: We might
not live to see it.

00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:29.170 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to live longer if I
possibly can and get to see it.

00:49:29.170 --> 00:49:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you believe
in life after death?

00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:32.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISI: I barely believe in--

00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:33.940 align:middle line:90%
I believe in life during life.

00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You barely
believe in life, right?

00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:37.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: No, I don't believe
in life after death.

00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:39.875 align:middle line:84%
There's no evidence anything
like that would exist.

00:49:39.875 --> 00:49:42.100 align:middle line:84%
As far as we know,
our conscious minds

00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:44.410 align:middle line:84%
require a physical
substrate to exist.

00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:47.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever in your
life asked for something--

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:49.630 align:middle line:84%
maybe there was someone in
your family that was sick

00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:50.800 align:middle line:90%
or whatever--

00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:54.840 align:middle line:90%
and said, God, please help me?

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:55.640 align:middle line:90%
Ever?

00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:56.822 align:middle line:90%
Ever use that phrase?

00:49:56.822 --> 00:49:59.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Sure, when I was a
little kid inside my head.

00:49:59.030 --> 00:50:01.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then why'd
you grow out of that?

00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: It never
got me anything.

00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yet.

00:50:05.130 --> 00:50:06.414 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it did.

00:50:06.414 --> 00:50:08.080 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it got you to
where you are today?

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:10.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: If you keep talking
to yourself inside your head

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:11.210 align:middle line:84%
and asking for
things, you're going

00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:12.590 align:middle line:84%
to get those things
some of the time.

00:50:12.590 --> 00:50:13.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: But then
that doesn't mean

00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.320 align:middle line:84%
that some supernatural
power made it happen.

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:19.650 align:middle line:90%
It just means that happened.

00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:23.104 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But could you accept
the fact that it's possible?

00:50:23.104 --> 00:50:24.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: If there was
any evidence for it

00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:28.070 align:middle line:84%
at all I'd have a higher
degree of belief in it.

00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:30.654 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you go to meetings
with your peers and colleagues?

00:50:30.654 --> 00:50:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Yeah, I
go to conferences.

00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if so, what do they
think of the you, of your work?

00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: They think
I'm a little weird.

00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:37.390 align:middle line:90%
They also--

00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:38.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No!

00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:41.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: They also like
coming out to Maui to visit.

00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:44.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who wouldn't?

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: Although I had an
unusual lifestyle hopping

00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:47.900 align:middle line:90%
around--

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:52.230 align:middle line:84%
so after I got my PhD, I
didn't go to Maui immediately.

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:55.961 align:middle line:84%
I spent time in
different friends' houses

00:50:55.961 --> 00:50:58.460 align:middle line:84%
where I spent time working on
physics while I took advantage

00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:00.150 align:middle line:90%
of their hospitality.

00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:02.600 align:middle line:10%
And I got a lot of good work
done while traveling around

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:05.000 align:middle line:10%
to beautiful places
in the world working

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.580 align:middle line:10%
on physics while staying
in friends' houses.

00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And I got the idea of
turning this into a thing.

00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:12.710 align:middle line:84%
We could have a network
of science hostels

00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:14.950 align:middle line:84%
where theoretical
researchers could go--

00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not a bad idea.

00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:20.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISI: --and work on stuff in a
very low-stress, very enjoyable

00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:21.680 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:23.690 align:middle line:84%
So I had a hard time
persuading people

00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:25.940 align:middle line:84%
