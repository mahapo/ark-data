>> [Background Music]

00:00:01.134 --> 00:00:02.903 align:middle line:84%
And I think many people
today don't know what

00:00:02.903 --> 00:00:05.939 align:middle line:90%
to believe anymore.

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:08.442 align:middle line:84%
>> People need to keep on help
uncover what really happened.

00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:10.811 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:12.846 align:middle line:84%
>> We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:14.882 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told the
entire story.

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:22.022 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.457 align:middle line:90%
And what a festive time a year,

00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:27.194 align:middle line:84%
especially during the Halloween
season, where people dress up

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:29.930 align:middle line:84%
and you go trick or treating,
and it's just a fun time.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.266 align:middle line:84%
So we thought it would
be very appropriate

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.601 align:middle line:84%
to bring you a witch,
Leanne Marrama.

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:35.802 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Hi.

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:37.971 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Who
happens to be a good witch.

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:39.206 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Thank you very much.

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:40.841 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
What's the difference

00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:43.377 align:middle line:84%
between a good witch
and a bad one?

00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:44.745 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Well, the
difference between a good witch

00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:47.014 align:middle line:84%
and a bad witch is whether
or not you're a good person

00:00:47.014 --> 00:00:49.816 align:middle line:84%
or a bad person, and I
consider myself fairly good.

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:51.752 align:middle line:84%
There are times where
I can be naughty.

00:00:51.752 --> 00:00:53.287 align:middle line:90%
Naughty's not a problem.

00:00:53.287 --> 00:00:54.688 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Sometimes naughty is nice.

00:00:54.688 --> 00:00:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Naughty is great sometimes,

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.792 align:middle line:84%
but I don't consider
myself evil or bad.

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:00.494 align:middle line:90%
I'm just like everyone else.

00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:02.296 align:middle line:90%
I have my belief system.

00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:05.866 align:middle line:84%
I have a different
way I look at God or,

00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:07.067 align:middle line:90%
I like to say, the goddess.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:10.237 align:middle line:84%
I have a different
way that I believe.

00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:12.572 align:middle line:90%
Just, you know, I'm not bad.

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:14.975 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Have you
come across bad witches?

00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:16.543 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: I've come
across a lot of bad witches.

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:17.477 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: You have.

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:18.277 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
And bad people,

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:19.079 align:middle line:90%
because they're bad people.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.414 align:middle line:90%
Not because they're a witch.

00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:21.747 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: They were
bad before they were a witch.

00:01:21.747 --> 00:01:22.515 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: They were
bad before they lit a candle

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:23.917 align:middle line:90%
and put on the pointy hat.

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:26.019 align:middle line:90%
They were bad anyways, you know.

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:27.988 align:middle line:90%
I've met a bad minister.

00:01:27.988 --> 00:01:31.925 align:middle line:84%
I've met bad people who were
Christian, you know what I mean?

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:35.529 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't their religion's
fault.

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:36.830 align:middle line:90%
It was their fault.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.031 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well,
doesn't it bother you though

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:40.866 align:middle line:84%
that you might have those
kinds of people involved

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:45.372 align:middle line:84%
in witchcraft, which further
gives witchcraft a bad name?

00:01:45.372 --> 00:01:48.041 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: It's
like anything in life.

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:52.412 align:middle line:84%
In anything, you're going to
meet good people and bad people.

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:56.615 align:middle line:84%
You get away from the bad people
and you don't think about them,

00:01:56.615 --> 00:01:58.050 align:middle line:90%
whether you're a witch or not.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.153 align:middle line:84%
That's just really good
advice I just gave everyone.

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:02.789 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: For every ten
witches, how many are good?

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.424 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
I would say nine.

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:05.258 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's huge.

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:06.593 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: It is huge.

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:07.594 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: That's probably better
than the human population,

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:08.996 align:middle line:90%
in terms of good and bad people.

00:02:08.996 --> 00:02:10.364 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: I just
don't think we're that bad.

00:02:10.364 --> 00:02:12.065 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's a lot of hype.

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:14.334 align:middle line:90%
Hollywood did us a number.

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:16.436 align:middle line:84%
We're always running
around turning somebody

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:20.207 align:middle line:84%
into possibly a toad
or a chicken.

00:02:20.207 --> 00:02:23.110 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea, you know,
and that's Hollywood.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.445 align:middle line:90%
I've never been like that.

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:27.214 align:middle line:90%
I'm generally a good person.

00:02:27.214 --> 00:02:29.416 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Well, as a good
person, I assume a lot

00:02:29.416 --> 00:02:32.219 align:middle line:84%
of people come to
you for advice.

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:33.286 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yes, they do.

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:33.854 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Help.

00:02:33.854 --> 00:02:34.688 align:middle line:90%
Relationships.

00:02:34.688 --> 00:02:35.222 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Absolutely.

00:02:35.222 --> 00:02:35.989 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Jobs.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.057 align:middle line:90%
Things like that.

00:02:37.057 --> 00:02:38.458 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
I'm a working psychic.

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:42.829 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Can spells generate the
good things in life for people?

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.664 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Yes, it absolutely can.

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:48.135 align:middle line:84%
Spellwork is using your
power of your own mind

00:02:48.135 --> 00:02:50.670 align:middle line:84%
and your own tenacity
to survive.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.941 align:middle line:84%
Spellwork's like a prayer,
let's say, or a mantra.

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:59.746 align:middle line:84%
It is about focusing on what you
want, believing you can have it.

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:04.017 align:middle line:90%
Using little things like this.

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:07.988 align:middle line:84%
This is a mojo bag, and
it was created for money.

00:03:07.988 --> 00:03:10.924 align:middle line:84%
It's a charm bag, and you
hold on to this charm bag.

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:12.325 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Let me see
this little thing.

00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:12.993 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Smell it.

00:03:12.993 --> 00:03:13.927 align:middle line:90%
It smells wonderful.

00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:14.995 align:middle line:90%
It smells like money.

00:03:14.995 --> 00:03:18.265 align:middle line:84%
You carry that, and
it will draw it in.

00:03:18.265 --> 00:03:20.500 align:middle line:84%
you put your own energy
into it, and you bless it.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.335 align:middle line:90%
It becomes like a lucky charm

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:23.603 align:middle line:84%
that will draw in
different things.

00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:26.506 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I bet you couldn't
get on a plane with this.

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:27.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: I did.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.908 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter]

00:03:27.908 --> 00:03:29.042 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You did?

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
That's how I got it here?

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.912 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Did you check
your suitcase?

00:03:31.912 --> 00:03:32.846 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Oh no, I put it away.

00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:33.947 align:middle line:90%
I put it away.

00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:35.215 align:middle line:90%
But I know people--

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:36.883 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: So you went through
security with this thing?

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:39.252 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
In my pocketbook.

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:40.253 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: They didn't
even question it?

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:41.421 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Nope.

00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:42.422 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's TSA for you.

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:43.123 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter]

00:03:43.123 --> 00:03:43.623 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yeah.

00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:44.191 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter]

00:03:44.191 --> 00:03:45.425 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right on.

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:49.329 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a little bit
about love and love curses.

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:50.464 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that for someone?

00:03:50.464 --> 00:03:53.066 align:middle line:84%
Someone comes to you and
says, you know, "Leanne,

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:54.267 align:middle line:90%
I want a relationship.

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:55.302 align:middle line:90%
I want to get going."

00:03:55.302 --> 00:03:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Sounded like Bill
Clinton for a while.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:57.471 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Yeah, you did.

00:03:57.471 --> 00:03:58.438 align:middle line:90%
You did.

00:03:58.438 --> 00:03:59.139 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: "Leanne, tell
me about that.

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:00.540 align:middle line:90%
I want a relationship."

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.343 align:middle line:90%
But how do you do that?

00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:04.945 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: There
are many different ways

00:04:04.945 --> 00:04:06.680 align:middle line:84%
that I can help people
with a relationship.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.984 align:middle line:84%
I can use puppets or
candles or magical oils.

00:04:10.984 --> 00:04:12.085 align:middle line:90%
And what I tell them to do.

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:14.721 align:middle line:84%
So I tell them first,
know what you want.

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:16.256 align:middle line:84%
Don't just be like,
"I want something."

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:17.023 align:middle line:90%
Know what you want.

00:04:17.023 --> 00:04:17.724 align:middle line:90%
Make a list.

00:04:17.724 --> 00:04:18.725 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Or who you want.

00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:19.493 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Not always.

00:04:19.493 --> 00:04:20.627 align:middle line:90%
I like to leave that open.

00:04:20.627 --> 00:04:21.962 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You do?

00:04:21.962 --> 00:04:23.396 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: When you're
trying to do a love spell,

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:26.766 align:middle line:84%
all right, let's say,
you know, you want--

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:28.301 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: I want.

00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:29.536 align:middle line:90%
I want.

00:04:29.536 --> 00:04:30.904 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: You
want someone in particular.

00:04:30.904 --> 00:04:33.106 align:middle line:84%
Let's just say you
want, I don't know.

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:34.040 align:middle line:90%
Giselle [assumed spelling].

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.275 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know,
you have to say

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:36.543 align:middle line:90%
to yourself, "Is that logical?"

00:04:36.543 --> 00:04:37.911 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter]

00:04:37.911 --> 00:04:41.081 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Why do people need a
spell to get that relationship?

00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:42.883 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Because spells work.

00:04:42.883 --> 00:04:44.818 align:middle line:90%
It's like a prayer.

00:04:44.818 --> 00:04:47.888 align:middle line:84%
It's like looking up to
the heavens and saying,

00:04:47.888 --> 00:04:50.790 align:middle line:90%
"Universe, I'm lonely.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.760 align:middle line:84%
Please draw in somebody
special for me."

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.732 align:middle line:84%
And it will happen, because let
alone a spell will, with herbs

00:04:58.732 --> 00:05:01.701 align:middle line:84%
and with color, signal
the universe.

00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:03.670 align:middle line:84%
Listen, everybody's
running around like a bunch

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.539 align:middle line:90%
of [inaudible] usually, right?

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:07.107 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes if
you're the person

00:05:07.107 --> 00:05:11.478 align:middle line:84%
that stomps their feet
and says, "I want it.

00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:16.616 align:middle line:84%
I want it now," I think
the divine looks down on us

00:05:16.616 --> 00:05:18.151 align:middle line:84%
and says, "Hey, what's
this person

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:19.853 align:middle line:90%
over here, doing something?"

00:05:19.853 --> 00:05:21.388 align:middle line:90%
And then they notice you.

00:05:21.388 --> 00:05:23.623 align:middle line:84%
It's about if everyone's
walking straight, maybe you need

00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:25.926 align:middle line:84%
to raise a hand and
scream to the heavens.

00:05:25.926 --> 00:05:27.260 align:middle line:90%
But also, here's the thing.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.195 align:middle line:84%
You have personality
responsibility.

00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:30.764 align:middle line:84%
If you're sitting
in your house--

00:05:30.764 --> 00:05:32.098 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: You have to
make it happen.

00:05:32.098 --> 00:05:33.300 align:middle line:84%
>>Leanne Marrama: And yeah,
you have to make it happen.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.769 align:middle line:84%
You can't just sit on
your tush, light a candle

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:37.771 align:middle line:90%
on a Friday night, for love.

00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:38.605 align:middle line:90%
That's when it works.

00:05:38.605 --> 00:05:39.706 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: And expect it to happen.

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:40.974 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: And
expect it to happen.

00:05:40.974 --> 00:05:42.642 align:middle line:84%
You have to get out there
to meet people, you know.

00:05:42.642 --> 00:05:44.644 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: But it gives you
that glow, doesn't it?

00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:46.046 align:middle line:90%
That energy people can feel.

00:05:46.046 --> 00:05:48.081 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yeah, so
when you go out, you're noticed.

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:49.249 align:middle line:90%
You get noticed.

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:50.383 align:middle line:84%
This is my advice to
people who are really,

00:05:50.383 --> 00:05:51.918 align:middle line:90%
really working up love spells.

00:05:51.918 --> 00:05:54.821 align:middle line:84%
And if you're lonely out there,
you really want somebody,

00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:56.756 align:middle line:90%
don't just look for one person.

00:05:56.756 --> 00:05:57.791 align:middle line:90%
Look for the universe.

00:05:57.791 --> 00:05:59.859 align:middle line:84%
Draw everyone in,
as many as you can.

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:03.263 align:middle line:84%
And on Friday nights, light a
candle and celebrate yourself.

00:06:03.263 --> 00:06:06.433 align:middle line:84%
When you love yourself,
all the love

00:06:06.433 --> 00:06:07.467 align:middle line:90%
in the world will come to you.

00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:08.702 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
this is all about.

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:10.203 align:middle line:90%
This is why we're alive.

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:12.038 align:middle line:90%
We're alive for love.

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:15.809 align:middle line:90%
Everything else is just gravy.

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:16.710 align:middle line:90%
So get out there.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.811 align:middle line:90%
Go to the bar.

00:06:17.811 --> 00:06:19.312 align:middle line:90%
Meet people.

00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:20.981 align:middle line:84%
You know, maybe the
bar isn't your scene.

00:06:20.981 --> 00:06:22.315 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you need to
join a dating site.

00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:23.516 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Whatever.

00:06:23.516 --> 00:06:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Maybe
you need to do something.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.751 align:middle line:90%
Do whatever.

00:06:24.751 --> 00:06:25.719 align:middle line:90%
Get out there and live.

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:26.786 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: But you have
to do something.

00:06:26.786 --> 00:06:27.621 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Have to do something.

00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:28.555 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Same thing with a job.

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:29.623 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Damn straight.

00:06:29.623 --> 00:06:30.757 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: To position
yourself for the job,

00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:32.859 align:middle line:84%
you have to school
yourself, train yourself,

00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:35.528 align:middle line:84%
and maybe a little extra boost
from a witch might help, huh?

00:06:35.528 --> 00:06:36.796 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
It will, absolutely.

00:06:36.796 --> 00:06:39.633 align:middle line:90%
And I've seen people, you know.

00:06:39.633 --> 00:06:42.168 align:middle line:90%
Woman bought a candle.

00:06:42.168 --> 00:06:43.803 align:middle line:90%
Bought a mojo candle.

00:06:43.803 --> 00:06:46.206 align:middle line:84%
Came to me and said,
"It didn't work.

00:06:46.206 --> 00:06:47.240 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work."

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.608 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "Oh my god.

00:06:48.608 --> 00:06:50.110 align:middle line:90%
Show me the jobs you applied to.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.245 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we can figure out
what the situation is."

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:54.180 align:middle line:90%
She didn't apply for anything.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.749 align:middle line:84%
She thought the job was
going to come to her

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:56.549 align:middle line:90%
because she lit a candle.

00:06:56.549 --> 00:06:57.684 align:middle line:90%
That's ridiculous.

00:06:57.684 --> 00:06:58.785 align:middle line:90%
You have to get out there.

00:06:58.785 --> 00:07:00.520 align:middle line:84%
You have to apply for
a job to get a job.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.722 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Yet strange things
have happened, right?

00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:03.923 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Ah, yes.

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:05.659 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Case in point, let
me give you an example.

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:10.263 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you do a job curse for
someone to help them find a job.

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:14.367 align:middle line:90%
And somebody is driving, right.

00:07:14.367 --> 00:07:15.568 align:middle line:90%
They're driving.

00:07:15.568 --> 00:07:17.504 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're going to go
to the library and pick

00:07:17.504 --> 00:07:20.507 align:middle line:84%
up some information, and
they get a flat tire.

00:07:20.507 --> 00:07:23.476 align:middle line:84%
And then somebody stops and
helps you with that flat tire,

00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:27.480 align:middle line:84%
and it's a guy who's
looking for someone like you.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.682 align:middle line:90%
Did the curse do that?

00:07:28.682 --> 00:07:29.516 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Oh no, the blessing.

00:07:29.516 --> 00:07:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Or it was something else?

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:31.584 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Curses make jobs go away.

00:07:31.584 --> 00:07:32.786 align:middle line:90%
A job curse--

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:34.354 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Oh, so a curse
is always bad?

00:07:34.354 --> 00:07:35.921 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Curse is
always something negative.

00:07:35.921 --> 00:07:37.223 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Okay.

00:07:37.223 --> 00:07:38.491 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: You want
a job spell to draw it in.

00:07:38.491 --> 00:07:40.126 align:middle line:90%
you want a job blessing.

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:44.331 align:middle line:84%
So you did the job blessing, all
right, and yeah, that helped.

00:07:44.331 --> 00:07:45.332 align:middle line:90%
That helped.

00:07:45.332 --> 00:07:47.100 align:middle line:90%
And I do, I believe in magic.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.468 align:middle line:90%
That's what I think.

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:49.769 align:middle line:90%
I believe in magical things.

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:52.238 align:middle line:90%
I believe in miracles.

00:07:52.238 --> 00:07:53.573 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Synchronous everything.

00:07:53.573 --> 00:07:55.275 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: It's a
really, really, really sad world

00:07:55.275 --> 00:07:57.977 align:middle line:84%
if we stop believing
in miracles.

00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: So the good
things you call blessings?

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.247 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yes.

00:08:01.247 --> 00:08:03.616 align:middle line:84%
Curses are the bad
things that can happen.

00:08:03.616 --> 00:08:06.419 align:middle line:90%
It's not necessarily bad.

00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:09.989 align:middle line:84%
I'd have to say, you
know, I have cursed.

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:12.258 align:middle line:84%
I've cursed people, and
you know what I've found?

00:08:12.258 --> 00:08:14.027 align:middle line:90%
I've found the best solution,

00:08:14.027 --> 00:08:16.730 align:middle line:84%
better than cursing,
is to bind somebody.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.031 align:middle line:90%
I get better results.

00:08:18.031 --> 00:08:20.032 align:middle line:84%
I feel better about
myself in the day.

00:08:20.032 --> 00:08:22.969 align:middle line:84%
And what binding
is, it ties somebody

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:25.338 align:middle line:90%
up so they can't harm you.

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:27.272 align:middle line:84%
And you know what I
always add in there?

00:08:27.272 --> 00:08:29.175 align:middle line:90%
You can't harm yourself either.

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:31.244 align:middle line:84%
You know what, I'm just
going to send you away.

00:08:31.244 --> 00:08:36.282 align:middle line:84%
And you know, one of the most
significant curses you can give

00:08:36.282 --> 00:08:38.184 align:middle line:84%
to somebody is exactly
what they want.

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:40.253 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Let's say you go
out on a Friday night.

00:08:40.253 --> 00:08:42.589 align:middle line:84%
You go to your favorite
little lounge,

00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:45.158 align:middle line:84%
and you're sitting there
having a good time.

00:08:45.158 --> 00:08:48.795 align:middle line:84%
Do people come up to you
and say, "Are you a witch?"

00:08:48.795 --> 00:08:51.164 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Not
always, but sometimes.

00:08:51.164 --> 00:08:53.133 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: People who
know you, do they talk

00:08:53.133 --> 00:08:54.501 align:middle line:90%
about witchcraft with you?

00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:57.337 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: People who
know me who aren't witches.

00:08:57.337 --> 00:08:58.972 align:middle line:90%
I'm really fortunate.

00:08:58.972 --> 00:09:03.276 align:middle line:84%
I happen to live in the
city outside of Salem,

00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:04.944 align:middle line:84%
that I feel like
I'm very welcome.

00:09:04.944 --> 00:09:07.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, I went to
my class reunion.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.682 align:middle line:84%
Nobody was like,
"Oh, Leanne's weird."

00:09:09.682 --> 00:09:13.153 align:middle line:84%
I think that I kind of
fly under the radar.

00:09:13.153 --> 00:09:16.623 align:middle line:84%
I wear black a lot
but other than that,

00:09:16.623 --> 00:09:20.693 align:middle line:84%
I don't think people would
come up to me and say that.

00:09:20.693 --> 00:09:22.328 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Are most of
your friends witches?

00:09:22.328 --> 00:09:23.363 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: No.

00:09:23.363 --> 00:09:25.231 align:middle line:84%
I have a very large
group of friends.

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:29.169 align:middle line:84%
I'm a mother and my son's
involved in football.

00:09:29.169 --> 00:09:31.037 align:middle line:90%
I'm a family woman.

00:09:31.037 --> 00:09:32.705 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Do they introduce
you as a witch?

00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:33.339 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: No.

00:09:33.339 --> 00:09:34.207 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: They don't.

00:09:34.207 --> 00:09:35.575 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: They do not.

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:36.843 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Ah-ha.

00:09:36.843 --> 00:09:39.345 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: When
people do realize I'm a witch,

00:09:39.345 --> 00:09:41.981 align:middle line:84%
generally, they're nonplussed
or they book a psychic party.

00:09:41.981 --> 00:09:43.283 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter]

00:09:43.283 --> 00:09:45.819 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Let's say before they
even know you're a witch.

00:09:45.819 --> 00:09:49.189 align:middle line:84%
You come across as very
friendly, effervescent.

00:09:49.189 --> 00:09:50.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Thank you.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:52.692 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And so they figure,
"Wow, what a nice woman.

00:09:52.692 --> 00:09:53.326 align:middle line:90%
This is fun.

00:09:53.326 --> 00:09:54.527 align:middle line:90%
This is pleasant."

00:09:54.527 --> 00:09:58.198 align:middle line:84%
From the moment they
realize that you're a witch,

00:09:58.198 --> 00:10:01.201 align:middle line:84%
does their persona
change with you?

00:10:01.201 --> 00:10:01.901 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: No.

00:10:01.901 --> 00:10:03.203 align:middle line:90%
Only one thing happens

00:10:03.203 --> 00:10:05.738 align:middle line:84%
when people realize I'm a
witch, that are non-witches.

00:10:05.738 --> 00:10:07.740 align:middle line:84%
They generally ask
for spellwork.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:08.741 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: They do?

00:10:08.741 --> 00:10:09.542 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
They ask for help.

00:10:09.542 --> 00:10:10.577 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: They don't run away.

00:10:10.577 --> 00:10:11.244 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
They don't run away.

00:10:11.244 --> 00:10:12.078 align:middle line:90%
They need the witch.

00:10:12.078 --> 00:10:12.779 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: And what do they want?

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:14.047 align:middle line:90%
Blessings or curses?

00:10:14.047 --> 00:10:16.449 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Most
people want blessings, I find.

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:20.453 align:middle line:84%
I find that people want
love in their life.

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:24.023 align:middle line:84%
And the people that are looking
for curses that have come to me,

00:10:24.023 --> 00:10:27.160 align:middle line:84%
they've been dramatically
harmed, and they really,

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.829 align:middle line:84%
really need to go
through a process.

00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:33.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, to call it a
curse, it seems shallow.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.403 align:middle line:84%
Because what people do do is
they take all this emotion

00:10:37.403 --> 00:10:39.172 align:middle line:90%
of being so tragically harmed.

00:10:39.172 --> 00:10:43.309 align:middle line:84%
Because I will not do curses
unless it's justified.

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:44.110 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: I was going to say that.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:45.378 align:middle line:90%
Have you turned down people?

00:10:45.378 --> 00:10:48.781 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Yes, yes I have.

00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:49.649 align:middle line:90%
If somebody--

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:50.783 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Here's a thousand
dollars.

00:10:50.783 --> 00:10:53.987 align:middle line:84%
I want a curse on this
person I can't stand.

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:54.921 align:middle line:90%
Would you do it?

00:10:54.921 --> 00:10:55.588 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
No, not at all.

00:10:55.588 --> 00:10:56.289 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Two thousand.

00:10:56.289 --> 00:10:56.856 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: No.

00:10:56.856 --> 00:10:57.657 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Three.

00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:58.458 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Not even.

00:10:58.458 --> 00:11:00.093 align:middle line:90%
I have to live with myself.

00:11:00.093 --> 00:11:02.395 align:middle line:90%
That refusal is priceless.

00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:04.364 align:middle line:84%
I will not harm somebody
unless--

00:11:04.364 --> 00:11:05.064 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: A million?

00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:06.099 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: No.

00:11:06.099 --> 00:11:07.467 align:middle line:84%
no, I have to still
live with myself.

00:11:07.467 --> 00:11:09.035 align:middle line:90%
I have a whole life to live.

00:11:09.035 --> 00:11:10.003 align:middle line:90%
Money is nothing.

00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:12.305 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Have you ever
given a curse,

00:11:12.305 --> 00:11:13.439 align:middle line:90%
I want you to think about this--

00:11:13.439 --> 00:11:14.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yes.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.775 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: -- and somebody
really got hurt?

00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:17.176 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
I don't feel--

00:11:17.176 --> 00:11:19.312 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: You didn't expect to do
it like that, but it happened.

00:11:19.312 --> 00:11:22.115 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: The one
thing I have done isn't a curse,

00:11:22.115 --> 00:11:23.917 align:middle line:90%
was to send someone away.

00:11:23.917 --> 00:11:26.619 align:middle line:84%
I sent them away, and this
is my greatest regret.

00:11:26.619 --> 00:11:29.889 align:middle line:84%
I sent somebody away,
and that's my big thing.

00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:32.125 align:middle line:84%
Go away. Just go be
great somewhere else.

00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:35.528 align:middle line:90%
And then I missed them.

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:36.796 align:middle line:90%
So you have to think long

00:11:36.796 --> 00:11:39.566 align:middle line:84%
and hard before you send
someone away or bind them.

00:11:39.566 --> 00:11:42.835 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Can you bring them
back once you send them away?

00:11:42.835 --> 00:11:46.272 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: I think
it has to happen naturally.

00:11:46.272 --> 00:11:48.341 align:middle line:84%
I think it has to
play itself out.

00:11:48.341 --> 00:11:52.312 align:middle line:84%
And I think, in some
ways, I have to realize

00:11:52.312 --> 00:11:57.850 align:middle line:84%
that it's how you react to
trauma or stress or an argument

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:01.087 align:middle line:84%
or a fight or something
you don't like someone did.

00:12:01.087 --> 00:12:03.923 align:middle line:84%
It's more common of us
as people, you know.

00:12:03.923 --> 00:12:07.527 align:middle line:84%
Are you just going to just
throw everything with a curse?

00:12:07.527 --> 00:12:12.465 align:middle line:84%
First, always communicate
and see if any other ways.

00:12:12.465 --> 00:12:15.368 align:middle line:84%
I find that through
the years, I mean,

00:12:15.368 --> 00:12:17.203 align:middle line:90%
I think I've grown as a witch.

00:12:17.203 --> 00:12:19.272 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the first
thing we do try to do.

00:12:19.272 --> 00:12:20.340 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's important.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
I've grown as a witch.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.875 align:middle line:90%
I don't like to curse.

00:12:22.875 --> 00:12:25.445 align:middle line:90%
I find it weird now.

00:12:25.445 --> 00:12:26.846 align:middle line:90%
I like to heal.

00:12:26.846 --> 00:12:30.583 align:middle line:84%
I find that relationships, right
before you take out that dagger

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:33.453 align:middle line:84%
to end a relationship
and curse somebody,

00:12:33.453 --> 00:12:36.956 align:middle line:84%
first try to heal it first
and first try to walk away.

00:12:36.956 --> 00:12:39.692 align:middle line:90%
And then first try to banish.

00:12:39.692 --> 00:12:42.161 align:middle line:90%
Cursing should not even be.

00:12:42.161 --> 00:12:43.930 align:middle line:90%
Just walk away from the person.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.965 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Beyond Belief, of
course, is interactive,

00:12:45.965 --> 00:12:49.302 align:middle line:84%
so let's go to one of
our viewer phone calls.

00:12:49.302 --> 00:12:50.637 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, this is Axana
[assumed spelling].

00:12:50.637 --> 00:12:54.741 align:middle line:84%
I wondered, at what age did
you realize you are a witch?

00:12:54.741 --> 00:12:56.242 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: What a great
accent she had, huh?

00:12:56.242 --> 00:12:57.377 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: That
was a beautiful accent.

00:12:57.377 --> 00:12:58.244 align:middle line:90%
You sound hot, honey.

00:12:58.244 --> 00:12:59.245 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That was a witch accent.

00:12:59.245 --> 00:13:00.013 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Yeah, that was.

00:13:00.013 --> 00:13:02.949 align:middle line:90%
That's magical in itself.

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:04.050 align:middle line:90%
Let me say.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:06.486 align:middle line:84%
I realized I was a witch
probably when I was

00:13:06.486 --> 00:13:10.823 align:middle line:84%
about in high school, in junior
high kind of puberty age.

00:13:10.823 --> 00:13:14.027 align:middle line:84%
I started to have
really strange dreams.

00:13:14.027 --> 00:13:19.432 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was
the dead coming to me.

00:13:19.432 --> 00:13:22.635 align:middle line:90%
Dreaming was the first place

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:24.437 align:middle line:84%
because I believe
I was traveling

00:13:24.437 --> 00:13:29.108 align:middle line:84%
and I got really
connected to a book I read.

00:13:29.108 --> 00:13:30.443 align:middle line:84%
And I was very young
at the time.

00:13:30.443 --> 00:13:32.512 align:middle line:84%
And it was called "Power of
the Witch" by Laurie Cabot,

00:13:32.512 --> 00:13:34.013 align:middle line:90%
and it was phenomenal.

00:13:34.013 --> 00:13:35.515 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: "Power of the Witch."

00:13:35.515 --> 00:13:36.849 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
"Power of the Witch."

00:13:36.849 --> 00:13:40.086 align:middle line:84%
Everybody had talked about
there was a witch in all of us.

00:13:40.086 --> 00:13:42.655 align:middle line:84%
And I realized there
was one inside of me,

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:46.659 align:middle line:84%
and then I realized that my
mother [inaudible] for fun

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:48.995 align:middle line:84%
to row cards, not
professionally.

00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:54.100 align:middle line:84%
But my family kind of played
with the metaphysical, you know.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.003 align:middle line:84%
Good Catholic people, but
played with the metaphysical

00:13:57.003 --> 00:14:03.009 align:middle line:84%
on the side, and you'll find a
lot of you out there do that.

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:05.778 align:middle line:84%
Some of the things,
especially Italian, you know,

00:14:05.778 --> 00:14:07.080 align:middle line:84%
the Malocchio [assumed
spelling] and all that,

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.815 align:middle line:90%
that's not church sanctified.

00:14:08.815 --> 00:14:11.818 align:middle line:84%
That's dabbling with the
dark gods there, you know.

00:14:11.818 --> 00:14:15.788 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: What is the big kettle
that you see so many witches

00:14:15.788 --> 00:14:19.225 align:middle line:84%
in books and in Hollywood,
again, brewing?

00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:20.293 align:middle line:90%
What do you guys--

00:14:20.293 --> 00:14:21.761 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Oh, that's a cauldron

00:14:21.761 --> 00:14:23.863 align:middle line:90%
and it's a lot like cooking.

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:25.598 align:middle line:90%
Spells remind me of cooking.

00:14:25.598 --> 00:14:26.999 align:middle line:84%
When people ask me
about spellwork,

00:14:26.999 --> 00:14:28.201 align:middle line:90%
it reminds me of cooking.

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:29.836 align:middle line:84%
You got a recipe, you're
going to put it in there.

00:14:29.836 --> 00:14:31.037 align:middle line:90%
You're going to mix it up

00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:32.338 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
put energy in it.

00:14:32.338 --> 00:14:33.172 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Eyes of newt.

00:14:33.172 --> 00:14:33.873 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: And all that.

00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:34.674 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: This and that.

00:14:34.674 --> 00:14:35.808 align:middle line:90%
You put that stuff in there?

00:14:35.808 --> 00:14:37.009 align:middle line:90%
Spiders?

00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:38.277 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Well,
not so much spiders.

00:14:38.277 --> 00:14:39.512 align:middle line:90%
I'm afraid of spiders.

00:14:39.512 --> 00:14:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: A witch who's
afraid of spiders?

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.582 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Yes, and snakes too.

00:14:42.582 --> 00:14:44.050 align:middle line:90%
It's awful.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:45.284 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I'm not a fan
of snakes either.

00:14:45.284 --> 00:14:46.719 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yeah,
it's just they slither.

00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:48.187 align:middle line:90%
But it's okay.

00:14:48.187 --> 00:14:49.522 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: We did bring you
a little present though.

00:14:49.522 --> 00:14:50.823 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Oh,
please don't tell me a snake.

00:14:50.823 --> 00:14:52.191 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Yes, a little
boa constrictor.

00:14:52.191 --> 00:14:53.226 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Oh
god, that's horrible.

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:54.327 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And you're
going to hold it.

00:14:54.327 --> 00:14:54.994 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: I'll
have to [inaudible].

00:14:54.994 --> 00:14:55.695 align:middle line:90%
Then I'm going to--

00:14:55.695 --> 00:14:56.529 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Give it a spell.

00:14:56.529 --> 00:14:57.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: -- zap you.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.431 align:middle line:90%
That's not going to--

00:14:58.431 --> 00:14:59.365 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: You would put a
curse on me, wouldn't you?

00:14:59.365 --> 00:15:00.066 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Yeah, I would.

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:01.200 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, that's not--

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: So what is in
that stuff, that kettle?

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.037 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: It depends.

00:15:05.037 --> 00:15:06.539 align:middle line:84%
It depends what the
spell requires.

00:15:06.539 --> 00:15:08.574 align:middle line:84%
Each spell requires
different ingredients.

00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:11.477 align:middle line:84%
If I was going to make a
love spell or a love mixture,

00:15:11.477 --> 00:15:14.380 align:middle line:84%
I would add things that
made me feel loved.

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.182 align:middle line:90%
Roses. Hibiscus.

00:15:16.182 --> 00:15:18.251 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful flowers
with fragrant scents.

00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:19.318 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Lavenders.

00:15:19.318 --> 00:15:20.953 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Lavender, to relax you.

00:15:20.953 --> 00:15:21.988 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful things.

00:15:21.988 --> 00:15:23.556 align:middle line:84%
And I'd put it in
there and I would--

00:15:23.556 --> 00:15:24.791 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Boil it up.

00:15:24.791 --> 00:15:26.459 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Cook it up.

00:15:26.459 --> 00:15:31.297 align:middle line:84%
You can burn it, let
it rise to the heavens.

00:15:31.297 --> 00:15:32.899 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: What kind of toys
did you bring us here?

00:15:32.899 --> 00:15:33.699 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: All right.

00:15:33.699 --> 00:15:34.767 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: What do we have here?

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:35.535 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Well, we have something

00:15:35.535 --> 00:15:36.469 align:middle line:90%
so we can make a mojo bag.

00:15:36.469 --> 00:15:38.971 align:middle line:84%
We have white sage
for protection.

00:15:38.971 --> 00:15:41.507 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I have heard
that sage helps get rid

00:15:41.507 --> 00:15:43.209 align:middle line:90%
of evil spirits in the house.

00:15:43.209 --> 00:15:45.711 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yes
it does, and negativity.

00:15:45.711 --> 00:15:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is something I
want you to carry with you.

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:48.581 align:middle line:90%
It's for travel.

00:15:48.581 --> 00:15:49.949 align:middle line:90%
It's a protection mojo bag.

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:51.450 align:middle line:90%
And it's not just protection.

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.186 align:middle line:90%
It's everything.

00:15:53.186 --> 00:15:55.254 align:middle line:90%
We have wolf hair here.

00:15:55.254 --> 00:15:58.858 align:middle line:84%
It's from a wolf, and
it was taken harmlessly.

00:15:58.858 --> 00:16:02.695 align:middle line:84%
And yes, witches
respect above all.

00:16:02.695 --> 00:16:04.263 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: And what will this do?

00:16:04.263 --> 00:16:05.431 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
This is for protection.

00:16:05.431 --> 00:16:07.667 align:middle line:90%
And you get a silver mojo bag.

00:16:07.667 --> 00:16:09.068 align:middle line:84%
Silver because we're
going to work

00:16:09.068 --> 00:16:10.169 align:middle line:90%
with the energy of the moon.

00:16:10.169 --> 00:16:14.307 align:middle line:84%
We're going to make
something for George.

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:15.708 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Going to turn
me in a werewolf.

00:16:15.708 --> 00:16:16.943 align:middle line:90%
[Howling sounds]

00:16:16.943 --> 00:16:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Nah, this
is going to protect you.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:18.711 align:middle line:90%
You fly a lot.

00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:21.314 align:middle line:84%
And we're all traveling
and it's scary out there.

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:24.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put a little
sage because sage banishes--

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:25.718 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I will not be
able to get through TSA

00:16:25.718 --> 00:16:26.886 align:middle line:90%
with one of these things.

00:16:26.886 --> 00:16:28.321 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] I'm telling you.

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:30.289 align:middle line:90%
I'll probably get arrested.

00:16:30.289 --> 00:16:32.191 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Well,
then put it in your suitcase.

00:16:32.191 --> 00:16:35.862 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: We'll have to have it
analyzed before I go through.

00:16:35.862 --> 00:16:37.463 align:middle line:90%
She's setting me up, isn't she?

00:16:37.463 --> 00:16:38.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yeah,
I'm just [inaudible].

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.232 align:middle line:90%
What can I tell you?

00:16:39.232 --> 00:16:40.466 align:middle line:90%
This is tiger's eye.

00:16:40.466 --> 00:16:42.168 align:middle line:84%
It's going to keep away any
negativity and jealousy.

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:43.436 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: All right.

00:16:43.436 --> 00:16:45.638 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: See,
because some of the negativity.

00:16:45.638 --> 00:16:48.774 align:middle line:84%
One of the worst evils
in the world is not evil.

00:16:48.774 --> 00:16:50.376 align:middle line:90%
It's not like we think.

00:16:50.376 --> 00:16:51.711 align:middle line:90%
It's jealousy.

00:16:51.711 --> 00:16:55.381 align:middle line:84%
And say, if you ever get into
a situation where you feel

00:16:55.381 --> 00:16:57.450 align:middle line:84%
like you have a good thing going
and somebody else wants to rain

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:59.919 align:middle line:84%
on your parade, this is
why I'm giving this to you.

00:16:59.919 --> 00:17:01.254 align:middle line:90%
So nobody rains on your parade.

00:17:01.254 --> 00:17:05.357 align:middle line:84%
[Inaudible] It will protect
from jealousy and negativity

00:17:05.357 --> 00:17:07.293 align:middle line:84%
and just crappy stuff,
crappy people.

00:17:07.293 --> 00:17:10.162 align:middle line:84%
Go away. Because we all
need positive people

00:17:10.162 --> 00:17:13.065 align:middle line:90%
and we all need good energy.

00:17:13.065 --> 00:17:15.067 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: My little bag.

00:17:15.067 --> 00:17:16.102 align:middle line:90%
What do you call it?

00:17:16.102 --> 00:17:17.503 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
This is a mojo bag,

00:17:17.503 --> 00:17:20.339 align:middle line:84%
and I have put [inaudible]
in it.

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:21.674 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Okay.

00:17:21.674 --> 00:17:28.114 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: There's
vegetable, mineral and animal.

00:17:28.114 --> 00:17:30.783 align:middle line:90%
So from the animal, I've--

00:17:30.783 --> 00:17:31.984 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: A wolf hair.

00:17:31.984 --> 00:17:32.752 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Wolf hair.

00:17:32.752 --> 00:17:34.020 align:middle line:90%
Once again, taken humanly.

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:35.288 align:middle line:90%
And some sage.

00:17:35.288 --> 00:17:36.088 align:middle line:90%
And a tiger's eye.

00:17:36.088 --> 00:17:38.524 align:middle line:90%
And the energy of this bag.

00:17:38.524 --> 00:17:41.027 align:middle line:84%
See, and I'm going
to charge it for you.

00:17:41.027 --> 00:17:43.896 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put some
energy in it, all right.

00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:47.967 align:middle line:90%
I put in this bag protection.

00:17:49.201 --> 00:17:53.506 align:middle line:84%
May nothing harm you
or those you love.

00:17:53.506 --> 00:17:55.441 align:middle line:90%
And great success.

00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:56.809 align:middle line:90%
Here.

00:17:56.809 --> 00:17:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Now, do I have to keep
that on my body all the time

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:58.911 align:middle line:84%
or do you just put
it away somewhere?

00:17:58.911 --> 00:18:00.313 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Some
people put it away.

00:18:00.313 --> 00:18:02.181 align:middle line:90%
It's best to carry it with you.

00:18:02.181 --> 00:18:06.185 align:middle line:84%
Most of us carry these mojo bags
on us on the left-hand side.

00:18:06.185 --> 00:18:08.688 align:middle line:84%
Some people who don't want to
carry stuff around carry it

00:18:08.688 --> 00:18:10.556 align:middle line:84%
in your bedroom, put
it under your mattress.

00:18:10.556 --> 00:18:13.926 align:middle line:84%
So when you sleep, you
sleep without being cursed.

00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:14.727 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: All right.

00:18:14.727 --> 00:18:15.561 align:middle line:90%
What else do we have there?

00:18:15.561 --> 00:18:18.664 align:middle line:90%
What are these statues there?

00:18:18.664 --> 00:18:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: These
are binding statues.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.001 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Candles?

00:18:22.001 --> 00:18:22.868 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yes.

00:18:22.868 --> 00:18:24.470 align:middle line:90%
It's a man and a woman.

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:29.675 align:middle line:84%
If somebody wants to harm you,
what you do is you can tie

00:18:29.675 --> 00:18:31.844 align:middle line:90%
up the candle, and very safely.

00:18:31.844 --> 00:18:34.113 align:middle line:84%
Listen. The universe is
never going to help you

00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:36.048 align:middle line:84%
if you're leaving
a candle unattended

00:18:36.048 --> 00:18:40.052 align:middle line:84%
because it's carelessness and
you'll burn your house down.

00:18:40.052 --> 00:18:45.958 align:middle line:84%
So you write the name of the
person that has caused you grief

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.426 align:middle line:90%
on the back of the candle.

00:18:47.426 --> 00:18:54.367 align:middle line:84%
You bind it to first tie them up
so they can't harm you anymore.

00:18:54.367 --> 00:18:55.768 align:middle line:90%
And then you burn it.

00:18:55.768 --> 00:19:03.142 align:middle line:84%
And you say, as it's burning,
"Like the wax of this candle.

00:19:03.142 --> 00:19:06.379 align:middle line:84%
Like the wax of this
candle disappears,

00:19:06.379 --> 00:19:08.381 align:middle line:90%
so will you from my life.

00:19:08.381 --> 00:19:10.483 align:middle line:84%
Go away and be great
somewhere else."

00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:13.185 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I had heard that candles
come in different colors,

00:19:13.185 --> 00:19:15.788 align:middle line:84%
and they all mean
something different.

00:19:15.788 --> 00:19:17.256 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Absolutely they do.

00:19:17.256 --> 00:19:20.660 align:middle line:84%
Black is for banishing
negativity or getting rid

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:23.696 align:middle line:84%
of something or to
bind or to hex.

00:19:23.696 --> 00:19:28.134 align:middle line:84%
Red is for passion,
at times for sex.

00:19:28.134 --> 00:19:30.670 align:middle line:84%
I like to add a lot of
red energy with love too.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:31.737 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You wouldn't happen

00:19:31.737 --> 00:19:33.039 align:middle line:84%
to have a red candle
with you, would you?

00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:35.808 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
No, I'm sorry, no.

00:19:35.808 --> 00:19:36.842 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: I didn't think so.

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:37.476 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Okay.

00:19:37.476 --> 00:19:39.145 align:middle line:90%
Pink is for love.

00:19:39.145 --> 00:19:43.215 align:middle line:84%
Some use green and gold
for money or creativity.

00:19:43.215 --> 00:19:46.152 align:middle line:90%
And blue for healing powers

00:19:46.152 --> 00:19:48.721 align:middle line:84%
or psychic abilities
with a deep purple.

00:19:48.721 --> 00:19:51.457 align:middle line:84%
Every color represents
a different thing.

00:19:51.457 --> 00:19:54.293 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people use brown to
protect their special animals,

00:19:54.293 --> 00:19:57.063 align:middle line:84%
their little furry friends
that are like family to us.

00:19:57.063 --> 00:19:59.665 align:middle line:84%
Don't forget them in your
protection magic as well.

00:19:59.665 --> 00:20:00.633 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Interesting.

00:20:00.633 --> 00:20:02.101 align:middle line:84%
I was raised a Catholic,
as you were.

00:20:02.101 --> 00:20:03.469 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yes.

00:20:03.469 --> 00:20:06.338 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And in the church, you
could go and light candles.

00:20:06.338 --> 00:20:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yes.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:11.077 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And you would pray, you
know, for someone at a candle.

00:20:11.077 --> 00:20:14.346 align:middle line:84%
Interesting ritual, and it
seems like it's fluent in,

00:20:14.346 --> 00:20:15.381 align:middle line:90%
you know, different things.

00:20:15.381 --> 00:20:16.715 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Do you see

00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:21.387 align:middle line:84%
where religions are more alike
each other than different?

00:20:21.387 --> 00:20:25.124 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I know
witchcraft isn't evil.

00:20:25.124 --> 00:20:27.159 align:middle line:90%
It is not an evil religion.

00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:32.164 align:middle line:84%
The first religion on
this earth was paganism,

00:20:32.164 --> 00:20:34.333 align:middle line:84%
because the first thing
we did when we came

00:20:34.333 --> 00:20:38.471 align:middle line:84%
out of the world was
to look up at the sun--

00:20:38.471 --> 00:20:39.605 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: And worship the stars.

00:20:39.605 --> 00:20:40.739 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
And worship the stars.

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:42.241 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Fascinating.

00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:43.576 align:middle line:90%
Are you also a medium?

00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:44.376 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yes, I am.

00:20:44.376 --> 00:20:46.946 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Tell me about that.

00:20:46.946 --> 00:20:49.982 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: I talk
to the dead or I feel them.

00:20:49.982 --> 00:20:55.387 align:middle line:84%
Being a medium is something
that came later to me.

00:20:55.387 --> 00:21:00.893 align:middle line:84%
I had done psychic
readings, amazing tarot work.

00:21:00.893 --> 00:21:05.197 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to be a medium.

00:21:05.197 --> 00:21:06.031 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You did not?

00:21:06.031 --> 00:21:06.899 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: I did not.

00:21:06.899 --> 00:21:08.200 align:middle line:90%
It's a very emotional thing.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.803 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Are you glad you are now?

00:21:10.803 --> 00:21:12.071 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
At times I am.

00:21:12.071 --> 00:21:13.906 align:middle line:84%
There's so much grief in
the world and death is

00:21:13.906 --> 00:21:17.643 align:middle line:84%
such a terrifying
topic for people

00:21:17.643 --> 00:21:20.446 align:middle line:84%
that people have a
hard time realizing

00:21:20.446 --> 00:21:23.983 align:middle line:84%
that their dead probably don't
have a whole lot of message,

00:21:23.983 --> 00:21:27.620 align:middle line:84%
other than that they love
them and that they're okay.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:32.725 align:middle line:84%
The dead do validate and
let them know they're there.

00:21:32.725 --> 00:21:34.660 align:middle line:90%
That's basically their message.

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is, if you
lose somebody you love so much,

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:39.899 align:middle line:90%
you become addicted to it.

00:21:39.899 --> 00:21:42.201 align:middle line:84%
And I think, you know,
you get your one message

00:21:42.201 --> 00:21:44.503 align:middle line:90%
and that soul has to move on.

00:21:44.503 --> 00:21:47.373 align:middle line:84%
That soul has to go
do what the dead do.

00:21:47.373 --> 00:21:49.441 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Right, and sometimes
we don't want that to happen.

00:21:49.441 --> 00:21:50.276 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: No, we don't.

00:21:50.276 --> 00:21:52.678 align:middle line:90%
We want the curses to be alive.

00:21:52.678 --> 00:21:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: We don't want
them to leave.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:58.417 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yeah, the
curses to be alive, not to die.

00:21:58.417 --> 00:21:59.952 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Why hauntings?

00:21:59.952 --> 00:22:02.588 align:middle line:90%
Why are some spirits benevolent

00:22:02.588 --> 00:22:04.557 align:middle line:84%
and others haunt
the heck out of us?

00:22:04.557 --> 00:22:06.892 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: I
think because the spirits

00:22:06.892 --> 00:22:10.930 align:middle line:84%
that haunt want what we all
want, is to be remembered.

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:14.767 align:middle line:84%
And I think those who
haunt want attention.

00:22:14.767 --> 00:22:17.670 align:middle line:90%
I am not a ghost hunter, per se,

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:20.506 align:middle line:84%
but I have felt frustrated
spirits.

00:22:20.506 --> 00:22:25.244 align:middle line:84%
And what they want is just to be
remembered and to acknowledge.

00:22:25.244 --> 00:22:28.047 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes a haunted
place is a place

00:22:28.047 --> 00:22:29.381 align:middle line:90%
where great tragedy happened.

00:22:29.381 --> 00:22:33.252 align:middle line:84%
And what that does is it
changes the energy of a place.

00:22:33.252 --> 00:22:34.753 align:middle line:84%
There's a thing called
spirit of place.

00:22:34.753 --> 00:22:36.822 align:middle line:84%
Every place, this
place, has a spirit.

00:22:36.822 --> 00:22:38.224 align:middle line:90%
It has an energy.

00:22:38.224 --> 00:22:43.696 align:middle line:84%
When something horrible happens,
it creates a wound in the place,

00:22:43.696 --> 00:22:46.999 align:middle line:84%
and that becomes like a
vacuum that collects souls.

00:22:46.999 --> 00:22:51.604 align:middle line:84%
And that becomes a place of
hauntings, where people get hurt

00:22:51.604 --> 00:22:53.405 align:middle line:90%
and they get frightened.

00:22:53.405 --> 00:22:55.941 align:middle line:84%
But like my mama always told
me, don't fear the dead.

00:22:55.941 --> 00:22:57.876 align:middle line:84%
It's only the living
that can truly hurt you.

00:22:57.876 --> 00:22:59.078 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Well, mama was right.

00:22:59.078 --> 00:22:59.645 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yeah.

00:22:59.645 --> 00:23:00.446 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: I think.

00:23:00.446 --> 00:23:01.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: I do too.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.715 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Are you glad though,
you have this balance

00:23:02.715 --> 00:23:04.416 align:middle line:84%
between witchcraft
and being a medium?

00:23:04.416 --> 00:23:05.584 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yes, I do,

00:23:05.584 --> 00:23:07.686 align:middle line:84%
because I can say this
about being a medium.

00:23:07.686 --> 00:23:11.724 align:middle line:84%
I want everyone to know here,
there, everywhere in the world,

00:23:11.724 --> 00:23:13.659 align:middle line:90%
that there is life after death.

00:23:13.659 --> 00:23:18.063 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's more
of a mission, I feel,

00:23:18.063 --> 00:23:24.336 align:middle line:84%
to show people not to fear
death and to look at it,

00:23:24.336 --> 00:23:26.405 align:middle line:84%
to see it in its
face for what it is.

00:23:26.405 --> 00:23:27.473 align:middle line:90%
It's transition.

00:23:27.473 --> 00:23:29.174 align:middle line:90%
You fear the unknown.

00:23:29.174 --> 00:23:30.242 align:middle line:90%
It's okay.

00:23:30.242 --> 00:23:31.343 align:middle line:90%
You're going to live.

00:23:31.343 --> 00:23:33.746 align:middle line:90%
And there is life after death.

00:23:33.746 --> 00:23:36.382 align:middle line:84%
I honor people in October
with this event I run

00:23:36.382 --> 00:23:37.583 align:middle line:90%
with my friend Heather.

00:23:37.583 --> 00:23:40.452 align:middle line:84%
It's called the Mourning
Tea, in which people come

00:23:40.452 --> 00:23:46.158 align:middle line:84%
and they bring stories of their
beloved dead, and they purge all

00:23:46.158 --> 00:23:49.061 align:middle line:84%
of the things that,
you know, they've held.

00:23:49.061 --> 00:23:50.863 align:middle line:84%
And they share it
with strangers,

00:23:50.863 --> 00:23:54.700 align:middle line:84%
because this is how
immortality truly is.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:59.305 align:middle line:84%
You say the name of your dead,
and they come right to you.

00:23:59.305 --> 00:24:01.907 align:middle line:84%
You know, I show you
candles and a little

00:24:01.907 --> 00:24:02.975 align:middle line:90%
of this and a little of that.

00:24:02.975 --> 00:24:04.543 align:middle line:90%
That just gives it more energy.

00:24:04.543 --> 00:24:07.446 align:middle line:84%
But if you truly want
somebody you love and you miss,

00:24:07.446 --> 00:24:09.315 align:middle line:84%
just say their name
and they'll be here.

00:24:09.315 --> 00:24:11.784 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Are you more a
witch than a medium?

00:24:11.784 --> 00:24:13.919 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: I'm a witch
who happens to be a medium.

00:24:13.919 --> 00:24:15.187 align:middle line:90%
Witchcraft is my religion.

00:24:15.187 --> 00:24:16.722 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: You're not a medium
who happens to be a witch?

00:24:16.722 --> 00:24:17.423 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yes.

00:24:17.423 --> 00:24:18.223 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Although you--

00:24:18.223 --> 00:24:19.325 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: You know,

00:24:19.325 --> 00:24:21.794 align:middle line:84%
witches don't have
to be psychic.

00:24:21.794 --> 00:24:24.196 align:middle line:84%
Witches don't have
to be mediums.

00:24:24.196 --> 00:24:26.332 align:middle line:90%
That's just a path.

00:24:26.332 --> 00:24:29.034 align:middle line:84%
And when you walk into
any spiritual path,

00:24:29.034 --> 00:24:33.339 align:middle line:84%
any spiritual path whatsoever,
once you really get into it

00:24:33.339 --> 00:24:35.307 align:middle line:84%
and really believe
and really read

00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:36.875 align:middle line:84%
and really study
all your faiths.

00:24:36.875 --> 00:24:38.844 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if
it's witchcraft or not.

00:24:38.844 --> 00:24:41.313 align:middle line:84%
If you truly, truly study
a faith, you're going

00:24:41.313 --> 00:24:42.915 align:middle line:90%
to unlock something in yourself.

00:24:42.915 --> 00:24:44.149 align:middle line:90%
Something godly.

00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:45.617 align:middle line:90%
Something amazing.

00:24:45.617 --> 00:24:46.985 align:middle line:90%
And it might be psychic ability.

00:24:46.985 --> 00:24:48.354 align:middle line:90%
It might be healing ability.

00:24:48.354 --> 00:24:50.856 align:middle line:90%
It might be mediumship.

00:24:50.856 --> 00:24:52.991 align:middle line:90%
It may be just whatever.

00:24:52.991 --> 00:24:56.528 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that human beings,
we need to have the mundane

00:24:56.528 --> 00:24:58.764 align:middle line:84%
and the spiritual
balanced inside

00:24:58.764 --> 00:25:00.599 align:middle line:90%
of us first to be phenomenal.

00:25:00.599 --> 00:25:02.801 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And now, let's go to
one of our viewer questions.

00:25:02.801 --> 00:25:04.937 align:middle line:84%
>> Hey, this is Edward
[assumed spelling].

00:25:04.937 --> 00:25:07.606 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to know, can
anyone have the ability

00:25:07.606 --> 00:25:09.141 align:middle line:90%
to cast a spell?

00:25:09.141 --> 00:25:10.142 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Nah.

00:25:10.142 --> 00:25:11.510 align:middle line:84%
You have to be a
witch to cast a spell.

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:12.811 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Absolutely not,

00:25:12.811 --> 00:25:14.113 align:middle line:84%
and that's a great question,
Edward [assumed spelling].

00:25:14.113 --> 00:25:15.247 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:25:15.247 --> 00:25:17.950 align:middle line:90%
Anybody can cast a spell.

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:19.952 align:middle line:84%
All you need is to
know your supplies.

00:25:19.952 --> 00:25:21.353 align:middle line:90%
And know what you want.

00:25:21.353 --> 00:25:26.325 align:middle line:84%
And know if what you
want is safe, okay.

00:25:26.325 --> 00:25:29.962 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Some people
are possessed.

00:25:29.962 --> 00:25:33.766 align:middle line:90%
Do you use anything, spells,

00:25:33.766 --> 00:25:36.201 align:middle line:84%
to try to rid them
of that possession?

00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:37.302 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Okay,

00:25:37.302 --> 00:25:39.738 align:middle line:84%
some people can have
spirit enter their body

00:25:39.738 --> 00:25:42.674 align:middle line:84%
and have a very difficult
time in getting it out.

00:25:42.674 --> 00:25:47.146 align:middle line:84%
Possession is a horrible,
horrible thing that happens

00:25:47.146 --> 00:25:48.447 align:middle line:90%
to people across the world.

00:25:48.447 --> 00:25:53.752 align:middle line:84%
I have used different types
of blended incense I used

00:25:53.752 --> 00:25:59.625 align:middle line:84%
to help relieve a human
being of evil spirits.

00:26:00.993 --> 00:26:03.962 align:middle line:84%
Also, before somebody comes
to me and says, "This person,

00:26:03.962 --> 00:26:05.664 align:middle line:84%
I know there's something
in there."

00:26:05.664 --> 00:26:08.700 align:middle line:84%
I believe in a strong
psychological evaluation.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.135 align:middle line:90%
I'm a practical witch.

00:26:10.135 --> 00:26:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: You are a
practical witch.

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:12.604 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: I'm a
very, very practical witch.

00:26:12.604 --> 00:26:15.607 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: So you want the
mentally checked out first.

00:26:15.607 --> 00:26:16.742 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: I want
them mentally checked out.

00:26:16.742 --> 00:26:20.112 align:middle line:84%
I want to know if this
person's mentally ill.

00:26:20.112 --> 00:26:24.883 align:middle line:84%
The mental health area is just
as fascinating and strange

00:26:24.883 --> 00:26:26.885 align:middle line:90%
as witchcraft in itself.

00:26:26.885 --> 00:26:29.521 align:middle line:84%
You have to first check
out the mental health.

00:26:29.521 --> 00:26:30.889 align:middle line:90%
That's my first test.

00:26:30.889 --> 00:26:33.725 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Do you believe everyone
who comes up to you in that?

00:26:33.725 --> 00:26:35.794 align:middle line:84%
You know, they might say,
"Oh, I see dead people."

00:26:35.794 --> 00:26:36.595 align:middle line:90%
I mean, do you believe--

00:26:36.595 --> 00:26:37.429 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: No.

00:26:37.429 --> 00:26:38.263 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: -- them at face value?

00:26:38.263 --> 00:26:39.531 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: No, I don't.

00:26:39.531 --> 00:26:40.732 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Or do you think, "Yeah,
something's wrong here"?

00:26:40.732 --> 00:26:42.901 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Sometimes people are not well.

00:26:42.901 --> 00:26:44.303 align:middle line:90%
This is an unusual faith.

00:26:44.303 --> 00:26:46.238 align:middle line:84%
I talk to dead people
for a living.

00:26:46.238 --> 00:26:49.842 align:middle line:84%
I don't always get really,
really sane people in my life.

00:26:49.842 --> 00:26:51.810 align:middle line:90%
And I like my quirky people.

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:55.948 align:middle line:84%
But I have to say, if someone
is really harming themselves,

00:26:55.948 --> 00:26:57.282 align:middle line:90%
and really.

00:26:57.282 --> 00:26:59.251 align:middle line:84%
You know, you see some of this
exorcism stuff and you say

00:26:59.251 --> 00:27:02.354 align:middle line:84%
to yourself, "Is it faith
or do I go to science?"

00:27:02.354 --> 00:27:04.523 align:middle line:90%
I say do both.

00:27:04.523 --> 00:27:05.257 align:middle line:90%
Do both.

00:27:05.257 --> 00:27:06.091 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It's safer.

00:27:06.091 --> 00:27:06.792 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: It's safer.

00:27:06.792 --> 00:27:07.826 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It's safer.

00:27:07.826 --> 00:27:08.594 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
And it's healthier.

00:27:08.594 --> 00:27:09.428 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: What is this soap?

00:27:09.428 --> 00:27:10.262 align:middle line:90%
I've had my eyes on this thing.

00:27:10.262 --> 00:27:11.296 align:middle line:90%
What is this for?

00:27:11.296 --> 00:27:12.364 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Oh, I wanted to talk

00:27:12.364 --> 00:27:14.032 align:middle line:84%
about washing negativity
off of you, okay.

00:27:14.032 --> 00:27:14.867 align:middle line:90%
So sometimes--

00:27:14.867 --> 00:27:15.801 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: I like that.

00:27:15.801 --> 00:27:16.468 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Yeah, we have--

00:27:16.468 --> 00:27:17.736 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Hold that up.

00:27:17.736 --> 00:27:18.871 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: --
different types of soap, okay.

00:27:18.871 --> 00:27:21.006 align:middle line:84%
And this one is called
Halloween Dreams.

00:27:21.006 --> 00:27:23.775 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's just
a fun, quirky title.

00:27:23.775 --> 00:27:24.510 align:middle line:90%
And it does.

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:26.178 align:middle line:90%
It smells like pumpkin.

00:27:26.178 --> 00:27:29.214 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at the
elements that are in this, sage,

00:27:29.214 --> 00:27:31.917 align:middle line:84%
cinnamon, it's what
can draw into you.

00:27:31.917 --> 00:27:35.454 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling people to
wash and cleanse your body

00:27:35.454 --> 00:27:37.990 align:middle line:84%
and spirit before
you do any spellwork.

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:41.460 align:middle line:84%
If so, if you're going to do a
spell, make sure you're clean.

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.996 align:middle line:84%
Make sure the outside is
as clean as the inside,

00:27:43.996 --> 00:27:46.532 align:middle line:90%
because it has to work.

00:27:46.532 --> 00:27:47.499 align:middle line:90%
I believe in cleaning.

00:27:47.499 --> 00:27:49.101 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, this is good stuff, yeah.

00:27:49.101 --> 00:27:50.869 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Let me see that stuff.

00:27:50.869 --> 00:27:52.437 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: This is
another thing to get rid

00:27:52.437 --> 00:27:54.106 align:middle line:90%
of negativity in your life.

00:27:54.106 --> 00:27:55.140 align:middle line:90%
These are coffin nails.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:56.608 align:middle line:90%
They're made out of iron.

00:27:56.608 --> 00:27:57.543 align:middle line:90%
And iron--

00:27:57.543 --> 00:27:58.944 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: What do you
do with those?

00:27:58.944 --> 00:28:01.513 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: You hang it
above your door or your window.

00:28:01.513 --> 00:28:02.548 align:middle line:90%
And what it does is,

00:28:02.548 --> 00:28:04.116 align:middle line:84%
if somebody's having
negative thoughts

00:28:04.116 --> 00:28:05.951 align:middle line:90%
about you, it can't get through.

00:28:05.951 --> 00:28:07.686 align:middle line:90%
It's locked up at the door.

00:28:07.686 --> 00:28:11.924 align:middle line:84%
So just that being sad,
I could add this to this.

00:28:11.924 --> 00:28:14.826 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I'll never get
on a plane with that.

00:28:14.826 --> 00:28:16.662 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] To be sure.

00:28:16.662 --> 00:28:18.263 align:middle line:90%
So you enjoy being a witch?

00:28:18.263 --> 00:28:18.931 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yes, I do.

00:28:18.931 --> 00:28:19.631 align:middle line:90%
I like my faith.

00:28:19.631 --> 00:28:20.732 align:middle line:90%
I believe in it.

00:28:20.732 --> 00:28:23.335 align:middle line:84%
And I find it to be
personally empowering.

00:28:23.335 --> 00:28:25.404 align:middle line:84%
And those of you who are
interested in the craft,

00:28:25.404 --> 00:28:27.039 align:middle line:84%
know that the first thing
that's going to happen,

00:28:27.039 --> 00:28:30.175 align:middle line:84%
you're not going
to fly on a broom.

00:28:30.175 --> 00:28:32.945 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to,
you know, turn green.

00:28:32.945 --> 00:28:34.212 align:middle line:84%
What you're going to
do is you're going

00:28:34.212 --> 00:28:36.748 align:middle line:84%
to be spiritually enlightened
you're going to realize

00:28:36.748 --> 00:28:38.984 align:middle line:90%
that inside of you is a church.

00:28:38.984 --> 00:28:40.552 align:middle line:90%
Inside of you is god.

00:28:40.552 --> 00:28:41.920 align:middle line:90%
Inside of you is goddess.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.622 align:middle line:90%
Inside of you is everything.

00:28:43.622 --> 00:28:46.658 align:middle line:84%
Being a witch is about knowing
what the hell you're doing.

00:28:46.658 --> 00:28:49.695 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: When a witch
loses her temper,

00:28:49.695 --> 00:28:51.430 align:middle line:90%
does she do strange things?

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:53.532 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: I try
not to do strange things.

00:28:53.532 --> 00:28:54.533 align:middle line:90%
I have known friends--

00:28:54.533 --> 00:28:56.034 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It's tempting, isn't it?

00:28:56.034 --> 00:28:56.969 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
It's very tempting.

00:28:56.969 --> 00:28:58.337 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Because you
have that power.

00:28:58.337 --> 00:28:59.438 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: You have
to remember to stay balanced.

00:28:59.438 --> 00:29:02.741 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, when
certain of us witches,

00:29:02.741 --> 00:29:04.743 align:middle line:84%
energy is electrical,
and when you get mad,

00:29:04.743 --> 00:29:06.111 align:middle line:90%
you start blowing out lights.

00:29:06.111 --> 00:29:07.479 align:middle line:84%
I had a good friend, Sean
Pouri [assumed spelling].

00:29:07.479 --> 00:29:08.680 align:middle line:90%
Every time something--

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.515 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: He's the one
you wished away.

00:29:10.515 --> 00:29:12.184 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: No,
he's the one I wanted.

00:29:12.184 --> 00:29:13.585 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: That's another
Sean [assumed spelling].

00:29:13.585 --> 00:29:16.154 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yeah, that's
another Sean [assumed spelling].

00:29:16.154 --> 00:29:19.358 align:middle line:84%
This is a light, you know what
I mean, and he could blow lights

00:29:19.358 --> 00:29:21.093 align:middle line:90%
out just by his pure energy.

00:29:21.093 --> 00:29:22.661 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Well, let me tell
you, you're a good witch.

00:29:22.661 --> 00:29:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's good to
know a good witch.

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:25.764 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Thank you.

00:29:25.764 --> 00:29:26.765 align:middle line:90%
And it's good to get out here.

00:29:26.765 --> 00:29:28.033 align:middle line:84%
I want you to know
there's plenty

00:29:28.033 --> 00:29:29.935 align:middle line:90%
of other good witches out here.

00:29:29.935 --> 00:29:30.736 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Let's hope so.

00:29:30.736 --> 00:29:31.436 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yes.

00:29:31.436 --> 00:29:32.037 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Halloween.

00:29:32.037 --> 00:29:33.505 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy yourself.

00:29:33.505 --> 00:29:34.539 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Thank you.

00:29:34.539 --> 00:29:36.174 align:middle line:84%

anything strange.
