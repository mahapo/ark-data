>>GEORGE NOORY: Our next
guest on Beyond Belief

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.260 align:middle line:10%
is a family therapist and a
past life regression therapist.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.850 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>>She believes the
lives we've already

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.180 align:middle line:84%
lived contain the keys to a
better life now for each of us.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.860 align:middle line:84%
Anne Barham is a licensed
marriage and family therapist,

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.410 align:middle line:84%
who practiced traditional
counseling for many years

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.540 align:middle line:84%
before discovering past
life regression therapy.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.010 align:middle line:10%
In her book, "The Past Life
Perspective: Discovering Your

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.910 align:middle line:10%
True Nature Across
Multiple Lifetimes,"

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.850 align:middle line:10%
Anne takes readers
into her office

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.250 align:middle line:10%
where clients mind their
unconscious memories

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.750 align:middle line:10%
for formative experiences that
provide insight into solving

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.220 align:middle line:10%
present day troubles.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.100 align:middle line:84%
She explains how the
therapy can clear

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.810 align:middle line:84%
a path to spiritual happiness
and one's true purpose in life.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.640 align:middle line:90%
Today, on Beyond Belief.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Anne, what a
great subject, and welcome

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.190 align:middle line:90%
to Beyond Belief.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: Well, thank you.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.676 align:middle line:90%
I'm delighted to be here.

00:01:12.676 --> 00:01:14.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
you get involved

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.710 align:middle line:84%
in this as a licensed
clinical family therapist?

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.820 align:middle line:84%
How did you start dabbling
with past life regression?

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.350 align:middle line:10%
>>BARHAM: Well, it was an
interesting process that I went

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.895 align:middle line:10%
through, but it's an area
that I had interest in prior--

00:01:27.895 --> 00:01:28.825 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Prior to?

00:01:28.825 --> 00:01:29.740 align:middle line:10%
>>BARHAM: Prior to.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.660 align:middle line:10%
And after I went through all
my formal, traditional training

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.240 align:middle line:10%
and was working with clients
for a number of years,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.050 align:middle line:10%
I just had that feeling
that there's something

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.650 align:middle line:10%
more here that I
need to be doing.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And I actually was
fortunate enough

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.790 align:middle line:84%
that a couple of the
world's greats in past life

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.250 align:middle line:84%
work and that era came
to a retreat center close

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.507 align:middle line:84%
to my house and actually each
gave week long trainings.

00:01:56.507 --> 00:01:58.090 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to
attend those and then

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.485 align:middle line:84%
start practicing a
little bit and realized

00:02:00.485 --> 00:02:02.120 align:middle line:84%
that this was a
method that I could

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.750 align:middle line:84%
use to help a lot more
people, a lot more quickly,

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.600 align:middle line:84%
and that also could incorporate
a lot of spiritual work

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.979 align:middle line:84%
that I was particularly
interested in as well.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your book,
The Past Life Perspective,

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.610 align:middle line:84%
which is, by the
way, a great read,

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.710 align:middle line:84%
you discuss various
cases of people

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.130 align:middle line:90%
who have gone through this.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Were you surprised
that so many people

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.510 align:middle line:84%
have had these past
lives, and it comes out

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.130 align:middle line:90%
in regression therapy?

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: Well, I
think the surprise

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.150 align:middle line:84%
that really hit for me
was the fact that so

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.050 align:middle line:84%
many people, no matter what
their background, no matter

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.910 align:middle line:84%
what their experiences
as a meditator or not,

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.930 align:middle line:84%
whether they even really
believed for sure that there

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.880 align:middle line:84%
were prior lifetimes,
that so many people

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.300 align:middle line:84%
were successful in pretty
easily retrieving past life

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.430 align:middle line:84%
information, and being
able to then really

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.935 align:middle line:84%
resolve some significant
issues in their current life,

00:02:56.935 --> 00:02:57.760 align:middle line:90%
as a result.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's the
key for what you do.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.260 align:middle line:84%
You are convinced that
individuals' past lives, how

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.464 align:middle line:84%
many they might have had,
have a bearing and an effect

00:03:07.464 --> 00:03:08.380 align:middle line:90%
on their current life.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.421 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: Oh, absolutely.

00:03:09.421 --> 00:03:13.130 align:middle line:84%
It's very much like
the unconscious effects

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.990 align:middle line:84%
that we have from things
that happen in our childhood,

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.560 align:middle line:84%
that very often we're
having reactions

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.290 align:middle line:84%
and acting out of these
experiences and memories

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.140 align:middle line:84%
that we may not even really
know are operating for us.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'm doing
with past life work

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.890 align:middle line:84%
is just extending
that time frame back

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.940 align:middle line:84%
further into experiences,
relationships, beliefs

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.710 align:middle line:84%
we've formed about ourselves
or about life and how it works,

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.950 align:middle line:84%
from experiences of
our prior lifetimes.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And they do have a very
large impact on us now.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
find that somebody

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.560 align:middle line:84%
who might have been a
very benevolent person

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.500 align:middle line:84%
in a past life, is the
opposite in their current life,

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.570 align:middle line:84%
or do you see this
progression of goodness,

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.390 align:middle line:84%
where if you've had 10 past
lives-- I've heard some times

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.870 align:middle line:84%
you might have had 500 past
lives-- but this progression

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.040 align:middle line:84%
from past lives is
always a step up,

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.362 align:middle line:84%
that you don't really
go back down again.

00:04:10.362 --> 00:04:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: That's
not the way I've

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.850 align:middle line:90%
seen it happen with people.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:14.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: So the way I look
at it, in general, yes,

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.140 align:middle line:84%
our progress as a
soul, if you will,

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:26.280 align:middle line:84%
is to understand and experience
increasing levels of goodness

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.220 align:middle line:84%
and love and bringing
those divine energies

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.030 align:middle line:90%
onto the planet.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.230 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of the general
framework, you might say,

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.420 align:middle line:90%
of what we're doing here.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.310 align:middle line:84%
However, the way that we do
that is not exactly linear.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's sort of like when
these scientists talk

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.510 align:middle line:84%
about the way you shoot
a rocket to the moon

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.860 align:middle line:84%
is not a direct
line from A to B.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.705 align:middle line:84%
It's constant
course corrections.

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:49.505 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:04:49.505 --> 00:04:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: So the same
thing's going on with us

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.510 align:middle line:90%
in our various lifetimes.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.160 align:middle line:84%
So we may have one lifetime
where we're just really

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.490 align:middle line:84%
a pretty horrible person,
and the next lifetime

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.680 align:middle line:84%
we may actually flip
that and be someone who's

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.071 align:middle line:84%
kind of making up for that
by really helping the poor

00:05:08.071 --> 00:05:09.820 align:middle line:84%
and really reaching
out to people in need.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.861 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But the next life
could slip back again?

00:05:11.861 --> 00:05:14.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: The next life
we might be working

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:15.777 align:middle line:90%
on a little different issue.

00:05:15.777 --> 00:05:17.818 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, I always
thought it was progression.

00:05:17.818 --> 00:05:19.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: So it's not
a direct progression.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.090 align:middle line:84%
So the way I like
to describe it is,

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:27.000 align:middle line:84%
we're building a mosaic, in
a sense, and that in the end

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.960 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be this beautiful
mosaic of all these experiences

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.050 align:middle line:90%
we've had.

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.170 align:middle line:84%
But each individual piece
that makes up that mosaic

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.916 align:middle line:84%
might be a little nicer
piece, or a not so nice piece.

00:05:38.916 --> 00:05:40.290 align:middle line:84%
But when you put
it all together,

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.340 align:middle line:84%
it's giving us
this broad picture.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.140 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And for you to have a better
idea about past life regression

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.132 align:middle line:84%
therapy, take a
look at this video.

00:05:50.132 --> 00:05:52.116 align:middle line:10%
>> Tell me what
happens as it happens.

00:05:52.116 --> 00:06:06.692 align:middle line:90%


00:06:06.692 --> 00:06:07.492 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:11.460 align:middle line:90%


00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.452 align:middle line:90%
>>I was shot.

00:06:12.452 --> 00:06:15.428 align:middle line:90%
>>You were shot.

00:06:15.428 --> 00:06:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>>In the chest.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>>In the chest.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:27.828 align:middle line:90%


00:06:27.828 --> 00:06:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>>Tom is dead.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>>They killed him too?

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:31.750 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.738 align:middle line:90%


00:06:34.738 --> 00:06:35.734 align:middle line:90%
>>Everybody crying.

00:06:35.734 --> 00:06:40.714 align:middle line:90%


00:06:40.714 --> 00:06:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>>Are you watching this
from the other side?

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:45.448 align:middle line:90%
>>Can't breathe.

00:06:45.448 --> 00:06:46.444 align:middle line:90%
>>You can't breathe?

00:06:46.444 --> 00:06:51.375 align:middle line:90%


00:06:51.375 --> 00:06:53.416 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[INAUDIBLE], you don't
have to feel any pain.

00:06:53.416 --> 00:06:55.408 align:middle line:90%
You can just observe it.

00:06:55.408 --> 00:06:58.396 align:middle line:90%


00:06:58.396 --> 00:06:59.890 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what's happening.

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:05.866 align:middle line:90%


00:07:05.866 --> 00:07:07.858 align:middle line:90%
>>All full of blood.

00:07:07.858 --> 00:07:08.854 align:middle line:90%
>>You're full of blood.

00:07:08.854 --> 00:07:15.640 align:middle line:90%


00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.140 align:middle line:90%
>>Young boy next to me.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:21.690 align:middle line:90%


00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:22.780 align:middle line:90%
Don't know who he is.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:23.580 align:middle line:90%
>>Mhm.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.417 align:middle line:90%


00:07:28.417 --> 00:07:29.500 align:middle line:90%
>>Has he been killed, too?

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.310 align:middle line:90%


00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.110 align:middle line:90%
>>Can't breathe.

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:34.084 align:middle line:90%
>>He can't breathe?

00:07:34.084 --> 00:07:44.760 align:middle line:90%


00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.635 align:middle line:90%
>>A lot of screaming.

00:07:45.635 --> 00:07:57.108 align:middle line:90%


00:07:57.108 --> 00:07:57.908 align:middle line:90%
>>I died.

00:07:57.908 --> 00:07:58.708 align:middle line:90%
>>You died.

00:07:58.708 --> 00:08:00.910 align:middle line:90%


00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Anne, that
was not you conducting

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:06.230 align:middle line:84%
that physical therapy and
that regression therapy.

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:09.010 align:middle line:84%
But apparently, that
individual was a 22-year-old

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.250 align:middle line:84%
from the Civil War era,
might have even have

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.470 align:middle line:90%
been a woman at that time.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:15.920 align:middle line:84%
How do you pull
that out of them?

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:21.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how does hypnotism pull
those past lives out of people?

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: Well, it's not
necessary to use hypnosis,

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:27.740 align:middle line:84%
though that's typically
what I use with clients.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.640 align:middle line:84%
But generally, the
idea is we want

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.640 align:middle line:84%
to get the client
to a relaxed place,

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:37.070 align:middle line:84%
where they're more focused on
what's going on internally,

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:38.780 align:middle line:84%
rather than what's
going on around them.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:39.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was he hypnotized?

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.239 align:middle line:90%
Did he look hypnotized?

00:08:40.239 --> 00:08:41.038 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: He did.

00:08:41.038 --> 00:08:43.010 align:middle line:84%
It looked like he was
in some sort of trance.

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:43.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And really, these
memories sometimes

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.150 align:middle line:84%
are not that far
beneath the surface.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.600 align:middle line:84%
It's just that we're so
busy in our daily lives

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.830 align:middle line:84%
that we may get a little
flash of something

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.290 align:middle line:84%
that we just either
don't pay attention to,

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:57.460 align:middle line:84%
or we don't realize, gee,
this might be information

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.080 align:middle line:90%
coming from a past lifetime.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.540 align:middle line:84%
But what we're
just doing is we're

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.710 align:middle line:84%
going into the unconscious
mind and looking and asking

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:08.240 align:middle line:84%
for the source of
a particular issue.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.980 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps maybe it's like
you have a dynamic,

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.020 align:middle line:84%
this negative dynamic
with your boss,

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.660 align:middle line:84%
and you're always
getting in arguments

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.500 align:middle line:84%
and you want to look at,
where does this come from?

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Why is it so difficult
to resolve this?

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And so I'll direct the
client to that origin,

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.700 align:middle line:90%
and the memory will emerge.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.220 align:middle line:84%
So this is all information
coming from the client.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.915 align:middle line:90%
It's not me telling them.

00:09:31.915 --> 00:09:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
not leading them.

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:34.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: No leading involved.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:37.880 align:middle line:84%
It's all their-- then
we're just following.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Typically, what I'll do with
the client initially getting

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.920 align:middle line:84%
into lifetime is really get
them anchored in the body,

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.360 align:middle line:84%
by asking them to
connect with their feet,

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.090 align:middle line:84%
see what kind of
shoes they're wearing.

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Is it boots or
sandals are skins,

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.320 align:middle line:84%
or if their feet are bare,
and then go through the body,

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:59.220 align:middle line:84%
getting the clothing, and
then checking surroundings, so

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.845 align:middle line:84%
really anchoring them
in that lifetime.

00:10:00.845 --> 00:10:01.645 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:10:01.645 --> 00:10:03.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: And then
I'm just moving them

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.810 align:middle line:90%
through the significant events.

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:08.340 align:middle line:84%
So I just have them
move forward to where

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:12.080 align:middle line:84%
something important happens,
something significant changes.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you able to
pinpoint the era they are in?

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: Yeah, actually that's
something that I traditionally

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:21.120 align:middle line:84%
do, is I will ask for
the location in the world

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.069 align:middle line:84%
and I will also
ask for the date.

00:10:23.069 --> 00:10:24.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they know the date?

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: It's a really
interesting process.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.860 align:middle line:90%
It will just pop up.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.250 align:middle line:84%
So I'll have a little
technique that I'll

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.850 align:middle line:84%
use, usually, that I'll
just count from three to one

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:37.240 align:middle line:84%
and snap my fingers and tell
them, when I snap my fingers,

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.940 align:middle line:84%
the date is going to
pop into your mind.

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:39.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:43.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: And I would say
90% of the time they come up

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:44.720 align:middle line:90%
with a date.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the farthest
date back you've had somebody.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: Well, we've definitely
gone to prehistoric, where

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.000 align:middle line:90%
there is no date kind of thing.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:52.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.600 align:middle line:90%
Like cave people?

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: Yeah, so the
client, in that personality

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.140 align:middle line:84%
that they go to, that prior
personality, of course,

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.801 align:middle line:84%
there's no concept of
what year is it, right?

00:11:03.801 --> 00:11:05.300 align:middle line:84%
So they just-- you
know prehistoric.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can they still
speak, or do they grunt?

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: So that's the other
really interesting part.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.440 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's a dual
processing that goes on,

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.480 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, in a session, where
the client-- part of their mind

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.590 align:middle line:84%
is involved in the lifetime
that they're going to,

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:24.410 align:middle line:84%
and another part of them still
knows that they're on a couch

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:27.010 align:middle line:84%
there, they're with me in the
room, and that we're talking.

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And so the brain is
such an amazing tool.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:33.760 align:middle line:84%
But it knows that it needs
to talk to me in English.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And it knows that it's trying
to convey information to me.

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:40.570 align:middle line:90%
So I haven't had anyone grunt.

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:42.330 align:middle line:84%
I have had a few
clients where they've

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.400 align:middle line:84%
gone a personality that's been
pretty reticent about talking.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh huh.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: And it
takes some real effort

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.670 align:middle line:90%
to draw the information out.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you had a
client that you have regressed

00:11:54.850 --> 00:12:00.180 align:middle line:84%
into an individual's life
that was not a good one,

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.920 align:middle line:84%
maybe they were murderers,
or serial killer,

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.460 align:middle line:90%
or something like that?

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:09.376 align:middle line:84%
And do you see that personality
come out during the therapy?

00:12:09.376 --> 00:12:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: Definitely see
some personalities come out.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:16.905 align:middle line:84%
I have not, fortunately, had
to deal with a serial murderer.

00:12:16.905 --> 00:12:18.696 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because how
would you handle that?

00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: Yeah, that would
be an interesting challenge,

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:23.040 align:middle line:90%
for sure.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.160 align:middle line:84%
I've definitely gone
to personalities

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.090 align:middle line:84%
that have been very
unhappy, that have been

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:33.220 align:middle line:84%
in huge emotional distress,
that have committed suicide,

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.350 align:middle line:84%
and at times have been
responsible for others deaths,

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:39.680 align:middle line:84%
certainly in war and battle
and things like that.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what would
you do if you had someone

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:45.410 align:middle line:84%
who was a serial killer, and
in this therapy, they say,

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:48.840 align:middle line:84%
yes, I killed brunettes
with bob haircuts.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, would you freak
and get up and run out?

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: Probably, if I
thought that they were actually

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:59.860 align:middle line:84%
dangerous at that
point in time, I'd

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.520 align:middle line:84%
probably count them out
and pull them out of it.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:07.360 align:middle line:84%
But typically, in
that state, the people

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:11.230 align:middle line:84%
are actually acting out
whatever it is that's going on.

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:12.080 align:middle line:90%
They're reporting.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.455 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
reporting on it.

00:13:13.455 --> 00:13:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: So I've had
one person once reporting

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.620 align:middle line:84%
that she went to a lifetime
where she was a pedophile.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:21.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: So that was a
pretty interesting dynamic

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:25.560 align:middle line:90%
to work with.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.340 align:middle line:84%
But again, it was
not as if that I

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.460 align:middle line:84%
was worried that this
individual was then

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:33.970 align:middle line:84%
going to go out and molest
children in their current life.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:35.455 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they cry?

00:13:35.455 --> 00:13:38.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: Yes very, often,
depending on what event.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.720 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, if
you go to a lifetime

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.250 align:middle line:84%
where you've had losses,
which most of us have.

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:44.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, sure.

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:47.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: So when a family
member dies or a loved one dies

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:51.321 align:middle line:84%
or something traumatic happens,
very often the first sign

00:13:51.321 --> 00:13:52.820 align:middle line:84%
that this kind of
thing is coming up

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:57.900 align:middle line:84%
is, I'll see the client
starting to cry, which

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.510 align:middle line:84%
is one of the reasons why
when I do sessions remotely

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:02.064 align:middle line:84%
through Skype or
something like that,

00:14:02.064 --> 00:14:03.730 align:middle line:84%
I have to make sure
that I have a camera

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:05.320 align:middle line:90%
that I can see the client.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Because that's often
the first sign,

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.270 align:middle line:84%
is something visual,
rather than they're

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:13.430 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden loudly
sobbing, or anything.

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:16.730 align:middle line:84%
It might just be tears kind
of tracking down their face.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:19.491 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when somebody
initially comes to you,

00:14:19.491 --> 00:14:20.500 align:middle line:90%
what's the reason?

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:21.910 align:middle line:90%
Why they do that?

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:24.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: There's just so
many reasons that people come.

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:26.750 align:middle line:84%
So it falls into a lot
of different categories.

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:30.480 align:middle line:84%
So one main category
is to solve a problem.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And that problem could
be an emotional problem,

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:36.801 align:middle line:84%
like they've had a sense
of depression or guilt

00:14:36.801 --> 00:14:38.300 align:middle line:84%
all their life and
they can't really

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:38.870 align:middle line:90%
point to where it came from.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they have no
idea about their past life

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:41.050 align:middle line:90%
at this point?

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: And they have
no idea about that.

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:44.220 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Or it might be
relationship issue.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:50.180 align:middle line:84%
That's a really big one, where
either they're having trouble

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:51.910 align:middle line:84%
finding a relationship,
or they're

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:56.590 align:middle line:84%
afraid of relationships, or they
are in a relationship that's

00:14:56.590 --> 00:15:00.680 align:middle line:84%
problematic and they can't
seem to solve the problem.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.430 align:middle line:84%
People will come to be
looking for life purpose.

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:06.630 align:middle line:84%
They don't really know what
they want to do with their life,

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:08.170 align:middle line:84%
or they think
they're on one path,

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:10.325 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't quite feel
like the right thing,

00:15:10.325 --> 00:15:13.090 align:middle line:84%
so they're wanting to
know more about that.

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Physical ailments-- often
people will come to me

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.870 align:middle line:84%
when there's an
issue that they're

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:22.120 align:middle line:84%
having that the medical
doctors are kind of saying,

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.440 align:middle line:84%
there's no real reason
for you to have this pain.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.135 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, we have no idea.

00:15:25.135 --> 00:15:26.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: Yeah,
you know, they've

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:28.728 align:middle line:84%
tried all sorts of things
and they're clueless.

00:15:28.728 --> 00:15:30.680 align:middle line:84%
So there's that whole
problem solving,

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:35.050 align:middle line:84%
and then there's the other
arena of really opening up

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:41.050 align:middle line:84%
to new talents and
skills, opening up

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:44.410 align:middle line:84%
to a greater sense of
your spiritual nature.

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:48.290 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people just want to
come in and do exploration.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people are looking
for help in their current life

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:56.150 align:middle line:84%
in terms of, gee, I'm an
artist, but I'm feeling blocked,

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:58.810 align:middle line:84%
and they want to tune into
a lifetime where they were

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:00.180 align:middle line:90%
very successful as an artist.

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:00.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:03.135 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: So it does fall into
those two main categories.

00:16:03.135 --> 00:16:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, will
somebody come to you and say,

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:08.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm scared of water.

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:10.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm petrified of water.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:11.430 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with me?

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:12.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: Mhm.

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then you realize
they drowned in another life.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:16.130 align:middle line:90%
Does that happen?

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:17.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: Absolutely.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.980 align:middle line:84%
In fact, phobias were
one of the first places

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:25.070 align:middle line:84%
that past life work was applied,
because it's sort of a pretty

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:26.640 align:middle line:90%
obvious direct connection.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.800 align:middle line:84%
So you can have someone
who's afraid of driving

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:30.740 align:middle line:90%
on the highway, even.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.959 align:middle line:84%
And I did have someone
come and work on that.

00:16:32.959 --> 00:16:35.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they got
killed in a crash probably.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:35.200 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:35.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: And it's
pretty obvious

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:37.330 align:middle line:90%
what connection's going to be.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes it'll be it
wasn't that they died,

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.290 align:middle line:84%
but maybe their
entire family died.

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:43.200 align:middle line:90%
And they were the driver.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: Or they
weren't even there.

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:48.361 align:middle line:84%
But just that whole idea
of traveling on a freeway,

00:16:48.361 --> 00:16:50.110 align:middle line:84%
it just has so many
negative connotations.

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:51.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they see
that in the past life

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:52.800 align:middle line:90%
and they describe it to you?

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:53.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: Right.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:59.190 align:middle line:84%
So we'll go through that,
and then a lot of the work,

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:02.000 align:middle line:84%
especially since I come from
a therapeutic standpoint,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.579 align:middle line:84%
is processing the emotions
that weren't dealt

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:11.030 align:middle line:90%
with enough in that past life.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:13.849 align:middle line:84%
So very often, when people
have losses, particularly

00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:16.280 align:middle line:84%
in the past where we
didn't have as much

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.650 align:middle line:84%
psychological help
available, people

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.420 align:middle line:90%
would just kind of shut down.

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And so you'd have
this terrible loss,

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:26.680 align:middle line:84%
and you just would live the
next 30 years of your life

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.630 align:middle line:84%
just not really
reaching out to people,

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.200 align:middle line:84%
never really recovering,
being kind of a recluse,

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.250 align:middle line:90%
and then you die.

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And so you haven't worked
through what that loss meant.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And you haven't come
to the understanding

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.250 align:middle line:84%
that even though you've
lost these people,

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:45.550 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean that
your life is over, too,

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:47.240 align:middle line:84%
and that you can
create new bonds,

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:50.460 align:middle line:84%
and you can still have love
in your life and all that.

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.639 align:middle line:84%
So if they haven't done
that kind of processing,

00:17:53.639 --> 00:17:55.180 align:middle line:84%
that's the type of
thing that we need

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.760 align:middle line:84%
to do in order to help
them release that past life

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:58.560 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was going to
say, once somebody mentions

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:04.050 align:middle line:84%
their past life and you start
to analyze it and figure out

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:08.110 align:middle line:84%
what happened to them then, how
do you turn that into something

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:09.981 align:middle line:90%
positive in the current life?

00:18:09.981 --> 00:18:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: Well, so
one of the things

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.680 align:middle line:84%
that we do, we go all the
way through the prior life

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.670 align:middle line:84%
and go through the
death experience.

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:20.201 align:middle line:84%
And after that, it gets a little
bit-- people have probably

00:18:20.201 --> 00:18:22.575 align:middle line:84%
been doing a lot of reading
about near death experiences,

00:18:22.575 --> 00:18:23.840 align:middle line:90%
and all of that recently.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite in
vogue right now.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.720 align:middle line:84%
So they often talk about
a life review, people

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.790 align:middle line:90%
who've gone through an NDE.

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And so we do a similar
thing after the death

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:38.670 align:middle line:84%
in the prior lifetime,
where we look back

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:41.940 align:middle line:84%
at the life just
lived, and we look at,

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:45.531 align:middle line:84%
what were the key themes
and the important lessons.

00:18:45.531 --> 00:18:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And we're not only looking at
the lessons that were learned,

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:50.350 align:middle line:84%
but we're also looking at the
ones that perhaps could have

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:51.485 align:middle line:90%
been learned, but were missed.

00:18:51.485 --> 00:18:52.285 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:18:52.285 --> 00:18:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: And then
we look at how it

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.405 align:middle line:90%
relates to their current life.

00:18:57.405 --> 00:18:59.200 align:middle line:90%
Are there other similar threads?

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Are there are differences
and contrasts?

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.802 align:middle line:84%
Are you continuing
those same lessons

00:19:03.802 --> 00:19:06.051 align:middle line:84%
or have you actually-- does
it look like you've really

00:19:06.051 --> 00:19:08.480 align:middle line:84%
mastered them and now you're
moving onto the next step?

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.880 align:middle line:84%
But we really do a lot of
work to incorporate that

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.590 align:middle line:84%
into the current
life, and see how

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:15.870 align:middle line:90%
those lessons can come forward.

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that's
really fascinating

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.390 align:middle line:84%
is often those past
life personalities,

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:25.350 align:middle line:84%
if they have certain strengths
that they really expressed well

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:29.980 align:middle line:84%
in that prior life, they can
then actually act as a mentor

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:32.060 align:middle line:90%
to the current personality.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And so I've run into
that quite often

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:38.470 align:middle line:84%
with clients, where perhaps they
want to get ahead in business,

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:42.150 align:middle line:84%
and they go back to a lifetime
where-- I had one client who

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:47.160 align:middle line:84%
went back to-- she was
a very successful man

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:51.100 align:middle line:84%
in the fashion industry and
in the '40s in New York City.

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And that prior personality
was able to give

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:58.150 align:middle line:84%
the current personality
a lot of advice

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:00.200 align:middle line:84%
about how to run
her business now,

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.580 align:middle line:84%
and to pull forward these
strengths of leadership

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:05.410 align:middle line:84%
and business acumen
and all of that.

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:08.470 align:middle line:84%
So it was sort of like she had
this mentor in her hip pocket

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:10.580 align:middle line:90%
now of this prior personality.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:14.355 align:middle line:84%
And she could actually
use that in times

00:20:14.355 --> 00:20:16.480 align:middle line:84%
of decision making, kind
of think, well, what would

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.690 align:middle line:84%
he say to me about how
I should handle this?

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:19.940 align:middle line:90%
With what would his advice be?

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:23.265 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you find that
everybody has had a past life?

00:20:23.265 --> 00:20:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: Well, my belief
is that yes, we all have.

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Not everyone can retrieve that
information for themselves,

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:35.176 align:middle line:84%
although the grand
majority of people do.

00:20:35.176 --> 00:20:36.550 align:middle line:84%
I have a business
background so I

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.360 align:middle line:84%
keep a lot of data
and statistics,

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:42.430 align:middle line:84%
and I found that 85% of the
people that come to see me

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:44.597 align:middle line:84%
do, indeed, retrieve
a prior lifetime.

00:20:44.597 --> 00:20:46.055 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how
many do they have?

00:20:46.055 --> 00:20:46.930 align:middle line:90%
How many lives?

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:48.895 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: Well, probably
hundreds to thousands.

00:20:48.895 --> 00:20:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, that's
what we've heard.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: Right.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:52.670 align:middle line:90%
We've been at this for a while.

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some are long
lives, some are short ones.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:54.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: Right.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:55.250 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:56.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some are
very brief if you

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:59.510 align:middle line:84%
die in childhood of a
childhood illness, which

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:01.870 align:middle line:90%
happened a lot in the past.

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:04.610 align:middle line:84%
You will have some
very quick lifetimes.

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:08.630 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting is the people
that don't retrieve a past life

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:10.610 align:middle line:90%
fall into two categories also.

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And one category is what they
come asking about ends up

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:18.250 align:middle line:84%
really being about an issue
in their current life.

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:21.000 align:middle line:84%
So when we go to the origin of
the issue, that's where we go.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:21.800 align:middle line:90%
It's current life.

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And so we'll do work
around something

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:26.092 align:middle line:84%
that happened in their
childhood or that kind of thing.

00:21:26.092 --> 00:21:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
small number of people

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.010 align:middle line:84%
that constitutionally
are just too

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:34.230 align:middle line:84%
anxious to be able to
really relax and get

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:36.810 align:middle line:84%
to that beta brainwave
state where you can retrieve

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:38.755 align:middle line:90%
those memories were easily.

00:21:38.755 --> 00:21:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't mean that's
a permanent condition,

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.840 align:middle line:84%
it just means they
maybe need to work on it

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.300 align:middle line:84%
more before they really
have built those muscles

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:47.100 align:middle line:90%
to retrieve.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.558 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What have
you, personally,

00:21:48.558 --> 00:21:52.460 align:middle line:84%
learned from all of these
cases that you've dealt with?

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:56.843 align:middle line:84%
What can you say about
what this all is?

00:21:56.843 --> 00:22:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: Well, it's
very clear to me

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:05.150 align:middle line:84%
that our experiences
in our prior lives

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:10.260 align:middle line:84%
have a very large influence
on who we are today,

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:15.240 align:middle line:84%
on how we deal with things,
on our belief systems today,

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.650 align:middle line:84%
and how we interact
with other people,

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:21.150 align:middle line:84%
and that for the most part
it works unconsciously.

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And it can either be helping
us or hindering us, depending.

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And by bringing it
to consciousness,

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:32.730 align:middle line:84%
it can be very helpful
in our current lives,

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:39.000 align:middle line:84%
just give a way richer meaning
to even a relationship like you

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.820 align:middle line:84%
and I. It's like, if we feel
like we've just met but,

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.642 align:middle line:84%
wow, we have a nice
connection, it's like, hmm,

00:22:46.642 --> 00:22:47.600 align:middle line:90%
isn't this interesting?

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.183 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we were together
in a prior life

00:22:49.183 --> 00:22:50.820 align:middle line:84%
and we were working
in a similar way?

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: And
similarly, if we have

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:55.980 align:middle line:84%
an instant negative
reaction to someone, it

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:59.810 align:middle line:84%
might be something from a
prior life that's coming up.

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:01.040 align:middle line:90%
So it really enriches that.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.540 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing that
I think is so important

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:08.530 align:middle line:84%
is this understanding of our
journey as an eternal being

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:11.850 align:middle line:84%
across many, many
lifetimes, and what

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:14.840 align:middle line:84%
it is that we're trying to
create here, and kind of what

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:19.500 align:middle line:84%
really is the purpose
of being on the planet.

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:23.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, what is this human
adventure that we're on,

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:24.570 align:middle line:90%
and what is it really about?

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do these past lives
make us better people today,

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:30.826 align:middle line:90%
or worse people today?

00:23:30.826 --> 00:23:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: I believe
that, in general, they're

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:34.840 align:middle line:90%
making us better people.

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:38.404 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that we're
learning as we're going along.

00:23:38.404 --> 00:23:39.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or we should.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:40.403 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: Or we should be.

00:23:40.403 --> 00:23:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't learn
it the first time,

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:47.270 align:middle line:84%
we get to come back
and do it again.

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And so that's-- you
know, in a sense,

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:54.240 align:middle line:84%
it's wonderfully reassuring to
know that we don't have to get

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:58.140 align:middle line:84%
everything right this lifetime,
because this isn't our one

00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:59.450 align:middle line:90%
and only shot.

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:02.105 align:middle line:84%
It might be our one and only
shot in this current body

00:24:02.105 --> 00:24:02.905 align:middle line:90%
and personality.

00:24:02.905 --> 00:24:07.190 align:middle line:84%
So of course I want to do the
best I can with who I am today,

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:09.580 align:middle line:84%
and the talents and
skills that I have.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:15.320 align:middle line:10%
But the fact that maybe I'm not
going to go out there and save

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:19.180 align:middle line:10%
all the starving people in
this current personality

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:23.160 align:middle line:10%
is OK, because maybe I've
done that in the past,

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.110 align:middle line:10%
or maybe I'll do
that in the future,

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:27.800 align:middle line:10%
but that we have
certain areas that we're

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.715 align:middle line:10%
focusing on in any
particular lifetime that

00:24:30.715 --> 00:24:32.660 align:middle line:10%
are the talents and
skills that we're

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:34.310 align:middle line:10%
intending to be using now.

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And so we want to use those
to our best of our ability.

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And again, if we go back to
that idea of the mosaic--

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:42.920 align:middle line:84%
so this is one little piece I'm
working on in this lifetime,

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.655 align:middle line:84%
and as I keep adding pieces
from other lifetimes,

00:24:45.655 --> 00:24:48.050 align:middle line:84%
you end up with a really
beautiful picture by the time

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:48.850 align:middle line:90%
you're done.

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:50.896 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will you
regress children?

00:24:50.896 --> 00:24:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: I have not worked
that much with children.

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:57.590 align:middle line:84%
There are some people that
really specialize in regression

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:58.390 align:middle line:90%
with children.

00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And there's some amazing
stories that come out.

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:02.940 align:middle line:84%
That's also the
area where people

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:07.030 align:middle line:84%
have done a lot more
research, because it's

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:09.030 align:middle line:84%
less tainted, I
guess you would say,

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:11.950 align:middle line:84%
as far as really
trying to prove, gee,

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:16.100 align:middle line:84%
this is evidence for
reincarnation because,

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:21.460 align:middle line:84%
how would these children know
these details any other way?

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:23.240 align:middle line:84%
So I've worked with
a couple children,

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:26.430 align:middle line:84%
but overall my practice has
been much more with adults.

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does anybody
talk about heaven or hell

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.690 align:middle line:84%
in this interim period
before they come back

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:35.578 align:middle line:90%
into a different life?

00:25:35.578 --> 00:25:39.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: Those labels
don't usually come up.

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Almost inevitably,
people go to a really

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:50.810 align:middle line:84%
wonderful, warm,
loving, peaceful place

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:52.330 align:middle line:90%
after they pass over.

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:53.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.280 align:middle line:90%
That's a good thing.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.196 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: It's lovely.

00:25:55.196 --> 00:25:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And most of them
want to stay there.

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:00.217 align:middle line:84%
They kind of have
to be convinced.

00:26:00.217 --> 00:26:01.800 align:middle line:84%
All right, there's
more for you to do.

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.160 align:middle line:90%
Time to come back.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:08.240 align:middle line:84%
But occasionally, if someone
has a really difficult death,

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.980 align:middle line:84%
or had a really difficult
lifetime, when they first

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.960 align:middle line:84%
crossover, it's
like they have to go

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.340 align:middle line:84%
through a little bit
of a waiting period

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:21.300 align:middle line:84%
to release the negativity
from that prior life.

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.290 align:middle line:84%
But it's usually
pretty short lived,

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:24.940 align:middle line:84%
and we get past
it pretty quickly.

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:26.960 align:middle line:84%
But there might be a
little bit of confusion

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.830 align:middle line:84%
or there might be a
little bit of negativity

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:middle line:90%
that's still associated.

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.140 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't
happen very often.

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:37.650 align:middle line:84%
So for the most part, people
have this universal experience

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:41.114 align:middle line:84%
of being in this very
peaceful, very loving place.

00:26:41.114 --> 00:26:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how soon do you
think somebody reincarnations

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:46.970 align:middle line:84%
after they physically
die from one life?

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: Well you know,
that's very individual.

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And part of what I've
seen is if someone

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:54.750 align:middle line:84%
has a very violent
death at a young age,

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:58.870 align:middle line:84%
or a very unexpected
death, or suicide,

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:00.180 align:middle line:90%
they'll come back pretty quick.

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.660 align:middle line:84%
So they might come back in
a couple years in our time.

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:04.280 align:middle line:90%
Or sooner.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:05.113 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: Or sooner.

00:27:05.113 --> 00:27:13.870 align:middle line:84%
But beyond that, it could
be anywhere from 20 years,

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:16.840 align:middle line:90%
to 200 years, to who knows.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:23.910 align:middle line:84%
So we measure things in linear
time on the physical plane,

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:26.850 align:middle line:84%
but on the spiritual plane,
time doesn't particularly exist.

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
had anybody or any case

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:32.370 align:middle line:84%
where they were two
lives at the same time?

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: I have
not run into that.

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm wondering
if that's possible?

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:39.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: Yeah, that whole
idea of parallel lives

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:43.314 align:middle line:84%
has not happened with
the hundreds and hundreds

00:27:43.314 --> 00:27:45.105 align:middle line:84%
and hundreds of people
that I've regressed?

00:27:45.105 --> 00:27:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been the
most fulfilling episode you've

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:51.055 align:middle line:90%
gone through with a patient?

00:27:51.055 --> 00:27:52.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: Wow.

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:57.172 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That just made you
think, this is amazing stuff.

00:27:57.172 --> 00:27:58.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: That's a
really great question.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:03.120 align:middle line:84%
There's been so many that
I have that reaction.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.020 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the things
that probably is most

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:09.160 align:middle line:84%
touching for me
is when I'll have

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:13.504 align:middle line:84%
a parent come in who's lost
a child at a young age, and--

00:28:13.504 --> 00:28:14.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's the
worst, I'm sure.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: It's so hard.

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:20.380 align:middle line:84%
But when we're able
to go back and reunite

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.660 align:middle line:84%
with that child in
a prior lifetime

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:28.610 align:middle line:84%
and see the connections of
love that were there before,

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:34.900 align:middle line:84%
and the client comes out
of it with this really

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:38.520 align:middle line:84%
deep understanding of, I
haven't really lost this child.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.910 align:middle line:90%
We were together before.

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:43.460 align:middle line:84%
We came together again
in this lifetime.

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:44.570 align:middle line:90%
We'll be together again.

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:49.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: And there's just
such a wonderful sense

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:53.780 align:middle line:84%
of reassurance and peacefulness,
often, that comes from that.

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:57.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does that
person-- here's an example.

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.415 align:middle line:90%
A guy's married to a woman.

00:28:58.415 --> 00:28:59.750 align:middle line:90%
They have a great life.

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:02.040 align:middle line:90%
She dies.

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:07.300 align:middle line:84%
Does she reincarnate and come
back within a year or two

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:13.980 align:middle line:84%
into some human that somehow
has an episode with that person

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:14.780 align:middle line:90%
again?

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:15.495 align:middle line:90%
Does that happen?

00:29:15.495 --> 00:29:16.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: Could happen.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:19.595 align:middle line:84%
In fact, she could come
back into the same family

00:29:19.595 --> 00:29:20.470 align:middle line:90%
as a grandchild, or--

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And is it always
a baby they come back into?

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:24.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, can you
literally come back

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:28.695 align:middle line:84%
as an adult in someone
else's personality?

00:29:28.695 --> 00:29:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: I have not
seen that happen.

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:30.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You haven't
seen that either?

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: I can't say
no, because there's

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:34.820 align:middle line:84%
more mysteries out there
then we'll ever understand.

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:38.714 align:middle line:84%
But as far as in my work, I
have not seen that happen.

00:29:38.714 --> 00:29:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it starts
at the baby level.

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: Yeah, so the
soul makes a decision

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:46.620 align:middle line:84%
to come into a new body,
and it starts out as a baby.

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had always
heard that a lot of people

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:52.250 align:middle line:84%
that you associate
with in your life,

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:54.220 align:middle line:84%
you've had it in past
lives, and you'll

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:56.245 align:middle line:84%
have it in future lives,
this relationship.

00:29:56.245 --> 00:29:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: Very often.

00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:01.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, we tend to travel in what
we like to call "soul groups."

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's sort of the
people that we really

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:05.340 align:middle line:90%
like hanging out with.

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.227 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds
like a new TV show.

00:30:07.227 --> 00:30:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: Your soul group.

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:09.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The soul groups.

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:10.853 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: But there
are certain people

00:30:10.853 --> 00:30:14.000 align:middle line:84%
that we just have very
strong connections with,

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.250 align:middle line:84%
and that these bonds of love
exist across many lifetimes.

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And we decide on the
soul level, yeah,

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:22.100 align:middle line:90%
we want to be together again.

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:23.580 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it again, right?

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:25.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, sometimes these
actually end up

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.950 align:middle line:84%
being the people that we also
might have challenges with.

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And part of that is
that we're choosing

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:35.330 align:middle line:90%
to push each other's growth.

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:38.021 align:middle line:84%
So I might decide that I'm
going to come back and be

00:30:38.021 --> 00:30:39.520 align:middle line:84%
with my husband
this time, but we're

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:41.850 align:middle line:84%
going to have sort of a
conflictual relationship,

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:45.390 align:middle line:84%
because I need to learn
patience and tolerance,

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:47.470 align:middle line:84%
and he needs to learn
to be more open minded,

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:51.060 align:middle line:84%
and that we've sort of decided,
on a higher level, that we're

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:54.600 align:middle line:84%
going to come back and kind of
have trouble with each other

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.450 align:middle line:84%
because these are
lessons that we want

00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:58.220 align:middle line:90%
to learn at this point in time.

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:03.770 align:middle line:84%
But the overall, over
reaching principle

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:06.850 align:middle line:84%
behind coming onto
the planet together

00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:09.080 align:middle line:84%
is that there's these
very strong bonds of love,

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:12.110 align:middle line:84%
and that we want to continue
working together, evolving

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.910 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:15.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've got emails
coming in for you.

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:16.060 align:middle line:90%
From New Mexico.

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Marguerite-- Do I have to
come back after this lifetime?

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.314 align:middle line:90%
What if I don't want to?

00:31:22.314 --> 00:31:27.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: So again, that's
a very individual decision.

00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:30.157 align:middle line:84%
It's not pre-destined
that you must come back.

00:31:30.157 --> 00:31:32.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's not a
group that forces you back?

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: No.

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.680 align:middle line:84%
But what we have
to understand is

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:39.460 align:middle line:84%
that things on the higher plane
look a lot different than they

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:43.150 align:middle line:84%
do here, and the understandings
that we have from a soul basis

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:45.490 align:middle line:84%
are very different than
our small little human

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:47.270 align:middle line:90%
personalities can really get.

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:53.900 align:middle line:84%
So in a soul basis, Marguerite
may decide that I really

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:56.210 align:middle line:84%
want to come back and
work on this thing

00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:59.420 align:middle line:84%
that I had such trouble with
in that life I just finished,

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:00.960 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not
done with that yet.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.800 align:middle line:84%
I really haven't mastered
that, and I really

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.230 align:middle line:90%
want to master that.

00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:05.740 align:middle line:84%
However, Marguerite
will never have

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:08.530 align:middle line:90%
to come back as Marguerite.

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:10.830 align:middle line:84%
It'll be a different body,
a different personalities.

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:13.220 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, no, she
doesn't have to come back.

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:15.555 align:middle line:84%
And her life circumstances
will be different.

00:32:15.555 --> 00:32:17.180 align:middle line:84%
But she'll probably
have an opportunity

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:20.110 align:middle line:84%
to work on some lessons
that she may not have

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:21.250 align:middle line:90%
completed this time around.

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:24.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Donald, from Florida--
I've tried group recessions.

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.210 align:middle line:90%
No results.

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:26.540 align:middle line:90%
Nothing good there.

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean I
never had a past life?

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: That's
another great question,

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.880 align:middle line:90%
and I run into that a lot.

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:36.250 align:middle line:84%
So doing a group
regression, to just explain

00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:38.780 align:middle line:84%
a little bit, that's when you
have someone like me who's

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:41.110 align:middle line:84%
standing at the front of
a room, is leading you

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:44.660 align:middle line:84%
through an induction, relaxing
you, and then just directing

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:45.460 align:middle line:90%
you around.

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:49.600 align:middle line:84%
But there's no interaction
between the person leading

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.667 align:middle line:84%
the session and the group that
you're-- so it's just like

00:32:52.667 --> 00:32:53.500 align:middle line:90%
a guided meditation.

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:54.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everybody's
individual, basically.

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: Yeah.

00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very
common for people

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:00.900 align:middle line:90%
not to get anything from that.

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, only
about maybe 50%

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:06.340 align:middle line:84%
of people in a group
regression will get anything,

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:10.050 align:middle line:84%
and I might just be a glimmer,
it just might be an idea.

00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And then the other whole half of
the group doesn't get anything.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.070 align:middle line:84%
They just say, well,
either I fell asleep,

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:17.060 align:middle line:84%
or I went to this
nice relaxed place,

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:18.500 align:middle line:90%
but nothing else came up.

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:21.600 align:middle line:84%
So that doesn't indicate
anything at all, other

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.490 align:middle line:84%
than those weren't the
right conditions for you

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:25.290 align:middle line:90%
to do regression.

00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's very different
when you're interactive,

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:31.130 align:middle line:84%
because I'm leading the client,
we're talking back and forth,

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and I'm leading them
through and helping get

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.930 align:middle line:90%
past blocks that might occur.

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:39.500 align:middle line:84%
So no indication whatsoever that
you haven't had a past life.

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:43.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do any of them,
Anne, talk about the future?

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: That's something that
I haven't done a lot of work

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:52.980 align:middle line:84%
with, because personally, I
don't see it that helpful.

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And again, I'm coming from
a therapeutic standpoint.

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: So I'm looking at
what's going to help you now.

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:59.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're looking at
past issues to make you now.

00:33:59.090 --> 00:33:59.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: Right.

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:01.020 align:middle line:90%
What do we need to resolve?

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:04.290 align:middle line:84%
There are some people that
get into doing future lives.

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:07.960 align:middle line:84%
The way I look at that
is, again, the future's

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:10.560 align:middle line:84%
not predestined, and
we have human choice.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:12.530 align:middle line:84%
So even though there
might be a possibility

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:16.389 align:middle line:84%
that maybe this is a possible
future life that you might

00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:20.260 align:middle line:84%
have, again, depending on
the choices that you make,

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:22.000 align:middle line:90%
that may or may not happen.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.412 align:middle line:84%
So that's sort of
a fun thing of, oh,

00:34:25.412 --> 00:34:26.870 align:middle line:84%
who am I going to
be in the future?

00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:28.370 align:middle line:84%
What am I going to
do in the future?

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And it might give you a
goal to kind of look toward,

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:36.170 align:middle line:84%
but I'm still not clear
myself on how therapeutic

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:39.434 align:middle line:84%
that would be to spend a lot of
time going into future lives.

00:34:39.434 --> 00:34:42.989 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Cynthia, from Maine--
I've had a really hard life.

00:34:42.989 --> 00:34:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean I did something
awful in my past lives?

00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:48.914 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: Another great
question, and relates

00:34:48.914 --> 00:34:51.330 align:middle line:84%
a little bit to what you and
I talking about as far as, it

00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:53.820 align:middle line:90%
is a direct line or not.

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:55.920 align:middle line:90%
And not necessarily.

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:59.630 align:middle line:84%
What I've found is
that often the people

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:04.030 align:middle line:84%
that have some of the most
challenging lives now,

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:06.550 align:middle line:84%
I speak of it in terms
of, they've signed up

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:10.430 align:middle line:84%
for spiritual postgraduate
work, and that actually, they're

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:12.850 align:middle line:90%
a pretty highly evolved soul.

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And they've mastered a
lot of tough challenges

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:18.950 align:middle line:84%
already on human
plane, and their souls

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:22.370 align:middle line:84%
decided to come back and
have a really tough life

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:26.360 align:middle line:84%
to master even more
in a higher level.

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:29.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's not necessarily
an indication that you did

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:30.810 align:middle line:90%
dastardly things in the past.

00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:33.270 align:middle line:84%
It might be that you've just
decided that you're really

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:37.140 align:middle line:84%
going to go for it,
and conquer some

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:39.420 align:middle line:84%
of the more challenging
things on the human plane.

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now how
do you apply what

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.470 align:middle line:84%
you've learned
from the past life

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:46.590 align:middle line:84%
to fix some person's
problem in the current life?

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:49.386 align:middle line:84%
How do you tie
those two together?

00:35:49.386 --> 00:35:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: Well, that's where we
get into the realm of therapy,

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:55.600 align:middle line:84%
which, fortunately, I
have training of that.

00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:01.200 align:middle line:84%
So you're looking at the way
the patterns from the past

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:04.810 align:middle line:84%
maybe are still playing
out in the present.

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:05.966 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:36:05.966 --> 00:36:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have to find
those, though, don't you?

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: Yeah, so
you go through what

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:12.990 align:middle line:84%
happened in the past
lifetime, and then we

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:13.959 align:middle line:90%
do that processing of.

00:36:13.959 --> 00:36:16.000 align:middle line:84%
How does this really relate
to your current life.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's very
obvious, and sometimes it's

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:22.250 align:middle line:84%
a little more elusive
and you kind of

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:27.300 align:middle line:84%
have to learn how to draw
the lines between the dots.

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And then, depending on how
traumatic the events were

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:33.560 align:middle line:84%
from the prior
lifetime, I may end up

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:37.150 align:middle line:84%
doing more trauma work with
the person about releasing

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:40.510 align:middle line:84%
the trauma and bringing
in healing energies,

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:44.890 align:middle line:84%
and looking at what
the lesson was,

00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:46.610 align:middle line:84%
and how can they
incorporate it now.

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And then we also pull in some
higher spiritual guidance.

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And I have certain
techniques I use for that.

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:59.930 align:middle line:84%
But the client is
able to get messages

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:03.060 align:middle line:84%
from a spiritual guide
or some sort of figure

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:03.860 align:middle line:90%
like that, coming--

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:05.318 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Guardian
angel, who knows.

00:37:05.318 --> 00:37:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: Yeah, right.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.210 align:middle line:84%
An ancestor might
come in, whatever.

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:12.450 align:middle line:84%
That can really help
them move forward

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:15.850 align:middle line:84%
and understand it on
a different level,

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:19.560 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps just might
give them-- very often

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.560 align:middle line:84%
they get the message from
these spiritual guides

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:25.630 align:middle line:84%
that everything is
really going to be OK.

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:28.690 align:middle line:90%
You can relax and stop worrying.

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And receiving that on the level
from some spiritual guidance

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:39.940 align:middle line:84%
when you're in a
very relaxed state--

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:42.260 align:middle line:90%
it gets in in a different way.

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:43.650 align:middle line:90%
We're able to absorb that.

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:46.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: Much more
effectively than it just

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.194 align:middle line:84%
being an intellectual
concept that,

00:37:48.194 --> 00:37:49.610 align:middle line:84%
you know, your
friend says to you,

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:50.860 align:middle line:90%
oh, you just need to relax.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:52.320 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be fine.

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:54.860 align:middle line:84%
But when you're getting
that from a figure

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:59.760 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual guidance
that's come in just for you,

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:02.130 align:middle line:84%
it causes a different
kind of shift.

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:04.872 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How soon, Anne, do
you see results with people?

00:38:04.872 --> 00:38:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: So again,
that's variable.

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And so for some
people it's overnight.

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:12.100 align:middle line:84%
I myself, personally,
have-- for some reason,

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:14.820 align:middle line:84%
my body seems to hang on
to things from prior lives.

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'll end up with
some physical issue

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:24.570 align:middle line:84%
that, when I get to the
past life origin of that,

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:27.540 align:middle line:84%
it's like, boom, the next
day the problem's gone.

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That fast?

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:29.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: That fast.

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:31.420 align:middle line:90%
So that's been pretty amazing.

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:34.170 align:middle line:90%


00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:36.140 align:middle line:84%
A lot of issues,
though, for people,

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:40.530 align:middle line:84%
it works a little bit
underground over time.

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:42.180 align:middle line:84%
So particularly
when it's perhaps

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:47.570 align:middle line:84%
a relationship dynamic,
or something that we've

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:49.230 align:middle line:84%
grooved in in the
current life, may

00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:51.370 align:middle line:84%
be a bad habit or an
attitude that we've

00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:54.630 align:middle line:84%
grooved in in our
current life, the shift

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:56.410 align:middle line:90%
may happen a little more slowly.

00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:58.630 align:middle line:84%
So I'll hear back
from clients maybe

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:02.260 align:middle line:84%
after two or three
months, and they'll say,

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:06.720 align:middle line:84%
wow, I'm looking back now
and realizing that something

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:09.600 align:middle line:84%
has been subtly shifting
in the past few months,

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:11.250 align:middle line:84%
and the way I'm
relating to my husband

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:15.670 align:middle line:84%
is so completely different now
than it was three months ago.

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:17.640 align:middle line:84%
But it takes a little
while sometimes for it

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.800 align:middle line:84%
to just kind of
work underground,

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.860 align:middle line:90%
and shift those patterns.

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:24.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's pretty variable
depending on the issue.

00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What major
message do you

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:30.380 align:middle line:84%
want people to bring with them
and take away from your book,

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:31.574 align:middle line:90%
"The Past Life Perspective."

00:39:31.574 --> 00:39:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: Well, one of things is
I really want them to enjoy it.

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:37.035 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the reasons
I wrote the book was--

00:39:37.035 --> 00:39:38.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's kind of fun.

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:42.117 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: It's fun, and the
stories are so fascinating.

00:39:42.117 --> 00:39:44.700 align:middle line:84%
At least they are to me, and I
think they are to other people.

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:47.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the readers
who have read the book

00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:50.900 align:middle line:84%
and talked with me about it
have said, it's just so amazing,

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:53.090 align:middle line:90%
these stories.

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And they're a little
bit like "who done it?"

00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:58.530 align:middle line:84%
mysteries, in that
you're looking

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:02.170 align:middle line:84%
for the origin of some issue,
and the life stories take

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:04.240 align:middle line:84%
these twists and turns,
just like real life

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.140 align:middle line:84%
does, and you're
not quite sure how

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:08.070 align:middle line:84%
it's all going to come together,
and then all of a sudden

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:08.870 align:middle line:90%
it does.

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:11.090 align:middle line:90%


00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:13.560 align:middle line:84%
So there's just that whole
part of really enjoying it.

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:17.680 align:middle line:84%
But my greater
purpose really was

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:23.470 align:middle line:84%
to try to bring the message
to more mainstream America

00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:28.770 align:middle line:84%
that there's such a richness
that we can introduce

00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:30.940 align:middle line:84%
into our lives, into
our relationships

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:35.350 align:middle line:84%
with other people, and into
just the whole dynamic of life

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:41.740 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, if we embrace
this new perspective of yes,

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:43.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm an eternal being.

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:45.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing this life right now.

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:46.859 align:middle line:90%
I've done others in the past.

00:40:46.859 --> 00:40:48.150 align:middle line:90%
I'll have others in the future.

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:50.426 align:middle line:84%
Look at the connections
that we have.

00:40:50.426 --> 00:40:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And the other really, really
important thing for me

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:56.070 align:middle line:84%
is, I believe that
past life work really

00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:59.210 align:middle line:84%
teaches us about the
commonality of human experience.

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:00.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree.

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: And the fact that
are seeming differences

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:08.580 align:middle line:84%
on the surface are pretty
meaningless in the big picture.

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And I've had people go from
all races, all religions,

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:16.410 align:middle line:84%
all manner of political
beliefs, and all that.

00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And they end up
going to lifetimes

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:20.590 align:middle line:84%
where they were the exact
opposite of what they are now.

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:23.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and you
can be different sexes,

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:25.360 align:middle line:84%
different races, different
everything, right?

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:25.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: Yep.

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:26.490 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:31.910 align:middle line:84%
So I have a story in the
book of one client who went

00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:36.430 align:middle line:90%
to a lifetime as a Nazi pilot.

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And he was devastated in
his current personality,

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:45.240 align:middle line:84%
thinking there's no way
that I could be a Nazi.

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.550 align:middle line:90%
There's just no way.

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:47.990 align:middle line:90%
Yet there he was in the session.

00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:49.930 align:middle line:90%
He was even thinking in German.

00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And the perspective that also
gives us is, in whatever life

00:41:56.110 --> 00:42:02.970 align:middle line:84%
we're in, our world
view is what we believe.

00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:07.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, so it's like, if
I'm Muslim in a prior life,

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:13.300 align:middle line:84%
that faith is as
important to me then,

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:15.760 align:middle line:84%
as maybe being a
Christian is now.

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And who are we to say
who's right about that?

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:25.180 align:middle line:84%
It's just like, whoever
you are in one life is just

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:29.280 align:middle line:84%
as strongly held as an
exact opposite opinion

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.430 align:middle line:90%
in another life.

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:34.246 align:middle line:84%
And I think just really
getting that perspective helps

00:42:34.246 --> 00:42:40.360 align:middle line:84%
us get over this issue
we have about people who

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:41.890 align:middle line:84%
have a different
religious faith,

00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:44.780 align:middle line:84%
or have a different
political leaning,

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:48.910 align:middle line:84%
or-- and we really get
more to that level of,

00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:50.930 align:middle line:90%
we're all really the same.

00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you find, Anne,
that if you're the abused,

00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:56.530 align:middle line:90%
you become the abuser?

00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Do you have that
kind of juxtaposition

00:42:58.760 --> 00:42:59.720 align:middle line:90%
with these past lives?

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: There is certainly
an element of that,

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:06.340 align:middle line:84%
that whatever side of
the fence you're on now,

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:08.240 align:middle line:84%
you've either been
on the other side,

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.470 align:middle line:84%
or you might be on the
other side the next time.

00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:11.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that to
show you what it's like,

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:11.380 align:middle line:90%
to give you that experience?

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:12.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: I think it.

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:14.430 align:middle line:90%
And to get that balance.

00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And especially if-- let's say
I was a very wealthy person,

00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:20.490 align:middle line:84%
and I was very
greedy with my money,

00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:23.509 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't help the
poor, and I just horded.

00:43:23.509 --> 00:43:25.425 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You become a
bag person or something.

00:43:25.425 --> 00:43:26.225 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: Exactly.

00:43:26.225 --> 00:43:29.800 align:middle line:84%
The next lifetime I
might be very destitute.

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.940 align:middle line:90%
And that's to teach compassion.

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:32.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: To teach
understanding,

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:33.860 align:middle line:90%
to teach generosity.

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:35.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then in
the next life time,

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:39.490 align:middle line:84%
should you pick up those traits
and become a better person?

00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: You might.

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be that you're
worked that one out,

00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:47.360 align:middle line:84%
and maybe that's not the issue
the next lifetime that you're

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:48.280 align:middle line:90%
really involved with.

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Or you may pick it
up a century later.

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.720 align:middle line:84%
You may come back and do a
little more in that arena.

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:56.280 align:middle line:84%
But really, the idea is
to have that balance.

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, as we have both
sides of the spectrum,

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:04.160 align:middle line:84%
we do generally kind of come to
a place of balance and mastery

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.050 align:middle line:90%
around that issue.

00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do your patients come
in with a little reluctance

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:09.650 align:middle line:90%
or unbelievability?

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: A lot of
people are apprehensive.

00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:14.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, number one, they're
worried that they just

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:15.569 align:middle line:90%
won't get anything.

00:44:15.569 --> 00:44:17.110 align:middle line:84%
That's just about
every single client

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:19.276 align:middle line:84%
that comes in is, oh, I'm
not going to get anything.

00:44:19.276 --> 00:44:20.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm so worried.

00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes people are afraid
of what they're going to see.

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:29.625 align:middle line:84%
They think, oh, I probably
was a murderer, or--

00:44:29.625 --> 00:44:31.375 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't want
to know this, right?

00:44:31.375 --> 00:44:32.175 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: Yeah.

00:44:32.175 --> 00:44:34.450 align:middle line:84%
Yet, here they are,
and they want to know.

00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And so, yes, there is some
reluctance and there's also--

00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:39.864 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you tape
it and videotape it?

00:44:39.864 --> 00:44:41.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: I don't videotape.

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:42.820 align:middle line:84%
I do record the session
so that the client has it.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you let
them listen to it?

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: So I give them
a copy of the recording,

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:49.409 align:middle line:84%
and they have that for
as long as they want.

00:44:49.409 --> 00:44:50.950 align:middle line:84%
Many, many people
never listen to it,

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:52.510 align:middle line:84%
because they
remember it so well.

00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:54.570 align:middle line:90%
Or they're afraid?

00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: No.

00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:58.490 align:middle line:84%
It's really more that they
tell me that they remember it

00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:02.570 align:middle line:84%
so well, and it's just gotten
in so deeply that they just

00:45:02.570 --> 00:45:06.152 align:middle line:84%
don't ever bother
listening to the recording.

00:45:06.152 --> 00:45:07.860 align:middle line:84%
I forget where I was
going with that now.

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we were talking
about these past lives,

00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:15.260 align:middle line:84%
of course, and the
progression of what happens.

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:18.200 align:middle line:84%
If you're an abuser, do
you become the abused?

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:19.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: Right.

00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:19.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:23.930 align:middle line:84%
So the balance is something
that we're working toward.

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're
also, hopefully,

00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:28.360 align:middle line:84%
as a species, evolving
toward a place

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:30.180 align:middle line:84%
where we all are living
more out of place

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:32.550 align:middle line:84%
of kindness and compassion
and love for each other.

00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
finding that people

00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:38.640 align:middle line:84%
are getting better or worse,
in terms of how they are

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:42.420 align:middle line:84%
and how they treat people,
based on these past lives?

00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BARHAM: Oh, definitely better.

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a good thing.

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.030 align:middle line:90%
We're evolving, you're saying.

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: We definitely
are evolving.

00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:55.280 align:middle line:84%
When you go back to, say,
the Middle Ages or beyond,

00:45:55.280 --> 00:46:00.385 align:middle line:84%
the level of man's inhumanity
to man is atrocious.

00:46:00.385 --> 00:46:01.185 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:46:01.185 --> 00:46:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: And the
devaluing of human life

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:07.640 align:middle line:84%
is really pretty horrible
sometimes in the past.

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:10.950 align:middle line:84%
So even though we still
have elements of that,

00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:17.030 align:middle line:84%
I think, as a society, or as a
species, we've really evolved.

00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if people want
the information on what

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:21.825 align:middle line:90%
you do, how can they find you?

00:46:21.825 --> 00:46:23.200 align:middle line:10%
>>BARHAM: Well,
I have a website,

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:26.145 align:middle line:10%
and it's pastlives.org.

00:46:26.145 --> 00:46:27.770 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, that's
easy to remember.

00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:29.180 align:middle line:10%
>>BARHAM: So that's plural.

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And they can always search
for me on Google or whatever.

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And there's quite a bit of
information on my website.

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:37.660 align:middle line:10%
And my book is available.

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:39.970 align:middle line:10%
It's published through
Simon and Schuster,

00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:43.180 align:middle line:10%
so it's available
just about everywhere.

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, and I love
working with clients.

00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:49.280 align:middle line:84%
That's still my
number one thing.

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:50.113 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I can tell.

00:46:50.113 --> 00:46:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: It's so
fun, and I meet

00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:55.240 align:middle line:90%
so many fascinating people.

00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And we have a very intense
couple hours together,

00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:00.070 align:middle line:90%
and hopefully change their life.

00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:02.069 align:middle line:90%
And it's really awesome.

00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Anne, thanks for
being on Beyond Belief.

00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BARHAM: Thank you,
George, I really

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:05.881 align:middle line:90%
did enjoy talking to you.

00:47:05.881 --> 00:47:07.410 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What a
fascinating subject,

00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:10.910 align:middle line:10%
to be able to take past lives
and use that information

00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:15.070 align:middle line:10%
to fix your current
life, truly is amazing.

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:17.640 align:middle line:10%
The book "The Past
Life Perspective."

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:21.590 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching Beyond Belief.

00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:27.561 align:middle line:90%
