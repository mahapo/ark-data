00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And I
think many people today don't

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.820 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.672 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.672 --> 00:00:13.660 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.640 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.255 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:25.539 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.580 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief,"

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.390 align:middle line:10%
with another fascinating program
with the onlinecolumnist.com.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.100 align:middle line:10%
His name is Dr. John Curtis.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And he's an expert in
spin, and we'll tell you

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.220 align:middle line:90%
about spin in just a moment.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.970 align:middle line:84%
In this edition, we're going
to be talking about Wall

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.620 align:middle line:90%
Street and the Federal Reserve.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, talking about the Federal
Reserve, when did it start?

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.030 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.850 align:middle line:10%
>>In November of
1910, a secret meeting

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.340 align:middle line:10%
took place of six bankers
and economic policymakers

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.670 align:middle line:10%
who represented the financial
elite of the Western world.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.880 align:middle line:10%
It was hosted at
the JP Morgan estate

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.960 align:middle line:10%
on Jekyll Island in Georgia.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.390 align:middle line:84%
This meeting was so
secret at the time

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.620 align:middle line:84%
that not even the names
of those who attended

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.970 align:middle line:84%
were mentioned to the
servants who lived and worked

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.370 align:middle line:90%
on the island.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.100 align:middle line:84%
The men who attended came
on a late night train,

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.160 align:middle line:84%
claiming to be on their way
to a hunting expedition.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.810 align:middle line:84%
But instead, these bankers met
with Senator Nelson Aldrich

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.800 align:middle line:84%
to draft what would eventually
become the Federal Reserve Act.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.530 align:middle line:84%
This private meeting attended
by some of the most powerful men

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.790 align:middle line:84%
in America was
strategically designed

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.270 align:middle line:84%
to take control of our
country's money supply

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.156 align:middle line:84%
and to achieve ultimate
power in America.

00:01:38.156 --> 00:01:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Dr. John
Curtis, the Federal Reserve

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.260 align:middle line:90%
started a long time ago.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. JOHN CURTIS: 1913, with
the first financial panic that

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.450 align:middle line:84%
practically took the
country down to its knees,

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.370 align:middle line:90%
completely broke.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.575 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did they
decide to put it together?

00:01:52.575 --> 00:01:54.482 align:middle line:10%
>>CURTIS: Well, they
didn't want the country

00:01:54.482 --> 00:01:55.940 align:middle line:10%
to run out of cash
anymore and they

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.830 align:middle line:10%
couldn't rely on the big banking
families like the Rockefellers

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.240 align:middle line:10%
and the Morgans
simply to resupply

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.855 align:middle line:10%
the banks with all their cash.

00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of course, we've
got the fiat system.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.120 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
backing the cash.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.740 align:middle line:90%
But there was then, right?

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: Well, that's
not exactly true, George.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.880 align:middle line:10%
I mean, for everybody's
information,

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.834 align:middle line:10%
the US has the largest
gold reserve in the world.

00:02:16.834 --> 00:02:18.250 align:middle line:10%
It's somewhere in
the neighborhood

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.102 align:middle line:10%
of 1,300 tons of gold, not
necessarily in Fort Knox.

00:02:22.102 --> 00:02:23.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, it's
not in Fort Knox.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.559 align:middle line:90%
>>CURTIS: Some of it is.

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:27.470 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, there's gold
underneath the Federal Reserve

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.990 align:middle line:90%
in New York.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.290 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.950 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is that the
Federal Reserve was there

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.560 align:middle line:90%
to resupply the system.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And Wall Street, as you
know, is a system that

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.140 align:middle line:90%
basically runs like a casino.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.410 align:middle line:10%
So when Madoff went down, and
he was basically from prison

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.180 align:middle line:10%
telling everybody,
look, my Ponzi scheme

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.710 align:middle line:10%
was far less dangerous than
the Wall Street Ponzi scheme.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.140 align:middle line:84%
What I was doing is, somebody
comes in with the money

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.470 align:middle line:84%
and I was providing
people with the out.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.600 align:middle line:84%
With Wall Street, when
the markets go down,

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.380 align:middle line:84%
everybody's wiped
out until one day

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.820 align:middle line:84%
down the road it
comes back again.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.760 align:middle line:84%
So he viewed it as somehow
a bonus, what he was doing.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.830 align:middle line:84%
But it's always been
a very risky way

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.340 align:middle line:90%
of financing American business.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With the Federal
Reserve, why are so many people

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.700 align:middle line:90%
opposed to it?

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Because every time I'm
on "Coast to Coast"

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.900 align:middle line:84%
and I do a financial
program or we

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.420 align:middle line:84%
talk about the Federal Reserve,
I don't hear anything positive

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.120 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: Well, part of
it is because there's

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.260 align:middle line:84%
no commanding legal authority
with the Federal Reserve.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's not supervised
by Congress.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.090 align:middle line:90%
It's completely independent.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And nobody knows when they
give the order to print money.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And there's a belief
in the markets

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.020 align:middle line:84%
that printing money,
fiat currency,

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.640 align:middle line:84%
is going to create
hyperinflation.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.610 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be taking
wheelbarrows down,

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.210 align:middle line:84%
buying a quart of milk
or a loaf of bread.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And the reality is, this
is the way it's been.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.460 align:middle line:84%
There is, as you say, the
13 tons of gold that is here

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.530 align:middle line:90%
is a drop in the bucket.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.370 align:middle line:84%
It's a fraction of what
the actual wealth is

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.400 align:middle line:90%
of the country.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.035 align:middle line:84%
And the country's mortgaged
through derivatives.

00:04:06.035 --> 00:04:07.356 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To the hilt.

00:04:07.356 --> 00:04:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: Way to the hilt.
And the banking industry

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.350 align:middle line:84%
is completely,
hopelessly dependent.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.780 align:middle line:84%
They tossed out Glass-Steagall
in 1998 under Bill Clinton,

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.630 align:middle line:84%
giving the banks, the big
financial institutions

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.240 align:middle line:84%
the right to basically invest
willy-nilly in the market

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.976 align:middle line:84%
and make as much fast
cash as they could.

00:04:24.976 --> 00:04:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Elizabeth Warren
is one who wants

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.550 align:middle line:90%
to reinstate Glass-Steagall.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's opposed to it,
because these banks basically

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.017 align:middle line:84%
right now are so heavily
leveraged on derivatives.

00:04:33.017 --> 00:04:35.600 align:middle line:84%
The old way of making money in
the bank doesn't exist anymore.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, it does--
and explain to us

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.850 align:middle line:90%
what a derivative is, John.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: Well, a
derivative is basically

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.230 align:middle line:84%
an instrument, an investment
instrument that is built off

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.610 align:middle line:90%
some hypothetical commodity.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.222 align:middle line:84%
In the last meltdown in 2008,
was built off the real estate

00:04:50.222 --> 00:04:51.805 align:middle line:84%
market, in mortgage-backed
securities.

00:04:51.805 --> 00:04:53.388 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And look
what happened there.

00:04:53.388 --> 00:04:56.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: Well, I mean,
the great geniuses

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.720 align:middle line:84%
have told us that this was
due to people not paying

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.690 align:middle line:90%
their mortgages.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.130 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, it was bets that
were being made by JP Morgan,

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.370 align:middle line:84%
by Wells Fargo, by some
of the biggest mortgage

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.626 align:middle line:90%
lenders in the country.

00:05:06.626 --> 00:05:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And they were losing
on all their bets.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.150 align:middle line:84%
People were-- those
investments, paper investments,

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.490 align:middle line:84%
mortgage-backed securities,
these tranches--

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.620 align:middle line:84%
they call them tranches of
investments just went from,

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.645 align:middle line:84%
let's say, $100
to zero overnight.

00:05:22.645 --> 00:05:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happened,
actually, with that?

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CURTIS: Panic.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:26.800 align:middle line:90%
And just like any stock.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, you've seen
Tesla Motors recently

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.610 align:middle line:84%
go from almost $300
a share down to $200.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.090 align:middle line:84%
If the market takes a dump, it
could go down to $5 a share.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Even during the 2008
crash, the market crash,

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.990 align:middle line:84%
do you realize that Wells Fargo,
which is the bank that Warren

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.570 align:middle line:84%
Buffett invests in--
I mean, that stock

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.820 align:middle line:90%
went down to under $10 a share.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Their money market,
which had never

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.456 align:middle line:84%
gone below par, which is
like, dollar for dollar.

00:05:52.456 --> 00:05:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's like nothing.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.246 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: No, the
money market went down

00:05:55.246 --> 00:05:56.970 align:middle line:84%
below par for the
first time, which

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.660 align:middle line:84%
means they paid their investors
in a money market account

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.560 align:middle line:90%
at Wells Fargo-- lost money.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.910 align:middle line:84%
So we know that even
the most-- let's

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.030 align:middle line:84%
say the most financially solvent
institutions that we count on

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.330 align:middle line:84%
and that we know in the banking
industry, in the oil industry,

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.130 align:middle line:84%
in any conceivable
sector of the US economy,

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.990 align:middle line:84%
can go to nothing if everybody
decides it's time to sell.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you predict another
bubble, an explosion, a burst?

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:26.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CURTIS: No, I don't think so.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think we were on
a show doing predictions

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.712 align:middle line:84%
for the year and everybody
was saying that the market was

00:06:32.712 --> 00:06:33.420 align:middle line:90%
going to go down.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And your lonely voice here
said that he didn't read it

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.320 align:middle line:84%
that way, the way that Federal
Reserve Bernanke was passing

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.120 align:middle line:84%
out the cash, with
all the bailouts

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.440 align:middle line:84%
and printing the money, that
it was going to-- the markets

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.800 align:middle line:90%
were going to stay strong.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.810 align:middle line:84%
I also believe that in this
particular economy right

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.592 align:middle line:84%
now, where we're really facing
more of a deflationary cycle,

00:06:53.592 --> 00:06:55.800 align:middle line:84%
believe it or not, than we
are an inflationary cycle.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.650 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's looking
for inflation.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Bottom line is, in Europe
and Asia and other parts

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.340 align:middle line:84%
of the world and in
the United States,

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.980 align:middle line:90%
there is no real inflation.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Because the reality
is, whatever employment

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.210 align:middle line:84%
has been created over the
last eight years and some 10

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.480 align:middle line:84%
million jobs, that's
not enough for people

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.940 align:middle line:84%
to survive-- a lot of part-time
jobs, lot of low-income jobs.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And the reality is this
great consumer economy,

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.930 align:middle line:84%
which is like 70%
of the nation's GDP,

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:28.220 align:middle line:84%
it just cannot support this
economy any longer with

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.780 align:middle line:84%
anything but these
slashed interest rates.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.450 align:middle line:84%
So we are in a period where
this Federal Reserve, they've

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.140 align:middle line:84%
been itching to raise
interest rates for years,

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.707 align:middle line:84%
but they can't do it because
they're afraid of deflation,

00:07:38.707 --> 00:07:39.290 align:middle line:90%
not inflation.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:42.118 align:middle line:84%
And if they raised interest
rates, what would happen?

00:07:42.118 --> 00:07:44.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: They're afraid
we'd go into a recession.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.810 align:middle line:84%
The GDP, which is running
somewhere around 2%

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.650 align:middle line:84%
at the fourth quarter, really
was not a good representative

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:51.840 align:middle line:90%
of around 4%.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:57.020 align:middle line:84%
It could flatline and it
could go into the red again.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.000 align:middle line:90%
So that's the concern.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.090 align:middle line:90%
In Europe, they are in the red.

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And so they're facing this
great recession over there.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And you see the likes of the
French president Francois

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Holland and Angela
Merkel meeting

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.020 align:middle line:84%
with Vladimir Putin
in the Kremlin

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.530 align:middle line:84%
and deciding what
to do in Ukraine.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:17.926 align:middle line:84%
And you're asking yourselves,
well, what kind of a deal

00:08:17.926 --> 00:08:19.300 align:middle line:84%
do they actually
make over there?

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.960 align:middle line:90%
And why did they make this deal?

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, the big concern
over in the Eurozone right

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.650 align:middle line:90%
now is recession.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And when they're not selling
enough cars, especially

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:33.450 align:middle line:84%
in Germany, or France,
which isn't known

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:35.789 align:middle line:84%
to be one of the big
manufacturing powers,

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:38.919 align:middle line:84%
but is certainly
hurting financially,

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:41.460 align:middle line:84%
they're very concerned about
lapsing into a recession.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.680 align:middle line:84%
Nothing could accelerate a
recession, maybe a depression,

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.700 align:middle line:84%
more than a war spreading from
the Ukraine over into Europe.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:53.940 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason why they
put the kibosh on Poroshenko

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.480 align:middle line:84%
and the Ukrainians,
because they're

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.050 align:middle line:84%
afraid of a very serious
recession in Europe.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:02.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that's a real fear.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: It is a fear, but
the bigger concern right now,

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.220 align:middle line:84%
and the thing that
we're all facing

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:12.330 align:middle line:84%
is you've got a
hegemony going on

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.460 align:middle line:84%
with Putin, with a land army
that basically just beats up

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.070 align:middle line:90%
on everybody.

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:18.150 align:middle line:10%
And it happened
during-- for everybody

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.520 align:middle line:10%
that is blaming
Obama for this, well,

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.190 align:middle line:10%
they can just step back
to 2008 and remember

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:28.860 align:middle line:10%
when Putin ran the Red Army
into Georgia and literally

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:33.030 align:middle line:10%
annexed Abkhazia
and South Ossetia.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:34.580 align:middle line:90%
And so what happened there?

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.070 align:middle line:84%
He essentially got this
green light from the West

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:41.270 align:middle line:84%
and from NATO that he could go
anywhere he wants and anytime

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:42.050 align:middle line:90%
he wants.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And what he's done in Ukraine
is simply to divide the country.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And he's working now
feverishly toward creating

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.850 align:middle line:84%
that land bridge between Crimea,
which he seized on March 1

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:54.055 align:middle line:90%
last year, and Russia.

00:09:54.055 --> 00:09:55.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's not done.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CURTIS: He's not done.

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By any means.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Yet they're going
to let him do it.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to step
in and stop him?

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:01.626 align:middle line:90%
Not the United States.

00:10:01.626 --> 00:10:03.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: And
certainly not NATO.

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think what he's exposed--
and this is extremely dangerous

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:10.870 align:middle line:84%
right now-- he's exposed
that NATO is essentially

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:12.530 align:middle line:90%
a fraud organization.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:13.880 align:middle line:90%
It's all smoke.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And no one in Europe
has the stomach--

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:18.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No teeth.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:22.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: No teeth to confront
anything that Putin does.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.794 align:middle line:84%
He also is major gas
supplier in Europe.

00:10:24.794 --> 00:10:26.460 align:middle line:84%
All he has to do is
turn the spigot off.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.450 align:middle line:84%
They've got nobody else to
supply the energy right away.

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:32.070 align:middle line:84%
So they'd have to spend
some time transitioning.

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:33.599 align:middle line:84%
So there's business
relationships.

00:10:33.599 --> 00:10:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
that people don't

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:38.330 align:middle line:84%
realize about the relationship
that Europe has, especially

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Germany has with Putin is--
and it's come out recently--

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:48.470 align:middle line:84%
is that you have
the Russians losing,

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:52.190 align:middle line:84%
estimated in today's
dollars, $4 to $5 trillion

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:56.460 align:middle line:84%
of property damage because
of the Nazi Holocaust

00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:01.190 align:middle line:84%
and Hitler's regime and 20
million of their population.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:04.030 align:middle line:84%
So when you talk about Angela
Merkel and the Russians,

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.930 align:middle line:84%
especially her coming from
East Germany putting their foot

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:09.080 align:middle line:90%
down, she can talk tough.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.490 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is, they
don't have any stomach

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:14.350 align:middle line:84%
for really taking it
out all on the Russians.

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:16.020 align:middle line:84%
The US is fighting
its own battle,

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.840 align:middle line:90%
the Cold War that just goes on.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And the Europeans don't
have the same feeling.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.670 align:middle line:84%
There's a sense that they
should be doing reparations over

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:28.530 align:middle line:84%
in Russia rather than
sanctioning them more.

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's a different
perspective than we have.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: World War II
ended about 70 years ago.

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:37.710 align:middle line:84%
70 years ago, yet we
still have the remnants

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:38.750 align:middle line:90%
of what happened then.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: Well, we
do-- the damage that

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:44.030 align:middle line:84%
was done by the Germans to
especially the Russians,

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:45.260 align:middle line:90%
and all over Europe.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:49.620 align:middle line:84%
But what you find right now
is that the European economy,

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.630 align:middle line:84%
which is built off
this euro right now,

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.899 align:middle line:84%
which is a fake currency--
and what I mean by--

00:11:53.899 --> 00:11:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
all fake currencies.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.106 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: What I mean
by a fake currency

00:11:57.106 --> 00:11:58.440 align:middle line:90%
is it's not a Deutsche Mark.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.190 align:middle line:90%
It's not a French franc.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:01.190 align:middle line:90%
It's not a drachma.

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:03.320 align:middle line:84%
What's happening
over in Greece is

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.380 align:middle line:84%
that it's still completely
unaffordable for those Greeks

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.110 align:middle line:84%
to be using a currency
that's essentially

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:09.730 align:middle line:90%
built off the Deutsche Mark.

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why the
Germans are so committed--

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:15.170 align:middle line:84%
the European Central Bank, it's
no accident it's in Frankfurt--

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:20.040 align:middle line:84%
for them doling out euros is
because if the German currency,

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.000 align:middle line:84%
if the Eurozone were to end
and they would end the euro,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:31.400 align:middle line:84%
the German Deutsche Mark
would fly to maybe $3.00.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.380 align:middle line:84%
One Deutsche Mark would be
worth about three US dollars.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bring this home
to the United States,

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.120 align:middle line:84%
though-- people watching this
program right now, going I

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:44.530 align:middle line:84%
don't give a darn about what's
going on in Europe or Greece.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.780 align:middle line:84%
I care about what's happening
right here in the United

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:47.510 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.820 align:middle line:84%
I care about whether
I have a job.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.870 align:middle line:84%
I care about whether
I pay my mortgage.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:52.870 align:middle line:90%
What do you say to them?

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: Well, you
basically say look,

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:58.590 align:middle line:84%
the entire international
business community

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:00.290 align:middle line:90%
is interconnected today.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:03.590 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the manufacturing is
done in essentially slave labor

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:05.270 align:middle line:90%
markets in Asia.

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:06.690 align:middle line:90%
The same thing is in Europe.

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:08.950 align:middle line:84%
So any time Europe
is in recession,

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:10.990 align:middle line:84%
the United States is
being dragged down also

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:11.630 align:middle line:90%
into recession.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:14.290 align:middle line:84%
Anytime the United States
goes into recession,

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:15.960 align:middle line:90%
it also drags Europe down.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.270 align:middle line:90%
So we're all interconnected.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:19.720 align:middle line:84%
We buy a lot of foreign
products in the United States

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.250 align:middle line:90%
manufactured in China.

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And so we're all in this
boat together right now.

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, the US
cannot be so isolationist.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:34.320 align:middle line:84%
Another problem is, as far as
the economy over in Europe,

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.010 align:middle line:84%
is there's only so
much the US can do.

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:38.730 align:middle line:84%
We have our own problems here,
and you're right about that.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And so most
people will say, look.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:44.440 align:middle line:84%
I just want to make sure I'm
OK, that I've got my one or two

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.850 align:middle line:84%
cars, that I'm working,
that I can pay my mortgage.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:49.310 align:middle line:90%
Just leave me alone.

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:52.700 align:middle line:84%
It's that old clip from
"Network" with Howard

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Beale coming out, the late Peter
Finch going, leave us alone.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Just let us have our
tellies and our toasters,

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.130 align:middle line:90%
and leave me alone.

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:03.639 align:middle line:90%
Because we're as mad as hell.

00:14:03.639 --> 00:14:05.180 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
take this anymore.

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: Well, Wall
Street calls the shots.

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.840 align:middle line:10%
So when you're looking at
this, you're talking about,

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:12.810 align:middle line:10%
are we in a bubble?

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.170 align:middle line:10%
Of course we're in a bubble.

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:15.980 align:middle line:84%
We're in a bubble in
terms of share prices.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.300 align:middle line:84%
The price to earnings ratios
have never been higher.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.890 align:middle line:84%
This is higher than it was
during the crash in 2000

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:25.280 align:middle line:84%
right now, where we have
an inflated stock market.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.386 align:middle line:10%
But what we have
that differs today

00:14:27.386 --> 00:14:28.760 align:middle line:10%
is that we have
a Federal Reserve

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:33.060 align:middle line:10%
Board under Janet Yellen, who's
inherited the job from Ben

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:36.290 align:middle line:10%
Bernanke, who in turn inherited
it from the great one, Alan

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:37.720 align:middle line:10%
Greenspan.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.410 align:middle line:10%
We have somebody who's committed
to these low interest rates

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:41.780 align:middle line:10%
for the indefinite future.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And what that means
to investors out there

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:48.010 align:middle line:84%
is that while you will see
sell-offs periodically,

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:50.660 align:middle line:84%
where the market will come
down 1,000 points or so,

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.810 align:middle line:90%
we're at over 18,000 right now.

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:56.540 align:middle line:84%
Don't forget, when Obama
came to office in 2008,

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.730 align:middle line:84%
the market was around
8,000, just under 8,000.

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:00.951 align:middle line:84%
It dropped by the time
the recession hit.

00:15:00.951 --> 00:15:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's doubled
and then some.

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:03.824 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: It's
more than doubled.

00:15:03.824 --> 00:15:10.700 align:middle line:84%
So Wall Street will continue
to sell off and take profits

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.020 align:middle line:84%
periodically, and people
should not panic about that.

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:18.150 align:middle line:84%
That's just the nature of big
investment bankers at JP Morgan

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:19.170 align:middle line:90%
and at Goldman Sachs.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:21.100 align:middle line:84%
They know what to do
and how to make money.

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.740 align:middle line:90%
You can count on that.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:26.350 align:middle line:84%
But as far as any bubble
like we had in 2008,

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:27.670 align:middle line:90%
I don't read it that way.

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:31.850 align:middle line:84%
I read that we're going to see
a sideways market where there's

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:35.120 align:middle line:84%
periodic sell-offs and Wall
Street takes its profit-taking.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And then not too
long after that,

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:39.240 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
see market run-ups

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.240 align:middle line:90%
and we'll be breaking new highs.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And as long as Janet Yellen
keeps the pedal to the metal

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:48.670 align:middle line:84%
as far as these
low interest rates,

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:52.972 align:middle line:84%
even though they've stopped
the quantitative easing,

00:15:52.972 --> 00:15:54.180 align:middle line:90%
and they may go back to that.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.790 align:middle line:84%
But they're doing
that in Europe now.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:59.260 align:middle line:84%
I think you're going to see
this market continue to climb,

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:00.650 align:middle line:90%
at least until the election.

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And the election is-- there's
a lot of unknowns about what's

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.230 align:middle line:90%
going to happen then.

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:05.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.585 align:middle line:84%
So you do not see
the bubble happening,

00:16:07.585 --> 00:16:08.835 align:middle line:90%
as some people are predicting?

00:16:08.835 --> 00:16:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: I'm saying
that there is a bubble,

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:12.340 align:middle line:90%
but as far as the bubble--

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't think
it's going to burst, though?

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:14.086 align:middle line:90%
>>CURTIS: No, I don't.

00:16:14.086 --> 00:16:18.070 align:middle line:84%
I think as long as you have that
Federal Reserve Board offering

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:21.470 align:middle line:84%
zero to 0.25 interest rates--
we have the lowest interest

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:24.930 align:middle line:84%
rates in the last 50 or
60 years right now-- I

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:27.300 align:middle line:84%
don't think that you'll
have a sustained--

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.310 align:middle line:84%
and I emphasize this-- a
sustained sell-off in Wall

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:32.980 align:middle line:90%
Street like we had in 2008.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:34.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
gold and silver?

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:39.146 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of hovering, gold
around $1,200-plus, silver $16,

00:16:39.146 --> 00:16:41.310 align:middle line:90%
$17 an ounce.

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:43.200 align:middle line:84%
It's gone higher
in the old days.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: Look,
gold was up to close

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:48.430 align:middle line:84%
to $2,000 We saw all
of your gold friends

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:51.020 align:middle line:84%
that were coming on the show,
and people talking about that.

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:51.686 align:middle line:90%
We're going to--

00:16:51.686 --> 00:16:52.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: $8,000 gold--

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:54.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: $5,000,
$6,000, whatever.

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:57.120 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line with
gold is, until we

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:01.750 align:middle line:84%
see-- until we see an imminence
of a new market crash,

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.810 align:middle line:84%
which we don't see
yet, we're going

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:06.900 align:middle line:84%
to see gold hovering in the
neighborhood of this $1,100

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.290 align:middle line:90%
to $1,200 range.

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:10.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's
really much room for it

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:14.400 align:middle line:84%
to go any lower than that, given
the cost of gold manufacturing

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.030 align:middle line:84%
or the bottom line
costs of bringing gold

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:18.770 align:middle line:90%
to the surface right now.

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:21.220 align:middle line:84%
I think you're pretty
much at a bottom.

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.569 align:middle line:84%
Now, for people
who are considering

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:26.420 align:middle line:84%
what to do as an
investor as a hedge,

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:30.240 align:middle line:84%
I would be very cautious
to jump into this right

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.920 align:middle line:90%
now as a hedge for people.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Because you've got a scenario
with this Federal Reserve--

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.100 align:middle line:84%
remember, there's no
commanding legal authority

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.140 align:middle line:90%
in the Federal Reserve.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.680 align:middle line:90%
Janet Yellen can do anything.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:44.870 align:middle line:84%
She's reading the ti leaves, and
they use all the common metrics

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:47.390 align:middle line:84%
that they have to determine
how they're going to do this.

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.175 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line is, there
is no inflationary cycle

00:17:50.175 --> 00:17:51.300 align:middle line:90%
that they're worried about.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.390 align:middle line:90%
It's deflation.

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:54.089 align:middle line:84%
As long as deflation
is on the horizon,

00:17:54.089 --> 00:17:56.130 align:middle line:84%
they are not going to
raise those interest rates.

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:57.940 align:middle line:84%
They're too afraid
that they could drive

00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.540 align:middle line:90%
the country into a recession.

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And remember, we're heading
into an election cycle.

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And typically, there's a chicken
in every pot during an election

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:05.350 align:middle line:90%
cycle.

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And they're not going to
want to mess with, you've got

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:09.500 align:middle line:90%
a good thing going right now.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, how long
has it been since they've

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:11.950 align:middle line:90%
raised interest rates?

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:13.320 align:middle line:90%
It's been years, hasn't it?

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.975 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: Well, I mean, interest
rates were slashed back in--

00:18:15.975 --> 00:18:17.907 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 2008.

00:18:17.907 --> 00:18:19.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: Yeah, when
Obama came into office.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:20.170 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:21.350 align:middle line:90%
They were already before that.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
haven't gone up since.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:23.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CURTIS: No, they haven't.

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:24.255 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is unprecedented.

00:18:24.255 --> 00:18:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: Well, it's
unprecedented in the United

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:26.190 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:27.523 align:middle line:90%
It's not unprecedented in Japan.

00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:30.200 align:middle line:84%
Japan has had zero-- they have
negative interest rates right

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.620 align:middle line:84%
now, where you actually get
incentive for companies, where

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.372 align:middle line:84%
they're buying
below par on money,

00:18:35.372 --> 00:18:37.080 align:middle line:84%
where the government
is subsidizing them.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.370 align:middle line:90%
They could do that too.

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Federal Reserve Board could
actually subsidize banks.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Listen, there's
no limit, George,

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:46.290 align:middle line:84%
to how much money the Federal
Reserve Board can print.

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:48.290 align:middle line:84%
If you looked at their
website and they told you

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:51.130 align:middle line:84%
in 2008, 2009, when
they were trying

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.060 align:middle line:84%
to piece this economy
back together,

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.450 align:middle line:84%
how much money the Federal
Reserve Board printed,

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:58.590 align:middle line:84%
on their website they said
they printed $6 trillion.

00:18:58.590 --> 00:18:59.939 align:middle line:90%
We know that in order--

00:18:59.939 --> 00:19:00.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just printed it.

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.479 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: No, but
I mean $6 trillion

00:19:02.479 --> 00:19:03.690 align:middle line:90%
was a drop in the bucket.

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:08.190 align:middle line:84%
They printed actually,
and there's $24 trillion

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:10.360 align:middle line:84%
that is completely
unaccounted for.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What you
mean unaccounted for?

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: It's not on their
books, the Federal Reserve

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:15.270 align:middle line:90%
Board.

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it's in
the system somewhere?

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:17.578 align:middle line:90%
>>CURTIS: It's in the system.

00:19:17.578 --> 00:19:19.030 align:middle line:90%
It's in JP Morgan's hands.

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:20.370 align:middle line:90%
It's in Wells Fargo's hands.

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:21.760 align:middle line:90%
It's an AIG's hands.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.790 align:middle line:84%
All the companies--
it's in General Motors--

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:24.095 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bank of America.

00:19:24.095 --> 00:19:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: Bank of
America-- all the companies

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:26.895 align:middle line:90%
that were bailed out.

00:19:26.895 --> 00:19:30.530 align:middle line:84%
It took close to $30 trillion
to bail out the country

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:32.300 align:middle line:90%
in 2008, not the $6 trillion.

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Had they not done
that, had they simply said,

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.980 align:middle line:84%
let it fail, let it collapse,
what would have happened,

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.220 align:middle line:90%
in your opinion?

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: I think you would
have seen runs on the banks

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:45.560 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:51.510 align:middle line:84%
I think you would have
seen the 1929 repeat.

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:52.900 align:middle line:90%
History would repeat itself.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.130 align:middle line:84%
You'd have an instant
replay of people

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:58.610 align:middle line:84%
rushing to their financial
institutions with nothing left.

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
risk that you had.

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:03.810 align:middle line:84%
The idea that somehow,
let 'em all go under,

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:06.530 align:middle line:84%
let all the big boys--
let 'em all fail,

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:10.330 align:middle line:84%
the big manufacturers,
Detroit, let the banks fail,

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:14.700 align:middle line:84%
you would have found a disaster
of far worse proportions

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.540 align:middle line:84%
than you saw in '29 and
through the Great Depression.

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Look, they called the last
recession the Great Recession.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:23.370 align:middle line:84%
It could very easily morphed
without this Federal Reserve

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:27.590 align:middle line:84%
intervention into
something far more atomic

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:29.750 align:middle line:90%
and catastrophic and nuclear.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.820 align:middle line:90%


00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Had they not provided the
liquidity to the banks,

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:40.684 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what would
have happened in 2008, 2009.

00:20:40.684 --> 00:20:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's all we need.

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:45.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, most of you probably
don't remember the recession

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:49.530 align:middle line:84%
from way gone back, the
Great Depression, I guess,

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:51.200 align:middle line:90%
as we would call it.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.590 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't even born then.

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:54.400 align:middle line:84%
John, I don't think
you were either.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: No, but I
know a lot of people

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:56.446 align:middle line:90%
that lived through it.

00:20:56.446 --> 00:21:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's been passed to me that
when people have no money--

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:03.750 align:middle line:84%
look, there's people living
on the fringe right now.

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:06.590 align:middle line:84%
Let's not for a second
think that this economy,

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:09.590 align:middle line:84%
this economic recovery
we have is really

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:11.120 align:middle line:90%
widespread for a lot of people.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not.

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: There are people--
this is where I'm headed.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:18.200 align:middle line:84%
The job analysis-- you can
have a 6.2% unemployment rate,

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.397 align:middle line:84%
and that's the government
metric that's used.

00:21:20.397 --> 00:21:21.605 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think it's higher.

00:21:21.605 --> 00:21:24.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: People could argue
it's far higher than that,

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:25.860 align:middle line:90%
because people just given up.

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And they've been taken
out of the statistic.

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.890 align:middle line:84%
But apart from
that, if you even go

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:34.940 align:middle line:84%
with the government
rate of 6.2%,

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.530 align:middle line:90%
these are not quality jobs.

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:39.700 align:middle line:84%
These are low income
and part-time jobs.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And with Obamacare,
what they've done

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.190 align:middle line:84%
is they've given the
biggest-- I mean,

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:47.000 align:middle line:84%
when you look at Obamacare,
and really, the good thing

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.117 align:middle line:84%
about Obamacare is that if
you were sick, if I were sick,

00:21:50.117 --> 00:21:51.950 align:middle line:84%
and we couldn't get
health insurance because

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:53.517 align:middle line:84%
of a preexisting
condition, somebody

00:21:53.517 --> 00:21:54.600 align:middle line:90%
can go out and get it now.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.900 align:middle line:90%
I have no problem with that.

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.150 align:middle line:90%
I don't think anybody does.

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.470 align:middle line:84%
But what I have a problem
with, with Obamacare,

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:01.690 align:middle line:84%
and why it is a
disaster, is because it's

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:06.990 align:middle line:84%
the biggest bailout to the
entire employer-based health

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:09.220 align:middle line:84%
care system that we've
ever seen in this country.

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:11.580 align:middle line:84%
As soon as that law
went into effect

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.690 align:middle line:84%
and they knew that
they no longer had

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:16.100 align:middle line:84%
to provide that insurance,
that they could force

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.840 align:middle line:84%
their employees who are
working 30 hours a week

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.600 align:middle line:84%
or less to go buy
Obamacare, that

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:26.380 align:middle line:84%
came off the expense ledger
for these major corporations.

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.270 align:middle line:90%
And that's not right.

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:32.140 align:middle line:84%
The taxpayer should not be
funding these corporations out

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:35.090 align:middle line:84%
of their obligation to provide
employer-based health care.

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
why Obamacare either

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:42.200 align:middle line:84%
needs to be fixed or it needs
to be trashed, because of that.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Retain the rule that you cannot
deny people health insurance

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:50.950 align:middle line:84%
or rate them up, but do not
allow these employers to get

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:53.326 align:middle line:84%
off the hook as far as paying
employer-based health care.

00:22:53.326 --> 00:22:54.741 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
have happened,

00:22:54.741 --> 00:22:56.800 align:middle line:84%
John, if we had a
system in place where

00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:01.180 align:middle line:84%
if you need a new kidney,
that the government makes sure

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:02.350 align:middle line:90%
you get that kidney?

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:03.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: Well, I
think the problem

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:08.290 align:middle line:84%
is with government-- Obamacare
is a private sector a scenario,

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:11.270 align:middle line:84%
where the health insurance
industry is essentially

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:12.310 align:middle line:90%
running it and gouging.

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:14.980 align:middle line:84%
There's no regulation on it
right now through Congress,

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:18.430 align:middle line:84%
because Congress is in massive
gridlock, as everybody's heard.

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:21.090 align:middle line:84%
So it means that they
can get away with a lot,

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:24.920 align:middle line:84%
as far as raising prices
in an unprecedented way.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.370 align:middle line:84%
Their profits in the
insurance industry

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:28.390 align:middle line:90%
have never been higher.

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:30.450 align:middle line:90%
So they love Obamacare.

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:33.690 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is, when you
have any kind of a government

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:37.530 align:middle line:84%
program, just
answer, it inevitably

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:40.260 align:middle line:84%
will fail because there's so
much cronyism, there are so

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:43.670 align:middle line:84%
many payoffs, there's so much
insider manipulation that

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:46.210 align:middle line:84%
goes on that I don't think
anybody would trust it.

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:49.230 align:middle line:84%
The fact is that it goes on
that way anyway right now.

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:53.220 align:middle line:84%
We know folks that have been
in high places who have gotten

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:57.890 align:middle line:84%
heart transplants with
nice healthy bodies

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:01.810 align:middle line:84%
stepped out of line and got
those transplants faster

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:04.161 align:middle line:84%
because they were
able to pony up.

00:24:04.161 --> 00:24:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going
to name any names,

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:07.451 align:middle line:84%
but I think you know
who I'm talking about.

00:24:07.451 --> 00:24:10.064 align:middle line:90%
And so if you had it with the--

00:24:10.064 --> 00:24:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They moved to
the front of the lines.

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:13.355 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: They
certainly are very

00:24:13.355 --> 00:24:15.720 align:middle line:84%
vociferous since their
heart transplant, too.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.100 align:middle line:84%
They talk more when
they have more oxygen,

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:19.870 align:middle line:84%
and their hearts
are working better.

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:24.600 align:middle line:84%
So I have no problem with
having fairness in the system.

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.700 align:middle line:84%
The problem that we
have right now is,

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:34.620 align:middle line:84%
you cannot pass the buck to
American taxpayers and take

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:37.600 align:middle line:84%
this burden of paying
for health care off

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:41.180 align:middle line:84%
of the employer's balance sheet
and let them stick all this

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.384 align:middle line:90%
money overseas.

00:24:42.384 --> 00:24:44.300 align:middle line:84%
All this money that's
out of the country right

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:45.883 align:middle line:84%
now, these major
employers like Apple,

00:24:45.883 --> 00:24:48.680 align:middle line:84%
and you name the biggest
corporations in the world,

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.330 align:middle line:84%
they're keeping
all their trillions

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:53.430 align:middle line:84%
of dollars of cash
out of the country.

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:55.132 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And not
paying taxes on it.

00:24:55.132 --> 00:24:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: Well, that
goes without saying.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:00.707 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, you can't
stick it to the taxpayer

00:25:00.707 --> 00:25:02.290 align:middle line:84%
to pay the employer-based
health care.

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:02.957 align:middle line:90%
That's not fair.

00:25:02.957 --> 00:25:04.206 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But they're doing it.

00:25:04.206 --> 00:25:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: Well, that's
what Obamacare-- that's

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:08.380 align:middle line:84%
the loophole in the law
that's killing the system.

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.629 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So when does it
change, a new administration?

00:25:10.629 --> 00:25:14.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: Well, you talk
about a new administration--

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:21.580 align:middle line:84%
it's like the Republicans hosted
their conservative dog and pony

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:23.470 align:middle line:84%
show over the
weekend, and you had

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:25.990 align:middle line:84%
everybody like-- first
they thought that, well, we

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:27.070 align:middle line:90%
should rip Obama.

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And then they figured out,
well, why are we ripping him?

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.240 align:middle line:90%
He's not running again.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.900 align:middle line:84%
So then they start
ripping Hillary.

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And now they're talking about
things like, oh, my God,

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:36.359 align:middle line:90%
can you imagine?

00:25:36.359 --> 00:25:38.650 align:middle line:84%
They have a foundation and
there's foreign money in it.

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Foreign money-- who
are you kidding?

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:41.580 align:middle line:84%
How much foreign
money do you think

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:43.454 align:middle line:84%
there is in all these
presidential libraries?

00:25:43.454 --> 00:25:47.539 align:middle line:84%
H. W. Bush's, George's,
Clinton's-- where you think all

00:25:47.539 --> 00:25:49.580 align:middle line:84%
the money came from to
construct these libraries?

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:52.740 align:middle line:84%
Where do think Obama's money--
did it come from, as we know,

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:55.360 align:middle line:84%
cheap petro dollars
from the Middle East?

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.620 align:middle line:90%
We all know this.

00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:00.600 align:middle line:84%
So the kettle calls the
pot black all the time.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.910 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line is, they're
looking for anything

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:06.130 align:middle line:84%
they can to indict any
Democratic candidate.

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think it
appears that there

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.312 align:middle line:90%
is an anointed one coming on.

00:26:10.312 --> 00:26:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And she hasn't
announced yet, but I

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:14.540 align:middle line:84%
think everybody is fairly
certain that Hillary Clinton,

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:16.910 align:middle line:84%
unless she dies between
now and the election,

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:17.824 align:middle line:90%
she's going to run.

00:26:17.824 --> 00:26:19.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I see a dark horse
popping in here, though.

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere, either whether it's
a Republican or a Democrat,

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:27.420 align:middle line:84%
someone's going to come out
and be totally refreshing.

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Because I think people may be
tired of these little family

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:32.080 align:middle line:90%
dynasties.

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:37.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: Well, there
are dark horses all over.

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.430 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people throughout
the history of mankind

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:42.450 align:middle line:84%
have always wanted some kind of
dark horse to come rescue them.

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:45.610 align:middle line:90%
We all know what that means.

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:50.130 align:middle line:84%
I think the menagerie that you
get with the groups out there,

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:51.690 align:middle line:84%
I think this is
what you're getting.

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:53.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Slim pickings.

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: There's not much
on the Democratic side,

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:58.310 align:middle line:90%
other than Hillary.

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And there's certainly the same
familiar cast of characters

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.060 align:middle line:90%
that have been running.

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:07.386 align:middle line:84%
The dark horse would be, let's
say McCain decided that--

00:27:07.386 --> 00:27:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He wants to
come back and run again?

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:09.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CURTIS: Forget my age.

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:11.830 align:middle line:84%
What does age got to
do with it anymore?

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:13.421 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's done.

00:27:13.421 --> 00:27:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CURTIS: But you're
talking about a dark horse.

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:19.322 align:middle line:84%
So, who do you think,
Elizabeth Warren?

00:27:19.322 --> 00:27:20.530 align:middle line:90%
She's not quite ready for it.

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:22.964 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Scott Walker's
coming on like crazy,

00:27:22.964 --> 00:27:24.130 align:middle line:90%
the governor from Wisconsin.

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:25.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CURTIS: He's from Wisconsin.

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Scott Walker is not
ready for prime time.

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:30.970 align:middle line:90%
He has zero foreign policy.

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:33.910 align:middle line:84%
These geopolitical concerns
right now-- the world

00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:38.260 align:middle line:84%
is ready to-- the US is ready
for a proxy war with Russia.

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:39.860 align:middle line:84%
We're on the verge
of arming-- we're

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:41.960 align:middle line:90%
arming Syrian rebels right now.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:47.100 align:middle line:84%
The last time we armed that with
General Salim-- this is Idris,

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.780 align:middle line:84%
he's a friend of McCain's--
ISIS took all the weaponry that

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:53.317 align:middle line:84%
the US gave them away, and
they're now using it against--

00:27:53.317 --> 00:27:54.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Against us.

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:55.025 align:middle line:90%
>>CURTIS: Against us.

00:27:55.025 --> 00:27:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And now, the idea
that we're going

00:27:56.750 --> 00:28:01.150 align:middle line:84%
to somehow join back and
start resupplying arms, that's

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:04.160 align:middle line:84%
going to affect the negotiations
in Geneva on an arms

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.440 align:middle line:84%
deal with Iran more
than anything else.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.720 align:middle line:90%
But think about this.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.735 align:middle line:84%
The proxy war-- you
talk about a proxy war,

00:28:09.735 --> 00:28:11.650 align:middle line:84%
you start arming
Ukraine right now,

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:16.600 align:middle line:84%
and the French and the Germans
are horrified by that prospect.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And they're essentially
running the EU.

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Anybody that thinks that this
is EU is right out of Brussels,

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:23.800 align:middle line:84%
they've got a lot
of thinking to do.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:24.990 align:middle line:90%
It's run out of--

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:26.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Putin
will pull the plug

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:30.470 align:middle line:84%
on any nation that
arms the Ukrainians.

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CURTIS: Absolutely.

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And the Baltic
states are terrified.

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:37.210 align:middle line:90%
Poland is terrified.

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:39.610 align:middle line:84%
They're all afraid
right now of Putin

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:43.900 align:middle line:84%
marching in that Russian
army and returning

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:45.776 align:middle line:84%
to the old Soviet
satellites that were there.

00:28:45.776 --> 00:28:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who's
going to stop him?

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:48.345 align:middle line:90%
>>CURTIS: No one.

00:28:48.345 --> 00:28:49.190 align:middle line:90%
There's no one.

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And the bottom line
is, you can isolate him

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.060 align:middle line:84%
all you want with
economic sanctions.

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:57.370 align:middle line:84%
But there's rogue regimes
all over the world.

00:28:57.370 --> 00:29:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And there's these
devouring Pac-Man regimes

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:03.910 align:middle line:90%
like China and India.

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:07.070 align:middle line:84%
They're thirsty,
a bottomless pit

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:13.920 align:middle line:84%
of abysmal neediness of energy
and money and nuclear power.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Russia
can supply them.

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:19.464 align:middle line:84%
So they don't want
to alienate Russia.

00:29:19.464 --> 00:29:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We should have kept
Saddam Hussein in power.

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:26.230 align:middle line:84%
We should have kept
Muammar Gaddafi in power.

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And even though they weren't Boy
Scouts, they were controllable.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't have the kind of
chaos we appear to have today.

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:36.850 align:middle line:10%
>>CURTIS: Well, and
what you're mentioning

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:42.620 align:middle line:10%
is the exact reason why
the forces, the chaos,

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:46.230 align:middle line:10%
the utter anarchy that is going
on all through the Middle East,

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:51.040 align:middle line:10%
with the exception right now of
the military dictatorship that

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:57.030 align:middle line:10%
is in control of Egypt,
with Fattah Assis,

00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:02.500 align:middle line:10%
he is the only-- that was a
Saddam Hussein-like, Baathist,

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.130 align:middle line:10%
authoritarian regime.

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:06.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a control of Egypt.

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:08.212 align:middle line:84%
They have declared the
Muslim Brotherhood--

00:30:08.212 --> 00:30:10.420 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know if you
caught this latest news item,

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:14.910 align:middle line:84%
but a judge in Egypt
yesterday, I believe it was,

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:17.770 align:middle line:84%
declared Hamas a
terror organization

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:20.790 align:middle line:84%
because they're closely tied
to the Muslim Brotherhood.

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:24.639 align:middle line:84%
And Egypt's Assis
understands the consequences.

00:30:24.639 --> 00:30:25.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go figure.

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:27.190 align:middle line:84%
John, we're out of time,
but I want to thank you

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:28.398 align:middle line:90%
for being on "Beyond Belief."

00:30:28.398 --> 00:30:29.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CURTIS: Oh, my God.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:30.430 align:middle line:90%
It was great.

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:32.910 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: World events--
they all happen

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:34.380 align:middle line:10%
and they all affect all of us.

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:35.210 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:37.330 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:41.280 align:middle line:90%
