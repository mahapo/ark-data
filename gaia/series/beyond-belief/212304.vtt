00:00:17.868 --> 00:00:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.300 align:middle line:10%
Vicki Joy Anderson is with us,
an author of the paranormal.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.660 align:middle line:10%
And she has researched the
sleep paralysis phenomenon

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.290 align:middle line:10%
for 10 years after
experiencing sleep paralysis

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.479 align:middle line:10%
for more than 45 years.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.960 align:middle line:84%
Her book is called "They
Only Come Out at Night."

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.285 align:middle line:90%
Vicki, welcome to the program.

00:00:37.285 --> 00:00:38.370 align:middle line:84%
>>VICKI JOY ANDERSON:
Thanks, George.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.380 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me on.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 45 years,
you've been at this?

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: That's a long
time to be chasing and getting

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.990 align:middle line:90%
away from that.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.420 align:middle line:84%
But yep, probably since I
was about three years old.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.365 align:middle line:84%
Well, explain what
sleep paralysis is.

00:00:51.365 --> 00:00:52.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Yeah, absolutely.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.210 align:middle line:10%
I think, personally, I think
the phrase is a little bit

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.060 align:middle line:10%
deceptive.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.360 align:middle line:10%
I think there's probably
a better word for it

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.690 align:middle line:10%
because everyone has sleep
paralysis every night

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.690 align:middle line:10%
several times.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.190 align:middle line:84%
It's a physiological
aspect of our sleep cycles.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.970 align:middle line:84%
When we go into deep
sleeps and REM sleep,

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.340 align:middle line:90%
our body naturally shuts down.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is for
protection, or we

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.270 align:middle line:84%
would be getting up and
possibly stumbling downstairs

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.640 align:middle line:90%
or walking into traffic.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.820 align:middle line:84%
So there's nothing
unusual, supernatural,

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.780 align:middle line:84%
or paranormal about our body
going into states of paralysis

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.950 align:middle line:90%
while we sleep.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.990 align:middle line:84%
What people really
mean when they

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.200 align:middle line:84%
say sleep paralysis
is a phenomenon that

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.910 align:middle line:84%
during this state of
paralysis, the veil thins.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.190 align:middle line:84%
These altered states
of consciousness,

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.460 align:middle line:84%
as we come in and out of
sleep, become liminal spaces.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And we see into
spiritual realms,

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.100 align:middle line:84%
which unfortunately
for most people,

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.630 align:middle line:90%
is a terrifying experience.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sometimes, I sleep
on the edge of my bed,

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.990 align:middle line:90%
but I don't fall off.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.680 align:middle line:84%
Is that because I'm probably
undergoing sleep paralysis

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.545 align:middle line:90%
in my sleep state?

00:02:02.545 --> 00:02:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Very well
could be, George.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.300 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of people--
some people toss and turn

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.100 align:middle line:90%
quite a bit.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.759 align:middle line:84%
But then there's
other people, where

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.120 align:middle line:84%
they wake up in the exact same
position as they fell asleep.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And these states of paralysis,
they're common, they're normal.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.900 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when this paralysis
ceases to function correctly,

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.560 align:middle line:84%
that's where we have things like
sleepwalking or even bedwetting

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.330 align:middle line:84%
because those are
things that shut down.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: When we sleep.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.805 align:middle line:84%
How did you get
involved in all of this?

00:02:29.805 --> 00:02:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Against my
will, really, George.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.100 align:middle line:84%
It started happening to me,
as best as I can remember,

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.000 align:middle line:90%
three years old.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.170 align:middle line:90%
It may have happened sooner.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.880 align:middle line:84%
But who can recollect
to that point?

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And so it really wasn't
until I was in my teens

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.240 align:middle line:84%
that I started to have
a curiosity about it.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.830 align:middle line:84%
I think when you're
little, you just

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.330 align:middle line:90%
think everything's a bad dream.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.970 align:middle line:84%
You don't necessarily start
connecting dots or coming up

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:54.810 align:middle line:90%
with theories.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And in high school, I think I
was really into dark things.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.040 align:middle line:84%
In high school, I was watching
all the horror movies.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.000 align:middle line:90%
And this was the '80s.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.297 align:middle line:90%
So everything was like--

00:03:04.297 --> 00:03:05.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You enjoyed that?

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: I did.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.870 align:middle line:84%
I migrated towards
dark literature,

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.840 align:middle line:90%
HP Lovecraft, Edgar Allan Poe.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.490 align:middle line:90%
I was into dark music.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And so because I was fascinated
with things that were dark,

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.930 align:middle line:84%
I became fascinated with
the sleep paralysis.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.000 align:middle line:84%
But it really wasn't until my
40s that the fascination waned.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And I got to the point
where I was unsatisfied

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.050 align:middle line:84%
with the silly explanations
and official narratives that

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.340 align:middle line:90%
are given on the internet.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
come to the bottom.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.130 align:middle line:90%
Why is this happening to me?

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.530 align:middle line:90%
I never asked for this.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'm starting to
understand that this

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.470 align:middle line:84%
is happening to a lot of people,
which I didn't know previously.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I went into
journalist mode, research mode.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.278 align:middle line:84%
And I decided I want to
figure out what this is.

00:03:53.278 --> 00:03:55.695 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important was the
internet for your research?

00:03:55.695 --> 00:03:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: It was
absolutely crucial.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.860 align:middle line:84%
When I was in my 30s,
I was falling asleep

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.090 align:middle line:90%
listening to podcasts.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.875 align:middle line:90%
And so there was an apologetic--

00:04:04.875 --> 00:04:06.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And my show, I hope.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.005 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Oh, of course.

00:04:07.005 --> 00:04:07.805 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thank you.

00:04:07.805 --> 00:04:08.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Of course.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.782 align:middle line:84%
One of the shows I listened to,
simply because it was lengthy

00:04:11.782 --> 00:04:13.740 align:middle line:84%
and it would give me
enough time to fall asleep

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.680 align:middle line:84%
and then it wouldn't wake me up
when the end of the show music

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.709 align:middle line:84%
came roaring on, was
an apologetics podcast

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.029 align:middle line:90%
that ran about three hours.

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And one night, they
were doing a show on,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.110 align:middle line:84%
what is the deal with this
sudden interest in all

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.440 align:middle line:84%
of this paranormal stuff,
ghost hunting, and all

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.640 align:middle line:90%
of these things.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.590 align:middle line:84%
This is probably
about 15 years ago.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.030 align:middle line:90%
And I fell asleep.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up in the
middle of the night

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.540 align:middle line:84%
just as they were talking about
sleep paralysis, a phrase,

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.427 align:middle line:84%
up to that point in
my life, I had never--

00:04:44.427 --> 00:04:45.885 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Synchronicity
at its best.

00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Absolutely.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.480 align:middle line:84%
Never heard the term
"sleep paralysis."

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.900 align:middle line:84%
I had chills run all
the way through my body

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:90%
as they gave that phrase.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.900 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't believe
that someone, verbatim,

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.330 align:middle line:84%
was explaining the exact
same phenomenon that I

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.080 align:middle line:84%
had been encountering
my whole life, which

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.673 align:middle line:90%
I thought was exclusive to me.

00:05:06.673 --> 00:05:08.715 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know anyone else
was going through this.

00:05:08.715 --> 00:05:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everybody
goes through this.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Everybody,
unbeknownst to me.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.650 align:middle line:84%
So the next day-- and again,
this was 15 years ago or more,

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.010 align:middle line:84%
so the internet even then
wasn't what it is today.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't even know
if Google was around.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.850 align:middle line:84%
So somehow, I did a search
for sleep paralysis.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And what came up wasn't a lot
of information but message

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.960 align:middle line:84%
boards where hundreds of people
were sharing their stories.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't
believe that it was

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.850 align:middle line:84%
the exact same situation, the
same sights, the same sounds.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, now,
this is curious.

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Because if this was just
nightmares or bad dreams

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:48.110 align:middle line:84%
or that bad slice of pizza
you eat too much too close

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.960 align:middle line:84%
to bedtime, why
would everyone be

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.620 align:middle line:84%
seeing the same characters
and the same feelings

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.430 align:middle line:84%
and hearing the same voices
and getting the same messages?

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I knew there's
something more to this.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Vicki, would you
say that 9 out of 10 people

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.586 align:middle line:90%
experienced sleep paralysis?

00:06:05.586 --> 00:06:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: I would say that
would be a fair estimate if you

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.960 align:middle line:84%
count all the people
that have, maybe, only

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.140 align:middle line:84%
had it once or twice in
their life, as well as,

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.890 align:middle line:90%
George, what I'm finding now.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Is, there are a
lot of people that

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.790 align:middle line:84%
have sleep paralysis that have
no recollection in the morning

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:23.930 align:middle line:90%
that they've had it.

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.950 align:middle line:84%
But they're finding out because
a spouse or a college roommate

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.642 align:middle line:84%
will express to
them the next day,

00:06:29.642 --> 00:06:31.100 align:middle line:84%
you were calling
out in your sleep,

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.720 align:middle line:84%
you were crying out
the name of Jesus,

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.050 align:middle line:84%
you were waving your arms around
like you were sword fighting.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And they have no
recollection of it.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.480 align:middle line:84%
So what's interesting about
this is that, I think,

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.780 align:middle line:84%
sleep paralysis is so
common that there's even

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.580 align:middle line:84%
people that have
encountered it that will

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:47.835 align:middle line:90%
have no recollection of it.

00:06:47.835 --> 00:06:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Vicki, tell
us about the book.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.082 align:middle line:90%
How did you decide to write it?

00:06:51.082 --> 00:06:52.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Absolutely.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.010 align:middle line:84%
So "They Only Come Out at
Night, Exposing the Dark Weapon

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.440 align:middle line:84%
of Sleep Paralysis,"
this did not

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.000 align:middle line:84%
come about with any organized
thought or intention.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.738 align:middle line:84%
I had always wanted
to be a writer.

00:07:03.738 --> 00:07:05.780 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be a writer
since I was 10 years old.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.100 align:middle line:90%
My mom was a writer.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And my little perfect
picture in my mind

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.770 align:middle line:84%
is that I would come
up with a pen name.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And I would just write beautiful
poetry in the woods somewhere.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And no one would
ever know who I was.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted
to write things that

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:20.990 align:middle line:90%
were beautiful and encouraging.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And what ended up
happening is, I

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:29.060 align:middle line:84%
started writing for an
online magazine that

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.965 align:middle line:84%
wanted a biblical perspective
of paranormal and fringe.

00:07:32.965 --> 00:07:34.242 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they pay you?

00:07:34.242 --> 00:07:35.186 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: No.

00:07:35.186 --> 00:07:35.660 align:middle line:90%
Total--

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:36.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gratis, OK.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.310 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: --volunteer work.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And so never despise
small beginnings, as they say.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And so I was just
happy to finally

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:49.490 align:middle line:84%
have an outlet for these two
aspects of my personality

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:52.250 align:middle line:84%
that never seemed
to fit together.

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.560 align:middle line:84%
There's part of me that has
this religious and biblical

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.360 align:middle line:90%
training.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.902 align:middle line:84%
But then there's
this part of me that

00:07:57.902 --> 00:08:02.060 align:middle line:84%
is fascinated with the
spirit realm and these darker

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.415 align:middle line:84%
things that, I think,
have significance.

00:08:04.415 --> 00:08:06.275 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
mixing the two together.

00:08:06.275 --> 00:08:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: I was mixing
the two together, exactly.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't think
that I would ever

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.040 align:middle line:84%
have an opportunity
or a platform

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.840 align:middle line:84%
or even an audience
for such a thing.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.570 align:middle line:90%
And so I started writing.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And what was great about
this particular magazine is,

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.700 align:middle line:84%
I could write about
whatever I wanted.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.210 align:middle line:84%
There was no slaps on the
hand or editors cutting out

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:27.330 align:middle line:90%
the crazy stuff.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.870 align:middle line:84%
So that really allowed me
to go further and further

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:31.010 align:middle line:90%
into the fringes.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.903 align:middle line:84%
And so I decided,
well, I'm going

00:08:33.903 --> 00:08:35.570 align:middle line:84%
to write on sleep
paralysis because I've

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:36.820 align:middle line:90%
gone through it my whole life.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And so clearly, I must
be an expert on it.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And when I actually went
to write the article,

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:44.460 align:middle line:84%
I realized I've experienced
this my entire life.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And if someone actually asked
me who, what, when, where, why,

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:51.650 align:middle line:84%
how, I don't think I could
give them a good explanation.

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:53.210 align:middle line:90%
So that piqued my interest.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:54.860 align:middle line:90%
And I began to research.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.450 align:middle line:90%
And I began to read.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:59.480 align:middle line:90%
And I would read everything.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.390 align:middle line:90%
I would read things on Kabbalah.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:03.980 align:middle line:84%
I would read things
in the occult.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.440 align:middle line:90%
I would read ancient things.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were
obsessed with this stuff.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:07.510 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:10.940 align:middle line:84%
I would read theological things,
biblical things, anywhere

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.400 align:middle line:84%
I could get-- and what
I started to realize,

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.930 align:middle line:84%
and this touches on the opening
paragraph of HP Lovecraft's

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.420 align:middle line:84%
"Call of Cthulhu,"
I started to realize

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:24.860 align:middle line:84%
that the reason that we
are unable to understand

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:28.460 align:middle line:84%
a lot of what's going on
is that the sciences of all

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.600 align:middle line:84%
strained in their
own directions.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.990 align:middle line:84%
So they have hitherto
hurt us little.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And if we are able
to get to a place

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:40.280 align:middle line:84%
where we're able to
re-associate allegedly

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.870 align:middle line:84%
disassociative knowledge, it
will open up vistas of reality.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think part of the
reason why we don't understand

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:53.390 align:middle line:84%
a lot of this stuff is,
Christianity and the church

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:59.540 align:middle line:84%
has completely forbade or made
taboo anything supernatural,

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.087 align:middle line:84%
which is bizarre
because the Bible is

00:10:02.087 --> 00:10:03.170 align:middle line:90%
an extremely supernatural.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Other than
exorcisms, of course.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Absolutely.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.380 align:middle line:84%
But then if you delve into
the realms of science,

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.020 align:middle line:84%
they explain the
supernatural away.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's always brain
firings and narcolepsy

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:16.350 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.490 align:middle line:84%
So both sides of the
table have to join hands

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.700 align:middle line:84%
and find that some of this
knowledge that we're told

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:26.300 align:middle line:84%
is not associated, if
we pull it back together

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.220 align:middle line:84%
and bring it into
the same sphere,

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.888 align:middle line:84%
that they are just different
facets of the same diamond.

00:10:30.888 --> 00:10:32.555 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Vicki, you
grew up in Virginia.

00:10:32.555 --> 00:10:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Yes, I did.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something
happened in that house.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: It did.

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure in my
heart here, George,

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm being very vulnerable here.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.340 align:middle line:90%
This was back in the early '70s.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And no one in my family, no one
in the church where we went,

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:52.220 align:middle line:84%
no one would have had an
accurate explanation for what

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:55.410 align:middle line:84%
was going on or seen the
signs or the breadcrumb trail,

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:56.390 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.310 align:middle line:90%
We lived there for a year.

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:03.442 align:middle line:84%
And a litany of bizarre,
terrifying events happened.

00:11:03.442 --> 00:11:05.150 align:middle line:84%
It was played out like
a Hollywood movie.

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:06.608 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To all of
you or just you?

00:11:06.608 --> 00:11:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: To my
brother and I, primarily.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:11.510 align:middle line:84%
I think my brother
got the brunt of it.

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:14.400 align:middle line:84%
My mom told stories
later in her life.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think that much
happened with my father.

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:22.570 align:middle line:84%
My brother started having
nightly night terrors.

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And night terrors is actually
a very separate phenomenon

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:26.875 align:middle line:90%
from sleep paralysis.

00:11:26.875 --> 00:11:27.625 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And It's frightening.

00:11:27.625 --> 00:11:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: It's
very frightening.

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:30.790 align:middle line:90%
He would have them nightly.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:32.530 align:middle line:90%
And he would sleepwalk.

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And my mother
would often wake up

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:37.400 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the night
with that maternal instinct

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.200 align:middle line:90%
premonition.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And she would run into
my brother's room.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.380 align:middle line:90%
And his bed would be empty.

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And he would be in the middle
of the street, dodging traffic,

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.760 align:middle line:90%
totally oblivious.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.335 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just not
like sleepwalking.

00:11:47.335 --> 00:11:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Sleepwalking,
totally oblivious.

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:51.435 align:middle line:90%
He was impossible to wake up.

00:11:51.435 --> 00:11:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And the next morning, he
would have no recollection

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.220 align:middle line:90%
of what happened.

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And I
believe that this

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.800 align:middle line:84%
is where I picked up the
sleep paralysis, simply

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.440 align:middle line:84%
because I have a lone funny
memory of telling my mom one

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.240 align:middle line:90%
night.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.860 align:middle line:84%
I was probably
only three, George.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:06.915 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it?

00:12:06.915 --> 00:12:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Only
three years old.

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:11.380 align:middle line:84%
But I remember telling my mom
that I was afraid of the dark

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.710 align:middle line:84%
and that I was afraid of
the shadows on the wall.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And she told me, as you
would tell a three-year-old,

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.020 align:middle line:84%
she told me, you don't
have to be afraid

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:24.000 align:middle line:84%
because the angels
are watching over you.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
what's an angel?

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And because I only got a
three-year-old explanation,

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.450 align:middle line:84%
the only thing she said was
they're big, they're bright,

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.010 align:middle line:90%
and they're everywhere.

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:35.030 align:middle line:90%
So she left.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And I took that
council very literally.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.360 align:middle line:90%
And I looked around my room.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't see anything
big or bright or everywhere.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.650 align:middle line:90%
So I decided to investigate.

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And I went and
got up out of bed,

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:45.860 align:middle line:90%
and I looked out my window.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:49.312 align:middle line:84%
And all up and down my street
were these massive streetlights

00:12:49.312 --> 00:12:51.020 align:middle line:84%
going all the way up
and down the street.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And they were big,
and they were bright,

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:53.600 align:middle line:90%
and they were everywhere.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.510 align:middle line:84%
So I assumed, hey, there's
a whole bunch of angels

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:57.740 align:middle line:90%
parked outside my window.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:58.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm cool.

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:01.880 align:middle line:84%
So even though I
can't directly tie

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.090 align:middle line:84%
to that I was having sleep
paralysis at that time,

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:07.040 align:middle line:84%
the fact that I have
that memory that I

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.050 align:middle line:84%
was afraid of
shadows on the wall,

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:13.220 align:middle line:84%
makes me believe that might
have been where I picked this up

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.400 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.240 align:middle line:90%
So what we found out later--

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.340 align:middle line:84%
and this is where
we get into the woo.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.745 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
the scientific minds

00:13:21.745 --> 00:13:23.120 align:middle line:84%
and the investigative
journalists

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.710 align:middle line:84%
will say, well, you
can't prove that.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:26.120 align:middle line:90%
And I can't.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:32.200 align:middle line:84%
But what happened later was, we
had a neighbor after we moved

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.590 align:middle line:84%
write to my mom and say,
I'm dying of curiosity,

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:38.200 align:middle line:84%
did anything strange ever
happen in your house?

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And my mom is a
very private person.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Her cards were very
close to the vest.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And so she played dumb and
said, well, what do you mean?

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And the neighbor said,
well, everyone on the block

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:52.510 align:middle line:84%
has this conspiracy theory
that your house is haunted.

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And so my mom said,
well, why would you--

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.220 align:middle line:84%
where are people
getting that from?

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
the home is owned by--

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.190 align:middle line:90%
we were renting the home.

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:06.010 align:middle line:84%
The home is owned by
a satanic high priest.

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And we've heard that rituals
are done in your basement.

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:13.660 align:middle line:84%
So that didn't mean anything
to us in the 1970s, George.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.143 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that just sounded
preposterous to us.

00:14:17.143 --> 00:14:18.310 align:middle line:90%
There's no such thing as a--

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Woo stuff.

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:19.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: --high priest.

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:20.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:24.610 align:middle line:84%
So I think we wrote that off
for three decades as silly.

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Now that there's
so much disclosure,

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:28.930 align:middle line:84%
and we're finding out so
much more about the spirit

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:32.420 align:middle line:84%
realm and the astral
realm, and we're

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:35.330 align:middle line:84%
able to talk about things now
that you couldn't talk about

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.380 align:middle line:84%
without getting the rubber
stamp of schizophrenic

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:38.180 align:middle line:90%
on your forehead.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can get
away with it now.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it conceivable that
you can use sleep paralysis

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:44.380 align:middle line:90%
to your benefit?

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: This is a
tough question, George.

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:49.850 align:middle line:84%
This is where I
fear that I'm going

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:54.015 align:middle line:84%
to diverge from the typical
viewer of this show.

00:14:54.015 --> 00:14:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I just want to preface
what I'm about to say with,

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:58.760 align:middle line:90%
I have no desire to be divisive.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.710 align:middle line:84%
There's too much
division in this world.

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:04.010 align:middle line:84%
I have no desire to set
myself on a pedestal

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:07.265 align:middle line:84%
or advertise some
worldview above another.

00:15:07.265 --> 00:15:09.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're not
going to hit me, are you?

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.765 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: I'm not
going to punch you.

00:15:10.765 --> 00:15:14.000 align:middle line:84%
But I spent quite a
bit of time trying

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.130 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what would
be an appropriate subtitle

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:16.930 align:middle line:90%
for this book.

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And I landed upon,
"exposing the dark weapon

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:23.450 align:middle line:84%
of sleep paralysis," knowing
it would be controversial,

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:24.870 align:middle line:90%
knowing it would step on toes,

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:25.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: --knowing
that sacred cows

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.200 align:middle line:84%
would be slaughtered and
made into leather jackets.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.460 align:middle line:84%
But I really do believe that
sleep paralysis brings us

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:42.760 align:middle line:84%
into a realm, a spiritual realm,
that is filled with rulers,

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:47.020 align:middle line:84%
principalities, archons,
and spiritual forces

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.180 align:middle line:90%
that can be very deceptive.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, depending on
your ilk, some people

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:55.540 align:middle line:84%
will classify them as lower
and higher vibrational.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Some will say,
angels versus demons.

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:00.610 align:middle line:90%
Some will say, good versus evil.

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:04.030 align:middle line:84%
I think that there's more
categories than just the black

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:05.080 align:middle line:90%
and the white.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:09.370 align:middle line:84%
But the range of
beings or entities

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:14.290 align:middle line:84%
that live in the high
places, the epouranios, which

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:17.470 align:middle line:84%
would be the Greek word of the
high places of the King James

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:21.640 align:middle line:84%
version, they are
explicitly introduced

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:27.370 align:middle line:84%
as characters that rebelled and
fell from the original heaven

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:30.160 align:middle line:90%
and created their own heaven.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And so I just want
to warn people

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:36.400 align:middle line:84%
who delve very deeply
into these things,

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.005 align:middle line:84%
we all delve into
spirituality for pure motives.

00:16:40.005 --> 00:16:40.805 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:16:40.805 --> 00:16:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And
yet there's a point

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:44.930 align:middle line:90%
where we can delve too far.

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And the metaphor I like
to use for this, George,

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:50.930 align:middle line:90%
is JRR Tolkien's.

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:52.460 align:middle line:84%
In "Fellowship of
the Ring," there's

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.950 align:middle line:84%
this beautiful passage
where the narrator

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:58.820 align:middle line:84%
is explaining what happened
to the race of dwarves.

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.100 align:middle line:84%
They were living in
the mines of Moria.

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.750 align:middle line:90%
And they discovered gold.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And so they dug deeper
and deeper and deeper.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:10.326 align:middle line:84%
And they were so greedy with
their lust for this wealth.

00:17:10.326 --> 00:17:11.409 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They wanted more.

00:17:11.409 --> 00:17:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: They
wanted more that they

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:14.960 align:middle line:90%
dug deeper and deeper.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And they eventually
dug so deep that they

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.000 align:middle line:90%
crossed the threshold.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.089 align:middle line:84%
And they opened up the pit where
the Balrog lived, this dragon.

00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And the dragon then
leapt through this portal

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:30.240 align:middle line:90%
and consumed them.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And so the metaphor
in that is that we all

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:35.930 align:middle line:90%
start out with pure motives.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.600 align:middle line:84%
Whether you go to a
new age bookstore,

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:42.650 align:middle line:84%
or you go to a seminary, most
people, they want answers.

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:44.540 align:middle line:90%
They want to be a better person.

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.200 align:middle line:90%
They want to help other people.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.825 align:middle line:84%
These are all pure,
altruistic motives.

00:17:47.825 --> 00:17:49.283 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And these
are all natural.

00:17:49.283 --> 00:17:50.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Absolutely.

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.690 align:middle line:84%
We all start out on a
level playing field.

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:58.820 align:middle line:84%
But there's a point where we
can dig so deep that we open up

00:17:58.820 --> 00:17:59.630 align:middle line:90%
that pit.

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And there is a
Balrog And so I think

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:07.490 align:middle line:84%
that everyone, even Christians
who are pursuing knowledge

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:10.220 align:middle line:90%
in seminary, can go too far.

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:11.870 align:middle line:84%
I've seen plenty
of people come out

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:15.980 align:middle line:84%
of seminary who dug so
deep into this knowledge

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:17.840 align:middle line:90%
that they went too far.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And everything, their whole
worldview flipped on its head.

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And so when I say, exposing the
dark weapon of sleep paralysis,

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.180 align:middle line:84%
there are aspects of
the heavenly realms,

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:32.690 align:middle line:84%
of the astral realm, that
we do not understand.

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And what's fascinating
to me, George,

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:39.680 align:middle line:84%
I did a deep dive researching
Ephesians 6:12, which

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:44.250 align:middle line:84%
talks about the high places,
which in worldly terms,

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:45.650 align:middle line:90%
we would call the astral realm.

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about
these high places.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And in these high places,
there dwells spiritual forces

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:55.840 align:middle line:90%
of darkness.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.480 align:middle line:84%
That's the way some of
the translations word it.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:03.460 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the Greek
word, darkness, it's "skotia."

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And what it means in the
context of that verse,

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:09.430 align:middle line:90%
if you delve into the full--

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Koine Greek is a
multifaceted language.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.760 align:middle line:84%
There's double and triple
meanings and nuances

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:17.560 align:middle line:90%
to the language.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.430 align:middle line:90%
It's a full language.

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at that word
"skotia," which means darkness,

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:27.010 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't just mean
evil or bad or sin

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:29.350 align:middle line:90%
or you did something wrong.

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:32.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind of a
darkness that is

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:38.870 align:middle line:84%
allowed to prevail when humans
are ignorant of divine things.

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is according to the
Thayer's Greek concordance.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:46.040 align:middle line:84%
Divine or human ignorance
of divine things

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:51.830 align:middle line:84%
becomes a portal to which
human beings can be deceived.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And so when we're
dealing with things

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:58.670 align:middle line:84%
that are of a higher vibration
or have higher knowledge

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:02.810 align:middle line:84%
than we do, there can be
wolves in sheep's clothing.

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:05.990 align:middle line:90%
And we can get too cocky.

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And if we're up in the astral
realm, and we're being told,

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:13.850 align:middle line:84%
you're special, you're a
chosen one, you have a gift,

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:18.400 align:middle line:84%
we need you, if we just
take that verbatim,

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:23.110 align:middle line:84%
and we just strip off all
of our protective armor,

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:25.555 align:middle line:84%
there's a point where we're
going to be vulnerable.

00:20:25.555 --> 00:20:27.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
find that separating

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:31.880 align:middle line:84%
the physical and the
spiritual is good or harmful?

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: I feel that,
ultimately, it's harmful.

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:38.860 align:middle line:84%
We live in an era now, we're
civilized, we're educated.

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And church and state
need to be separated.

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:45.140 align:middle line:84%
The supernatural and the
spiritual need to be separated.

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And this goes back,
again, to HP Lovecraft,

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:49.450 align:middle line:84%
that the sciences
have all strained

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:53.060 align:middle line:84%
in their own directions and
have hitherto harmed us little.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:56.470 align:middle line:84%
They've harmed us little because
when they become dissociated,

00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:59.690 align:middle line:84%
we don't understand that
they were once connected.

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to bring
this into scientific terms,

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:03.880 align:middle line:90%
quantum entanglement.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.210 align:middle line:84%
If everything's entangled,
and we're down here trying

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:11.890 align:middle line:84%
to untangle it, all we're going
to do is cause more confusion.

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:12.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And chaos.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:13.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: And chaos.

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.580 align:middle line:84%
In the old days,
in antiquity, there

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:18.890 align:middle line:84%
was no separation
between church and state.

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:23.340 align:middle line:84%
If you were sick, and you
were going to go to a healer,

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.100 align:middle line:90%
you went to a temple.

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:28.130 align:middle line:84%
If you wanted
religious services,

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:29.510 align:middle line:90%
you went to the temple.

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:32.240 align:middle line:90%
It was the same facility.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And we see this in
antiquity, in what would

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:38.540 align:middle line:90%
be called the pagan religions.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.420 align:middle line:84%
We even see it in the
judaistic religion,

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:44.630 align:middle line:84%
under the auspices
of the one true God.

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:48.590 align:middle line:84%
There's "New Testament" stories
where Jesus would heal a leper.

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:51.617 align:middle line:84%
And then he would
say, go to the temple

00:21:51.617 --> 00:21:53.450 align:middle line:84%
and present yourself
before the high priest.

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:54.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:56.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Well, Luke, one of
the guys in his own entourage,

00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.950 align:middle line:90%
was a physician.

00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Why not send the
guy with leprosy

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:01.460 align:middle line:84%
to the physician for
the second opinion?

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.410 align:middle line:84%
But no, he sent
him to the temple.

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And then this gets
into the asklepians

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to run ahead
if those questions are coming.

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:09.288 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are they?

00:22:09.288 --> 00:22:12.300 align:middle line:90%
What are asklepians?

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.555 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: I spent so
much time researching this.

00:22:14.555 --> 00:22:15.930 align:middle line:10%
I didn't get to
the bottom of it.

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:19.370 align:middle line:10%
I have a whole chapter
on this in my book.

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:22.010 align:middle line:84%
It is a fascinating
topic of research.

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:24.390 align:middle line:84%
Around the first
and second century,

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:27.110 align:middle line:84%
so this would have been the
time of Christ and the century

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:32.270 align:middle line:84%
following, they had asklepians,
which were the temples.

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they were called
asklepians is because the God

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:41.450 align:middle line:84%
that they deified, the God
of healing, was Asclepius.

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And we hear about Asclepius in
the original Hippocratic oath,

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:47.180 align:middle line:90%
which was originally Greek.

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:48.830 align:middle line:90%
And so it was written in Greek.

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:50.810 align:middle line:90%
And they have a new version now.

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:52.730 align:middle line:84%
They've modernized
it into English.

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:56.780 align:middle line:84%
But the original Hippocratic
oath that all of the physicians

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:59.300 align:middle line:84%
would swear upon
their graduation--

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:00.608 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And still do.

00:23:00.608 --> 00:23:01.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: And still do.

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:03.450 align:middle line:84%
But the wording is a
little bit different.

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:07.550 align:middle line:84%
The original Greek is that
they are binding an oath

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:15.230 align:middle line:84%
to Apollos, the physician, his
son, Asclepius, the surgeon.

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And then there is a mention
of Hygieia and Panacea,

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:22.760 align:middle line:84%
which are daughters
of Asclepius.

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:27.830 align:middle line:84%
So these are four gods and
goddesses in the pantheon, who

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:33.770 align:middle line:84%
are heads over healing, surgery,
well-being, health, et cetera

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Asclepius was known as the
Serpent God of healing.

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And this played
into the asklepians.

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:45.170 align:middle line:84%
One thing to note, I
think this is interesting,

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:49.190 align:middle line:84%
one of the phrases that
has become very popular

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:53.420 align:middle line:84%
in Christianity is they refer to
Christ as the great physician.

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:54.975 align:middle line:84%
This is found
nowhere in scripture.

00:23:54.975 --> 00:23:55.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:56.480 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Yeah.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:59.105 align:middle line:84%
Nowhere in the "Old Testament,"
nowhere in the "New Testament."

00:23:59.105 --> 00:24:00.620 align:middle line:84%
In the "Old
Testament," you'll get

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:02.540 align:middle line:84%
the Hebrew phrase,
"Jehovah rapha,"

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:03.950 align:middle line:90%
which is, God, our healer.

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:06.020 align:middle line:84%
That's the closest
you're going to get.

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:10.580 align:middle line:84%
The term "great
physician" is a borrowed

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.860 align:middle line:84%
term from the first
and second century,

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:15.800 align:middle line:84%
where Asclepius the
Serpent God of healing,

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.720 align:middle line:90%
was the divine physician.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was he real?

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:20.810 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: I
believe that he was.

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, in
the mythology, he

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:28.100 align:middle line:84%
is the son of Apollo,
who was a God.

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.890 align:middle line:84%
He was probably a
Watcher or a Titan,

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:33.110 align:middle line:84%
depending on if you're
coming at it from a Hebraic

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:35.030 align:middle line:90%
or a Greek pantheon.

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:38.150 align:middle line:90%
And he had a mortal mother.

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:43.530 align:middle line:84%
So in the realms of theology,
this would make him a Nephilim.

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:44.910 align:middle line:90%
This would be a demigod.

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:48.210 align:middle line:84%
This would be an offspring
of the gods and the mortals.

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe that, at one
time, he was a real demigod.

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And we've, of course, made
mythology out of a lot of that.

00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:00.140 align:middle line:84%
But even to quote
Tolkien again, Tolkien

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:03.200 align:middle line:84%
wrote what we would call
mythology or fiction.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.870 align:middle line:84%
But if you actually read his
journals and his letters,

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:09.060 align:middle line:90%
he said that he wrote history.

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And the original
term, mythology,

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:16.020 align:middle line:84%
if you go all the way back to
the etymology of that word,

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:19.830 align:middle line:84%
mythology at one
time meant history.

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And we've turned that
now into fiction.

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And so we look at the Greek
gods and the mythologies

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:30.210 align:middle line:84%
and these pantheons of gods as
if they were all just made up

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:31.410 align:middle line:90%
or oral traditions.

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:34.740 align:middle line:84%
But if you go all the way back
into Sumerian, Babylonian,

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Akkadian,
Mesopotamian, if you go

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:41.730 align:middle line:84%
into the tablets and
the ancient writings

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:45.090 align:middle line:84%
and the epics of Gilgamesh
and all of those writings,

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:46.770 align:middle line:90%
they were historians.

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:50.340 align:middle line:84%
They were not writing stories
for people's entertainment.

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were
recording what was going on.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: They were recording
what they were seeing.

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
second and third heaven?

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:59.460 align:middle line:84%
So these terms can
sometimes be controversial.

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm just using
them as synonyms.

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:05.130 align:middle line:90%
Pick whatever term you want.

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:07.440 align:middle line:84%
The differentiation
here is if you

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:11.500 align:middle line:84%
go into the Hebraic
understanding of the heavens,

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:16.130 align:middle line:84%
the word "heavens"
is a plural word.

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:17.210 align:middle line:90%
And so if you go in--

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:18.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So we're talking
about more than one.

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:20.462 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: We're
talking of more than one.

00:26:20.462 --> 00:26:24.430 align:middle line:84%
The word "heaven" as it appears
in the English translations

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:28.670 align:middle line:84%
of the Bible, it doesn't show
up in any of the original texts.

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:31.900 align:middle line:84%
The word "heaven" in the
original Hebrew texts

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:34.570 align:middle line:90%
were always a plural word.

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:36.355 align:middle line:90%
It had an I-M

00:26:36.355 --> 00:26:37.375 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --in heaven.

00:26:37.375 --> 00:26:38.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Heavens.

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:42.130 align:middle line:84%
So in English, we
add an E-S or an S.

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And it indicates
multiple or plural.

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:48.820 align:middle line:84%
In the Hebrew, if you add
an I-M, it makes it plural.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:51.790 align:middle line:90%
So a cherub would be one angel.

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:52.970 align:middle line:90%
The cherubim--

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:54.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would be many.

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Exactly.

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.270 align:middle line:84%
So the heavens in the
Hebraic, if you go back

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:02.680 align:middle line:84%
into Judaic and rabbinical
teachings and writings,

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.530 align:middle line:84%
their philosophy,
their cosmology

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:07.480 align:middle line:84%
was that there
were three heavens.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:10.300 align:middle line:84%
This differs from Dante
who had the seven levels.

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And there's different
schools of thought.

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:15.310 align:middle line:84%
But in the Hebraic
school of thought,

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:16.810 align:middle line:84%
there was the
heavens as we would

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:19.870 align:middle line:84%
describe the visible heavens,
the sky, the stars, the sun,

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:20.800 align:middle line:90%
the moon.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Then there is a layer,
a dimensional layer,

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:32.560 align:middle line:84%
between our visible sky
and the third heaven,

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:35.410 align:middle line:84%
to coin what the
apostle Paul called it,

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:38.120 align:middle line:84%
or what we would call,
the throne room of God,

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:38.920 align:middle line:90%
where we see--

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.795 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this would
be heaven number two.

00:27:40.795 --> 00:27:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: So the astral
realm or the second heaven,

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:45.910 align:middle line:84%
the astral plane,
or the high places

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:49.780 align:middle line:84%
is what scripture calls it,
this is the intermediary.

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:54.680 align:middle line:84%
It is the dimension between the
physical and the throne room.

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And these high places, this
is when we have out-of-body

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.910 align:middle line:84%
experiences, when
we astral project,

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:07.390 align:middle line:84%
when we are in ayahuasca
or in some altered state

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:11.065 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, if we are
communicating with an ascended

00:28:11.065 --> 00:28:11.865 align:middle line:90%
master--

00:28:11.865 --> 00:28:13.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're on that level.

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.035 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: We're in
that second level.

00:28:15.035 --> 00:28:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then the
third would be what?

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: The third level
would be the actual throne

00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:21.600 align:middle line:90%
room of God.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:25.140 align:middle line:84%
So when John the revelator
talks about seeing the Lamb that

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:28.050 align:middle line:84%
was slain sitting on a
throne and the cherubim

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:31.380 align:middle line:84%
and the seraphim around him with
the eyes and the wings saying,

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.810 align:middle line:84%
holy, holy, holy, that
would be the third heaven.

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, how
do these heavens

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:38.385 align:middle line:84%
tie into the so-called
threshold of covenants?

00:28:38.385 --> 00:28:39.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Yes, absolutely.

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:44.220 align:middle line:84%
So where my research diverts
from any other research

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:47.340 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see
on sleep paralysis.

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:50.970 align:middle line:84%
So if you go to the church and
say, I have sleep paralysis,

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:55.290 align:middle line:84%
you're probably going to get
the answer that it's demons.

00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:56.400 align:middle line:90%
And you did something.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or you need a doctor.

00:28:57.650 --> 00:28:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Or you need
a doctor or a therapist.

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.490 align:middle line:84%
If you go to a doctor, they're
going to say, you need meds.

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:03.802 align:middle line:90%
It might be schizophrenia.

00:29:03.802 --> 00:29:05.010 align:middle line:90%
It might be a mental illness.

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:05.820 align:middle line:90%
It might be stress.

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:08.580 align:middle line:90%
It might be narcolepsy.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying that
any of those things

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:11.530 align:middle line:90%
aren't possibilities.

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:12.660 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
many possibilities.

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:13.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We can't rule them out.

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:14.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Exactly.

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:15.510 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:18.767 align:middle line:84%
But where my research
took me, and I

00:29:18.767 --> 00:29:20.350 align:middle line:84%
don't hear other
people talking about,

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:27.050 align:middle line:84%
is, it's interesting to me that
these entities, not always,

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:30.680 align:middle line:84%
but I'd say, 7 out of 10
times, if you hear someone tell

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.560 align:middle line:84%
a sleep paralysis story, they
wake up in their bedroom,

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.870 align:middle line:84%
and they see an entity,
a shadow person,

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:38.780 align:middle line:90%
a half man at the bedroom door.

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:40.880 align:middle line:84%
Now sometimes, it's
already upon them.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or exactly
looming over them.

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Yeah,
looming over them.

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:46.040 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it's
looming on the ceiling.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.470 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, it's
a black mist or shadow

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:50.900 align:middle line:90%
in the corner of the room.

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:53.900 align:middle line:84%
But the reason why,
even in artwork,

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:58.040 align:middle line:84%
if you Google shadow man,
sleep paralysis, and then hit

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.770 align:middle line:84%
Google Images,
most of the artwork

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:04.490 align:middle line:84%
has this shadow man by the
bedroom door, coincidentally.

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:06.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Peering down at you.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Peering down
at you, looking ominous.

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:12.290 align:middle line:84%
So what's interesting to
me is that these things

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:14.730 align:middle line:90%
are standing at a threshold.

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, this immediately made
me think of vampire lore,

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:23.100 align:middle line:84%
where we're told the vampire
cannot come into a home,

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.350 align:middle line:84%
can't bite you,
can't seduce you--

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unless--

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:27.805 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Crosses
the threshold.

00:30:27.805 --> 00:30:28.605 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:30:28.605 --> 00:30:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And we've all
seen those old black and white

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:36.300 align:middle line:84%
movies, where you see the
close-up of the boot crossing

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:37.560 align:middle line:90%
over the threshold.

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's the point
where you're like, oh,

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:44.205 align:middle line:84%
no because you have now
given that entity invitation.

00:30:44.205 --> 00:30:45.435 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You've invited them.

00:30:45.435 --> 00:30:46.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: You've invited.

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:49.410 align:middle line:84%
That is the linchpin
of understanding

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:50.980 align:middle line:90%
all of this, George.

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:52.050 align:middle line:90%
And this is our power.

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:54.390 align:middle line:84%
This is our kryptonite
as human beings.

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:57.840 align:middle line:84%
This is where we hold the
power of our own protection

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:05.030 align:middle line:84%
if we know how to
not give invitation,

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:07.580 align:middle line:84%
and we know how to
unravel that invitation

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:08.670 align:middle line:90%
once it's been given.

00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Here's the bad news
about the vampire lore.

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And are
these astral vampires?

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Yes.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly--
chapter 4 in my book

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:18.437 align:middle line:84%
is called "Astral Vampires
and Threshold Covenants."

00:31:18.437 --> 00:31:19.895 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
an astral vampire?

00:31:19.895 --> 00:31:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: An
astral vampire are

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:26.990 align:middle line:84%
these entities that
need permission

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:28.550 align:middle line:90%
to cross the threshold.

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:31.490 align:middle line:84%
But once they have
crossed the threshold,

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:35.270 align:middle line:84%
you are actually in
a covenant with them

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:38.690 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of these
ancient threshold covenants

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:42.680 align:middle line:84%
were linked very closely
to betrothal covenants.

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.115 align:middle line:84%
And we even still see aspects
of that in our own culture.

00:31:45.115 --> 00:31:46.615 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you
need to invite them?

00:31:46.615 --> 00:31:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: You absolutely
have to invite them.

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And what's
interesting about that

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:54.680 align:middle line:84%
is, I used to think that this
was like, the rules for ghouls

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:56.040 align:middle line:90%
is what I used to call them.

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And the way you keep demons or
entities or vampires or shadow

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:03.000 align:middle line:84%
people away is, you
can't invite them.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.840 align:middle line:84%
But this isn't just a
rule of evil entities.

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:12.060 align:middle line:84%
It's a rule for every spirit
being in the spirit realm,

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:12.900 align:middle line:90%
good or evil.

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:14.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who in their
right mind, though, Vicki,

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:15.848 align:middle line:90%
would invite in an evil spirit?

00:32:15.848 --> 00:32:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: No one would.

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:18.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind of
person would do that?

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:19.312 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: No one would.

00:32:19.312 --> 00:32:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's why many
of these entities

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.300 align:middle line:90%
have become very clever.

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:26.580 align:middle line:84%
This is like "Little
Red Riding Hood."

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:29.620 align:middle line:84%
The wolf's dressed up
like grandma in the bed.

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:30.930 align:middle line:90%
She thinks it's grandma.

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And they're very sophisticated
in their disguises.

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they come
back as a loved one.

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:42.450 align:middle line:84%
They appear sometimes as someone
we will open the door for.

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:45.420 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't actually have
to be an entity, either.

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:48.270 align:middle line:84%
There's other methods
of invitation.

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:51.510 align:middle line:90%
Our fear can be invitation.

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:55.170 align:middle line:84%
You can't separate the
sleep paralysis experience

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:56.430 align:middle line:90%
from terror.

00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:57.702 align:middle line:90%
And the control--

00:32:57.702 --> 00:32:58.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, you can't.

00:32:58.660 --> 00:32:59.055 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: The controlling of--

00:32:59.055 --> 00:33:00.222 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're synonymous.

00:33:00.222 --> 00:33:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: They
are, absolutely.

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:08.600 align:middle line:84%
There are 365 references in
the "Old and New Testament"

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:12.170 align:middle line:84%
basically, thou shalt not fear,
don't fear, don't be afraid,

00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:13.310 align:middle line:90%
be not afraid.

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And this isn't just
some cosmic therapy,

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:19.340 align:middle line:90%
or don't worry be happy.

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:25.520 align:middle line:84%
What that is a cipher for
spiritual warfare protection.

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:29.780 align:middle line:84%
If we're not afraid,
it's a shield

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:31.340 align:middle line:90%
that they can't pass through.

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:33.170 align:middle line:90%
It blocks the entrance.

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And Robert Monroe in his
"Far Journeys" trilogy talks

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:40.402 align:middle line:90%
about loosh, this concept--

00:33:40.402 --> 00:33:42.485 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: He was the expert
in astral projections.

00:33:42.485 --> 00:33:43.550 align:middle line:90%
>>VICKI: Yes.

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:47.150 align:middle line:84%
This concept of loosh
is that our fear--

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:48.830 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't just
have to be fear.

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:52.560 align:middle line:90%
It's any strong human energy.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:55.460 align:middle line:84%
So this can be any
kind of strong emotion.

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:57.020 align:middle line:90%
It can be fear.

00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:00.570 align:middle line:84%
But it can also
be sexual energy,

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:03.960 align:middle line:84%
which is why so many sleep
paralysis experiencers talk

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.780 align:middle line:84%
about this incubus,
this succubus,

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:11.610 align:middle line:84%
a rape experience because
that is also loosh.

00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:13.690 align:middle line:90%
It's also an invitation.

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:19.320 align:middle line:84%
So if they can work us up into
a frenzy, whether it's sexual

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:23.340 align:middle line:84%
or it's terror, it is
a form of invitation

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:27.400 align:middle line:84%
because it is a drawing like a
magnet of these things to us.

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.969 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Another sidebar
with researchers,

00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:33.420 align:middle line:84%
let's say, UFO researchers,
for example, a lot of them

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:36.540 align:middle line:84%
are a little skeptical
of sleep paralysis.

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:37.484 align:middle line:90%
They don't get it.

00:34:37.484 --> 00:34:38.284 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:34:38.284 --> 00:34:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: I hope that
this is going to change.

00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:44.639 align:middle line:84%
But in the past and even
when I started my research,

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:46.560 align:middle line:90%
I would be reading--

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.810 align:middle line:84%
the sleep paralysis
researchers would

00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:54.150 align:middle line:84%
want to hitch their cart
to the UFO research horse.

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:56.670 align:middle line:84%
But the UFO experience
researchers,

00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:58.530 align:middle line:84%
they did not want
the sleep paralysis

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:03.240 align:middle line:84%
people messing with their
research, understandably so.

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And I liken this to
those commercials

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:07.972 align:middle line:84%
back in the '80s, where
you've got two people coming

00:35:07.972 --> 00:35:09.930 align:middle line:84%
around a corner, and they
bang into each other,

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:11.850 align:middle line:84%
and you got your chocolate
in my peanut butter,

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:13.642 align:middle line:84%
you got your peanut
butter in my chocolate.

00:35:13.642 --> 00:35:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't want this
mixing, this adulterating

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:19.740 align:middle line:90%
of these silly--

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:23.783 align:middle line:84%
people having nightmares with
this very serious encounter

00:35:23.783 --> 00:35:25.950 align:middle line:84%
with spiritual beings, where
they're being abducted,

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:27.430 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, et cetera.

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And I agreed with that
for a very long time.

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:34.050 align:middle line:84%
Even in my experiencing
it for 45 years,

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:40.140 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't put the similarities
together until very recently.

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:45.600 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I believe that
the sleep paralysis phenomenon

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:49.020 align:middle line:90%
is also an abduction.

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.120 align:middle line:90%
There's different beings.

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:51.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Yep.

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:52.330 align:middle line:90%
There's--

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:53.413 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:35:53.413 --> 00:35:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: --different
beings, different locations,

00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:59.160 align:middle line:90%
and different projects.

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:01.570 align:middle line:90%
But it is still an abduction.

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:05.150 align:middle line:84%
You're coming to
people at night.

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:07.510 align:middle line:90%
And the part of the experience--

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
not invited in.

00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: They're
not invited in.

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:14.980 align:middle line:84%
The part that most people
remember of the sleep paralysis

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:17.470 align:middle line:90%
phenomenon is when they wake up.

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And most people
think that that's

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.020 align:middle line:90%
the whole of a sleep paralysis.

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:22.145 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's like a dream.

00:36:22.145 --> 00:36:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Yes.

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:25.510 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the sleep
paralysis experience

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:27.370 align:middle line:84%
in your bedroom at
night when you're

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:29.710 align:middle line:84%
seeing the things on your
chest or at the door,

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:35.380 align:middle line:84%
I think that is the tail
end of a much lengthier

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:40.930 align:middle line:84%
experience that started
deep in REM phases of sleep.

00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:43.630 align:middle line:84%
There was an abduction
to the astral realm.

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:45.820 align:middle line:90%
You come to consciousness.

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And your body is
physiologically trying

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:52.390 align:middle line:84%
to send you every
communication that it

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:56.530 align:middle line:84%
can that it's in fight or
flight, high adrenaline mode.

00:36:56.530 --> 00:36:58.420 align:middle line:90%
Your heart is racing.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:00.190 align:middle line:90%
You're sweating.

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:03.070 align:middle line:84%
All the saliva in your
mouth is dried up.

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:04.750 align:middle line:90%
You're in panic mode.

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:08.100 align:middle line:84%
But you don't have a memory
of the full experience.

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe that's a
way of the body preventing

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:13.030 align:middle line:90%
further disruption.

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Absolutely.

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:17.360 align:middle line:84%
I do believe it is a
form of dissociation

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.800 align:middle line:90%
for our protection.

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:22.580 align:middle line:84%
But here's the clever
aspect of sleep paralysis.

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Most experiencers of
the UFO phenomenon

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:29.360 align:middle line:84%
don't remember exactly
what happened to them.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:33.650 align:middle line:84%
But they know something occurred
because there's missing time.

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:37.970 align:middle line:84%
When we wake up, and six,
seven, eight hours have gone by,

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:40.520 align:middle line:84%
even if we've had
a nightmare, even

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.740 align:middle line:84%
if we've had an
experience, we're savvy,

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:44.840 align:middle line:84%
and we know that was
an astral experience,

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:48.590 align:middle line:84%
we usually wake up
with no question

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:51.230 align:middle line:84%
as to all of that missing
time because we were asleep.

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How soon when
we're asleep, Vicki,

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:55.745 align:middle line:84%
does the sleep
paralysis take effect?

00:37:55.745 --> 00:37:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: It can take
effect at any point

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:02.840 align:middle line:84%
that you're falling
into or out of sleep.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And there's fancy
scientific terms for this.

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:09.050 align:middle line:84%
It's hypnopompic and
hypnogogic, depending

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:11.450 align:middle line:84%
on whether you're getting
it as you go to sleep

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:12.960 align:middle line:90%
or coming out of sleep.

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:16.190 align:middle line:84%
I always had it
coming out of sleep.

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And I found that the
few times in my life I

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:21.300 align:middle line:84%
had it while drifting
off to sleep,

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:24.380 align:middle line:84%
I was able to shake myself out
of it very quickly and easily

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:25.940 align:middle line:90%
and wake myself up.

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:27.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it genetic?

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Did your parents have the
same thing happen to them?

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:31.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: I don't
believe my parents did.

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:34.560 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe that
it can be genetic.

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:37.140 align:middle line:84%
I've had people contact me,
where they said they had it,

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:38.610 align:middle line:84%
and their grandparents
have had it,

00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:40.152 align:middle line:84%
and now their children
are having it.

00:38:40.152 --> 00:38:45.030 align:middle line:84%
But I think a more accurate
word to use, even, would be--

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:47.950 align:middle line:84%
I think it can be
related to bloodline.

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:52.660 align:middle line:84%
I think that the
individuals that are being--

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:55.340 align:middle line:84%
for I don't like this word,
but for lack of a better word,

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:59.590 align:middle line:84%
the individuals that are being
targeted or chosen for this

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:00.640 align:middle line:90%
operation--

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Chosen.

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Or if
you would do research

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:07.930 align:middle line:84%
into your family
history, I think

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:10.570 align:middle line:84%
you would find that
it's not random.

00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:13.420 align:middle line:84%
They're not randomly
picking because--

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:16.960 align:middle line:84%
and this is where I diverge
from the church's explanation

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.990 align:middle line:84%
that it has to be a
demon attack because you

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:22.930 align:middle line:84%
played with the Ouija board,
or you did some bad thing.

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a lot
of people out there

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:27.380 align:middle line:84%
who have done those things that
never have sleep paralysis.

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And so there's
something more to it.

00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, if you
go into your deep study

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:35.650 align:middle line:84%
of genealogical
record, you might

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:40.780 align:middle line:84%
find that you have some
affiliation to a bloodline

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:42.490 align:middle line:90%
of some importance.

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:44.080 align:middle line:90%
It could be a royal bloodline.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.210 align:middle line:84%
It could be a bloodline
that goes all the way back

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:49.940 align:middle line:90%
to the dragon courts of old.

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:52.640 align:middle line:84%
They're choosing
you because they're

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.800 align:middle line:90%
keeping it in the family.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Like the Royals, they
keep it in the family.

00:39:56.970 --> 00:40:01.310 align:middle line:84%
You are chosen because you
are of that special family.

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:04.813 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they
bank on reeling you in.

00:40:04.813 --> 00:40:06.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
want to be chosen?

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: I personally
don't, George,

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:15.470 align:middle line:84%
because I understand that the
realm that I am being taken

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:19.610 align:middle line:84%
into, the classroom that
I'm being taken into--

00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:20.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The scope.

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:22.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Yeah, the
scope, the teachers

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:26.750 align:middle line:84%
that there are not
necessarily on the side

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:28.380 align:middle line:90%
that I've chosen to be on.

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like you
got two football teams.

00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And you can't play
for both teams.

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at it
from a cosmic perspective,

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:40.880 align:middle line:84%
and don't look at
it just in terms

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.610 align:middle line:84%
of our physical
life here, if you

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:45.290 align:middle line:84%
look at it from a
cosmic perspective,

00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:49.520 align:middle line:84%
there is a spiritual dimension
and a spiritual reality

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:52.815 align:middle line:84%
that is going on beyond the
veil now that's complicated.

00:40:52.815 --> 00:40:53.615 align:middle line:90%
There's characters.

00:40:53.615 --> 00:40:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At what point, though,
when all this is happening,

00:40:56.360 --> 00:41:00.260 align:middle line:84%
do your dreams turn a little
sinister, a little weird?

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:01.800 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Yeah, absolutely.

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:05.990 align:middle line:84%
So if you have it enough, you
can begin to see the signs.

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And I like the way
they portrayed this

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:12.050 align:middle line:90%
in the movie "Inception."

00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:15.440 align:middle line:84%
The main character, the
Leo DiCaprio character,

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:20.240 align:middle line:84%
he lost track of when he was
in these other dream worlds

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:23.370 align:middle line:84%
and dimensions and when he
was in the terrestrial realm.

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:24.320 align:middle line:90%
So he had a totem.

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:25.940 align:middle line:84%
He had this little
top he would spin.

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:26.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And there's
ways to do this.

00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:31.040 align:middle line:84%
One thing that is
so fascinating,

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:34.610 align:middle line:84%
George, that I figured out
after decades of observation

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:39.380 align:middle line:84%
is, when I would
wake up in my room,

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:44.210 align:middle line:84%
my bedroom would
be 99% accurate,

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:47.060 align:middle line:90%
but there's always a glitch.

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:48.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's the glitch?

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: There's
something in your room,

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.640 align:middle line:90%
if you can observe it.

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is hard because when
you're in fight or flight,

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:58.775 align:middle line:84%
and you're in terror, you are
striving so hard to just wake

00:41:58.775 --> 00:42:00.650 align:middle line:84%
up that you're not
observing around the room.

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The things
that are happening.

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:02.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: But there's
always one thing

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:05.670 align:middle line:90%
in that room that's off.

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:11.720 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to notice
a door on the wrong wall,

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:13.825 align:middle line:84%
or the wall is painted
the wrong color.

00:42:13.825 --> 00:42:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you mean
a door on the wrong wall?

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: So if
your bed is set up

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:20.450 align:middle line:84%
in such a way that if you woke
up you'd see your bedroom door,

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:24.320 align:middle line:84%
maybe in this dream
sense, your room

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:28.050 align:middle line:84%
looks exactly the way it should,
but the door is on this wall.

00:42:28.050 --> 00:42:30.353 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe the curtains that
are hanging up aren't--

00:42:30.353 --> 00:42:32.145 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you created
this in your mind?

00:42:32.145 --> 00:42:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Well, what
I think it could be.

00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still in the stages
of researching this, George,

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:40.720 align:middle line:90%
and talking to other people.

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:44.280 align:middle line:84%
But what I've come
to understand is

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:48.180 align:middle line:84%
that this is some sort of
an overlay on the third eye

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:49.380 align:middle line:90%
or the mind's eye.

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:52.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a hijacking of
the visual cortex.

00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you
had your druthers,

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:57.210 align:middle line:84%
Vicki, would you want
sleep paralysis or not?

00:42:57.210 --> 00:42:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: I would not.

00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:00.600 align:middle line:84%
I would not, which is
why I've spent years

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:01.950 align:middle line:90%
researching and writing a book.

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But we don't
have a choice, do we?

00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: That's
a really good point.

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:07.140 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of the
people that contact me.

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:10.680 align:middle line:84%
They're contacting me
because they feel targeted.

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:14.765 align:middle line:84%
They feel like they're
being harassed.

00:43:14.765 --> 00:43:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
they probably are.

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:17.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: They are.

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And I do think that there are
ways to significantly reduce

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:26.590 align:middle line:90%
the occurrences.

00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And I do think that
there's ways to stop it.

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:31.150 align:middle line:84%
There are people
who have stopped it.

00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:33.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, the caveat
with that, George,

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:37.600 align:middle line:84%
is I thought mine went away
because I had a 15-year hiatus,

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:38.750 align:middle line:90%
where I never had it.

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:40.600 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, took care of it.

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:41.740 align:middle line:90%
And it came back.

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And not only did it come back,
but it came back in spades.

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes,
it just goes latent.

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:49.560 align:middle line:90%
Or sometimes, it goes away.

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.310 align:middle line:84%
But then they come in
through a back door.

00:43:51.310 --> 00:43:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And they're
communicating with us

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.930 align:middle line:84%
in a different way through our
dreams or through lucid dreams

00:43:55.930 --> 00:43:59.210 align:middle line:84%
or through other
sorts of things.

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:01.700 align:middle line:84%
I liken it unto a
security system.

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:03.890 align:middle line:84%
We can put a security
system in our home.

00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And that is going to
significantly reduce

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:08.960 align:middle line:84%
the chances of our
being hurt because we're

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:11.390 align:middle line:84%
going to be given an
advance warning to wake up

00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:15.360 align:middle line:84%
and take action before
that burglar gets

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:16.235 align:middle line:90%
all the way upstairs.

00:44:16.235 --> 00:44:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But our
security system, Vicki,

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:19.937 align:middle line:90%
is only good until you arm it.

00:44:19.937 --> 00:44:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: It's only
good until you arm it.

00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
mean, no one's going

00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:25.685 align:middle line:90%
to try to break in, right?

00:44:25.685 --> 00:44:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if they
do, what happens?

00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:31.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: But if they
do, you are now prepared.

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:34.460 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things that I
tell people who have not had

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:36.330 align:middle line:10%
a lot of luck
combating this-- again,

00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:39.170 align:middle line:10%
we're going back to the fear
the invitation, the loosh--

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:46.010 align:middle line:10%
is, if you start to think in
terms of offensive measures

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:48.650 align:middle line:10%
rather than defensive measures
when these things come

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:52.210 align:middle line:10%
into your room,
when you're in fear,

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:57.370 align:middle line:10%
and you are only acting
defensively-- get away from me,

00:44:57.370 --> 00:44:59.110 align:middle line:10%
get away from me,
get away from me--

00:44:59.110 --> 00:45:02.590 align:middle line:10%
they still have the upper
hand because you're in terror.

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:04.990 align:middle line:84%
You have to start
working offensively.

00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Vicki, how do
people get a hold of you?

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:08.815 align:middle line:10%
>>ANDERSON: So you
can get a hold of me

00:45:08.815 --> 00:45:11.440 align:middle line:10%
at vickijoyanderson.com.

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:14.230 align:middle line:10%
You can get me on
Instagram, @vickijoyauthor.

00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And you can get my book,
"They Only Come Out at Night,

00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Exposing the Dark Weapon
of Sleep Paralysis,"

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.783 align:middle line:90%
exclusively on lamarzulli.net.

>>NOORY: Vicki, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:24.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Thanks, George.

00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:25.827 align:middle line:90%
It's great being here.

00:45:25.827 --> 00:45:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sleep paralysis
is no laughing matter.

00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:30.400 align:middle line:84%
If it happens to
you, you will know

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:33.430 align:middle line:84%
exactly what we've been talking
about on "Beyond Belief."

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And you don't want
that to happen.

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:36.640 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for watching.
