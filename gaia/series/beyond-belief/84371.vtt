>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.702 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:09.702 --> 00:00:12.032 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:12.032 --> 00:00:13.944 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.944 --> 00:00:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.235 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.235 --> 00:00:19.250 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:27.367 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:27.950 align:middle line:10%
>>There he is.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.300 align:middle line:10%
There's a foot coming
down the steps.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.130 align:middle line:90%
>>OK, Neil.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.506 align:middle line:84%
We can see you coming
down the ladder now.

00:00:34.506 --> 00:00:35.005 align:middle line:90%
>>OK, Neil.

00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:36.950 align:middle line:90%
We can see you coming.

>>Armstrong is on the moon.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.190 align:middle line:10%
Neil Armstrong,
38-year-old American,

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:49.470 align:middle line:10%
standing on the surface of the
moon on this July 20, 1969.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.610 align:middle line:10%
>>That's one small step for man.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.560 align:middle line:10%


00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.384 align:middle line:10%
One giant leap for mankind.

00:00:58.384 --> 00:01:00.050 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: That
was an amazing time

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.850 align:middle line:10%
with America's space program.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.300 align:middle line:10%
Welcome back to "Beyond Belief"
with our special guest, Dr.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.340 align:middle line:90%
Steven Kates.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.330 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Sky we call him.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.700 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing more exciting.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.491 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVE KATES: Yes.

00:01:10.491 --> 00:01:13.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Than me as a
19-year-old kid watching

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.837 align:middle line:84%
the landing on the moon with our
dear friend, Walter Cronkite--

00:01:16.837 --> 00:01:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Absolutely.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: -making
that announcement.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: George, the
most amazing part

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.980 align:middle line:84%
of American history,
I remember it myself.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.313 align:middle line:10%
I'm old enough to remember
that with our black and white

00:01:24.313 --> 00:01:26.160 align:middle line:10%
television in my home
in New York City.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.157 align:middle line:10%
It was just so amazing.

00:01:27.157 --> 00:01:28.990 align:middle line:10%
We got permission to
stay up late that night

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.330 align:middle line:10%
from our parents,
but wow, what a show.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.750 align:middle line:10%
When we see this man crawling
on the deck, or the ladder

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.800 align:middle line:10%
and coming down the
ladder and stepping

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.310 align:middle line:10%
onto a surface of an object
that nobody could ever imagine.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.290 align:middle line:90%
What was under there?

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was-- you could crack
and fall through the surface.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.990 align:middle line:90%
Just an amazing time.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would it keep going?

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.460 align:middle line:90%
Would it keep going?

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.170 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Exactly.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.910 align:middle line:90%
All the way to the center.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:47.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They didn't know.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.380 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Exactly.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We had
some landings prior.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:50.521 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Yes.

00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:51.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But you never knew.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to land in the
spot that is 20 feet of dust,

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.000 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.132 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Sure.

00:01:57.132 --> 00:01:58.080 align:middle line:90%
Just an amazing story.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And I got this from
some of the people

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.720 align:middle line:84%
that I've talked
to and from reading

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.370 align:middle line:84%
that the actual descent
to the surface of the moon

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.097 align:middle line:84%
was not as simple as
many people imagine.

00:02:06.097 --> 00:02:08.180 align:middle line:84%
Neil Armstrong's heart
beat and his blood pressure

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.410 align:middle line:90%
was off the charts.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.785 align:middle line:84%
And he knew that he had only
a small amount of fuel left.

00:02:11.785 --> 00:02:13.201 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No margin
of error there.

00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:14.010 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Exactly.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He had to get
it down in tranquility.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:16.560 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: He had to do it.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.370 align:middle line:90%
And he did it.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.744 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he
got it down well.

00:02:18.744 --> 00:02:21.120 align:middle line:84%
Buzz Aldrin I've gotten to
know after all these years.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.828 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Oh, yes.

00:02:21.828 --> 00:02:22.411 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful man.

00:02:22.411 --> 00:02:25.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was telling us
how they got off the moon.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.469 align:middle line:84%
He had to use a Bic pen to jam
it down into a little button--

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:30.760 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Now that's incredible.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: -in order
to launch the lamp.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.890 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: I never heard that.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.480 align:middle line:10%
That is amazing revelation.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.400 align:middle line:10%
And it's sad to say if
they didn't get that rocket

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.190 align:middle line:10%
to ascend, they knew--

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.000 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's it.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.125 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: -the public didn't
really understand that.

00:02:42.125 --> 00:02:44.080 align:middle line:84%
They would have been
memorialized on the moon

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.760 align:middle line:90%
forever.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You needed
that to trigger it.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.660 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Absolutely.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a great story.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: It is a
beautiful story.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.466 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are
people, Steven,

00:02:50.466 --> 00:02:53.830 align:middle line:84%
that believe that there
are UFOs on craters

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.550 align:middle line:90%
looking at us and stuff.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.915 align:middle line:84%
That keeps the mystery and
the wonder of the moon going.

00:02:57.915 --> 00:02:59.165 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: It sure does, George.

00:02:59.165 --> 00:03:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And just recently I
just read something

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.990 align:middle line:84%
that Buzz Aldrin now comes
out and states on the journey

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.150 align:middle line:84%
to the moon, he witnessed
an unidentified flying

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.112 align:middle line:84%
object outside of the craft
of the Lunar Module itself.

00:03:11.112 --> 00:03:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And of course, with
Command Module,

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.280 align:middle line:84%
which is just totally amazing
because other astronauts,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.712 align:middle line:84%
as you know, have come up
with some interesting stories.

00:03:17.712 --> 00:03:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All kinds of things.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.750 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Amazing stories.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.940 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Aldrin
doesn't know whether he

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.720 align:middle line:10%
saw a piece of the capsule
floating along or what.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.303 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Sure.

00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:24.330 align:middle line:90%
But something was there.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But
something was there.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: Something
definitely was there.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.912 align:middle line:90%
An amazing story.

00:03:26.912 --> 00:03:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I
remember John Glenn.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.391 align:middle line:84%
He saw those twinkly
lights all around him.

00:03:30.391 --> 00:03:30.932 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Yes.

00:03:30.932 --> 00:03:33.445 align:middle line:84%
Like little fireflies floating
around his spacecraft.

00:03:33.445 --> 00:03:33.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What were they?

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.810 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: To this day, I don't
think anybody really knows,

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.510 align:middle line:10%
but they were talking about
the possibility of material

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.082 align:middle line:10%
breaking off when the
heat shield was too--

00:03:41.082 --> 00:03:43.290 align:middle line:10%
the first shield before the
heat shield would detach.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.017 align:middle line:90%
But George, it's amazing.

00:03:45.017 --> 00:03:46.850 align:middle line:84%
One of the astronauts
that I've come to know

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.660 align:middle line:84%
and I respect so highly and I'm
sure you've spoken with him,

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.122 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Edgar Mitchell of Apollo 14.

00:03:51.122 --> 00:03:52.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Know him well.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.430 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Amazing man.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.680 align:middle line:10%
As we all have heard
about the revelation

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.760 align:middle line:10%
that he had on
going to the moon.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.310 align:middle line:84%
His only mission in space,
but imagine that one.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.570 align:middle line:90%
What a lucky one that is.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Your only mission, you get to
be the sixth man on the moon.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.010 align:middle line:84%
But even more important,
something happened

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.460 align:middle line:84%
as an out-of-body-type
of experience for him.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.670 align:middle line:90%
And I'm amazed at that.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, when he was on
Apollo 14 and he was on his way

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.459 align:middle line:84%
to the moon, he conducted
mind experiments with somebody

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:20.709 align:middle line:90%
back on good old planet Earth.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:21.958 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: I think I heard this.

00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he had an
incredible experiment.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.471 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Totally amazing.

00:04:25.471 --> 00:04:26.096 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:04:26.096 --> 00:04:26.420 align:middle line:90%
Truly bizarre.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.461 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Totally amazing.

00:04:27.461 --> 00:04:30.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I remember he
was having lunch one

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.570 align:middle line:84%
day with the very great
Uri Geller, the mentalist.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And Edgar had lost
a NASA tie clasp.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.830 align:middle line:84%
It was one of his
favorite little pieces.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.235 align:middle line:90%
Lost it years ago.

00:04:42.235 --> 00:04:42.860 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: I see.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But he's having
lunch with Uri Geller.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And he's telling
Geller the story.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.446 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying, I
lost my tie clasp.

00:04:49.446 --> 00:04:50.570 align:middle line:90%
I wish I knew where it was.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.910 align:middle line:90%
It was one of my favorites.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.210 align:middle line:84%
Geller, who was eating a
little bowl of ice cream, all

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.130 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden goes,
[COUGH], and pulls out

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.830 align:middle line:90%
of his mouth the tie clasp.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Oh my goodness.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: -that Mitchell
had lost years ago.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.856 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: Oh, that's
just amazing.

00:05:09.856 --> 00:05:11.396 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now how
strange does it get?

00:05:11.396 --> 00:05:12.570 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Extremely strange.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:13.020 align:middle line:90%
That is just--

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they both
verified that story.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: One of the
beyond belief stories.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sure is.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.263 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Absolutely.

00:05:17.263 --> 00:05:19.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So after
the moon program,

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.409 align:middle line:84%
what happened to
our space program?

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:22.783 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: Well,
George, there were

00:05:22.783 --> 00:05:24.682 align:middle line:84%
other Apollos that
were supposed to go.

00:05:24.682 --> 00:05:26.140 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
don't realize this.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.450 align:middle line:90%
There was an Apollo 18.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:28.075 align:middle line:90%
There was a 19.

00:05:28.075 --> 00:05:29.533 align:middle line:84%
And there,
theoretically, was a 20.

00:05:29.533 --> 00:05:31.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Some think they did go.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.840 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Exactly right there.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.310 align:middle line:84%
But the simple truth
is budgetary things.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.929 align:middle line:84%
We kind of lost,
I think, the fizz.

00:05:36.929 --> 00:05:38.470 align:middle line:84%
It's like you take
your soda, pour it

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.570 align:middle line:84%
in the cup or the glass, and
after awhile the fizz came out

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.216 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:05:43.216 --> 00:05:44.340 align:middle line:90%
It's like, we've done this.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.370 align:middle line:90%
We've been there.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think the American
spirit behind it kind of just

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.670 align:middle line:90%
died out.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many more
rocks can we bring back?

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.110 align:middle line:90%
That kind of thing.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.310 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Exactly.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And the cost of
those spacecraft,

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.790 align:middle line:84%
the people should know, in terms
of today dollars, literally,

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.910 align:middle line:84%
is billions of
dollars of hardware.

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.740 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting,
George, that

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.770 align:middle line:84%
for many reasons,
which we both I'm sure

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.570 align:middle line:84%
would agree that we should have
continued to go to the moon--

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We could have
built a space station.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:06.491 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Most definitely.

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:07.394 align:middle line:90%
We need an outpost.

00:06:07.394 --> 00:06:08.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A base.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.435 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: And we're hearing
now that the People's Republic

00:06:10.435 --> 00:06:13.550 align:middle line:10%
of China as we've talked about
on the radio or other guests

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.170 align:middle line:10%
have told you, they look
like they're probably

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.290 align:middle line:10%
going to be the main force
at least going to the moon.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And maybe not necessarily
for just scientific reasons.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.970 align:middle line:90%
For military reasons, too.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it an act of
war if China lands where

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.480 align:middle line:84%
we've landed in
the various spots

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.270 align:middle line:84%
and pulls out the
American flag that

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.460 align:middle line:84%
are in several areas
around the moon and just

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.231 align:middle line:84%
drops them on the
face of the moon.

00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:39.772 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Wow.

00:06:39.772 --> 00:06:41.210 align:middle line:90%
That would be pretty degrading.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is degrading.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: You're asking
if it's an act of war.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.023 align:middle line:84%
I would think it
would be, but I think

00:06:45.023 --> 00:06:49.770 align:middle line:84%
we'd have to consult a new area
of legalese, which is the space

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.510 align:middle line:84%
attorneys that are involved in
international law like this.

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.680 align:middle line:84%
But on a simple way of
referring to it, sure.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's just an out
right act of aggression.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And I would hope that it
doesn't come down to that.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I hope they would
have more class that that.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:02.780 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Yes, I would hope so.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.000 align:middle line:90%
But we'll have to see.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.070 align:middle line:84%
But the Russians,
obviously, have an interest

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:08.260 align:middle line:90%
in going to the moon again.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.650 align:middle line:84%
But the Chinese, the
People's Republic of China,

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.780 align:middle line:84%
seems like they're going
to be the group that's

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:13.880 align:middle line:90%
going to do it.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.320 align:middle line:84%
Their Long March rockets
are their power plant,

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.050 align:middle line:84%
like we had with the
Saturn V. And they

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.890 align:middle line:84%
work very well because now
in orbit the Chinese have

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:27.820 align:middle line:84%
evolution two of a spacecraft
called the Tiangong 1, which

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.860 align:middle line:84%
is something of a
small-scale space station.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.490 align:middle line:84%
It'll probably evolve to
something much larger,

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.330 align:middle line:84%
but the point is they
have the heavy lift

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.272 align:middle line:90%
capability to really do that.

00:07:36.272 --> 00:07:37.980 align:middle line:84%
So I think we're
looking at it happening.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:38.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:39.040 align:middle line:90%
And we don't right now.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.720 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: You're
exactly right, George.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.136 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that,
when we discuss the whole space

00:07:43.136 --> 00:07:45.470 align:middle line:84%
program, obviously,
I'm a big fan of NASA,

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:47.210 align:middle line:84%
but I have to be
honest with everybody--

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:50.230 align:middle line:84%
you and the audience-- I
think, in my humble opinion,

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:51.700 align:middle line:90%
I think we're on the wrong path.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.350 align:middle line:84%
If I were to choose, if I
was the director of NASA,

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.890 align:middle line:84%
I certainly wouldn't
choose mining an asteroid

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.130 align:middle line:90%
as my number one priority.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:00.282 align:middle line:90%
I would make it the moon.

00:08:00.282 --> 00:08:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
all into robotics.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:02.110 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Absolutely.

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:03.140 align:middle line:90%
That's a wonderful thing.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:03.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They've
forgotten about man.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.640 align:middle line:84%
Jerry Pournelle,
the science writer,

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.310 align:middle line:84%
who was a co-writer with
Larry Niven when they wrote

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:11.520 align:middle line:84%
"Lucifer's Hammer"
told me the most

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.650 align:middle line:84%
incredible story about
our moon mission.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And he said prior to going to
the moon, we were looking for

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:25.960 align:middle line:84%
and found volunteers of
guys who would go one way.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.220 align:middle line:84%
Much like we're talking
about Mars right now.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.053 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: Now that's
something I never heard.

00:08:30.053 --> 00:08:32.549 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This was something
that, to beat the Russians--

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:35.280 align:middle line:84%
and that was the only
intent-- they were going

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.559 align:middle line:84%
to launch a man to the
moon, land him there,

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:41.424 align:middle line:84%
but they had no way
of getting him back.

00:08:41.424 --> 00:08:42.169 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Wow.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they were going
to periodically drop supplies

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.057 align:middle line:90%
down to him until he died.

00:08:47.057 --> 00:08:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Geez.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they had
the guy picked out.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.300 align:middle line:90%
They were ready to go.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.861 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately, we
didn't need that.

00:08:52.861 --> 00:08:53.860 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: That's amazing.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.500 align:middle line:90%
I never heard that.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.700 align:middle line:84%
That is totally
incredible because now we

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.450 align:middle line:84%
hear that how many
people have signed up

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:01.060 align:middle line:90%
for the one-way mission to Mars.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:01.977 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would you go?

00:09:01.977 --> 00:09:02.476 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: No.

00:09:02.476 --> 00:09:03.280 align:middle line:90%
I would say, no.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same with me.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: I'm being practical.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:05.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love this planet.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.813 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: I'm being honest
and I'm being practical.

00:09:07.813 --> 00:09:09.220 align:middle line:90%
Like you say, we love the Earth.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.390 align:middle line:84%
I think it's great,
but I'm not looking

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:13.800 align:middle line:84%
for that kind of heroic
thing and certainly,

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.700 align:middle line:90%
not a selfish thing.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wouldn't even
go on a three-year mission.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.180 align:middle line:90%
Would you?

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.820 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: Well, if I knew that
there would be a way to come

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.654 align:middle line:84%
back and at least my
odds were better than--

00:09:20.654 --> 00:09:23.153 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, but look what
would change after three years.

00:09:23.153 --> 00:09:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: It could be a
dynamic change, George.

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:28.420 align:middle line:84%
People maybe need to really
hear this straight up, too.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.916 align:middle line:84%
A mission to Mars as they're
saying now, a nine-year-old,

00:09:31.916 --> 00:09:33.790 align:middle line:84%
a seven or eight-year-old
that's on the Earth

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:36.200 align:middle line:84%
today, young children,
they're probably,

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.020 align:middle line:84%
of course, that mission
to the planet Mars.

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:41.480 align:middle line:90%
We know this, but nine months.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.500 align:middle line:84%
I like you and you like me
and we like a lot of things,

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.000 align:middle line:84%
but how do we fit
into that environment

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.346 align:middle line:90%
where we're now together--

00:09:48.346 --> 00:09:49.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Every
moment of the day.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.980 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Exactly.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.682 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In a very
small capsule.

00:09:52.682 --> 00:09:53.390 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Exactly.

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:54.180 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.230 align:middle line:84%
So I would probably
consider it, George,

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:58.200 align:middle line:84%
but my answer finally
would be if there

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.380 align:middle line:84%
was at least a fairly
good possibility that I

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.070 align:middle line:90%
could return.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a movie idea
once that we launched astronauts

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:05.990 align:middle line:90%
to Mars.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Yes.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And now
they're coming back.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.260 align:middle line:10%
And as they're
coming back, they're

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:15.180 align:middle line:10%
looking at the planet,
how gorgeous it is,

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.667 align:middle line:10%
and it gets hit by an asteroid.

00:10:17.667 --> 00:10:18.500 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: Oh my gosh.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.810 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And it
wipes out everything.

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:21.660 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: And they're
the only ones left.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.850 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And they're
the only ones left.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:23.370 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: How amazing.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:24.180 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Where do they go?

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:24.520 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: Right.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.436 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they land?

00:10:25.436 --> 00:10:27.269 align:middle line:84%
Do they try to find
another place to go?

00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: What a
scenario to think of.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:29.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing story.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:30.370 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: It is an amazing story.

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:32.079 align:middle line:84%
The last of mankind,
which is incredible.

00:10:32.079 --> 00:10:32.661 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:10:32.661 --> 00:10:33.470 align:middle line:90%
Out there in space.

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:35.470 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: But George, the
vastness of space as we

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:37.422 align:middle line:84%
talk about the space
program itself,

00:10:37.422 --> 00:10:38.630 align:middle line:90%
I would look at other things.

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And just to complete my answer,
I would go back to the moon,

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.220 align:middle line:90%
naturally, as you said.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:43.719 align:middle line:84%
And I agree with
you wholeheartedly.

00:10:43.719 --> 00:10:45.760 align:middle line:84%
A lunar base, I think,
would be a great thing.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And here's another
trivia question

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.926 align:middle line:84%
that I came to learn
about the hard way.

00:10:48.926 --> 00:10:51.020 align:middle line:84%
People said, hey, Dr. Sky,
in some of my classes.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:54.354 align:middle line:84%
What's the coldest spot in
the entire solar system?

00:10:54.354 --> 00:10:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
well, of course,

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:57.350 align:middle line:90%
way out by Pluto and such.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:00.530 align:middle line:84%
But we find it's interesting
the Lunar Reconnaissance

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:03.250 align:middle line:84%
Orbiter that's been in
orbit around the moon taking

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:05.485 align:middle line:84%
these great images by the
way-- you've seen them--

00:11:05.485 --> 00:11:09.060 align:middle line:84%
of the landing locations
on the surface of the moon.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.340 align:middle line:84%
But the answer to that
is the southern pole

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:16.650 align:middle line:84%
of the moon in the Shackleton
Crater is totally in dark.

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you then were to
go down and land there

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:22.740 align:middle line:84%
on the tops of those mountains
they are always in sunlight.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.410 align:middle line:10%
Temperature there,
no kidding, they

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:29.610 align:middle line:10%
allege to be 395 degrees
below zero on the Fahrenheit

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:31.640 align:middle line:10%
scale, which I still
scratch my head

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.229 align:middle line:10%
and say, how can something
that close be that cold?

00:11:34.229 --> 00:11:35.020 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That cold.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.510 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: So one of
the great mysteries.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And are we blocking the
sun from hitting part of that?

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:39.580 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Yes we are.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:40.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes we are.

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:41.470 align:middle line:90%
So it's an amazing story.

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.970 align:middle line:84%
But going back to the moon, I
wholeheartedly agree with you.

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.541 align:middle line:84%
I think that should be
America's and a lot of the other

00:11:46.541 --> 00:11:47.040 align:middle line:90%
nation's.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.937 align:middle line:84%
Let's all try to work together
and get a mission together

00:11:49.937 --> 00:11:51.020 align:middle line:90%
to do something like that.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:51.980 align:middle line:90%
I think it would take that.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think
everything's going private.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: Yes, you're
probably right there.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.812 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everything.

00:11:55.812 --> 00:11:57.520 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: More of the
privatized-- I mean,

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.390 align:middle line:10%
if we look at the privatization
of space, Elon Musk,

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:01.720 align:middle line:10%
obviously, with SpaceX.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.270 align:middle line:10%
We have to salute him.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:03.997 align:middle line:10%
A true genius.

00:12:03.997 --> 00:12:06.080 align:middle line:10%
I'd love to be able to
have one of his Tesla cars.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.070 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Burt Rutan, who you
mentioned in our previous show.

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Most definitely.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.612 align:middle line:90%
These are great names.

00:12:10.612 --> 00:12:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Branson.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.420 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Richard Branson.

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:15.152 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at going back,
let's say, to the moon--

00:12:15.152 --> 00:12:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bigelow.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:16.290 align:middle line:90%
You've got to throw him in.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:16.998 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Bigelow.

00:12:16.998 --> 00:12:17.840 align:middle line:90%
Las Vegas.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.130 align:middle line:90%
With his hotel.

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:20.680 align:middle line:90%
The inflatable hotels.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.620 align:middle line:84%
But I'm so fascinated,
George, that

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.660 align:middle line:84%
just to think that what
we can do in SpaceX,

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.230 align:middle line:90%
I think you're 100% right.

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:28.850 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at
privatization, which

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:31.037 align:middle line:84%
is going to eclipse a
lot of what NASA's doing.

00:12:31.037 --> 00:12:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's going to
be out there in the next

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.744 align:middle line:84%
what, 5 to 10 years,
some real amazing things.

00:12:35.744 --> 00:12:38.160 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Could you imagine
being in one of Bigelow's space

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.580 align:middle line:10%
hotels calling for room service?

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.242 align:middle line:10%
What's taking them so long?

00:12:44.242 --> 00:12:44.950 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: Exactly.

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.070 align:middle line:10%
What the heck is
going on here, guys?

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:49.400 align:middle line:84%
But just a very
optimistic-- I'm very

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.580 align:middle line:84%
optimistic about
the future of space.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's got such a
wonderful history, George.

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And in my programs that
I do as an educator

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:59.570 align:middle line:84%
I try my best to go through
Mercury, Gemini, Apollo,

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.930 align:middle line:84%
and let's not forget the long
and important space program

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:05.120 align:middle line:84%
project, the space
shuttle itself

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:09.270 align:middle line:84%
that sadly was
put to retirement.

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:11.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's do a
quiz with each other.

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Yes, sir.

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:13.154 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's both
work on the answer.

00:13:13.154 --> 00:13:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: OK.

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:18.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who are the original
seven Mercury astronauts?

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:18.710 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: OK.

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:19.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You pick one.

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:19.720 align:middle line:10%
I'll pick one.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.261 align:middle line:10%
And let's see if we
can get them all.

00:13:21.261 --> 00:13:21.980 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: OK.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.560 align:middle line:10%
Schirra.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.510 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: John Glenn.

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:27.410 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: Grissom.

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:28.930 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Alan Shepard.

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:30.322 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: Gordon.

00:13:30.322 --> 00:13:31.280 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Gordon Cooper?

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:31.740 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: Mhm.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:31.980 align:middle line:10%
Is that five?

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:32.880 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: Gordon
Cooper, excuse me.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:33.540 align:middle line:10%
I think, yes.

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:34.460 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Scott Carpenter.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:34.940 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: Yes.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:35.530 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Six.

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:36.347 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: OK.

00:13:36.347 --> 00:13:37.430 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We need one more.

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.940 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: Wally Schirra.

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:38.580 align:middle line:10%
Did I say Wally?

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:39.070 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You did.

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:39.400 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: I did.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.520 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I think it was Grissom.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.228 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: Grissom.

00:13:41.228 --> 00:13:41.730 align:middle line:10%
Gus Grissom.

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:42.030 align:middle line:10%
Right.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was.

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:43.060 align:middle line:90%
That's seven.

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:43.400 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Amazing.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:43.975 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:13:43.975 --> 00:13:44.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:44.540 align:middle line:90%
We did it.

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Not a lot of people--
it's Carpenter

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:47.245 align:middle line:90%
who screws everybody up.

00:13:47.245 --> 00:13:47.870 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Right.

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And sadly, he passed, I
think, about a year ago.

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.890 align:middle line:10%
Just another
wonderful astronaut.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:55.800 align:middle line:10%
His big love, of
course, was the ocean.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.670 align:middle line:10%
He wanted to study the ocean.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.970 align:middle line:84%
But George, it's so amazing
that if things didn't happen

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.730 align:middle line:84%
the way they did as we talked
about in our previous show

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:07.310 align:middle line:84%
with the Apollo 1 fire, there's
a large speculation out there

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:10.470 align:middle line:84%
that states that Gus Grissom
probably would have been one

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:12.410 align:middle line:84%
of the first, if not
the first, astronaut

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:13.280 align:middle line:84%
to land on the
surface of the moon.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:13.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On the moon.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:13.981 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:14:13.981 --> 00:14:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And poor Gus had
to fight that story

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:17.770 align:middle line:90%
of losing the Mercury Capsule.

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:18.353 align:middle line:90%
Remember that?

00:14:18.353 --> 00:14:19.210 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Absolutely.

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:20.355 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which they
have since recovered.

00:14:20.355 --> 00:14:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: They have pulled it
out of the bottom of the ocean.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They pulled
that out, but then he

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:24.090 align:middle line:90%
died in that horrible fire.

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:25.466 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: That's
a horrible thing.

00:14:25.466 --> 00:14:26.798 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people don't know this.

00:14:26.798 --> 00:14:28.390 align:middle line:84%
If you go to the
Kennedy Space Center,

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:29.824 align:middle line:90%
you see the normal tour.

00:14:29.824 --> 00:14:31.240 align:middle line:84%
But if you call
them-- and this is

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.810 align:middle line:84%
open to anyone who
will contact NASA--

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:36.670 align:middle line:84%
you ask for what I
call the other tour.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And this other tour,
George, is given-- certainly

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:42.930 align:middle line:84%
when the weather cooperates--
they take you to the Apollo 1

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:47.410 align:middle line:84%
memorial location where that big
large concrete blast center was

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:49.240 align:middle line:90%
where they tested the Apollo 1.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.560 align:middle line:10%
There's a small plaque.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.980 align:middle line:10%
You would never know
that that's the location

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:55.460 align:middle line:10%
that that horrific fire
happened such a long time ago.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.550 align:middle line:84%
But you see a plaque
memorializing the astronauts.

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Around you are
pelicans and sea birds

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.310 align:middle line:84%
all standing there as
if time is immortal.

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:05.860 align:middle line:10%
And then you can also
see the launch location

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.370 align:middle line:10%
for John Glenn's mission.

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:08.680 align:middle line:10%
And you see that whole complex.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.565 align:middle line:84%
You go underneath into the blast
where the big blast doors are

00:15:11.565 --> 00:15:13.410 align:middle line:84%
and into their little
mission control.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And sad to say, it's not
in good repair right now--

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:19.312 align:middle line:84%
and it's no fault of NASA's--
the Gemini launch pads,

00:15:19.312 --> 00:15:21.603 align:middle line:84%
which have literally just
sat there with the salt air--

00:15:21.603 --> 00:15:21.743 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my God.

00:15:21.743 --> 00:15:22.870 align:middle line:90%
Look how old they must be.

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: -rotting with some
of the doors just blowing

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:25.329 align:middle line:90%
in the wind.

00:15:25.329 --> 00:15:28.950 align:middle line:84%
But this is the true legacy
of the American Space Program.

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:31.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When we were kids, we
all wanted to be astronauts.

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:32.809 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Oh, you bet.

00:15:32.809 --> 00:15:34.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's not
the same anymore.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:35.600 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: You're exactly right.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.405 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've not heard one kid
say, I want to be an astronaut.

00:15:38.405 --> 00:15:39.530 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: It's true, George.

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:40.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's all
we said in those days.

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:41.740 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: That's exactly right.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:42.698 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:15:42.698 --> 00:15:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: Well, I don't know, but
I think guys like both of us,

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.859 align:middle line:84%
I remember my favorite
television show

00:15:47.859 --> 00:15:49.650 align:middle line:84%
and it's kind of cool,
was "Lost in Space."

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
be Will Robinson.

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:52.240 align:middle line:90%
Didn't you?

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:52.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Loved it.

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:53.573 align:middle line:90%
Let me tell you something.

00:15:53.573 --> 00:15:55.670 align:middle line:90%
A great story there.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:59.060 align:middle line:84%
I not only loved that
show so much that once

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.990 align:middle line:84%
I started doing "Coast to
Coast," told my producer,

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:04.734 align:middle line:90%
Tommy, I said, find Billy Mumy.

00:16:04.734 --> 00:16:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: There you go.

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I loved
"The Twilight Zone."

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:07.680 align:middle line:90%
He was in that.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:07.950 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Wonderful.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:10.309 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was Will
Robinson in "Lost in Space."

00:16:10.309 --> 00:16:11.600 align:middle line:90%
He's now a dear friend of ours.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Oh, that's wonderful.

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's been on the
show countless of times.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: He's a great person.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's got a
little band in Los Angeles

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:17.756 align:middle line:84%
plus all the other
things he does.

00:16:17.756 --> 00:16:18.437 align:middle line:90%
He still acts.

00:16:18.437 --> 00:16:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: That's amazing, George.

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:21.145 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you
talk about going

00:16:21.145 --> 00:16:22.821 align:middle line:84%
to find the things
you like to do

00:16:22.821 --> 00:16:24.070 align:middle line:90%
in life, that was one of them.

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:24.778 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Oh, yes.

00:16:24.778 --> 00:16:25.860 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Watching shows like that, seeing
those early pioneers to space

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:32.780 align:middle line:84%
and June Lockhart being
in "Lost in Space"

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.700 align:middle line:84%
and all these great
actors that were in there.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:37.300 align:middle line:84%
Who wouldn't want
to go to space?

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:38.375 align:middle line:90%
I even had the outfit.

00:16:38.375 --> 00:16:39.750 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it sounds
a little comical.

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:41.420 align:middle line:10%
I had the boots and
the little silver suit.

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:43.240 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Didn't you walk in
with that outfit tonight?

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.906 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: I changed
in the dressing room.

00:16:44.906 --> 00:16:46.925 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How about
remember "Fireball XL5?"

00:16:46.925 --> 00:16:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Yes.

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.388 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a very interesting
of the great classics.

00:16:49.388 --> 00:16:50.277 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Classic.

00:16:50.277 --> 00:16:51.860 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: But if you
look back, George,

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.506 align:middle line:84%
"Space 1999" and all
these other great shows

00:16:54.506 --> 00:16:56.380 align:middle line:84%
from "The Outer Limits,"
"The Twilight Zone,"

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:58.120 align:middle line:90%
doing so many wonderful shows.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:58.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "Science
Fiction Theatre."

00:16:58.860 --> 00:16:59.485 align:middle line:90%
One of the first.

00:16:59.485 --> 00:16:59.770 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Most definitely.

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:00.353 align:middle line:90%
Just the best.

00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'm hooked on all
these great whether they're

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:06.890 align:middle line:84%
A or B movies of the 1950s, like
the "Monolith Monsters," all

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:08.890 align:middle line:84%
these movies that were
pretty much watched shot.

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:09.819 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: "The Time Machine."

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:10.730 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: "The Time Machine."

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:11.500 align:middle line:90%
Most definitely.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:12.708 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All of those things.

00:17:12.708 --> 00:17:15.447 align:middle line:84%
I think they all helped fuel
us for the space program.

00:17:15.447 --> 00:17:16.030 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Sure.

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:17.160 align:middle line:90%
There was a big fever.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.040 align:middle line:90%
People had passion.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.560 align:middle line:84%
But like you were saying
before, where did it go?

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.995 align:middle line:84%
I think now today most
people think, well--

00:17:22.995 --> 00:17:26.550 align:middle line:84%
and I don't say it's fair to
say it 100%-- but a lot of kids,

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:29.020 align:middle line:84%
I think, are now into other
things other than going

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.024 align:middle line:90%
to the moon, let's say.

00:17:30.024 --> 00:17:31.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I remember a movie.

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:32.030 align:middle line:90%
Black and white.

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:34.630 align:middle line:84%
It was called "The
First Man in Space."

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And he was in a
fighter jet-type plane.

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:40.369 align:middle line:90%
And he went too far.

00:17:40.369 --> 00:17:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: Oh, we went
out of the atmosphere.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So he went
out of the atmosphere

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:46.420 align:middle line:90%
and he floated in space.

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.980 align:middle line:90%
He came back deformed.

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:51.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, horrendous.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:52.970 align:middle line:90%
And that was the whole thing.

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:54.175 align:middle line:90%
He changed his personality.

00:17:54.175 --> 00:17:57.160 align:middle line:90%
He became evil and everything.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.880 align:middle line:10%
Can't a plane, if
it flew high enough,

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.520 align:middle line:10%
go right through into space?

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:02.830 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: I don't think so.

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:06.024 align:middle line:84%
Talking to F15 pilots that
have a time to climb record--

00:18:06.024 --> 00:18:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You'd stall, right?

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.820 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: You'd stall.

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.403 align:middle line:84%
I know one of these
pilots personally.

00:18:09.403 --> 00:18:12.900 align:middle line:84%
They flew in North Dakota at
one of the Air Force bases

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:13.400 align:middle line:90%
up there.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.040 align:middle line:90%
Grand Forks.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.570 align:middle line:84%
They took an F15, stripped
it down to bare metal.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:18.284 align:middle line:90%
It was called a Streak Eagle.

00:18:18.284 --> 00:18:19.700 align:middle line:84%
The pilot got in
and he kicked it.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.129 align:middle line:90%
After burn straight up.

00:18:21.129 --> 00:18:22.670 align:middle line:84%
A Viking departure
as they called it.

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:24.460 align:middle line:84%
He got up to about
90-- and hopefully, I'm

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:26.550 align:middle line:90%
correct-- 90-ish thousand feet.

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:27.930 align:middle line:90%
So you're right.

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:31.000 align:middle line:84%
What happens is those
turbines don't have enough air

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.217 align:middle line:90%
and you come back to Earth.

00:18:32.217 --> 00:18:33.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He'd do a Chuck Yeager.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:35.174 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: But here's
an interesting one.

00:18:35.174 --> 00:18:36.380 align:middle line:90%
He could do a Chuck Yeager.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:39.190 align:middle line:84%
But if you looked at it this
way that with Richard Branson's

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:41.350 align:middle line:84%
SpaceShipOne,
that's another point

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.310 align:middle line:84%
that maybe you're on
to something there.

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:46.152 align:middle line:10%
If you just kept firing the
rocket and didn't do the arc--

00:18:46.152 --> 00:18:46.860 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.890 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: -you'd become
permanently in space.

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:50.120 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And then you've got
to figure out how to get back.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Right.

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:52.580 align:middle line:84%
But to some, they might--
I'll bet you there's

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:54.150 align:middle line:84%
some on there that would
go on a one-way mission.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
you change right now

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.254 align:middle line:90%
about our space program?

00:18:57.254 --> 00:18:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: George, I would look at
this whole thing from a dollars

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:00.795 align:middle line:90%
and cents standpoint.

00:19:00.795 --> 00:19:02.212 align:middle line:84%
The simple thing
I would do is-- I

00:19:02.212 --> 00:19:04.545 align:middle line:84%
know this is going to sound
a little radical to people--

00:19:04.545 --> 00:19:07.160 align:middle line:84%
I would reactivate our space
shuttle program even albeit

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:07.702 align:middle line:90%
the hard way.

00:19:07.702 --> 00:19:08.868 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe a better one?

00:19:08.868 --> 00:19:09.870 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: A better one.

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And we do have something
that's flying around the Earth

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.985 align:middle line:84%
and people can see it in the
nighttime sky called the X-37B,

00:19:15.985 --> 00:19:16.735 align:middle line:90%
which is a small--

00:19:16.735 --> 00:19:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's like a
drone up there, right?

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:18.570 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: It's like a drone.

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:20.780 align:middle line:84%
It's about half to a third
the size of the space shuttle.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:22.060 align:middle line:90%
Looks like a space shuttle.

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:22.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
it doing up there?

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:23.346 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Surveillance.

00:19:23.346 --> 00:19:26.610 align:middle line:84%
Many people say in the
secret area of the world

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:28.902 align:middle line:84%
here with Dr. Sky
many people say--

00:19:28.902 --> 00:19:30.610 align:middle line:84%
and I've talked to
some of those people--

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:32.020 align:middle line:84%
but what they
think it's doing is

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:35.190 align:middle line:84%
that spacecraft is doing
reconnaissance on the Earth

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:middle line:84%
with an advanced
form of-- get a load

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.270 align:middle line:84%
of this-- synthetic aperture
radar, which means that when

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:43.760 align:middle line:84%
it goes over a location, that
radar-- which is nothing new.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.700 align:middle line:10%
They've had it-- it
penetrates deep into the Earth

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.400 align:middle line:10%
so vis-a-vis if the Iranians
are doing something where we

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.530 align:middle line:10%
don't want them or they
shouldn't be building nukes

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:53.230 align:middle line:10%
and hiding them--

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:53.830 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We can see that.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:55.788 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: Hopefully, we
have an advanced warning

00:19:55.788 --> 00:19:57.320 align:middle line:10%
by detecting it
through the Earth.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.360 align:middle line:84%
But back to your
original question.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:02.789 align:middle line:84%
I would go back and activate
another type of ease to space,

00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:04.830 align:middle line:84%
but I would do it in the
premise that we wouldn't

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:06.650 align:middle line:90%
use the heavy rockets anymore.

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:09.090 align:middle line:84%
We would use something like
Richard Branson's technology

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:11.190 align:middle line:84%
where we take a
mother ship and then

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:15.490 align:middle line:84%
we deploy the craft off of the
top of that to get to orbit.

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:17.350 align:middle line:90%
And it's nothing new.

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:19.640 align:middle line:84%
There was a project, George,
that I'm so amazed about,

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.500 align:middle line:84%
and maybe the viewers are
or are not familiar with.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.420 align:middle line:84%
In the 1960s, we had a project
called Dyna-Soar, the X-20.

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.670 align:middle line:84%
D-Y-N-A S-O-A-R.
This was interesting.

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:32.130 align:middle line:84%
It was launched on the
top of a Titan rocket

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:35.290 align:middle line:84%
or a Titan 3C, which was
the big powerful rocket.

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And it had the capability
to go into orbit

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.182 align:middle line:90%
as a regular aircraft.

00:20:39.182 --> 00:20:40.140 align:middle line:90%
It's cool looking, too.

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:41.790 align:middle line:90%
It looks like a little shuttle.

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:43.300 align:middle line:90%
You could do your work in space.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.510 align:middle line:90%
It was a military project.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:44.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:45.271 align:middle line:90%
They all are.

00:20:45.271 --> 00:20:47.330 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: And then you
could land at an airport.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.288 align:middle line:90%
Could you imagine that?

00:20:48.288 --> 00:20:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about the Black
Ops Program for the military?

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:54.070 align:middle line:84%
I tend to think something
else is going on.

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:57.020 align:middle line:84%
That they may have
a space program.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.310 align:middle line:90%
Richard Hoagland believes it.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:59.410 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: I believe he's right.

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So many
other people too.

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.434 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we've just
forgotten about SpaceX.

00:21:02.434 --> 00:21:03.600 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Not at all, George.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.850 align:middle line:90%
I think we're on to something.

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:08.070 align:middle line:84%
Many of the guests that I've
had on programs that I still do

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:11.540 align:middle line:84%
are part of the SR-71
program that we no longer fly

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:12.550 align:middle line:90%
that aircraft.

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:13.540 align:middle line:90%
And here's a story.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.550 align:middle line:90%
And I've heard it in the past.

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:19.360 align:middle line:84%
Not only on Coast, but I've
heard it from other radio shows

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.560 align:middle line:84%
that there was a story
at Groom Lake, Area 51,

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:24.710 align:middle line:84%
that there was a
large mother ship

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:28.580 align:middle line:84%
craft that looked,
resembled, like a huge SR-71.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that was this
unbelievable craft called

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:35.970 align:middle line:84%
the Delta Dart, this very
arrowhead-shaped craft--

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:38.659 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which
people may be seeing.

00:21:38.659 --> 00:21:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: You're probably right.

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:44.110 align:middle line:84%
That was then launched off
the top of this mother ship.

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And the stories in
1990, "Aviation Week"

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.960 align:middle line:84%
and "Space Technology"
had reports of people--

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:52.430 align:middle line:84%
and you probably remember this--
hearing the sky ripping apart

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:54.310 align:middle line:90%
over Southern California.

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:55.687 align:middle line:90%
The FAA denied any aircraft.

00:21:55.687 --> 00:21:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Deny, deny, deny.

00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: The same thing.

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:02.060 align:middle line:84%
But what it might be is
simply a way to get to space.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:03.626 align:middle line:10%
And I think you're
probably right on,

00:22:03.626 --> 00:22:05.000 align:middle line:10%
George, in the
cross hairs there.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.242 align:middle line:10%
We probably just don't give
up an SR-71 and go backwards.

00:22:08.242 --> 00:22:08.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:09.710 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: So you're
onto something there.

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:11.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at a few more graphics

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:12.586 align:middle line:90%
that you've supplied to us.

00:22:12.586 --> 00:22:13.626 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Most definitely.

00:22:13.626 --> 00:22:15.220 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: This first
one, of course,

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.191 align:middle line:10%
looks almost like
the solar system.

00:22:17.191 --> 00:22:17.690 align:middle line:90%
Is it?

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:18.310 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: It sure does.

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.810 align:middle line:90%
No, George.

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:19.710 align:middle line:90%
This is interesting.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:23.000 align:middle line:84%
This is in dedication to my
professor in college, Dr. Clyde

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.315 align:middle line:84%
Tombaugh, who discovered
Pluto in Arizona.

00:22:25.315 --> 00:22:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, did he?

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: He discovered Pluto.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And he did it on
February the 18th--

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A planetoid now.

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: A dwarf planet now.

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:34.470 align:middle line:84%
But the reason I wanted to
show this to your viewers

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:38.050 align:middle line:84%
is this particular object
shows the dwarf planet.

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Five satellites
orbit around Pluto.

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is so amazing, George,
because if it's a dwarf,

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:46.557 align:middle line:84%
how can it have
all this symmetry?

00:22:46.557 --> 00:22:47.890 align:middle line:90%
It's a little world unto itself.

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a little planet.

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: And I'm excited
as you know, next year

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:55.570 align:middle line:84%
the great spacecraft will
get to the planet Pluto

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:58.140 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll see what
this planet is like.

00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:58.911 align:middle line:90%
The dwarf planet.

00:22:58.911 --> 00:22:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Next one.

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:00.780 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at this.

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:01.940 align:middle line:90%
That looks like Sputnik to me.

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:02.898 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: It is, George.

00:23:02.898 --> 00:23:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
started to talk about.

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:08.280 align:middle line:84%
The 184-pound little sphere that
was placed up by the Russians.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.760 align:middle line:10%
Boy, did it psychologically
change our thoughts about--

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:11.820 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh, my God.

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:12.630 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: That little thing.

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:13.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did it do?

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.840 align:middle line:90%
It just sent back the signal?

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: It sent back
radio signals, right.

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:16.050 align:middle line:90%
Little beeps.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:16.970 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It didn't
do anything really?

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:18.742 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: It was just
there for image.

00:23:18.742 --> 00:23:19.700 align:middle line:10%
That's what we can say.

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:20.030 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We could do it.

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:20.822 align:middle line:10%
We put it in space.

00:23:20.822 --> 00:23:22.613 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: We put it in
space and you didn't.

00:23:22.613 --> 00:23:24.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has Sputnik
crashed and come down now?

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.060 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Yes, it has.

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:27.110 align:middle line:90%
And that's interesting.

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:29.020 align:middle line:84%
A part of space
trivia-- and I'm trying

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:31.540 align:middle line:84%
to remember the name of it--
there's one little spacecraft

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.950 align:middle line:84%
that I think it's called
a Vanguard if I'm correct.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was
our first, wasn't it?

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:35.650 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Yes.

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And there's one of those
little Vanguards that's

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.277 align:middle line:84%
still going around the Earth
still today, but it's so tiny.

00:23:40.277 --> 00:23:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it still
broadcasting something?

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:42.880 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: I don't think so.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.310 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just
there as a dummy.

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:44.851 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:23:44.851 --> 00:23:48.270 align:middle line:10%
I remember some of the
other missions of satellites

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:51.130 align:middle line:10%
that they would send
out deep into space

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:54.400 align:middle line:10%
had little cassettes,
audiotapes,

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.950 align:middle line:10%
for the programming.

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:57.692 align:middle line:90%
So they had magnetic tape.

00:23:57.692 --> 00:23:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: So this was
like old technology.

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.524 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just unbelievable.

00:24:00.524 --> 00:24:01.774 align:middle line:90%
And they're still functioning.

00:24:01.774 --> 00:24:03.982 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: Well, some of these
spacecrafts are amazing.

00:24:03.982 --> 00:24:06.070 align:middle line:84%
But for the viewers,
one of the most amazing

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:07.440 align:middle line:90%
is still the Voyagers.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.590 align:middle line:84%
It takes over 18 hours,
George, to get a signal.

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:12.040 align:middle line:84%
If you wanted to
say, turn left--

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:12.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's so far out.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:13.516 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: That's crazy.

00:24:13.516 --> 00:24:17.390 align:middle line:10%
It's almost at the end of the
solar-- beyond the solar wind,

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:19.050 align:middle line:10%
but imagine sending
a signal to tell

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:22.530 align:middle line:10%
you do something, turn left
at the next intersection,

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:23.700 align:middle line:10%
takes 18 hours.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.685 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You have to predict
the 18 hours of the turn left.

00:24:26.685 --> 00:24:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: You sure do.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.560 align:middle line:90%
That's a long story.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.226 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this,
of course, is the sun

00:24:30.226 --> 00:24:31.449 align:middle line:90%
acting very, very angry.

00:24:31.449 --> 00:24:31.990 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Yes.

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
interesting image.

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:35.740 align:middle line:84%
I have a solar
telescope that shows

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.401 align:middle line:90%
the sun in the same light.

00:24:37.401 --> 00:24:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And people, I just
want to make sure

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:40.066 align:middle line:90%
that they hear this, George.

00:24:40.066 --> 00:24:41.610 align:middle line:84%
I know this sounds
very, very basic,

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:43.290 align:middle line:90%
but people need to hear this.

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, never stare
directly at the sun.

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:48.440 align:middle line:84%
We do demonstrations
with children in schools

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.970 align:middle line:84%
where we take a telescope,
put an eye piece in it,

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:53.580 align:middle line:84%
take a sheet of paper like
you have here on the table,

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:57.950 align:middle line:84%
and put it right on the focal
point, like a magnifying glass.

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Within two seconds,
it's on fire.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:00.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It burns.

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: So don't let
that happen to your eye.

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I used to do that
with a magnifying glass.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: And that is
equally dangerous.

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:05.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was unbelievable.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.224 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: But the
point is the sun right

00:25:07.224 --> 00:25:09.810 align:middle line:84%
now, George, is going
through this amazing period

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:10.882 align:middle line:90%
of activity.

00:25:10.882 --> 00:25:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, we're not
going to get the kill shot

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:16.110 align:middle line:84%
that we hear about from many
of your guests that talk about.

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:18.830 align:middle line:84%
That would be
utterly devastating.

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This looks
like an Aurora Borealis.

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:21.673 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: George,
this is probably

00:25:21.673 --> 00:25:23.259 align:middle line:84%
one of the most
spectacular pictures.

00:25:23.259 --> 00:25:24.300 align:middle line:90%
It's one of my favorites.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.330 align:middle line:90%
It's a comet.

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:26.160 align:middle line:90%
What are comets?

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.590 align:middle line:84%
They're dirty snowballs that
Fred Whipple, the astronomer

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:31.020 align:middle line:84%
from Harvard, coined
a long time ago.

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.550 align:middle line:84%
They're objects that have
5 or 10 miles in diameter,

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:34.730 align:middle line:90%
like an asteroid.

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:36.625 align:middle line:84%
They're coated with
material that's icy.

00:25:36.625 --> 00:25:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Here's what the effect
is if they get--

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And some
brought water here.

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:40.557 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Well, there you go.

00:25:40.557 --> 00:25:41.765 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe not all of it.

00:25:41.765 --> 00:25:43.620 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: That's a very
interesting theory

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.850 align:middle line:10%
that the Earth may
have been seeded

00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:48.707 align:middle line:10%
with the life
materials of comets.

00:25:48.707 --> 00:25:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a lot of comets.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: That's a lot of comets.

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:53.180 align:middle line:84%
But this comet that
we're looking at

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:56.870 align:middle line:84%
was Comet McNaught in the
Southern Hemisphere in 2007.

00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:59.040 align:middle line:84%
I only wish, George,
that you, myself,

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.930 align:middle line:84%
and everybody else
who's watching

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:04.380 align:middle line:84%
had the opportunity to see this
during the morning or evening.

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:10.050 align:middle line:84%
That expanse in the sky covers
about 100 or more degrees

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:10.730 align:middle line:90%
of your sky.

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:10.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: God, that's exciting.

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:14.050 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: So if you were looking
east-- oh, where the nucleus is

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:17.260 align:middle line:84%
all the way to that tree
or that line on the picture

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:20.720 align:middle line:84%
would be maybe going from that
point of the comet's nucleus

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.950 align:middle line:84%
to the right, you're
looking easily

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:24.549 align:middle line:90%
at 100 degrees in the sky.

00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:25.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:25.810 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: That's rare.

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A couple more
graphics to look at here.

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:29.240 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to our next one.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:29.990 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: This is--

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pretty shot.

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:32.099 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: It's a beautiful one.

00:26:32.099 --> 00:26:33.580 align:middle line:84%
In the artist's
rendition, it shows

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:36.440 align:middle line:84%
us what theoretically could
be the surface of the planet

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.230 align:middle line:84%
or the dwarf planet,
excuse me, Pluto.

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:39.901 align:middle line:84%
I have a hard time
with that because I

00:26:39.901 --> 00:26:42.150 align:middle line:84%
know Dr. Tombaugh would be
turning in his grave going,

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:43.400 align:middle line:90%
why'd you take my planet away?

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now is that Pluto
that we're looking up close?

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:46.550 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Pluto in the tan.

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:47.220 align:middle line:90%
Right up in the foreground.

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what's behind them?

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:48.471 align:middle line:90%
What's that--

00:26:48.471 --> 00:26:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: This is the
satellite Charon or Sharon,

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:51.890 align:middle line:90%
as people describe it.

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:53.800 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very
important satellite

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:57.060 align:middle line:84%
because it also tends
to dynamically make

00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:00.140 align:middle line:84%
those other little satellites
go in resonance so they all

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.645 align:middle line:84%
stay in harmony because
of that satellite

00:27:02.645 --> 00:27:03.770 align:middle line:90%
that you're seeing in the--

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:04.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what's
in the foreground?

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:05.410 align:middle line:90%
Is that the sun?

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:06.910 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: And that
is-- well, that is

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:09.390 align:middle line:10%
way in the back is the sun
from the distance of the dwarf

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:10.980 align:middle line:10%
planet, Pluto, which
is just amazing.

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:12.500 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It would be interesting
to see the sun from that.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.160 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: Wouldn't
that be something?

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I guess you would
get no heat from that distance,

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:16.060 align:middle line:90%
would you?

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:17.580 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Not much at all.

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:18.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's look at--

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: Ice volcanoes
on the surface of Pluto

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:22.580 align:middle line:90%
as many people speculate.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we've got
one more graphic for you.

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:26.580 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: George,
this is something

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:28.640 align:middle line:84%
that I never forget
for as long as I live.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:33.960 align:middle line:84%
Back in 1996 and 1997, we had
some amazing comets come by.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.730 align:middle line:84%
This is a picture
of Comet Hyakutake.

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:37.749 align:middle line:90%
Hard enough to spell.

00:27:37.749 --> 00:27:38.790 align:middle line:90%
Hard enough to pronounce.

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:39.570 align:middle line:90%
In our skies-

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:41.402 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: -Who would doubt you?

00:27:41.402 --> 00:27:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: What they're
going to hear right

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:45.310 align:middle line:84%
now is-- this blew
my mind totally

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:47.930 align:middle line:84%
of anything I've ever
seen in the night sky.

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:51.300 align:middle line:84%
This passage of the comet, it
came around the end of March.

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:52.699 align:middle line:90%
I think it was '97 or '96.

00:27:52.699 --> 00:27:53.490 align:middle line:90%
I'll have to check.

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:55.130 align:middle line:90%
I think it was '96.

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:56.730 align:middle line:84%
We went out in the
desert of Arizona

00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:59.450 align:middle line:84%
when it was 9 million
miles away, George.

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:02.840 align:middle line:84%
The nucleus was on
one side of the sky.

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:07.250 align:middle line:84%
The tail stretched over
175 degrees across the sky,

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:08.966 align:middle line:90%
like a contrail of a jet.

00:28:08.966 --> 00:28:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And all you had
to do-- I brought

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:12.720 align:middle line:84%
a lawn chair and a
few other things.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.900 align:middle line:84%
I was out there with
binoculars and I just

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:16.890 align:middle line:90%
watched that the entire night.

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gorgeous.

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: That was the most
amazing thing I've ever seen.

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:21.853 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you imagine
being on the planet

00:28:21.853 --> 00:28:26.030 align:middle line:84%
at the time we were
hit by another planet?

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:27.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: That would be--

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:28.595 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it
would, obviously,

00:28:28.595 --> 00:28:31.459 align:middle line:84%
it hit so you would see
it coming down, right?

00:28:31.459 --> 00:28:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Getting bigger and
bigger and bigger.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: It'd be just
filling up your sky

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:36.500 align:middle line:84%
and the gravity between
the two would, I'm sure,

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:37.410 align:middle line:90%
disrupt everything.

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:38.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the sound
would have been just--

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:39.940 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Screeching.

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:40.620 align:middle line:90%
Horrible.

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:42.642 align:middle line:84%
Frictional dynamics
would just destroy us.

00:28:42.642 --> 00:28:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would
there be explosions?

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:45.155 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Oh, many.

00:28:45.155 --> 00:28:46.030 align:middle line:90%
It would be horrible.

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:48.110 align:middle line:84%
It would be gravitationally,
the two objects,

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:50.480 align:middle line:84%
because if you have to really
look at it from physics.

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.810 align:middle line:84%
If you get the two objects
within close proximity

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:56.190 align:middle line:84%
to each other, the lesser of the
strength is going to shatter.

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:58.420 align:middle line:84%
So thus, the theoretical
thing with the satellite

00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:00.230 align:middle line:90%
that came too close to Saturn.

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:02.070 align:middle line:90%
We see the residual ring.

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:04.770 align:middle line:84%
So there's a thing in
astronomy called Roche's Limit

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:08.040 align:middle line:84%
that if it gets within a certain
distance of the primary object,

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.990 align:middle line:84%
that satellite or
object would shatter.

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:13.080 align:middle line:84%
But what if it was
denser than the Earth?

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.110 align:middle line:90%
We would be the loser.

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:15.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point.

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:17.937 align:middle line:84%
Are they teaching
astronomy in school?

00:29:17.937 --> 00:29:18.770 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Yes and no.

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:22.690 align:middle line:84%
The yes of it is we get a
basic diet of Astronomy 101

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:23.680 align:middle line:90%
in the early grades.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.890 align:middle line:84%
In the basic, early
years of life,

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:30.700 align:middle line:84%
say grades first grade all the
way up to about seven or eight.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.340 align:middle line:84%
But I think after
that, George, there

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:34.680 align:middle line:84%
becomes this
confusion out there.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.400 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't really
carry the ball on this.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And I would hope
that they would.

00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:41.860 align:middle line:84%
We see a lot of people
now wanting to go in--

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:45.070 align:middle line:84%
and this is great-- they want
to study astrobiology, which

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:46.820 align:middle line:90%
is a wonderful degree program.

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:49.950 align:middle line:84%
You don't see this-- you didn't
see this 20, 30 years ago,

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:51.430 align:middle line:90%
astrobiology.

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:53.310 align:middle line:84%
But the astronomy
subject, I think,

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:56.070 align:middle line:84%
is just not taught
as it should today.

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:57.300 align:middle line:90%
Because here's the problem.

00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.851 align:middle line:84%
Most people live in these
light-polluted areas.

00:29:59.851 --> 00:30:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you have them do labs
where you want people to go out

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:06.170 align:middle line:84%
at night to see the sky,
many people, sad to say,

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:08.320 align:middle line:84%
they can't find the
objects other than the moon

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.055 align:middle line:90%
in this time.

00:30:09.055 --> 00:30:12.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the '50s and '60s,
what percent of American homes

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:15.272 align:middle line:90%
do you think had a telescope?

00:30:15.272 --> 00:30:15.980 align:middle line:90%
Even a small one.

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: I would say, George,
probably less than today.

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:19.900 align:middle line:10%
And the answer that I
would you give you--

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:20.190 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Yes.

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:21.130 align:middle line:90%
And here's why.

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Telescopes on this
side today have

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.100 align:middle line:90%
become a mass-produced item.

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.240 align:middle line:84%
So generally, as we do better,
hopefully, economically,

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:32.140 align:middle line:84%
technology usually comes down
in price over a period of time.

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:34.436 align:middle line:10%
But to answer your
question, I believe

00:30:34.436 --> 00:30:36.310 align:middle line:10%
that the small-- I would
say there's probably

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:39.550 align:middle line:10%
no more than about 15% or 20%
of the American population

00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:40.780 align:middle line:10%
had telescopes.

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:43.710 align:middle line:10%
In those days, they
were very expensive.

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:45.200 align:middle line:84%
They were usually
either imported

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.830 align:middle line:84%
from Germany, the great
opticians, or from Japan.

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And now today, China with mass
production-- not that they're

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:52.990 align:middle line:90%
bad.

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:54.849 align:middle line:90%
Get something, folks.

00:30:54.849 --> 00:30:56.390 align:middle line:84%
It's better than
not having anything.

00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:58.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And lots of great
companies selling telescopes.

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:00.045 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: There are many
wonderful telescopes.

00:31:00.045 --> 00:31:02.770 align:middle line:84%
So today, there's no excuse as
we've talked about in the past.

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:05.270 align:middle line:84%
I always recommend binoculars
as your first gateway

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:06.190 align:middle line:90%
to the heavens.

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:07.547 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful views.

00:31:07.547 --> 00:31:08.380 align:middle line:90%
Here's a little tip.

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.390 align:middle line:84%
If you're out in
the summer, look

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:14.080 align:middle line:84%
to the southern sky around
midnight on a moonless night.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And George, you will
be treated to what

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:19.130 align:middle line:84%
I consider in my opinion to
be the most spectacular view.

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:21.030 align:middle line:90%
Look into the southern sky.

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:22.990 align:middle line:90%
The star clouds of Sagittarius.

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:25.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't see how any normal,
reasonable person could

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:29.450 align:middle line:84%
be bored looking at the
star clouds that you see.

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:31.400 align:middle line:84%
That's the center
of our Milky Way.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:35.790 align:middle line:84%
27,000 light years out
into space into the nucleus

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:37.710 align:middle line:90%
is how far we are away.

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Boy, does it make me think
I'm a tiny little guy

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:41.544 align:middle line:90%
on a big pale blue dot.

00:31:41.544 --> 00:31:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do you prefer?

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:46.010 align:middle line:84%
The refractor telescope, the one
that you look down and straight

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:49.640 align:middle line:84%
out, or the reflector, the
one that you look on the side

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.910 align:middle line:90%
and it goes out that way?

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:52.200 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: George, I have both.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.880 align:middle line:84%
But if I had to
really choose one

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.650 align:middle line:84%
I would take the
reflector because they're

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:59.280 align:middle line:84%
easier to afford the
bigger the diameter mirror.

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.220 align:middle line:84%
They have ones
called Dobsonians.

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:01.930 align:middle line:90%
I own one.

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:03.767 align:middle line:84%
It is a 16-inch
diameter Dobsonian.

00:32:03.767 --> 00:32:05.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a big telescope.

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:05.850 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: It's big.

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:08.330 align:middle line:84%
But if you saw it and we were
going to take my small Honda

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:10.100 align:middle line:84%
Element and pack
it, you would say,

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:13.560 align:middle line:84%
wow, this telescope, Dr.
Sky, is like seven feet tall.

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.150 align:middle line:84%
But you take all the
trusses out and it

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:18.000 align:middle line:90%
looks like a large garbage can.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.530 align:middle line:90%
The bottom part with the mirror.

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:21.700 align:middle line:84%
But the reason I like
those, George, is

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:25.240 align:middle line:84%
that those telescopes to
me are just fantastic.

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:28.990 align:middle line:84%
They show you some
amazing detail in the sky

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:30.680 align:middle line:84%
without having to
really spend a lot.

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:31.430 align:middle line:90%
Now, what's a lot?

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:35.680 align:middle line:84%
A 16-inch telescope like that
may cost you less than $2,000.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.540 align:middle line:84%
But the other side
of the coin is

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:40.560 align:middle line:84%
refracting telescopes are
for planetary observers.

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:43.730 align:middle line:84%
If you want to look
at Saturn or Jupiter,

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:48.200 align:middle line:84%
the biggest lens that you can
get is what's best for you.

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.860 align:middle line:84%
So planetary objects I
recommend refractors.

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:52.530 align:middle line:90%
They're darn expensive.

00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:54.644 align:middle line:90%
The good ones.

00:32:54.644 --> 00:32:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Like I mentioned before,
the Dobsonian mirrors

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.200 align:middle line:90%
have come down in price.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.160 align:middle line:84%
George, it's the most
amazing thing to do.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Take people out with one of
those 8-inch or 10-inch or

00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:04.690 align:middle line:90%
12-inch Dobsonians.

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:06.860 align:middle line:84%
You won't stop, as
we do many times.

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:07.590 align:middle line:90%
We go out.

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:08.550 align:middle line:90%
We cook our meal.

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:10.870 align:middle line:10%
We barbecue out in the
middle of the desert.

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:12.870 align:middle line:10%
We take our telescopes--
and I'm not kidding you

00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:14.870 align:middle line:10%
when I say this--
it's so amazing.

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:17.670 align:middle line:10%
The adrenaline's running
through my body and everybody's.

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:20.860 align:middle line:10%
We stand all night
and we continue

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:22.390 align:middle line:10%
to stand until the sun rises.

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:23.500 align:middle line:10%
And I'm not kidding you.

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.280 align:middle line:90%
Not in a painful way.

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:27.020 align:middle line:84%
Just in the pleasure
of observing.

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:29.110 align:middle line:84%
There's so much to see
in that nighttime sky.

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
most fascinating object

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:33.060 align:middle line:90%
you have looked at?

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:34.559 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: George,
one of them happens

00:33:34.559 --> 00:33:38.230 align:middle line:84%
to be a galaxy that's about
20 million light years away.

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:41.290 align:middle line:84%
There are Messier objects that
this comet observer, Charles

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Messier, first
found around 1780.

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:46.550 align:middle line:90%
There's about 110 of these.

00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:50.390 align:middle line:84%
One of them is M81, a
galaxy, and another one, M82.

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:53.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm standing out looking
with the telescope seeing

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:55.490 align:middle line:90%
an object in that Dobsonian.

00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:57.510 align:middle line:90%
One is a galaxy that's a spiral.

00:33:57.510 --> 00:34:00.230 align:middle line:84%
You see the bluish and
somewhat spiral nature to it.

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:01.750 align:middle line:90%
Not like the Hubble.

00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Next to it is a galaxy
that looks like a cigar.

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's gorgeous.

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:06.110 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: And right
in it I'm seeing

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:07.880 align:middle line:90%
a supernova that exploded.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is 20 million
light years away.

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:11.449 align:middle line:90%
That blows my mind.

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:12.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're time traveling.

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: I'm time traveling
and we all can time travel.

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:15.949 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief," Steven.

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:16.770 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Thank you very much.

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a wonderful trip.

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:19.889 align:middle line:10%
It's almost like
getting in a spaceship

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:23.040 align:middle line:10%
and flying out into
space, talking to Dr. Sky

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.610 align:middle line:10%
here, Steven Kates.

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:26.891 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
