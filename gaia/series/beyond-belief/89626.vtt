>>SUSAN MASINO: Hi.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm Susan Masino.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.880 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever wondered
what life is all about?

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever wondered
what it means to be here?

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.200 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever felt like
you've been here before?

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.190 align:middle line:84%
My son Jamie had a past life
that's going to blow you away,

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.080 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
share it with you.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.334 align:middle line:84%
"Beyond Belief" with
George Noory starts now.

00:00:21.334 --> 00:00:23.972 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:23.972 --> 00:00:25.430 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.150 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.680 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.185 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:35.185 --> 00:00:42.412 align:middle line:90%


00:00:42.412 --> 00:00:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.360 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.190 align:middle line:10%
And indeed, we have a
fascinating program with you,

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.825 align:middle line:10%
with Susan Masino, who is a
rock historian journalist.

00:00:51.825 --> 00:00:55.100 align:middle line:84%
She has written about some
incredible rock groups

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.050 align:middle line:84%
throughout her
career, but she's also

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.130 align:middle line:84%
the author of "Secrets
of the Universe."

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Susan, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.495 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Thank you, George.

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:03.150 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.733 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Always a
pleasure to be here.

00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little bit about
your life as a rock journalist.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.050 align:middle line:84%
Because that kind of
ties into your work as

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.620 align:middle line:84%
a paranormal writer now with
"Secrets of the Universe."

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: It does, yeah.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.080 align:middle line:10%
I've been a writer
for over 30 years.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.210 align:middle line:10%
I just finished my sixth book.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.360 align:middle line:10%
I did a biography of AC/DC
called "Let There Be Rock."

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle line:10%
I also did "Family
Tradition: Three Generations

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.950 align:middle line:10%
of Hank Williams."

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.290 align:middle line:84%
Another book that I wrote
earlier in my career

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.560 align:middle line:84%
is called "Famous
Wisconsin Musicians,"

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.740 align:middle line:84%
and Les Paul wrote
the forward for me.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Susan, explain the
jump into the paranormal.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.930 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.190 align:middle line:90%
Something happened.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Well, my grandmother,
when I was very, very young--

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.480 align:middle line:84%
and it's kind of funny in a
way, because you'd think, well,

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.550 align:middle line:84%
she's going to scare the
daylights out of you.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.920 align:middle line:84%
But we would go to bed
at night at her house,

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.790 align:middle line:84%
and we would always
say our prayers.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And then she would tell us about
how her mother showed herself

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.760 align:middle line:90%
after she died.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.760 align:middle line:84%
She came to her bedroom
to say goodbye to her.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And that just started
a whole lifetime

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.240 align:middle line:90%
of how does that happen?

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.840 align:middle line:90%
How is that possible?

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.699 align:middle line:90%
Is it a good thing?

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:11.560 align:middle line:90%
Is it a bad thing?

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And I started reading every
book I could get my hands on.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And I've followed
your show for years.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.560 align:middle line:90%
I've gone to conferences.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.190 align:middle line:90%
I've done some ghost adventures.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.965 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I met you
at a conference

00:02:22.965 --> 00:02:24.020 align:middle line:90%
just a couple years ago.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Exactly.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I'm fascinated
with all facets of it.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At the outset
of this program,

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.040 align:middle line:84%
you talked a little bit on
video of your son, Jamie,

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.980 align:middle line:90%
and his paranormal experience.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:38.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yes.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Oh my goodness.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.130 align:middle line:84%
He was four years
old at the time.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And he actually--
I kept a journal,

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.390 align:middle line:84%
because he used to tell me
things, even when he was three.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.450 align:middle line:84%
He had a memory of building
the railroad cars in Wyoming.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.870 align:middle line:90%
Like a past life?

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.665 align:middle line:90%


00:02:55.665 --> 00:02:56.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yeah.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.380 align:middle line:84%
He said his name was
James at that time, too.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.150 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have cars;
they only had horses.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.702 align:middle line:84%
He helped design the train cars,
and he talked about Wyoming.

00:03:07.702 --> 00:03:09.910 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't even pronounce
Wisconsin, where he lived.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.170 align:middle line:84%
But he knew everything
about Wyoming.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And later on, I found out that
they did build the first tracks

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.540 align:middle line:90%
and train cars in Wyoming.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.001 align:middle line:84%
How did a little kid
know that, right?

00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:20.625 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yeah.

00:03:20.625 --> 00:03:21.124 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:21.124 --> 00:03:22.070 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know that.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.990 align:middle line:90%
And so that kind of passed.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And then one night, when
he was four, we went out.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And the movie "The Titanic"
was on HBO at the time.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And the babysitter was
watching the movie.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.940 align:middle line:84%
He must have gotten
up during the night

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.380 align:middle line:84%
and watched the rest
of the movie with her.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.610 align:middle line:84%
Which the next day, I
wasn't really happy about.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not exactly
something you'd sit a--

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not
for little kids.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Yeah, a four-year-old
to sit down and watch

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.960 align:middle line:90%
this horrible tragedy.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.900 align:middle line:84%
But that very next
day, he was completely

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.320 align:middle line:84%
obsessed with the
Titanic, the ship itself.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.940 align:middle line:90%
And he loved to draw and paint.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.990 align:middle line:84%
So he started drawing
pictures and painting.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.090 align:middle line:90%
And he knew all these things.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.040 align:middle line:90%
And this lasted for two years.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.710 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And we've got some of
his pictures here, don't we?

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:05.060 align:middle line:10%
>>MASINO: Yes.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.410 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.590 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So we'll be
taking a look at some.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.964 align:middle line:10%
Little Jamie, it's
kind of funny,

00:04:07.964 --> 00:04:11.980 align:middle line:10%
because my little
six-year-old grandson, Gavin,

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.980 align:middle line:10%
he too is obsessed
with the Titanic.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And they won't let him watch
the movie at this point.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.230 align:middle line:84%
But he wants to know everything
about that ship and everything

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.750 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking
to him, and I'm

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.830 align:middle line:84%
asking him questions like
he was on that ship before.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.620 align:middle line:90%
And it's kind of uncanny, Susan.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Because he kind of knows
things about that ship

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.622 align:middle line:90%
that nobody should know.

00:04:39.622 --> 00:04:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: That's
exactly what Jamie was--

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't know
if he was a passenger

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.690 align:middle line:84%
or if he was part of
the crew, or if he even

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.010 align:middle line:90%
escaped in that other life.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.220 align:middle line:90%


00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.100 align:middle line:84%
But one day, maybe we can
get him and Jamie together.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.092 align:middle line:84%
What if they knew each
other in a past life?

00:04:55.092 --> 00:04:56.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Well exactly.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Actually, when you mentioned
that to me earlier,

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.530 align:middle line:84%
one of Jamie's friends
now-- he's 20 now.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.190 align:middle line:84%
One of his friends was
obsessed with the Titanic

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.690 align:middle line:90%
when he was a child.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.092 align:middle line:90%
So we know another kid.

00:05:07.092 --> 00:05:08.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, that could be.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.910 align:middle line:90%
Three of them.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:09.784 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yeah, yeah.

00:05:09.784 --> 00:05:15.030 align:middle line:84%
But Jamie, he started talking
about the flaws of the ship.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.660 align:middle line:84%
How it was-- they rushed
the production of it.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.865 align:middle line:84%
It was made out of
iron instead of steel.

00:05:20.865 --> 00:05:22.180 align:middle line:90%


00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.920 align:middle line:84%
When they hit the iceberg,
the emergency doors

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.490 align:middle line:84%
closed and trapped all the
men in the boiler room.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.670 align:middle line:90%
And he used to sob over that.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And I was kind of like trying
to comfort him and saying,

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.610 align:middle line:84%
well that's a horrible
thing, I know, honey.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, no,
you don't understand.

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:39.870 align:middle line:90%
It shouldn't have happened.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:40.849 align:middle line:90%
That's not fair.

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:42.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: It wasn't fair.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And, oh, he was-- It
was very-- And then he

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.210 align:middle line:84%
started having
night terrors, where

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.360 align:middle line:84%
he would go to sleep at
night, and within an hour,

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.420 align:middle line:90%
you could hear him.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.270 align:middle line:90%
And he'd fly out of bed.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.670 align:middle line:84%
He'd come running
out of his room.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.250 align:middle line:90%
Like he was trying to escape.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.970 align:middle line:84%
He would be opening
all the doors;

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.095 align:middle line:84%
he had to make sure he
didn't fall down the stairs.

00:06:02.095 --> 00:06:03.810 align:middle line:90%


00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.110 align:middle line:90%
So this went on and on.

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And he used to talk
about, like you said,

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.270 align:middle line:84%
stuff about the Titanic
that no child would know.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it wasn't like he
was watching anything or even

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.150 align:middle line:84%
looking at the ship
when he'd draw it.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And he drew, like,
a cross-section.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.880 align:middle line:90%


00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.720 align:middle line:84%
If you cut it in half and
looked at it from the side,

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.011 align:middle line:90%
he had all the--

00:06:24.011 --> 00:06:25.135 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He had everything.

00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:25.530 align:middle line:90%
The compartments.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:26.405 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Everything.

00:06:26.405 --> 00:06:28.800 align:middle line:84%
All the rooms, where
all the ladders were.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And so we finally got a CD-ROM
game that is a mystery game.

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And you go on it, and
you knock on doors.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:37.882 align:middle line:84%
And they say, well you
need to go down to--

00:06:37.882 --> 00:06:39.215 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This level or whatever.

00:06:39.215 --> 00:06:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Yeah, and
find this object,

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.900 align:middle line:84%
and take it to the
captain's quarters.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.592 align:middle line:84%
And he called everything
port and starboard.

00:06:45.592 --> 00:06:46.800 align:middle line:10%
He never said left and right.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does a
little kid know that?

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.161 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: No.

00:06:49.161 --> 00:06:52.130 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he used to
bark orders at us

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.650 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, too, and
say "straight away."

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.080 align:middle line:90%
Do it straight away.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.720 align:middle line:90%
And it was like, who is that?

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.540 align:middle line:84%
He was so funny, but he
was so-- He knew everything

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:02.180 align:middle line:90%
about the ship.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And when that game came out, he
knew his way around the ship.

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:07.099 align:middle line:90%
He didn't even have to guess.

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:08.265 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:07:08.265 --> 00:07:09.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yeah.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.030 align:middle line:90%
His sister played it with them.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And she wanted to
kind of explore.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And he says, don't go
down that stairwell,

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.240 align:middle line:84%
it'll take you to
the wrong deck.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll have to
cross over to the port side.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.450 align:middle line:90%
And you know.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And one time, well, he drew many
times, the ship with the smoke

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.055 align:middle line:84%
only coming out of three
out of four smokestacks.

00:07:27.055 --> 00:07:28.300 align:middle line:90%


00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, why
isn't there any smoke

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:31.680 align:middle line:90%
coming out of that?

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.300 align:middle line:90%
And he was so matter of fact.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.670 align:middle line:84%
He was like, it's a
dummy stack, momma.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:36.532 align:middle line:90%
It's a dummy stack.

00:07:36.532 --> 00:07:37.740 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what do you mean?

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:38.700 align:middle line:90%
What's a dummy stack?

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.019 align:middle line:90%
And he said, it was for show.

00:07:40.019 --> 00:07:42.310 align:middle line:84%
They thought it looked better,
but they didn't need it.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The symmetry;
they needed four.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:43.395 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yeah.

00:07:43.395 --> 00:07:44.180 align:middle line:90%


00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.200 align:middle line:90%
They didn't use it.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.740 align:middle line:90%
Which ended up being true.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.180 align:middle line:90%
It was a dummy stack.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.150 align:middle line:84%
But he-- he knew that
when he was like five.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:55.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So how do you
put this all together?

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.280 align:middle line:90%
What do you say?

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.709 align:middle line:90%


00:07:57.709 --> 00:07:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: We talked to
his doctor about it.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And his doctor said, don't shake
him out of the night terrors.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.700 align:middle line:84%
Just kind of comfort him until
he comes out of it on his own.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.800 align:middle line:90%
And I let him talk about it.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.120 align:middle line:90%
I let him draw.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.570 align:middle line:84%
If he wanted a book,
I would buy the book.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.520 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I let him indulge in it.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Because I figured
it's coming out now;

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:21.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't want him to suppress it
and then have problems later.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.080 align:middle line:84%
Although, it lasted
for two years.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Still fascinated
with the Titanic?

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:26.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Oh yeah.

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And what he said,
we were actually

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:31.920 align:middle line:84%
on a show that
showcases that story

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.150 align:middle line:84%
called "The Ghost
Inside My Child."

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.179 align:middle line:84%
And they interviewed him
at the end of the show.

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:38.005 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't
remember a lot of it.

00:08:38.005 --> 00:08:39.715 align:middle line:90%
He remembers all the artwork.

00:08:39.715 --> 00:08:41.340 align:middle line:84%
But they said, well,
what do you really

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:42.990 align:middle line:90%
remember about the experience?

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I remember the
Titanic being as familiar to me

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:47.593 align:middle line:90%
as my house was.

00:08:47.593 --> 00:08:48.902 align:middle line:90%


00:08:48.902 --> 00:08:49.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:50.860 align:middle line:90%
Did he seem to grow out of it?

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: He did.

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.260 align:middle line:84%
But what happened was
they brought the exhibit

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.140 align:middle line:90%
through the United States.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:57.720 align:middle line:90%
And it came to Chicago.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.440 align:middle line:90%
So we took him there.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.580 align:middle line:90%
And he was six at the time.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And he-- all the other
little kids there

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:07.092 align:middle line:84%
were running around and playing
and doing normal things.

00:09:07.092 --> 00:09:07.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not him.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.619 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: He had to
look at every-- it

00:09:09.619 --> 00:09:11.410 align:middle line:84%
took us like three
hours to get through it,

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.815 align:middle line:84%
because he had to look
at every single object.

00:09:14.815 --> 00:09:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was there
ever a point, Susan,

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.420 align:middle line:84%
where you were
concerned about him?

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:19.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Oh absolutely.

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:22.686 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering if, you know,
this is never going to go away.

00:09:22.686 --> 00:09:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Is this going to be a
lifetime thing or what?

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.270 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:28.480 align:middle line:84%
But we figured if we
took him to the exhibit

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.590 align:middle line:84%
and let him see actual
artifacts, that somehow it

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:34.812 align:middle line:84%
would bring some
epiphany, some--

00:09:34.812 --> 00:09:35.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Closure?

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yeah, exactly.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And about a month or
two after the visit,

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.900 align:middle line:84%
he had what I call
the death dream, which

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.285 align:middle line:84%
was very-- it's still
hard to describe.

00:09:47.285 --> 00:09:49.035 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you think
he died on the ship.

00:09:49.035 --> 00:09:49.743 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: He did.

00:09:49.743 --> 00:09:51.317 align:middle line:90%
He did go down on the ship.

00:09:51.317 --> 00:09:52.900 align:middle line:84%
We're pretty sure,
actually, that he--

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It sounds like he was
a crew member or something.

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: He designed the ship.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:56.283 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:09:56.283 --> 00:09:58.300 align:middle line:10%
>>MASINO: If you look
at Thomas Andrews,

00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.634 align:middle line:10%
the pictures of him and my son--

00:09:59.634 --> 00:10:00.800 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They look the same?

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: They look alike.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
convinced of that?

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:03.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yes.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.640 align:middle line:90%
It's very creepy, actually.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.020 align:middle line:90%
He looks so much like him.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So he
was the architect?

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.558 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Yeah, he
was the lead designer.

00:10:10.558 --> 00:10:11.230 align:middle line:90%


00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No wonder he
knows where everything is.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Oh yeah, no, he
knows everything about it.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.970 align:middle line:84%
But one night after we
had gone to the exhibit,

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:20.520 align:middle line:90%
I had put him to bed.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.820 align:middle line:90%
And I was watching television.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I heard this thumping

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:26.600 align:middle line:90%
on the wall of his bedroom.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.090 align:middle line:84%
Just this rhythmic
bang, bang, bang, bang.

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And I jumped up, and I ran
down, and I opened the door.

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And he's up on all
fours, and he's

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:39.790 align:middle line:84%
shaking so hard that
he's almost convulsing.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:42.900 align:middle line:84%
At first, I thought
about calling 911.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
he was in a dream.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:48.840 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't see me; he
didn't know I was there.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And he was up on all fours
in a crouched position.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And he was shaking so hard that
the bed was hitting the wall,

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.580 align:middle line:90%
and he's staring at the floor.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And before I could
even walk toward him,

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.450 align:middle line:84%
this voice-- and it
wasn't a child's voice;

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:04.539 align:middle line:90%
it was a man's voice.

00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:05.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Coming from him?

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yes.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And this man, the
terror in his voice,

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:09.990 align:middle line:90%
I can't even describe it.

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:13.049 align:middle line:90%
He screams, she's going down!

00:11:13.049 --> 00:11:13.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:14.630 align:middle line:90%


00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: And I--

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:17.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was the moment.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:18.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: That was it.

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:18.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:22.976 align:middle line:84%
I realized he's experiencing
the sinking of the ship.

00:11:22.976 --> 00:11:24.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This was as
it took him under.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.183 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yes.

00:11:25.183 --> 00:11:25.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And it took about 45 minutes
for him to come out of it.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:31.270 align:middle line:90%
I had to sit with him.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:33.470 align:middle line:84%
I sat with him and
rubbed his back.

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:35.350 align:middle line:90%
But he didn't see me.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:37.140 align:middle line:90%
He didn't know I was there.

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And then he finally laid
down and went back to sleep.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.520 align:middle line:90%
And I was completely shaken.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.845 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was horrifying.

00:11:44.845 --> 00:11:46.857 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever
regress him in hypnosis?

00:11:46.857 --> 00:11:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: We did later on.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.350 align:middle line:90%
He just recently did that.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:50.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
happened there?

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Actually
he saw the Titanic

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.420 align:middle line:90%
being built in the shipyard.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.242 align:middle line:90%
He saw that.

00:11:56.242 --> 00:11:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In regression?

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:57.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yes.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And he did go into the
sinking of the ship.

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And he had to be taken
out of it right away,

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:05.440 align:middle line:84%
because he started
getting so upset.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.694 align:middle line:84%
So he did go in to
the memory of it.

00:12:08.694 --> 00:12:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was he married
or anything like that?

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:11.193 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yes.

00:12:11.193 --> 00:12:12.740 align:middle line:90%
He left a wife and a daughter.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And they offered
him-- because of who

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.660 align:middle line:84%
he was, they offered him
a seat on a lifeboat,

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:18.910 align:middle line:90%
and he refused it.

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:22.120 align:middle line:84%
The funny part was when
we did the other TV show,

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.970 align:middle line:84%
they actually got a
blueprint from Thomas Andrews

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.000 align:middle line:90%
from eBay, a copy of it.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.980 align:middle line:84%
A big blueprint of
the ship, and it

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.450 align:middle line:84%
had all different
sections of it.

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:35.451 align:middle line:84%
And I'd never seen it before,
and he had never seen it.

00:12:35.451 --> 00:12:38.075 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted it to look like
I had gave it to him as a gift.

00:12:38.075 --> 00:12:39.450 align:middle line:90%
And It didn't make the show.

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:40.590 align:middle line:90%
They ran out of time.

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.914 align:middle line:84%
But we rolled it out
on the kitchen table.

00:12:42.914 --> 00:12:43.580 align:middle line:90%
I called him in.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And I said, hey Jamie, I have
something special for you.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.270 align:middle line:10%
And we rolled it out,
and I looked at it.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And he sat down,
and he looked at it

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:53.230 align:middle line:90%
for maybe a minute or two.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:57.230 align:middle line:10%
And the cameraman said, ask
him about the dummy stack.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:58.970 align:middle line:10%
Where's the dummy stack?

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:02.600 align:middle line:10%
And it took him about
maybe 15 seconds,

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.220 align:middle line:10%
and he pointed it
out immediately

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.780 align:middle line:10%
and said, right here.

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.520 align:middle line:84%
There's no intake
valve underneath where

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.190 align:middle line:84%
the steam would be
released underneath it.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.410 align:middle line:84%
This is the dummy
stack right here.

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And the whole room
just went silent.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was amazing.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.456 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They tried to
trick him, didn't they?

00:13:19.456 --> 00:13:19.600 align:middle line:90%


00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.641 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: In a way, yeah.

00:13:20.641 --> 00:13:22.710 align:middle line:84%
They kind of tried to
stump him a little bit.

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:24.260 align:middle line:90%
Took him less than two minutes.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:25.530 align:middle line:90%


00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So at this point, what
do you think this all means?

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.660 align:middle line:90%
That there's life after death?

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.270 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: We
absolutely come back.

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:37.520 align:middle line:10%
I figure we-- You know, I've
heard people say it before,

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.930 align:middle line:10%
that it's really hard
to learn everything

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:41.880 align:middle line:10%
that we're supposed to learn.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:46.850 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we start out
from God, or from the universe,

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:49.100 align:middle line:90%
and we're here to learn.

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't learn what
we're supposed to learn,

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:54.610 align:middle line:84%
or we don't complete what
we came here to complete,

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:56.060 align:middle line:90%
we come back.

00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And he definitely-- he worked
on the trains in the 1800s;

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.280 align:middle line:90%
he worked on the Titanic.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And he's wanted always to know,
because he wasn't born again

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:12.060 align:middle line:84%
until '94, what happened between
1912, when the ship sank,

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.070 align:middle line:90%
and 1994.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.840 align:middle line:84%
He wants to fill in
that blank somehow.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did this experience
change anything for you?

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Oh, it
made me-- I mean,

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:26.230 align:middle line:84%
I always believed
in reincarnation.

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:28.080 align:middle line:84%
I've always believed
in all of that.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:31.280 align:middle line:84%
But to see him go
through a two year period

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.710 align:middle line:90%
like that with no coaching.

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:36.917 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it wasn't like we
were giving him information.

00:14:36.917 --> 00:14:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sure, or
he was seeing things

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.795 align:middle line:90%
and remembered them and stuff.

00:14:39.795 --> 00:14:40.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yeah.

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:41.700 align:middle line:90%
He was drawing from memory.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.025 align:middle line:84%
It's really fascinating,
because you know,

00:14:44.025 --> 00:14:47.010 align:middle line:84%
you wonder too if it
all happens at once.

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:51.080 align:middle line:84%
If we are living different
lifetimes at the same time.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And our soul is
kind of fragmented

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.710 align:middle line:90%
into different facets.

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Because as Einstein
believed, the past, present

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:01.960 align:middle line:84%
and the future is all happening
at once, which is really

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.520 align:middle line:84%
a crazy thing to try to
get your mind around.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does your
son Jamie believe

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:07.880 align:middle line:90%
that he was on the Titanic?

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Oh absolutely.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:09.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At this point?

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:09.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yes.

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:10.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He does.

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: And he's
at peace with it now.

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:12.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He is.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.661 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: He said he would
go down with it again.

00:15:14.661 --> 00:15:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The fact that he
understands the life process,

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:23.000 align:middle line:84%
and reincarnation,
and life after death--

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.615 align:middle line:90%
seems like he's learned a lot.

00:15:24.615 --> 00:15:25.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Well he
used to tell me

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:28.270 align:middle line:84%
stuff like that
when he was little.

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, crazy things
that he would say.

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:32.280 align:middle line:84%
I made-- in the
book that I put out,

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.870 align:middle line:90%
I actually included the journal.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:39.750 align:middle line:84%
Because he told me things as a
really little kid, maybe three,

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.640 align:middle line:90%
that was astounding.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.060 align:middle line:84%
He would say things that
would just blow you away,

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:45.830 align:middle line:90%
and I'd write it down.

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:46.840 align:middle line:90%
I kept notes.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
you tell parents today

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:52.520 align:middle line:84%
whose son or daughter
may be having

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.840 align:middle line:84%
these kinds of experiences
about past lives?

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: I think they should
try to let them express it.

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Because I think a lot of
people would be more inclined--

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.359 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To suppress it.

00:16:03.359 --> 00:16:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Yeah, to say, oh
honey, that was probably

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:08.110 align:middle line:84%
a dream or you saw
that in a movie.

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
healthier, if it's

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:12.280 align:middle line:90%
coming out, to let it come out.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Because it's coming
out for a reason.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
better than-- to wait

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:19.280 align:middle line:84%
till they get older it
might cause more problems.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:22.060 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the kids that
I've heard that have this

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:23.415 align:middle line:90%
do have the night terrors.

00:16:23.415 --> 00:16:25.040 align:middle line:84%
They get up in the
middle of the night.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's probably
pretty normal isn't it?

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Yeah,
it's very common.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you would encourage
it, if you were going to.

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yes.

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:30.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:32.520 align:middle line:90%
Because let them express it.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:33.950 align:middle line:90%
Let them draw pictures of it.

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:36.470 align:middle line:90%
Or if they want books about it.

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:39.450 align:middle line:84%
So that you can
read to them, even.

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:42.410 align:middle line:84%
It seemed to bring
comfort to my son.

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:45.410 align:middle line:84%
The more books we
got, the more--

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:47.580 align:middle line:84%
they came out later
on with documentaries

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:49.120 align:middle line:90%
on the ship and everything.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed to kind
of make him feel better.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.970 align:middle line:90%
Like see, I told you.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:56.580 align:middle line:90%
I was right.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:57.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now your son's only 20.

00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:58.363 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yes.

00:16:58.363 --> 00:17:00.086 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's he
doing career wise?

00:17:00.086 --> 00:17:01.210 align:middle line:90%
Or what does he want to be?

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: He's
drawing and designing,

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:05.390 align:middle line:90%
and he's going into film.

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:05.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:07.598 align:middle line:84%
So he's going to do
that as a profession.

00:17:07.598 --> 00:17:08.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yes.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:11.609 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And so there's somewhat
of a tie-in with the past life.

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:12.609 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Oh absolutely.

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:13.730 align:middle line:90%
He can draw.

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:16.480 align:middle line:84%
He got into the
3D animation class

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.380 align:middle line:84%
in Madison right
out of high school.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.930 align:middle line:90%
And they asked him to draw.

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:25.030 align:middle line:84%
He had to do concept
art on the computer.

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And they gave them an assignment
to draw whatever you want,

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.370 align:middle line:90%
but it had to be very detailed.

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And he drew the engine
room of a submarine that

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:38.479 align:middle line:84%
was so detailed that they
used it at the conference.

00:17:38.479 --> 00:17:39.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is amazing.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: They actually
discouraged him,

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.380 align:middle line:84%
because he was so young when
he came into the program.

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And after they saw--
his teacher saw

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:52.860 align:middle line:84%
the picture of the submarine,
he was like, this is amazing,

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:53.485 align:middle line:90%
but it's crazy.

00:17:53.485 --> 00:17:54.700 align:middle line:90%


00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does this tell
you about life after death?

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:00.405 align:middle line:84%
What have you learned
about this experience?

00:18:00.405 --> 00:18:01.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Oh my gosh.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.640 align:middle line:90%


00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:08.110 align:middle line:84%
That we impact so many more
people than we realize.

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:10.370 align:middle line:84%
That a lot of people don't
realize that everything

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:15.070 align:middle line:84%
is so synchronistic, and you
meet people at the right time.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And that we travel-- I believe
we travel in soul groups,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.929 align:middle line:84%
where we all kind of
come back together.

00:18:20.929 --> 00:18:21.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think so, too.

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Yeah, when
you meet people.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Friends that you
have in this existence,

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:27.040 align:middle line:90%
you had in another existence.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.977 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Or even like
your son was your father.

00:18:29.977 --> 00:18:30.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: And that
sort of thing.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:33.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, definitely.

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:34.620 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.281 align:middle line:90%
It's very fascinating to me.

00:18:36.281 --> 00:18:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you come
up with your own theories

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.370 align:middle line:90%
on how it works?

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:40.820 align:middle line:90%


00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Oh my goodness.

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Well as my son said,
when he was three,

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:48.145 align:middle line:84%
he told me he chose
me and his sister.

00:18:48.145 --> 00:18:49.149 align:middle line:90%


00:18:49.149 --> 00:18:50.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He probably did.

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:51.150 align:middle line:90%


00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:52.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: This was one
of the first things

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:53.960 align:middle line:90%
that he said about this.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And we said, what do
you mean you chose us?

00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And he was so like, you
don't know anything.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.406 align:middle line:84%
He's like, there's
windows in heaven, mama.

00:19:03.406 --> 00:19:04.280 align:middle line:90%
You know that, right?

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.000 align:middle line:90%


00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.750 align:middle line:90%
So I think we get to choose.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:10.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well you
know, I've always

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:14.280 align:middle line:84%
believed that we are
given that opportunity

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.220 align:middle line:90%
to pick where do you want to go.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:20.360 align:middle line:84%
Do you want this family,
do you want this family?

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.805 align:middle line:90%
Do you want that?

00:19:22.805 --> 00:19:25.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't know why I
didn't pick the Warren Buffett

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:27.960 align:middle line:84%
family, but I'm happy
with what I did.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.240 align:middle line:90%


00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: I ask myself
the same question.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.170 align:middle line:90%
But we have free will, too.

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:35.500 align:middle line:90%
So that's another thing.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.240 align:middle line:84%
You can agree to
whatever and still

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:42.220 align:middle line:84%
come into life incarnated
again and decide

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.670 align:middle line:84%
not to do anything
that you agreed to do.

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And then I think you just
get booted back later on.

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:48.430 align:middle line:90%


00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:51.167 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No qualms about telling
people about life after death?

00:19:51.167 --> 00:19:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Lot of people are
skittish about that.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.490 align:middle line:90%


00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: I think life
would be so depressing,

00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:59.720 align:middle line:90%
to think that this is it?

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.020 align:middle line:84%
We get one run at
it and that's it?

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:05.150 align:middle line:84%
There's just too
many things to prove

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:07.350 align:middle line:84%
that there's got
to be more to it.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now some religions
believe in life after death,

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:13.313 align:middle line:84%
but they don't believe
in reincarnation.

00:20:13.313 --> 00:20:14.960 align:middle line:90%


00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.050 align:middle line:90%
You differ with that.

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:16.982 align:middle line:90%
I differ with that.

00:20:16.982 --> 00:20:18.440 align:middle line:84%
How do you convince
them otherwise?

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.520 align:middle line:90%


00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: There's
just too many things.

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:26.840 align:middle line:84%
The show that my son was on,
the pilot show had, no pun

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.080 align:middle line:84%
intended, a little
boy that remembered

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.389 align:middle line:90%
being a pilot in World War II.

00:20:30.389 --> 00:20:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I remember that story.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.805 align:middle line:84%
He was out of Chicago, I
think, the little kid was.

00:20:33.805 --> 00:20:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: And he remembered
the aircraft carrier he was on,

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:39.380 align:middle line:90%
the plane he flew.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.820 align:middle line:84%
He went down in Hiroshima
during World War II.

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.080 align:middle line:90%


00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The tires would
burst when he landed.

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.530 align:middle line:90%
And nobody knew that.

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:48.090 align:middle line:90%
He did.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:48.715 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Yeah.

00:20:48.715 --> 00:20:49.590 align:middle line:90%


00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:50.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:53.670 align:middle line:84%
How do you describe that if
he didn't actually do it?

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:54.922 align:middle line:90%
Where did it come from?

00:20:54.922 --> 00:20:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:57.440 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing how that works.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Well, and it's really
becoming more and more common.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And it usually happens between
the ages of three and six

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:05.634 align:middle line:90%
is what I'm finding.

00:21:05.634 --> 00:21:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where the
memory pops in.

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: It starts
coming in, yes.

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:09.646 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
it leaves again.

00:21:09.646 --> 00:21:11.770 align:middle line:84%
So would you say
that your son, Jamie,

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:15.270 align:middle line:84%
at this point in his
life, has forgotten

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.190 align:middle line:84%
most of the things
he talked about when

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:18.590 align:middle line:90%
he was three or four?

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:20.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: I do, yeah.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.315 align:middle line:84%
He remembers the artwork
because we still have it.

00:21:22.315 --> 00:21:22.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:24.310 align:middle line:90%


00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: But he doesn't
remember, luckily,

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:29.369 align:middle line:84%
he does remember the
night terrors or the fear

00:21:29.369 --> 00:21:30.160 align:middle line:90%
that he would have.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.185 align:middle line:90%


00:21:31.185 --> 00:21:33.185 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And maybe that's
a protection mechanism

00:21:33.185 --> 00:21:34.910 align:middle line:90%
that the body has.

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:35.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: I think so.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:36.380 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:38.830 align:middle line:84%
But he did say-- it
was kind of sweet.

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:40.940 align:middle line:84%
He said that if he had
to do it over again,

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.680 align:middle line:84%
he would still go
down with the ship.

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With what you
know about your son,

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:47.690 align:middle line:84%
and you're comfortable
with it now.

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:49.916 align:middle line:84%
Were you comfortable
with it then?

00:21:49.916 --> 00:21:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: I was
worried about it,

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:53.220 align:middle line:84%
mainly because of
the night terrors.

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you think there was
something going on in his head?

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MASINO: Well, I
was just worried

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.700 align:middle line:84%
that they weren't
going to go away.

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:01.242 align:middle line:90%
He was very--

00:22:01.242 --> 00:22:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you
thought it was more

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:04.152 align:middle line:90%
serious than what was happening?

00:22:04.152 --> 00:22:05.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Right, right.

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:07.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was a bright,
really bright boy.

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:10.550 align:middle line:10%
And picked up things
really quickly.

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:13.450 align:middle line:10%
So I wasn't really worried
about his mental state,

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:16.250 align:middle line:10%
but more of his emotional state.

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:19.250 align:middle line:10%
Is he going to suffer
from this for very long?

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:21.632 align:middle line:84%
Because the night terrors
sometimes were really--

00:22:21.632 --> 00:22:23.590 align:middle line:84%
they call them night
terrors for a good reason.

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well I'm glad
he's doing well now.

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:26.160 align:middle line:90%
It's a great story.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.300 align:middle line:84%
Susan, thank you for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:28.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MASINO: Thank you.

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:29.910 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:32.076 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Look, if you don't
believe in reincarnation

00:22:32.076 --> 00:22:34.140 align:middle line:84%
at this point, well,
you better think again.

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.990 align:middle line:10%
Because stories like this
that Susan has told us

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:40.110 align:middle line:10%
about her son, Jamie, about
living on the Titanic,

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:42.930 align:middle line:10%
as being the designer
of the Titanic,

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:45.300 align:middle line:10%
really will make you
wonder and question.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:49.770 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
