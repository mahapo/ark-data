>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.940 align:middle line:10%
Heidi Hollis is with us, an
author who named, defined,

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.660 align:middle line:10%
and trademarked the terms
shadow people and hat man.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.960 align:middle line:10%
She is also an occupational
therapist and host

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.110 align:middle line:10%
of "Dark Becomes Light" which
is on the "Coast to Coast AM

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.970 align:middle line:10%
Paranormal Podcast Network."

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.710 align:middle line:84%
Heidi, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIDI HOLLIS: Oh.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.180 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, George.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.900 align:middle line:84%
It's great to be
here with you again.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.140 align:middle line:90%
I should say welcome back.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.847 align:middle line:90%
How long has it been?

00:00:43.847 --> 00:00:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: I thought it
was close to 10 years

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.285 align:middle line:84%
since I've been here,
but I'm not sure.

00:00:47.285 --> 00:00:47.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a long time.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: That's a while.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you coin the
phrase shadow man and hat man.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.900 align:middle line:10%
>>HOLLIS: Well, shadow
people were something

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.600 align:middle line:10%
I just tossed out there
because I got tired of always

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.100 align:middle line:10%
describing it to my friends
and family about what it was I

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.900 align:middle line:10%
was seeing.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.270 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just like, "They're
like shadow people."

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.677 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a blanket
name to go over all of it.

00:01:06.677 --> 00:01:08.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you trademarked it.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.750 align:middle line:84%
So when you hear the word
shadow people, and hat man,

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.672 align:middle line:90%
do you cringe?

00:01:13.672 --> 00:01:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: When I hear--

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From other people?

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.890 align:middle line:10%
>>HOLLIS: Well, I'm
proud to know, thanks

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.220 align:middle line:10%
to being a regular on
Coast to Coast AM with you,

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.780 align:middle line:10%
that people are aware
of what's going on

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.850 align:middle line:10%
so they don't feel alone.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.540 align:middle line:84%
But I cringe when I
hear about people aiming

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.510 align:middle line:84%
to conjure these things
up or other people saying,

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.760 align:middle line:84%
"I'm the expert on
this, and they're

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.870 align:middle line:90%
telling the wrong things."

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.010 align:middle line:90%
And people know it came from me.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.070 align:middle line:84%
But it's been getting
distorted because I don't

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.125 align:middle line:90%
know what this whole flex is.

00:01:46.125 --> 00:01:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something
is going on, right?

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: It is and really, it
breaks my heart because it's

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.650 align:middle line:90%
causing harm out there.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the
reasons why I trademarked

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.290 align:middle line:90%
shadow people and hat man.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And I had to prove it came
from me so the copyright speaks

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.810 align:middle line:90%
for itself.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.620 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it really
was quite a process

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.539 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to pull it
in so people understood

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.030 align:middle line:84%
when they hear those two names,
this is the meaning of it.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.180 align:middle line:84%
This is where I'm
going and this is how

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.720 align:middle line:90%
it's supposed to help others.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.630 align:middle line:84%
It's been difficult to see
how it's become out there

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:23.430 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk about
shadow people for a little bit.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yes.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: First of all,
what is a shadow person?

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: So it's
never been a person.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.710 align:middle line:90%
It's never been human.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people think that
these are a shadow of a ghost

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.600 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.280 align:middle line:84%
That is not what
shadow people are.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.590 align:middle line:84%
They are something
that can change form

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.440 align:middle line:84%
to look like a shadow
streak or a shadow cloud.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Devious?

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: Oh man,
nothing positive.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.400 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, very negative.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.460 align:middle line:84%
Demonic, dare I say, but
not quite from here either.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do they want?

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: They want
whatever they can get.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.060 align:middle line:84%
They love to feed
off from negativity.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.430 align:middle line:84%
They love to feed
off from whatever

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.620 align:middle line:84%
it is that makes a person
tick, to be honest.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.035 align:middle line:84%
So they hold souls
in haunted locations.

00:03:09.035 --> 00:03:11.840 align:middle line:84%
If there's a haunting
going on, usually you'll

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.510 align:middle line:90%
see one of them lurking around.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And they really aim to create
a lot of havoc in the world.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what you
see is a shadow, right?

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.620 align:middle line:90%
Whisking by

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: You can see
something like that.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And you can also see
something more definitive

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.610 align:middle line:84%
that looks like a hulky man
with its head directly connected

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:30.410 align:middle line:90%
to its shoulders.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But as a shadow?

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: But as a shadow.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And if you see its eyes,
they're usually slanted

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.020 align:middle line:90%
and they glow red.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.088 align:middle line:90%
So glow.

00:03:38.088 --> 00:03:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what
about the hat man?

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.297 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: Now, the
hat man, when I first

00:03:41.297 --> 00:03:43.250 align:middle line:84%
introduced that
topic on your show,

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.850 align:middle line:84%
I thought he was more
of a shadow being.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.470 align:middle line:84%
I thought that this was just
another form that they took.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:51.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With a top hat.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yeah.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.283 align:middle line:84%
Well, he changes his hat or
he doesn't wear a hat at all

00:03:54.283 --> 00:03:56.730 align:middle line:84%
but he can step out
from the shadows

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.410 align:middle line:90%
and you can see his skin.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.180 align:middle line:84%
You could see if
he's clean shaven.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.870 align:middle line:90%
You could see how his hair is.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so he can change but
he is the epitome of evil.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And he wears a three-piece
suit, sometimes a trench coat.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.030 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes a cape.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.090 align:middle line:90%
And he talks.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.160 align:middle line:84%
Shadow people,
they might whisper.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.230 align:middle line:84%
You might hear a
moaning or something.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.610 align:middle line:84%
But hat man, I wouldn't
recommend engaging with him

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.000 align:middle line:84%
but if you talk to
him and he talks back,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.580 align:middle line:84%
you wish that you
never spoke to him.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The hat man have form?

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: He does.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, he is as
dark as they come.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you ask him who
he is, he will tell you

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.620 align:middle line:90%
he's the devil himself.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.350 align:middle line:90%
And God forbid he smiles.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.762 align:middle line:84%
He looks like something
worse than a shark's teeth.

00:04:46.762 --> 00:04:48.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you come
across these entities

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.400 align:middle line:90%
in the first place?

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: The very first time--

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.030 align:middle line:84%
I thought this was the very
first time but it turned out it

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.830 align:middle line:90%
wasn't.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, they'd wreaked
havoc in my life before.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.090 align:middle line:84%
But the very first
time I saw a shadow

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.720 align:middle line:84%
being following a friend
of mine and myself

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.317 align:middle line:90%
walking in broad daylight.

00:05:06.317 --> 00:05:07.650 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what I was seeing.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.450 align:middle line:90%
She didn't see it.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.480 align:middle line:90%
She kept walking.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of our walk in
broad daylight, I asked her.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.590 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Look, I don't
know what I just saw,

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.330 align:middle line:84%
but I saw this
thing following us."

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And I showed a drawing of
the head and shoulder shadow.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.422 align:middle line:84%
I just quickly drew it
out and she looks at it

00:05:24.422 --> 00:05:26.380 align:middle line:84%
and I'm thinking she's
going to think I'm nuts.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And instead she goes,
"Oh, that thing.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.100 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.260 align:middle line:84%
It's been following
me since I was a kid."

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about you?

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: For myself, my
home that I grew up in soon

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.310 align:middle line:84%
after my mother
passed became haunted.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.285 align:middle line:84%
And everybody is like,
"Oh it's your mother.

00:05:42.285 --> 00:05:44.660 align:middle line:84%
Why would my mother try to
scare her very young children?

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.460 align:middle line:90%
No."

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.400 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think about
this for many years,

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.830 align:middle line:84%
about this haunting
that we dealt with.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.160 align:middle line:84%
But when I thought of the thing
that attacked my stepbrother,

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.390 align:middle line:84%
it was black with glowing red
eyes and it scratched his face.

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And again, it was
broad daylight and--

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Scratched it badly?

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: It looked like cat
scratches all over his face.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, wow,
they were there then

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.800 align:middle line:84%
and I just never
thought about it.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.260 align:middle line:84%
But everywhere I
moved, I had a problem.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Every place, something
was knocking, or moving,

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.060 align:middle line:90%
or shifting, and shadowy.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:25.910 align:middle line:90%
What do they want?

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.530 align:middle line:90%
What do the shadow people want?

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.000 align:middle line:90%
What is the hat man want?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: Well, the shadow
people work for the hat man.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.070 align:middle line:90%
They're like a minion.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.120 align:middle line:84%
We make cartoons
out of these things

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.920 align:middle line:84%
but a minion is something that
follows something super evil,

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.060 align:middle line:90%
and hat man is absolutely evil.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.780 align:middle line:84%
He is something that he
wants the soul of people,

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.040 align:middle line:90%
and it sounds so cliche.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.750 align:middle line:90%
It sounds so ridiculous.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.360 align:middle line:84%
But from the beginning
of time we've

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.270 align:middle line:84%
been talking about
good versus bad.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.970 align:middle line:90%
And now, it has come to us.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:02.470 align:middle line:84%
It has stepped
out of the shadows

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:07.780 align:middle line:84%
quite literally to direct
other negative things to go out

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:13.060 align:middle line:84%
and to essentially taunt and
torture people until they just

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.500 align:middle line:90%
have no more fight.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:19.280 align:middle line:84%
But hat man, when
he steps forward,

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:24.200 align:middle line:84%
it's at the point where when
he's there after the person,

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:29.270 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the person
is somebody really special

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:30.320 align:middle line:90%
that he wants.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And he could come
once in 40 years

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.850 align:middle line:84%
or come every
night for 40 years.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And if he puts his
attention towards somebody,

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.630 align:middle line:84%
he tries to get them to the
point of literally saying,

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.590 align:middle line:90%
"I can't take this fear anymore.

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:44.540 align:middle line:90%
I give up."

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And right when they say
that, he will take his fist

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.240 align:middle line:84%
and punch it through
their chest and try

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.790 align:middle line:90%
to rip their soul from them.

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:54.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's disgusting,
what he does.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are shadow
people what we see

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:59.090 align:middle line:84%
whisking by the
corner of our eye?

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yes.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people are
like, "I see this thing.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And why is it more off
to my peripheral vision?

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.660 align:middle line:90%
Why can't I see them head on?"

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.120 align:middle line:90%
Well, you can see them head on.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.880 align:middle line:84%
You won't like
what you see but we

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.840 align:middle line:84%
have a more of a sensitivity
in our peripheral vision.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.120 align:middle line:84%
It's like that fight or
flight type of response.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.400 align:middle line:84%
If a ball is coming your
way, you see that sooner.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
why a lot of people

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.290 align:middle line:84%
are witnessing shadow people
from the corners of their eyes

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:30.090 align:middle line:90%
more.

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You write comic books.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: Yes, I do a
paranormal comic strip

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.700 align:middle line:90%
it's called "The Outlander."

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And I pull from all
the different types

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.450 align:middle line:84%
of things that go on in the
world from Bigfoot, to ghosts,

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:44.970 align:middle line:90%
and poke some fun at it.

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:49.080 align:middle line:84%
Because so many times people
talk about these topics

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.660 align:middle line:84%
and they feel like they have
to talk with a flashlight

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.370 align:middle line:84%
under their chin
and be so serious.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And all I ever wanted
to be growing up

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.240 align:middle line:90%
was to be a comic strip artist.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.903 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, that's it.

00:08:58.903 --> 00:08:59.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You got that.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:00.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: I did.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, yeah, and
having the opportunity

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:08.880 align:middle line:84%
to blend all the things that
I do into what I love doing,

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.800 align:middle line:84%
helping people in
the paranormal realm.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we've got some
stills of some of your work.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
what we've got here.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:16.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: OK.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
can describe for it.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.660 align:middle line:90%
What are we looking at here?

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:19.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yeah.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:22.920 align:middle line:84%
So these are the
different forms that I

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.290 align:middle line:84%
guess you could say like
the one up in the left hand

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:26.610 align:middle line:90%
corner, that's a shadow people.

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:28.500 align:middle line:84%
That's a head and
shoulder shadow.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And then there's this
grim reaper type of thing.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.080 align:middle line:84%
People assume are another
type that shadow people take

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.030 align:middle line:90%
but no, they're not.

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.160 align:middle line:90%
And then this alien shadow.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.290 align:middle line:84%
I get a lot of people
saying, "I saw a shadow

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:42.270 align:middle line:90%
being but it had a hood on."

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, "Well,
that's not a shadow being.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.320 align:middle line:84%
That's an alien
that wears a hood."

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.400 align:middle line:84%
But they have very round
eyes and they're bright red.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.430 align:middle line:10%
And there's another
form that hat man takes

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.470 align:middle line:10%
right there where
it's got the top hat

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.580 align:middle line:10%
and he'll wear a trench coat.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a cape usually
when he's got the top hat.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And he could change up
his outfit sometimes

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.060 align:middle line:90%
when he's looking like that.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.050 align:middle line:10%
But the typical hat man,
it's the trench coat,

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:08.580 align:middle line:10%
three-piece suit.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.980 align:middle line:84%
You might see a chain
watch on his hip.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And one of his favorite
hats is the gaucho hat.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And then the shadow spiders
which George, those things

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.138 align:middle line:90%
were the worst for me.

00:10:20.138 --> 00:10:21.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Those are scary.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:21.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Man.

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:22.460 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:23.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I hate spiders.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:24.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Gosh.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.530 align:middle line:90%
I swear to you, George.

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:28.170 align:middle line:90%
They can be the size of a--

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:30.960 align:middle line:84%
it took up my whole
ceiling one time.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And other times,
tons of little ones.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.100 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.330 align:middle line:90%
So this is a form.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:37.247 align:middle line:90%
This is from my book--

00:10:37.247 --> 00:10:39.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Scaring the death
out of that guy, right?

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:40.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yes, a little kid.

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:43.260 align:middle line:84%
Hat man loves to
mess with children

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.560 align:middle line:84%
and it is absolutely
infuriating to me.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.670 align:middle line:10%
And it's like, how are you going
to sit there and scare a kid?

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:53.130 align:middle line:10%
But hat man has no boundaries.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even the
frog is scared.

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yes.

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:58.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a
typical shadow being.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:07.290 align:middle line:10%
This is like a head and
shoulder shadow type and they

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:10.810 align:middle line:10%
work to get them to be less--

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:11.610 align:middle line:10%
how can I say?

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:15.482 align:middle line:10%
Reduce your human potential
because you're in such fear.

00:11:15.482 --> 00:11:16.440 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what do you do?

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.250 align:middle line:90%
You're paralyzed.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:18.510 align:middle line:90%
His arms are out to the side.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:19.740 align:middle line:90%
He can't respond.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And just to scare and put
that pressure on his chest

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.860 align:middle line:84%
so he feels like
he can't breathe.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.360 align:middle line:90%
And his eyes are turning red.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.770 align:middle line:90%
And just absolutely paralyzed.

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:32.400 align:middle line:84%
That is so typical of
hat man or shadow people.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do these entities
generally approach somebody

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.770 align:middle line:90%
in their bedrooms?

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:39.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: That is one
of the most common ways

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:41.220 align:middle line:90%
but it's not the only way.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:45.330 align:middle line:84%
But it is one of the ways
that they break a person down.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And I like to tell people, it's
like I don't know what to do.

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:50.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm so terrified.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.290 align:middle line:90%
How do I get over this?

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, think about your
human potential, first off.

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:56.580 align:middle line:90%
They have to paralyze you.

00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Come in the middle of the night
when you're dead asleep and--

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wake you up.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: Well,
yeah, wake you up.

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:04.500 align:middle line:84%
But it's like they've
got you pinned

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.330 align:middle line:90%
in this most vulnerable state.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And then they're like,
"Oh, now I got you."

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.645 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what a way to go.

00:12:10.645 --> 00:12:11.520 align:middle line:90%
What a cowardice way.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What invites them
in, in the first place?

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: A lot of
people are like, "Oh,

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.950 align:middle line:84%
one time I played
with a Ouija board.

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:19.880 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:20.720 align:middle line:90%
I used to do drugs.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.520 align:middle line:90%
Or I was drunk the first time."

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of different ways

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.752 align:middle line:84%
that people can attract
these things to themselves.

00:12:26.752 --> 00:12:27.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Putting guards down.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: They can.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.488 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

00:12:30.488 --> 00:12:32.030 align:middle line:84%
The number one thing
that I'm finding

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:35.750 align:middle line:84%
what attracts them are
people who are artistic,

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:41.210 align:middle line:84%
who are very insightful, who may
have different abilities, even

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:42.530 align:middle line:90%
a little bit psychic.

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:46.580 align:middle line:84%
So I find that they're trying
to get those people to shut down

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.148 align:middle line:84%
who they really are by
putting them in fear

00:12:49.148 --> 00:12:50.940 align:middle line:84%
and like saying, "I
don't want to see this.

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.315 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
experience this."

00:12:52.315 --> 00:12:54.410 align:middle line:84%
So they're blocking off
that part of themselves

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:56.760 align:middle line:84%
because what they're
seeing is not good.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they enter
people's dream states, Heidi?

00:12:58.950 --> 00:12:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: They do.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh God.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:01.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: They do indeed.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Once the person is feeling like
they can't take it anymore,

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:07.940 align:middle line:84%
or they've gone and
done this blessing

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.700 align:middle line:84%
that I tell people to do to
try to get rid of these things.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.280 align:middle line:84%
They'll infiltrate
their nightmares.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And imagine that you're
having a nightmare

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.760 align:middle line:84%
and you wake up
like, "Oh, thank God.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm done with that nightmare."

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.620 align:middle line:90%
And it's in your room.

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.420 align:middle line:90%
So it's just another mind game.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.550 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to find
what your weaknesses are

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:25.862 align:middle line:90%
by instilling those nightmares.

00:13:25.862 --> 00:13:28.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you're going to
have an encounter with a shadow

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.760 align:middle line:84%
person or the hat man,
which would it be?

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: Shadow people
are a lot easier.

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Hat man is something
that will really

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:39.812 align:middle line:84%
change your whole way of
thinking from this reality.

00:13:39.812 --> 00:13:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They want
your soul, don't they?

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: They do but hat man
really, really gets in there

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.190 align:middle line:90%
and because he's solid.

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:49.770 align:middle line:90%
He's not like shadow beings.

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:54.150 align:middle line:84%
He can grab a hold of you, and
tell you things about yourself,

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:57.452 align:middle line:84%
and throw you up against
the wall, and beat you.

00:13:57.452 --> 00:13:59.535 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you glad you
discovered these things?

00:13:59.535 --> 00:14:02.490 align:middle line:90%


00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: Discover
is a strong word

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:09.520 align:middle line:84%
because I experienced what
my friend was dealing with.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.720 align:middle line:90%
And it was like a contagion.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.460 align:middle line:90%
Suddenly, have shadow spiders.

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what was going
on but I'm proud of the work

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.330 align:middle line:84%
that I've done, and
bringing this awareness.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people think I
just learned this on my own

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.310 align:middle line:90%
but that's not the case.

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:28.685 align:middle line:84%
And I know that's
something we're

00:14:28.685 --> 00:14:33.090 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about more
but learning the definitions

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:35.580 align:middle line:84%
and what they're up
to, why they're here,

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.225 align:middle line:84%
why they're doing
the things that they

00:14:37.225 --> 00:14:39.870 align:middle line:90%
are, that was taught to me.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And actually goes beyond
just this lifetime

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:47.153 align:middle line:84%
that I remember agreeing to do
this work that I'm doing now.

00:14:47.153 --> 00:14:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I remember
when you first

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:51.360 align:middle line:84%
started talking about the
hat man and shadow people

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.670 align:middle line:84%
on our program,
on our radio show,

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:57.540 align:middle line:84%
and I'm listening to you
with the audience calling in.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And everybody is in fear
over these subject matters.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.950 align:middle line:90%
I mean, my God.

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:07.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Scary as all get up.

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:08.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Oh yeah.

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:12.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I first started
talking about these things,

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.600 align:middle line:84%
I was told by the
beings that taught me

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.410 align:middle line:84%
about him that this was going to
become a worldwide phenomenon.

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And I would serve as a
person that would warn them

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.860 align:middle line:90%
on what to do in case of.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:27.300 align:middle line:90%
So I knew it was coming.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:30.000 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't realize
until I got on your program

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.490 align:middle line:84%
how widely it had
already spread.

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And just the emails
started flooding in

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.108 align:middle line:90%
and they haven't stopped since.

00:15:38.108 --> 00:15:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's everywhere.

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: It is, yeah.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These beings,
who sends them to us?

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:46.650 align:middle line:90%
The devil.

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: When we say
devil, these beings

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:53.040 align:middle line:90%
don't come from here.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.170 align:middle line:90%
They come from another place.

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:56.045 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dimension.

00:15:56.045 --> 00:15:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: You
could say dimension

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.520 align:middle line:90%
but we have a light source.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.150 align:middle line:90%
Well, they have a dark source.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:03.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is
information that I was

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:06.660 align:middle line:84%
told by these alien
beings that instructed me

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:07.880 align:middle line:90%
on what these things were.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Remember the movie
"Ghost" with the late Patrick

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.490 align:middle line:90%
Swayze?

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:11.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yes.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Every time one of
those people in that movie

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.950 align:middle line:84%
did something wrong,
some ghouls that

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:21.160 align:middle line:84%
look like shadow
people or the hat man

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.380 align:middle line:84%
would come out of
the sewer system,

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.450 align:middle line:84%
or out of the
street, or somewhere

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:28.180 align:middle line:84%
and try to grab
them and take them.

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.160 align:middle line:90%
Is that what this is?

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: When I think
about that movie,

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:35.020 align:middle line:84%
I can't help but to think
that they experienced

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.190 align:middle line:90%
these things themselves.

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:37.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they didn't
just start because I

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:39.200 align:middle line:90%
started talking about them.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.970 align:middle line:90%
Others had experienced them.

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think that Hollywood often
reflects their personal life

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.280 align:middle line:90%
stories as well.

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:52.100 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I think that's honestly
a minion of sorts for darkness.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:52.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you get rid of
shadow people and the hat man?

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: Well, that
is a process too.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:00.738 align:middle line:84%
I get a lot of
people who say, "I

00:17:00.738 --> 00:17:03.280 align:middle line:84%
don't get into that religious
crap but I just saw the devil."

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.810 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, "Hold on.

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:05.980 align:middle line:90%
You don't get into that."

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.109 align:middle line:84%
I said, "But you just
gave a biblical term

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:09.220 align:middle line:90%
to something really evil."

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:10.839 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, "Then
throw a shoe at it."

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:16.630 align:middle line:84%
You have to go into this
calling in the light.

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:19.510 align:middle line:84%
What you see and
feel is God to you.

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:22.869 align:middle line:84%
I'm Christian so I
say, "In Jesus's name."

00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:24.430 align:middle line:90%
I do a blessing to go through.

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:25.347 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does it work?

00:17:25.347 --> 00:17:26.319 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: It does.

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:27.640 align:middle line:90%
And it's really methodical.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.820 align:middle line:84%
You have to go through your
home and bless it a certain way.

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:33.280 align:middle line:84%
But I've had friends that
have different belief systems.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And again, calling on that
element that you feel is God.

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:41.168 align:middle line:84%
That light source helps
to dispel, and disperse,

00:17:41.168 --> 00:17:42.460 align:middle line:90%
and keep them out of your home.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.780 align:middle line:90%
And it does work.

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't get many
people writing me back

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.130 align:middle line:90%
to say, "Can I do it again?

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:49.030 align:middle line:90%
How do I do this?

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:50.560 align:middle line:90%
Or how do I fix this again?"

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.700 align:middle line:84%
But that's one of the
beauties of being able to be

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:55.930 align:middle line:90%
in the position that I am.

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:59.530 align:middle line:84%
If people have these
issues, they can contact me

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:02.350 align:middle line:84%
and I could see what
it is that they did.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Why something didn't work,
but it is so very rare.

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Heidi,
where do ETs fit in?

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: Well,
those fit in very,

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:15.230 align:middle line:84%
very uniquely because
I'd seen some things.

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:17.990 align:middle line:90%
I'd seen a lot of UFOs.

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:21.560 align:middle line:84%
I've actually called down
big craft in the past.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've
summoned them down?

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:23.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: I have.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:29.090 align:middle line:84%
I have and one time jokingly,
and it just dropped so quickly.

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:31.220 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know it would
respond like that.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:32.880 align:middle line:90%
We hit the dirt.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.165 align:middle line:90%
Why did that happen?

00:18:35.165 --> 00:18:36.290 align:middle line:90%
So I had experienced stuff.

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:38.660 align:middle line:90%
I'd seen a lot of big craft.

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:44.840 align:middle line:84%
When it came to this alien being
that I learned the name was

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.480 align:middle line:90%
Cafth, C-A-F-T-H.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.450 align:middle line:84%
It actually approached my
college roommate first.

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And she was super
religious, Pentecostal.

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:57.980 align:middle line:90%
All alien stuff is evil.

00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Don't talk to me
about that stuff.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And this being came
to her and started

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.860 align:middle line:84%
talking to her to
the point that it

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:09.120 align:middle line:90%
started speaking through her.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in college
and I'm witnessing.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:14.340 align:middle line:84%
This and I'm like,
"What on Earth?

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.750 align:middle line:90%
What is going on here?"

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And it showed itself
to me while she

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:22.810 align:middle line:84%
was almost in this-- she called
it a meditative state that she

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:23.610 align:middle line:90%
was in.

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And when she was in
that state, this being

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:29.430 align:middle line:90%
would speak through her.

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'd witnessed
stuff like that

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:36.332 align:middle line:84%
before because I had a
UFO group for 15 years.

00:19:36.332 --> 00:19:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, you did.

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:38.090 align:middle line:90%
A good one too.

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:38.890 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yeah.

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:40.180 align:middle line:90%
I had a good time with it.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.720 align:middle line:90%
And I learned so much.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And my friends that
were in that group,

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.060 align:middle line:90%
I'd see them get regressed.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.550 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes when
they're talking

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:55.030 align:middle line:10%
about their experiences, the
being would speak through them.

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:57.270 align:middle line:90%
And so I witnessed this before.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.420 align:middle line:84%
But this is my super
religious Pentecostal

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:04.320 align:middle line:84%
friend who was very much
like, "Don't talk to me

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.860 align:middle line:90%
about this stuff at all."

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.520 align:middle line:84%
So when this being
presented himself

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:13.170 align:middle line:84%
and when it's speaking through
her, her accent reduced.

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:15.570 align:middle line:90%
She had a Spanish accent.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:18.210 align:middle line:90%
And I was just enthralled.

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:19.900 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know how to react.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
"Who's speaking?"

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And this being literally
said, "What you

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:25.410 align:middle line:90%
would call an alien being."

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:27.320 align:middle line:90%
And I'm trying to calm myself.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.120 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like--

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:28.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:29.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: "Can you
show yourself?"

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking a craft
would show up or something.

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And it said, "Well, we
can't do that anymore

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:41.190 align:middle line:84%
because America had the
ability to shoot them down."

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:43.500 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, "Oh, OK."

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.160 align:middle line:90%
And then it said, "But hold on.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.610 align:middle line:84%
I think I can transmit
an image of myself."

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And we're sitting
in my car, right?

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And I am not kidding, the
car filled with this hum

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:59.410 align:middle line:84%
and this pink
fleshy creature just

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:01.470 align:middle line:90%
appeared between the two of us.

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It could be a
magnet for all this, Heidi.

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: Oh, it's
stranger than that.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:06.730 align:middle line:90%
It's strange.

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some of the
ETs are very benevolent.

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:12.213 align:middle line:90%
They're good people.

00:21:12.213 --> 00:21:13.380 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at some of these,

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yeah.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:18.120 align:middle line:90%


00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's him.

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
your buddy, Kraft.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Cafth.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's the one.

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:26.380 align:middle line:84%
It's funny because
I made a crack once.

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, "Oh, you look
similar to the greys."

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:30.160 align:middle line:90%
Oh, he was so insulted.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It looks like a grey.

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: Well, he's got
more rounded features

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:35.100 align:middle line:90%
and he's pinkish.

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And he actually can
smile and use his mouth.

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:41.010 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, he does
not care for what

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:43.980 align:middle line:84%
the greys do on this
planet to say the least.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's
look at our next picture.

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yeah.

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:53.000 align:middle line:84%
So this was another being
that came to my friend.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.450 align:middle line:84%
It was interesting because she
had an experience with this guy

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:57.810 align:middle line:90%
and didn't tell me about it.

00:21:57.810 --> 00:21:58.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Soforus?

00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yes.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And so when conversations
would change

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.360 align:middle line:84%
to something more spiritual,
this being would show up.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, I didn't get a
chance to see him myself.

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:11.900 align:middle line:84%
My friend got to see him but
this is how she describes him.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.832 align:middle line:84%
And he has these
little balls of light

00:22:14.832 --> 00:22:16.790 align:middle line:84%
that are supposed to
represent different souls.

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But these are
positive, upbeat alien, right?

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: They speak of God.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:26.720 align:middle line:84%
They speak of there being a
conflict in alien contact.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.060 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones
that educated me

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:30.460 align:middle line:90%
on the topic of shadow people--

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How does he help you?

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:32.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: --and hat man.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:34.890 align:middle line:90%
Well, both of them--

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:35.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:39.110 align:middle line:84%
So imagine, right after we
had this encounter with cafth

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:42.612 align:middle line:84%
the very first time,
we're like, oh my gosh.

00:22:42.612 --> 00:22:44.570 align:middle line:84%
We could ask all the
questions to the universe.

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:46.100 align:middle line:90%
It's like, OK, let's try this.

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.750 align:middle line:84%
So my friend would get
into this meditative state

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:51.360 align:middle line:84%
and see, let's push
that button again

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.700 align:middle line:90%
and see if this being will talk.

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And he would come through
and I'd ask a question.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And nine times out of 10
he'd say, "Well, it wouldn't

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.300 align:middle line:90%
benefit you to know that."

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:02.800 align:middle line:84%
It's like, "Well,
where are you at?"

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.063 align:middle line:84%
"How would you know if
I told you the name?

00:23:05.063 --> 00:23:05.980 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't find it."

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:08.550 align:middle line:90%
So I understood.

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:12.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm in college and I started
throwing like odd questions

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:13.470 align:middle line:90%
here and there.

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:15.210 align:middle line:90%
And most of them were blocked.

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And then I brought up
a weird dream I had.

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "I had a dream
of the moon looking like it

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.400 align:middle line:90%
was going to hit the planet."

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And then a craft appeared and it
pulled the moon out of the way

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:29.670 align:middle line:90%
so it wouldn't crash."

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And this was the first
time I got an answer

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.100 align:middle line:84%
from this being speaking
through my friend

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:38.310 align:middle line:84%
to say, "Well, I'm not
in charge of dreams

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:40.080 align:middle line:90%
but I'm going to tell you.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:44.460 align:middle line:84%
We saw what the shadows
were doing and bringing

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:47.640 align:middle line:84%
the moon to the
planet to destroy it.

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.270 align:middle line:90%
And we moved it out of the way."

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:50.610 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "Hold on.

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:51.450 align:middle line:90%
Shadows?

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:52.900 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?"

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, "Well, you tend
to call them shadow people,

00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:57.210 align:middle line:90%
we call them shadows.

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And they have been a problem
throughout the universe.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And they come from
a dark source."

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:02.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same thing.

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:03.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yeah.

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:04.110 align:middle line:90%
That's the same thing.

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:04.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:05.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yeah.

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And they spoke of this
having been a nuisance

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:13.410 align:middle line:84%
and taking over many
types of beings.

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Very much like how can they
say, how we get possessed.

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:22.760 align:middle line:84%
You see the exorcists and
exorcisms that go on today.

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, aliens have souls too and
they can be poorly influenced.

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And this is how we
get some of this--

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.252 align:middle line:84%
you wonder what's connecting
the different beings

00:24:33.252 --> 00:24:34.210 align:middle line:90%
and what they're doing.

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:36.700 align:middle line:84%
So you've got the praying
mantis, you've got the greys,

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:37.540 align:middle line:90%
you got reptilians.

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:38.020 align:middle line:90%
And you're--

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:38.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nordics.

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:39.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yes.

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And they're abducting and
they're doing horrible things

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:42.910 align:middle line:90%
to people.

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, "Well,
what's the common factor?"

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:48.310 align:middle line:90%
And I had no idea.

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And I was informed these
shadow beings are infiltrating,

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.830 align:middle line:84%
and they have dominated,
and taken over some

00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:58.490 align:middle line:90%
of these beings that come here.

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:00.633 align:middle line:84%
Not all of them
but a big majority.

00:25:00.633 --> 00:25:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well, how can
you tell the difference?"

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And they told me and my
friend, "Well, their actions.

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:10.370 align:middle line:90%
Are they causing harm?

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Are they paralyzing you
like shadow people do?

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Are they doing experiments
against your will?"

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:18.910 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, "Oh, of course.

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:19.795 align:middle line:90%
It makes sense."

00:25:19.795 --> 00:25:22.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people do you
think know about shadow people?

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:22.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Oh gosh.

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:23.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And hat man.

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:24.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: It's in the millions.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's growing, isn't it?

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:27.368 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: It's in
the millions now.

00:25:27.368 --> 00:25:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And when I talk to people
about anything weird happening

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:35.600 align:middle line:84%
in their lives, I
could walk into a room

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.390 align:middle line:84%
and say, "Who here has
experienced something weird?"

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:39.570 align:middle line:90%
And usually, it's a ghost.

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:40.430 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, "OK.

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:41.930 align:middle line:90%
What did the ghosts look like?"

00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:43.650 align:middle line:84%
Nine times out of
10 it's hat man.

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:45.280 align:middle line:90%
It's that common.

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That prevalent?

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: It is that prevalent.

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:52.250 align:middle line:84%
It's disappointing
because I didn't realize

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:53.900 align:middle line:90%
it was this bad already.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:26:00.110 align:middle line:84%
But I'm upset that people
are thinking this is a game.

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are governments
affected by these entities?

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: I was told
that they influence

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:06.320 align:middle line:90%
so many different areas.

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.320 align:middle line:90%
That this is not--

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, great.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yeah.

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's like the devil
on one shoulder whispering

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:15.072 align:middle line:84%
in your ear or the angel
on the other one that's

00:26:15.072 --> 00:26:16.280 align:middle line:90%
telling you different things.

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:16.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Heidi, Heidi.

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yeah, right?

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Which one are you
going to listen to?

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:21.380 align:middle line:90%
And it seems so cliche.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.670 align:middle line:90%
It's like, "Oh, come on.

00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:24.980 align:middle line:84%
There couldn't be
something so rotten."

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:26.780 align:middle line:84%
But you've got
millions of people

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:29.900 align:middle line:84%
now, George, that
are saying exactly.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:31.460 align:middle line:90%
They know these names.

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:32.660 align:middle line:90%
They know these terms.

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And thanks to coming
on your program

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:40.470 align:middle line:84%
and talking about this for
so long, people are aware.

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:43.880 align:middle line:84%
But now, the way that people
are taking it, oh, maybe it's

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:44.810 align:middle line:90%
a guardian angel.

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:47.150 align:middle line:90%
This is a newer trend.

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:48.830 align:middle line:90%
"Oh, he's just watching me.

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:50.360 align:middle line:90%
He's not causing me any issues."

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These aren't
guardian angels.

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.305 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: They are
not guardian angels.

00:26:53.305 --> 00:26:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "If hat man or
shadow people are just staring

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.240 align:middle line:90%
at you, they're studying you.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:03.740 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to find a way in
to looking at your weaknesses.

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:06.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They want
to destroy you?

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:07.580 align:middle line:90%
What's the goal?

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:08.480 align:middle line:90%
The soul?

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.880 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: It's the soul.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.940 align:middle line:84%
It's like, "Why do we try to
dominate over each other?"

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:14.930 align:middle line:90%
Because they can.

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:15.950 align:middle line:90%
It's a power.

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:17.575 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
can get away with it.

00:27:17.575 --> 00:27:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: They can
get away with it.

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And now, seeing how
big and horrible it is,

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:25.140 align:middle line:90%
something's got to be done.

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And doing my best to
try to correct what's

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.180 align:middle line:90%
been going on out there.

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Because people are being told,
"Oh, if you drink some of this

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:36.150 align:middle line:84%
or if you take this drug, you
could experience hat man."

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:37.860 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, "Oh no.

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.250 align:middle line:90%
What is this?"

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
inviting hat man in?

00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: They are.

00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:45.310 align:middle line:84%
People are contacting me asking
how to conjure these things.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:47.132 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, "Why
would you want something

00:27:47.132 --> 00:27:48.090 align:middle line:90%
like that in your life?

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:50.640 align:middle line:90%
That makes no sense at all."

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's crazy times.

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: It is, but
it's because of some

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:57.450 align:middle line:84%
of the people that are going
out there saying, "Well, I've

00:27:57.450 --> 00:27:58.780 align:middle line:90%
had enough stories sent to me.

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:00.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm the authority on this.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you
exactly what this is."

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:04.950 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, "No.

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:06.360 align:middle line:90%
That is not correct."

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And it breaks my heart
because people are coming

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.100 align:middle line:90%
to me saying, "Oh my goodness.

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.180 align:middle line:90%
I saw your show.

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:12.990 align:middle line:90%
I saw your film."

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:15.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, "I have none
of that out there.

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Those are other people who have
pulled it and tried to make it

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.430 align:middle line:90%
what they want it to be."

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:24.150 align:middle line:84%
So that was why I had to
do the trademark because it

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:25.830 align:middle line:90%
was getting so distorted.

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how do
you bring it back home?

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.500 align:middle line:84%
How do you get people to
accept the fact that there's

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.040 align:middle line:90%
something really going on here?

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yeah.

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:37.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what I'm
doing one person at a time.

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Doing "Dark Becomes
Light" the podcast.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Continuing to talk, continuing
to get on different programs,

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:45.840 align:middle line:84%
trying to set the
record straight.

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's not so clean cut where
people think this is the cutoff

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:52.080 align:middle line:84%
line for shadow
people because they're

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:56.280 align:middle line:84%
seeing right alongside of alien
beings, alien abductions, hat

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.540 align:middle line:90%
man as well.

00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:02.220 align:middle line:84%
I actually got to
understand something.

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:06.700 align:middle line:84%
Somebody showed me a carving
and I didn't know what it was.

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
"This is amazing.

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:10.950 align:middle line:84%
Somebody did a great
carving of hat man,

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:13.470 align:middle line:90%
the original form of him."

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And my friends jaw
drops like, "Heidi."

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:17.200 align:middle line:90%
And I asked who did it.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.680 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "That's ahriman.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Rudolf Steiner carved
that 100 years ago."

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:25.080 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea.

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.788 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The phenomenon
he's been with us

00:29:26.788 --> 00:29:28.245 align:middle line:90%
since the beginning of time.

00:29:28.245 --> 00:29:30.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: It has been
around for a long time.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And interesting
enough Rudolf Steiner

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:36.870 align:middle line:84%
said 100 years from when
he created that bust

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:39.810 align:middle line:90%
of hat man, that ahriman.

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:41.430 align:middle line:84%
He called him
ahriman, would come

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:44.610 align:middle line:84%
to surface 100 years
from the time he made it.

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:47.310 align:middle line:90%
And here I am discussing this.

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned that I remember
before this lifetime, and I do.

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:55.260 align:middle line:84%
Not with hypnosis,
not through anything

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:59.280 align:middle line:84%
else, but I remembered
agreeing to come

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.650 align:middle line:84%
and be born during
this time period

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:03.495 align:middle line:90%
to do the work that I'm doing.

00:30:03.495 --> 00:30:06.660 align:middle line:90%


00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And I've talked to a lot
of people, a lot of authors

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.350 align:middle line:90%
and researchers.

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, "How
is this possible?

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:15.510 align:middle line:84%
The spontaneous
recall like this.

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:17.850 align:middle line:90%
And it's so rare, I guess."

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:20.620 align:middle line:90%
But I remember the whole thing.

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:23.190 align:middle line:90%
And the battle is real.

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:25.810 align:middle line:84%
That's why I called my first
book, "The Secret War."

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:29.590 align:middle line:84%
Because people think we're going
to see this glorified battle

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:30.410 align:middle line:90%
in the skies.

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:32.150 align:middle line:90%
But you go to bed at night--

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:33.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not angelic.

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:34.320 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yeah.

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And you go to bed at night and
you're battling for your life

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:38.140 align:middle line:90%
personally.

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:39.565 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have they
come after you, Heidi?

00:30:39.565 --> 00:30:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Oh, they have.

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:41.370 align:middle line:90%
They have.

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:43.052 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How have
you fought them off?

00:30:43.052 --> 00:30:44.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: As I
said, I'm Christian.

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:47.450 align:middle line:84%
I use the name of Jesus
and it works on aliens too.

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:48.250 align:middle line:90%
That I've tried.

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it
works all the time?

00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:50.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: It has, yes.

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:51.150 align:middle line:90%
It has.

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
invoke the name?

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: I say, "In Jesus's
name, get out of here.

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:56.890 align:middle line:90%
You're not welcome."

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
gone just like that?

00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: They leave, but
also in blessing my space.

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Because when your guard is down,
you're sleeping, you're busy.

00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:05.500 align:middle line:84%
You're doing something
else and that's

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.640 align:middle line:84%
when these things try
to sneak up on you,

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:08.890 align:middle line:90%
and try to take advantage.

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's really important that
you put your ethereal foot down

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:15.440 align:middle line:90%
and bless your space.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.470 align:middle line:90%
And I keep my blessing with me.

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:20.950 align:middle line:84%
What I bless my space
with is my cross necklace.

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And I go through my
home and I protect it

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.600 align:middle line:84%
that way because when
I've gone to work,

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.430 align:middle line:90%
my patients have been attacked.

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:30.910 align:middle line:84%
So I had to bring
the blessing with me

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:33.430 align:middle line:90%
so it would keep its distance.

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:35.500 align:middle line:90%
It's been a crazy battle.

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:36.670 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:38.890 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have it any
other way but to be

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:40.030 align:middle line:90%
doing what I'm doing now.

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:41.572 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Heidi, why
would some people

00:31:41.572 --> 00:31:45.198 align:middle line:84%
want to summon up the shadow
people and the hat man?

00:31:45.198 --> 00:31:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: People love
to be scared, George.

00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:47.960 align:middle line:90%
They really do.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of people are
really seeking something more

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:53.140 align:middle line:90%
in this life.

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:55.540 align:middle line:84%
They like to go out
into the graveyards

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:57.310 align:middle line:90%
and do the strangest things.

00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And I have eight
books published.

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:02.620 align:middle line:84%
Only three are on these topics
and all I get asked about

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.090 align:middle line:90%
are the spooky stuff.

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:05.560 align:middle line:90%
I have a book on Jesus.

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.920 align:middle line:84%
I got angels and so
many different things.

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People like
the spooky stuff.

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: They do.

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:12.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they believe it?

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: They do, but they
like to have that something

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:19.270 align:middle line:84%
to prove to them there's
more beyond this life.

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Because people question
if they even have a soul.

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:26.847 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind of folks do
the entities contact generally?

00:32:26.847 --> 00:32:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: What kind of entities
do they contact, these people?

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind of people
are affected by these entities?

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: I find the people that
are talented, artistic, gifted.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Those with synesthesia,
which is only like 1% to 4%

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:44.790 align:middle line:90%
of the population.

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's an element that shows
how we are evolving actually.

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:53.430 align:middle line:84%
We have this crossing of
the senses in our brains

00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:56.610 align:middle line:84%
and this has been absolutely
scientifically proven,

00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:59.700 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes people
hear music and they

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:02.550 align:middle line:84%
see lights or something,
or colors in the air.

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's those people
that seem to be

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:07.620 align:middle line:84%
able to see between
the lines and know

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:09.180 align:middle line:90%
that something is going on.

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And shadow beings don't like
to be seen because they're not

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:17.010 align:middle line:84%
doing the job of hat man
properly if they're being seen.

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:19.920 align:middle line:84%
So they might be confrontational
and charge right at you

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.390 align:middle line:90%
if you spot them out.

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And you get marked, I feel
too, because that's absolutely

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.150 align:middle line:90%
what happened to me.

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:28.240 align:middle line:84%
I saw it following
me and my friend.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I know,
I'm seeing shadow spiders

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.580 align:middle line:90%
wherever I went.

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh.

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yeah, I know.

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:34.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Open up your
purse and there's

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:35.650 align:middle line:90%
shadow spiders in there.

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:36.608 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Oh, terrible.

00:33:36.608 --> 00:33:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have a tape
of a client of yours

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:41.140 align:middle line:84%
who talked about
how you helped them

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:43.460 align:middle line:90%
deal with these dark entities.

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:44.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:48.370 align:middle line:84%
My name is Melissa
and Heidi Hollis

00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:49.960 align:middle line:90%
changed my life completely.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Prior to finding her
research and her work,

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:56.590 align:middle line:84%
I was being attacked
almost every single night

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:58.600 align:middle line:90%
by dark entities.

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And I was searching
for the truth.

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.820 align:middle line:84%
I needed to get down
to the bottom line

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:06.520 align:middle line:84%
of what these things are
and what they were doing.

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And through her research,
I was able to find out.

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Basically, I read her
book, "The Secret War,"

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:15.070 align:middle line:84%
and it changed my
life completely.

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like it equipped
me with the spiritual weapons

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:21.920 align:middle line:84%
that I needed to fight
against whatever it was.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And I now feel
like I'm weaponized

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:25.929 align:middle line:90%
because of her research.

00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:28.199 align:middle line:84%
And so when something
does happen,

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:29.580 align:middle line:90%
I can stop it right away.

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:33.179 align:middle line:84%
And it rarely happens anymore
because like once they know,

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:39.912 align:middle line:84%
the dark forces know
that you know their game,

00:34:39.912 --> 00:34:41.370 align:middle line:84%
they aren't going
to mess with you.

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:42.170 align:middle line:90%
So I'm grateful.

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:46.270 align:middle line:84%
She changed my life and
she's like family to me now.

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:48.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
change your life, Heidi?

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yeah.

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:49.389 align:middle line:90%
Melissa--

00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:50.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did you do?

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:52.332 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: She was
actually the first person

00:34:52.332 --> 00:34:55.929 align:middle line:84%
that contacted me to let me know
that my book, "The Secret War,"

00:34:55.929 --> 00:34:57.190 align:middle line:90%
made a difference.

00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:58.330 align:middle line:90%
She read it.

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And she put up her spiritual
fists and laid down the law

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:06.400 align:middle line:84%
because she was experiencing
these at a crazy level.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.010 align:middle line:84%
The shadow people and
the hat man phenomenon.

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:11.470 align:middle line:84%
It let me know that I
was on the right track

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:13.960 align:middle line:84%
and that I was explaining
things the best way.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Because when I first
was stepping out there,

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:18.820 align:middle line:90%
people thought this was sci-fi.

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:20.020 align:middle line:90%
What are shadow people?

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:22.300 align:middle line:90%
What is this lady talking about?

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:27.800 align:middle line:84%
But I did my best to be clear
and not be shy to say, "Look,

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.950 align:middle line:84%
there's a dark source and
there's a light source.

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And they are really
battling over us.

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds again,
I keep saying cliche,

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.350 align:middle line:90%
but it is what it is."

00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:40.690 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:44.080 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed near-death
experience researchers

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.070 align:middle line:90%
and everything's love and light.

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:48.290 align:middle line:84%
It's all these
positive experiences.

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:50.793 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Yeah, but I want
to hear about the not so

00:35:50.793 --> 00:35:51.710 align:middle line:90%
positive experiences."

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:52.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You want
the dark stuff.

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yeah.

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "What
are they saying?"

00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And they had no idea
about my background.

00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:58.760 align:middle line:84%
They said, "Well,
that's interesting

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:02.600 align:middle line:84%
because they see this man in
a three-piece suit and a hat."

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.250 align:middle line:90%
I said, "I thought so."

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:07.520 align:middle line:84%
So hat man is showing up
in near-death experiences.

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:10.820 align:middle line:84%
Some of these more negative
alien beings too that

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:13.310 align:middle line:84%
infiltrate people,
they are also being

00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:15.200 align:middle line:84%
seen at the end of
people's tunnels

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:18.125 align:middle line:84%
when they're having their
near-death experiences.

00:36:18.125 --> 00:36:20.870 align:middle line:84%
Just ask around
and keep your ears

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:23.360 align:middle line:90%
peeled for the truth of it.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.000 align:middle line:84%
I could talk about this
stuff all day but not

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.135 align:middle line:84%
until you go out and
ask the right questions.

00:36:29.135 --> 00:36:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Do you know this
is a real pattern?

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:33.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On your podcast,
"Dark Becomes Light,"

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:35.280 align:middle line:90%
you deal with this a lot?

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: I do.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:39.020 align:middle line:84%
I deal with a lot of different
topics, everything from aliens

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:39.830 align:middle line:90%
to Bigfoot.

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:42.410 align:middle line:84%
But nine times out of 10,
people are contacting me

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:45.200 align:middle line:84%
about shadow people
and hat man because I

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:48.047 align:middle line:84%
started this whole
craze out there but--

00:36:48.047 --> 00:36:48.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:49.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yeah.

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.430 align:middle line:90%
It's been really rewarding.

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:55.030 align:middle line:84%
People really help others
by sharing their stories.

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:57.070 align:middle line:90%
And I welcome people to.

00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:59.590 align:middle line:84%
The more details the better
because it's in the details

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:01.180 align:middle line:90%
that we see the patterns.

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:04.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't have all the
answers and we're all

00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:05.170 align:middle line:90%
learning together, right?

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:07.630 align:middle line:84%
If anybody says they have
all the answers, run.

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:08.560 align:middle line:90%
That's what I tell.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And feet
don't fail me now.

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Right, exactly.

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:11.992 align:middle line:90%
So keep humble.

00:37:11.992 --> 00:37:13.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What advice
would you give

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:18.098 align:middle line:84%
people who are being
harassed by these entities?

00:37:18.098 --> 00:37:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: I tell people
to go through their homes

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:24.430 align:middle line:84%
and methodically bless
their home, their space,

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:27.580 align:middle line:84%
and to keep it with them no
matter where they're going.

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:32.120 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like you're
a target, always a target.

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.660 align:middle line:90%
And it needs to be corrected.

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:36.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are we winning?

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Oh.

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:39.970 align:middle line:84%
Right now, it's looking
rough, I have to say.

00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, gosh.

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: But that's why I'm
up against the wall sometimes,

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:46.290 align:middle line:90%
and what it is that I'm doing.

00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:48.720 align:middle line:84%
Putting word out
there a certain way.

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:50.310 align:middle line:84%
People are putting
word out there

00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:54.600 align:middle line:84%
hoping to make a buck or
something, or get a TV show.

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:57.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
motivates people.

00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:59.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing it trying
to help people

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:03.540 align:middle line:84%
be OK so when their time
comes, they know what to do.

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:06.120 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not just a
possibility you'll see

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.740 align:middle line:90%
these things, it's a threat.

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And they really are
on that hunt for you.

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And as times are changing
as we can all tell,

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.770 align:middle line:90%
it's getting really real.

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:19.110 align:middle line:10%
And I hope that
people will reach out

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:22.410 align:middle line:10%
to me through my
site, shadowfolks.com

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:26.340 align:middle line:10%
or heidihollis.com and tell me
what's going on because we're

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:27.690 align:middle line:10%
all paying attention.

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:31.210 align:middle line:10%
We're all trying to
do this the right way.

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do these entities know
that there's people like you

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:36.730 align:middle line:90%
out there to fight them?

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Oh gosh, yes.

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:41.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm not at liberty
to say but let's just

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:43.890 align:middle line:90%
say I was approached.

00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:46.740 align:middle line:84%
I had an appointment,
physician appointment.

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:49.860 align:middle line:84%
They knew my background
and fidgeting.

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And they go, "I need to talk
to you about something."

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And here they were having
shadow people in their home.

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And their kid woke up
with scratch marks.

00:39:01.830 --> 00:39:03.600 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "Oh no.

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Were they three
little marks scratch?"

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why do they scratch?

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: It's a
mocking of the Trinity.

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:11.760 align:middle line:84%
There are three little scratch
marks, look like a cat scratch.

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.050 align:middle line:90%
And it's just a mock.

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's that one person
that they're marking.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.880 align:middle line:90%
That's who they're going for.

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If somebody wakes up
in the morning with scratches

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:26.340 align:middle line:84%
and has no recollection of what
happened, what do you suggest?

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:28.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: I tell people
there's something in their home

00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:31.500 align:middle line:90%
that they need to clear out.

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.980 align:middle line:84%
That it has to be done and
dealt with because otherwise,

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:36.480 align:middle line:90%
it's going to progress.

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:39.910 align:middle line:90%
And the goal is to possess.

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:42.040 align:middle line:84%
It really is to
possess and to own.

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:44.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it to kill?

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.380 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: I think they can.

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:45.940 align:middle line:90%
I think they can.

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:48.273 align:middle line:84%
Those people don't get back
to me that have been killed.

00:39:48.273 --> 00:39:50.080 align:middle line:84%
But there's been a
lot of people who

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:53.260 align:middle line:84%
felt like they were about to die
when they had their soul ripped

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:55.460 align:middle line:90%
out of their bodies.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:58.780 align:middle line:84%
They have had a really
hard time getting back

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:00.530 align:middle line:90%
after hat man did such a thing.

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:01.360 align:middle line:90%
And when--

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:03.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were these
entities once human?

00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Not those.

00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:05.560 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Neither one of them?

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:06.760 align:middle line:90%
Shadow people.

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Shadow people.

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:08.135 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hat man.

00:40:08.135 --> 00:40:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Hat man.

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Never human.

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: They're
not even from here.

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:11.220 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:13.600 align:middle line:84%
But they possess and they
take the form of others.

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, one of the
things that hat man is doing

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:18.340 align:middle line:90%
is recruiting.

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:21.430 align:middle line:84%
So people tell me, "My
hat man had dreadlocks.

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:24.310 align:middle line:84%
My hat man was freckled
with red hair."

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:25.900 align:middle line:84%
I was like, "That's
not hat man."

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:27.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who were
they recruiting?

00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:28.900 align:middle line:90%
Humans?

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:29.890 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yeah.

00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:30.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh boy.

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:32.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: Essentially,
building an army.

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
just what we need.

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Oh.

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:35.980 align:middle line:90%
It's so bad.

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And when they write
me to say, "Look.

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Hat man showed me
how to reap souls."

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:43.300 align:middle line:90%
I was like, "Oh no."

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:46.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's just horrific.

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:47.740 align:middle line:90%
So bad.

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:50.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
happy for the future?

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: I am because--

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're not concerned?

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: Guess
what's on the rise?

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:56.050 align:middle line:90%
Jesus encounters.

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:57.920 align:middle line:90%
Sightings of angels as well.

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:01.280 align:middle line:84%
So is this the battle
of all battles going on?

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:02.280 align:middle line:90%
I think that--

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The angelic sightings
offset the other ones?

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: I think so.

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:06.880 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:07.760 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.430 align:middle line:84%
I wish I got more
of those but there's

00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:11.290 align:middle line:84%
a lot of books being
written and a lot

00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:15.940 align:middle line:84%
of talk about these encounters,
and definitely, a balance.

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And well, we know who
wins in the end, right?

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:20.860 align:middle line:90%
It's always the good guy.

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:23.403 align:middle line:84%
And there's a new book
I'm working on right now

00:41:23.403 --> 00:41:24.820 align:middle line:84%
that's going to
talk more on that.

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You let us
know when it's done.

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:26.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Oh, yeah.

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:28.300 align:middle line:84%
It's getting
interesting, George.

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:30.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your podcast, you
can hear on the iHeart Radio

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:31.530 align:middle line:90%
Network?

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: Yes, "Dark Becomes
Light" on Coast to Coast.

00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:35.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:39.530 align:middle line:84%
The Podcast Network, it's going
great and I love doing it.

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:41.200 align:middle line:90%
It's so rewarding.

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And the people need
to have that shoulder

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:47.470 align:middle line:84%
to lean on and just say,
"Hey, this is what I'm seeing.

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:48.820 align:middle line:90%
This is what I'm experiencing."

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And try to go
through those steps

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:56.260 align:middle line:84%
because they sometimes want
to know why it started.

00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:58.780 align:middle line:84%
I moved into this
home, I renovated it.

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There may
never be a why.

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLLIS: Yeah.

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:02.030 align:middle line:90%
It's not important.

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:02.830 align:middle line:90%
It's like, so what?

00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:03.850 align:middle line:90%
Their time is up.

00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes these people
get crazy nightmares

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:08.800 align:middle line:84%
like the physician
I was talking about.

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.840 align:middle line:84%
Crazy nightmares just
before I'm walking in

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:13.550 align:middle line:84%
because they knew they were
going to talk to me about it.

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And they never had
nightmares like this before.

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:19.420 align:middle line:10%
So these things
know when somebody

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:21.760 align:middle line:10%
is going to come and touch
with me or something.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And I take it as a
compliment, to be honest.

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.560 align:middle line:84%
If hat man's coming
every night to somebody,

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:30.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, "Wow, who are you
that they're working so hard?"

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:31.060 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:32.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Heidi, Thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: Thank you
so much, George.

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:34.995 align:middle line:90%
This is a pleasure.

00:42:34.995 --> 00:42:36.370 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's
great to know we've

00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:39.730 align:middle line:10%
got people like Heidi
Hollis out there to battle

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:44.690 align:middle line:10%
evil like the shadow people and
the hat man, and protect us.

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:46.960 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
