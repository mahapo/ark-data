00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:21.210 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well, we've
all driven down highways,

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.980 align:middle line:10%
but what about the UFO highway?

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Our guest on "Beyond
Belief" is Anthony Sanchez,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.640 align:middle line:84%
who heads up an organization
called Umbra Research, which

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.060 align:middle line:84%
is telling us about emerging
technologies with UFOs.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Anthony, I'm glad
you do what you do.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY SANCHEZ:
Thank you, George.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Good to have
you on the program.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: It's an
honor to be here.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You are a
technologist by trade.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has this
affected your career?

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.690 align:middle line:84%
Or have you devoted it
now full-time to ufology?

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.630 align:middle line:10%
>>SANCHEZ: You know,
I have over 20 years

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.270 align:middle line:10%
working in Silicon Valley.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.230 align:middle line:10%
I have a degree in computer
information systems

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.330 align:middle line:10%
with an emphasis in software
development, software

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.380 align:middle line:10%
engineering.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'm one of those people that
was on the fast track at, like,

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.340 align:middle line:90%
major semiconductor companies.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.990 align:middle line:84%
But I've worked in some
pretty important capacities--

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.180 align:middle line:84%
business intelligence, data
analysis, software engineering.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.770 align:middle line:90%
Has it affected my career?

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.750 align:middle line:90%
You'd be surprised.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.720 align:middle line:10%
There are a lot of nerds and
a lot of geeks like myself

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.710 align:middle line:10%
who are not afraid of the
ufological discussion.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.680 align:middle line:90%
So not really.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.380 align:middle line:84%
When you get into executive
and management levels,

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.320 align:middle line:84%
they tend to not want to
be distracted with people's

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.559 align:middle line:90%
personal interests.

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What got you to
write "The UFO Highway"?

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.558 align:middle line:10%
And tell us about that.

00:01:35.558 --> 00:01:37.980 align:middle line:10%
>>SANCHEZ: Well, my personal
experiences, number one.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.020 align:middle line:10%
Initially the book was
called "UFO Highway"

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.800 align:middle line:10%
because I was
focused on Area 51,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.200 align:middle line:10%
the extraterrestrial highway.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.380 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't want to
exactly call it that.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.490 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted it to have a play
on words, maybe metaphorical.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And from 2007 to 2009,
my focus was Area 51.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.010 align:middle line:84%
However, in 2010 is when
I met this individual who

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.760 align:middle line:84%
claims to have been
working at a facility

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.990 align:middle line:84%
underground in northern New
Mexico alongside Gray aliens.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.150 align:middle line:90%
Pretty controversial.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: There were already
two stories out in the public

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.590 align:middle line:90%
that were very well-known.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.510 align:middle line:84%
You had Ann Richards
with Captain Richards.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And then you had Ann West,
Shirley Hinkle with John Lear

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.130 align:middle line:84%
and this whole Tom
Costello story.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.830 align:middle line:90%
I was afraid to get into that.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:31.800 align:middle line:90%
I had already been--

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.175 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you mean afraid?

00:02:33.175 --> 00:02:34.020 align:middle line:90%
Afraid of what?

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Because there's
this reptilian aspect to it.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.680 align:middle line:84%
There's this Gray
alien aspect to it.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.000 align:middle line:10%
There's military-industrial
complex involvement.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.895 align:middle line:10%
It's a very involved
story that has emerged out

00:02:45.895 --> 00:02:47.260 align:middle line:10%
of northern New Mexico.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And it has come under
lots of scrutiny.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And me trying to find
answers with regards

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.370 align:middle line:84%
to reverse-engineered alien
technology, do aliens exist?

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.580 align:middle line:84%
What did I experience
as a child?

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.470 align:middle line:84%
I did not know if delving
into the Dulce lore

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.950 align:middle line:84%
was going to distract me,
number one, and number two,

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.030 align:middle line:90%
cause more pain.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.340 align:middle line:84%
You're almost
constantly suffering

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.681 align:middle line:84%
under the eye of the
audience that is trying to--

00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:25.180 align:middle line:84%
they're also trying
to seek answers.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.138 align:middle line:84%
They're also trying to
find the individuals who

00:03:27.138 --> 00:03:28.060 align:middle line:90%
can provide answers.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.866 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure, constantly.

00:03:29.866 --> 00:03:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Dulce is
very controversial.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.300 align:middle line:84%
So I was worried about
delving into that.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There have been cases
that have been remarkable,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.680 align:middle line:90%
UFO cases that are frightening.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.340 align:middle line:84%
In your experience,
are we in any danger

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.140 align:middle line:90%
with these visitations?

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: When people
ask me about scenarios

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:58.170 align:middle line:84%
that paint a dangerous
picture, I focus in on actions

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.610 align:middle line:84%
by major governments, major
players around the globe.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And is there some sort
of an alien component?

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.490 align:middle line:90%
For instance, look at China.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.050 align:middle line:84%
China just built the FAST,
which is the 500-meter Aperture

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.230 align:middle line:90%
Spherical Telescope.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.590 align:middle line:84%
It's this massive-- essentially,
take Arecibo in Puerto Rico

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.390 align:middle line:90%
and just--

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Times 10, right?

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.656 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ:
Ginormousize it, right.

00:04:20.656 --> 00:04:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, why didn't China just
rent time with Arecibo

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.250 align:middle line:84%
like everybody else
around the globe does,

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.010 align:middle line:84%
all these other scientific
endeavors that take

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.740 align:middle line:84%
place using the
regular telescope?

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, from 2014 to 2016, they
constructed this monstrosity.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And nobody other than
Chinese scientists

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.210 align:middle line:90%
get to use this facility.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And when you think about
it, it's an antenna.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.240 align:middle line:84%
So I don't believe
that they're using it

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.739 align:middle line:84%
solely for listening from
radio waves from outer space.

00:04:52.739 --> 00:04:54.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe they're sending.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.696 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: I believe
they're sending out

00:04:55.696 --> 00:04:58.020 align:middle line:84%
to a specific set
of coordinates,

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.040 align:middle line:90%
and they are communicating.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.190 align:middle line:10%
>>SANCHEZ: Also,
way back in 2010,

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.460 align:middle line:10%
I went on the late Jerry
Pippin's radio show--

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.880 align:middle line:10%
he's since passed away--

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.350 align:middle line:10%
and Mel Fabregas's
radio show, "Veritas."

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.290 align:middle line:10%
And I spoke very--

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.952 align:middle line:10%
I was very vocal, very
public, about information

00:05:14.952 --> 00:05:17.160 align:middle line:10%
that I had received from
one of my government sources

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.050 align:middle line:10%
who told me that emanating
from beneath the Chengdu

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.300 align:middle line:10%
area of China, the
Chengdu district,

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.820 align:middle line:10%
was a massive
underground complex that

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.306 align:middle line:10%
extended beyond 3,500 miles
out in all directions.

00:05:29.306 --> 00:05:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
a city, right?

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.600 align:middle line:84%
But specifically
down to the coastline

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.430 align:middle line:90%
of the South China Sea.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.780 align:middle line:10%
Now, not just a year later,
Georgetown University's

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.240 align:middle line:10%
professor Phillip A. Karber and
his Asian arms control study--

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.090 align:middle line:10%
this is where he has
a bunch of students

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.010 align:middle line:10%
helping conduct a study.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.590 align:middle line:84%
They released the
information that prompted

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.030 align:middle line:90%
a congressional hearing.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, they discovered
that there were 3,000 miles

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:59.930 align:middle line:90%
of underground facilities.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
they doing, however?

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:07.340 align:middle line:84%
So the Georgetown study said
that these underground tunnels,

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.930 align:middle line:84%
essentially, were solely for
the purpose of storing weapons.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.680 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's not true.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.230 align:middle line:90%
And it's not accurate.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.820 align:middle line:90%
The truth is that--

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.570 align:middle line:84%
now, this is from my
government informant.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:20.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: He says that
these are state-of-the-art

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.990 align:middle line:84%
underground facilities, living
facilities, working quarters.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And they do have storage
facilities, as well.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.490 align:middle line:84%
But they are
electronically grounded

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.910 align:middle line:90%
and magnetically shielded.

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
like bunkers to hide?

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:35.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:40.630 align:middle line:84%
Imagine, not just for Chinese
residents, but for anybody

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.190 align:middle line:84%
who can afford it-- remember
the movie "2012" with the arks?

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:43.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.980 align:middle line:84%
So this paints somewhat
of a similar scenario

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.280 align:middle line:84%
where if there is some
sort of impending doom,

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.280 align:middle line:90%
some doomsday scenario--

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.857 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Asteroid coming
this way, some calamity.

00:06:53.857 --> 00:06:54.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Something, mhm.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:55.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:56.680 align:middle line:90%
You can buy your way in.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.330 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm being told.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, interestingly
enough, Phillip A. Karber

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.360 align:middle line:90%
was also a Pentagon specialist.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.000 align:middle line:84%
So there's a tie with the
Pentagon, the military.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And then again,
this study prompted

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:10.300 align:middle line:90%
a congressional hearing.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "UFO Highway"
tied into Area 51.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.690 align:middle line:84%
Bob Lazar, of course,
tied into Area 51.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.900 align:middle line:84%
He worked there, claims
that he witnessed

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.826 align:middle line:84%
incredible data of
an alien autopsy.

00:07:23.826 --> 00:07:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BOB LAZAR: This was
totally unrelated to anything

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.030 align:middle line:90%
I was doing.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.340 align:middle line:84%
But from that
photograph, it looked

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.380 align:middle line:84%
like what you see in UFO
lore as the typical Gray.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.150 align:middle line:84%
So how tall it was,
from what I could see,

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:37.664 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't tell
because I only saw

00:07:37.664 --> 00:07:38.830 align:middle line:90%
a portion of the photograph.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.480 align:middle line:84%
But if everything else
you see is correct,

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.220 align:middle line:84%
I would imagine it was 3
and 1/2 or 4 feet tall.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:50.010 align:middle line:84%
But there again, all I had
to see was a photograph.

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:54.960 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't have much to go on.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:59.970 align:middle line:84%
Allegedly this interaction
has occurred since man

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:01.980 align:middle line:90%
was a simian creature.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:05.799 align:middle line:84%
And there were genetic
alterations made.

00:08:05.799 --> 00:08:07.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Anthony, what do
you think of Bob Lazar?

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And what do you think
of what he says?

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.895 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: He's
absolutely right.

00:08:09.895 --> 00:08:11.130 align:middle line:90%
He's absolutely right.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:15.890 align:middle line:84%
This is a man whose
entire academic past

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:17.420 align:middle line:90%
has been wiped clean.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Strangely enough,
though, Bob Lazar

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:25.610 align:middle line:84%
has managed to continue working
in a scientific capacity

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:26.820 align:middle line:90%
for the government.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of
strange when you think

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.980 align:middle line:84%
about that whole scenario,
that first they tried

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.799 align:middle line:90%
to discredit him, but later--

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:35.049 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They need more than--

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:35.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: They need him more.

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
some of the things

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.390 align:middle line:84%
that he puts forth
through his company,

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:43.559 align:middle line:90%
it's pretty cutting-edge stuff.

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And some people would
say it's very advanced.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your opinion,
and based on research,

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.640 align:middle line:84%
are the extraterrestrials,
are the Grays,

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.720 align:middle line:84%
providing our military any kind
of information and knowledge?

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Oh, absolutely.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:58.660 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have the
Hyperion example,

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.400 align:middle line:84%
which proved that the
micronuclear technology

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.410 align:middle line:84%
or reactor technology
that emerge out

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:09.450 align:middle line:84%
of Los Alamos, New Mexico
came directly from Grays.

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are some of these
other technologies that they

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:13.184 align:middle line:90%
may have given us?

00:09:13.184 --> 00:09:14.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Computing
technologies.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.580 align:middle line:10%
Look at Phil Corso, right?

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: If you look at the
technology that was leaked out

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:26.850 align:middle line:84%
into the private sector over
the course of 30 to 40 years,

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:28.559 align:middle line:90%
we saw an advancement in--

00:09:28.559 --> 00:09:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Silicon chips
and everything else.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:31.724 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ:
--integrated circuitry

00:09:31.724 --> 00:09:33.620 align:middle line:84%
that was not supposed
to happen that fast.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Moore's law states
that every 18 months,

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:39.890 align:middle line:84%
we see a doubling in
speed, processing speeds.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:43.070 align:middle line:84%
So as a technologist
looking at it,

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:47.210 align:middle line:84%
I can see that there's some
sort of a pattern that emerges.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Computing processing
technologies

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.760 align:middle line:90%
seem to leap forwards.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.660 align:middle line:84%
But other areas, we seem to
be stagnated, to some extent.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Anthony, history has
shown us that if you give,

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:01.070 align:middle line:90%
you receive.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:02.900 align:middle line:84%
What are the ETs
getting back from us?

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.733 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: They're
getting natural resources

00:10:04.733 --> 00:10:06.360 align:middle line:90%
and cooperation.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.300 align:middle line:84%
They're managing to
sustain their existence

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:16.010 align:middle line:84%
in a much more easier means,
being facilitated by us.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:21.050 align:middle line:84%
But with regards to the Gray
aliens that Bob was describing,

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.720 align:middle line:90%
he's absolutely right.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:28.550 align:middle line:84%
The gentleman that I interviewed
claims that they discovered

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:32.990 align:middle line:84%
metallic sheets that had
this Akkadian-type cuneiform,

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:35.730 align:middle line:84%
which is a writing system
that dates all the way back--

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's what the
Sumerians did, right?

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:38.501 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Right, to
the ancient Sumerians.

00:10:38.501 --> 00:10:40.880 align:middle line:10%
So we're talking about
the cradle of civilization

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:45.080 align:middle line:10%
between the Euphrates and the
Tigris Rivers, modern-day Iraq,

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.010 align:middle line:10%
very well-known.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:48.410 align:middle line:90%
And that ties into the Annunaki.

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:52.345 align:middle line:84%
So based on some of the cylinder
seals and some of the writings

00:10:52.345 --> 00:10:56.110 align:middle line:84%
that are still in academia
today, in some museums,

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:58.880 align:middle line:84%
like in Cincinnati
and in Germany,

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.470 align:middle line:90%
we know about the Igigi.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:01.940 align:middle line:90%
And who are the Igigi?

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:06.740 align:middle line:10%
Well the Igigi are a created
being by the Annunaki

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.160 align:middle line:10%
that are essentially seen as
a demigod by the human race.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.880 align:middle line:84%
The Igigi, being the
Grays, are prolific

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.940 align:middle line:90%
throughout our history.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the
history of ufology

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:22.550 align:middle line:84%
because we hear stories
of Grays since Roswell,

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:23.900 align:middle line:90%
since who knows when?

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Up to this very day.

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.130 align:middle line:84%
Last year, I spoke
in Dulce, New Mexico

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.710 align:middle line:84%
as a keynote speaker
alongside Linda Moulton Howe.

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And it was the first time
that the Jicarilla Apache

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:37.540 align:middle line:90%
had come forth with this--

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.280 align:middle line:84%
almost with, like, this
permission from the tribe

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.405 align:middle line:84%
to be truthful and
honest and share.

00:11:43.405 --> 00:11:44.530 align:middle line:90%
It was the year of sharing.

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they described
alien Grays, as well.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:46.985 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Oh, my goodness.

00:11:46.985 --> 00:11:49.460 align:middle line:10%
George, for the first time
ever-- now, keep in mind,

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:53.030 align:middle line:10%
I've been going to Dulce,
New Mexico since 2011.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And this is the first
time where in public, they

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:01.640 align:middle line:84%
have talked about things like
engagement, where they've

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:06.410 align:middle line:84%
been paralyzed, forms of sleep
paralysis surrounded by Grays,

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:08.630 align:middle line:84%
familial connections,
people getting

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:11.074 align:middle line:84%
certain types of cancers, being
cured from these cancers--

00:12:11.074 --> 00:12:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By the Grays.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:13.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: --by the Grays.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:16.370 align:middle line:90%
Not to mention traffic.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:20.120 align:middle line:84%
They hear traffic
beneath their homes,

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.900 align:middle line:84%
like traffic-traffic,
like cars and trucks.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:24.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like underneath?

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Underneath
their homes late

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:28.760 align:middle line:90%
in early morning hours.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.310 align:middle line:84%
This is in the township
of Dulce, New Mexico.

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:34.460 align:middle line:10%
We have reports of
black helicopters

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:39.740 align:middle line:10%
all over the place shortly
after UFO sightings.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.250 align:middle line:90%
This is very commonplace.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:44.120 align:middle line:84%
I have one family in particular
who I'm good friends with.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:47.060 align:middle line:84%
She is an 11-year police
officer, a veteran police

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:49.670 align:middle line:84%
officer, of the Jicarilla
Apache Police Department.

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And her grandfather
is the president

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:53.570 align:middle line:90%
of the tribal council.

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:58.880 align:middle line:84%
She has sent me photographs of
UFOs and of black helicopters.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, this
is an area, Anthony,

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.995 align:middle line:90%
that is loaded with UFO cases.

00:13:02.995 --> 00:13:06.600 align:middle line:90%


00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MEGAN CRUZ: Dulce is
a quiet, unassuming town

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:11.300 align:middle line:90%
nestled in northern New Mexico.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.250 align:middle line:10%
Many of its residents are
members of the Jicarilla Apache

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:15.050 align:middle line:10%
tribe.

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:16.040 align:middle line:10%
They swear--

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.845 align:middle line:10%
>>GERI JULIAN: I tell stories,
but my nose isn't growing.

00:13:18.845 --> 00:13:21.590 align:middle line:10%


00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:23.570 align:middle line:10%
>>MEGAN CRUZ: --they
are not making this up.

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:28.550 align:middle line:10%
>>GERI JULIAN: They threw down
a ladder from that spaceship

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:31.694 align:middle line:10%
And then two small people
started climbing down.

00:13:31.694 --> 00:13:33.110 align:middle line:10%
>>MEGAN CRUZ: Geri
Julian says she

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:35.810 align:middle line:10%
had her first
extraterrestrial encounter

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:39.080 align:middle line:10%
right here on her Dulce
ranch about 40 years ago.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.500 align:middle line:10%
>>GERI JULIAN: It was huge.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.130 align:middle line:10%
I just saw the bottom of it.

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:45.992 align:middle line:10%
It was flat like this.

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:47.450 align:middle line:10%
>>MEGAN CRUZ: Many
of her neighbors

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:49.850 align:middle line:10%
claim similar strange sightings.

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:53.000 align:middle line:10%
>>MAN: Fat in the middle and
kind of rounded on the sides.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.920 align:middle line:10%
You're speechless, you know?

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:59.360 align:middle line:10%
You just don't
know what to think.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.885 align:middle line:10%
It's like nothing you've
ever encountered before.

00:14:01.885 --> 00:14:04.710 align:middle line:10%
>>MEGAN CRUZ: Why are stories
of the extraordinary ordinary

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:05.510 align:middle line:10%
here?

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:07.070 align:middle line:10%
>>WOMAN: I do not know.

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:08.570 align:middle line:10%
I do not know.

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:12.332 align:middle line:10%
Probably on account of that
mountain we have right there.

00:14:12.332 --> 00:14:13.790 align:middle line:10%
>>MEGAN CRUZ: Rumor
has it there is

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:17.390 align:middle line:10%
a secret base hidden underneath
the Archuleta Mesa here.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.220 align:middle line:10%
The mountain overlooks Dulce.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.110 align:middle line:10%
Some people in town
say the base is

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:24.230 align:middle line:10%
run by aliens working with
our federal government

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:27.800 align:middle line:10%
to conduct mind control
and genetic experiments.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.940 align:middle line:84%
That backs up everything
you've been saying, Anthony.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.220 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
compelling stories

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.430 align:middle line:84%
to have ever come out of
Dulce happened in 2012.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.740 align:middle line:10%
I went to Taos,
New Mexico to speak

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:41.590 align:middle line:10%
for Janet Sailor's ASPE
organization, met up

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:44.500 align:middle line:10%
with Edmund Gomez, who's part
of the ranching family who

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:49.577 align:middle line:10%
experienced many cattle
mutilations, ultimately forcing

00:14:49.577 --> 00:14:51.160 align:middle line:10%
his family out of
the cattle business.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.070 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't sustain
the costs involved

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:55.630 align:middle line:90%
with losing so many cattle.

00:14:55.630 --> 00:15:01.120 align:middle line:84%
That year, I met with a former
police officer of the Jicarilla

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Apache Police Department who
is now a high-ranking official

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.840 align:middle line:90%
of a neighboring community.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.589 align:middle line:84%
I can't give his
information publicly.

00:15:09.589 --> 00:15:10.630 align:middle line:90%
But I can tell you this--

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, give us
a little bit, Anthony.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.019 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Well,
Rick [? Pristell ?]

00:15:14.019 --> 00:15:15.700 align:middle line:84%
from the Sacramento
MUFON organization

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:19.120 align:middle line:84%
was there to witness this
event, as was Janet Sailor.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.160 align:middle line:84%
His two adult sons,
this individual--

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.620 align:middle line:84%
I will say this, he is a chief
of police in a neighboring

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:25.420 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.820 align:middle line:90%
But I cannot say which one.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And he is considering
running for office.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:35.380 align:middle line:84%
He gave us 19 separate
accounts of what he called

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:40.450 align:middle line:84%
escaped experiments from the
Dulce area, what he called

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:42.550 align:middle line:90%
hybrids, cryptids.

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:43.540 align:middle line:90%
And he gave detailed--

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he's dead serious.

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:45.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Dead serious.

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:48.224 align:middle line:84%
And you're not gonna lie in
front of your adult children.

00:15:48.224 --> 00:15:50.140 align:middle line:84%
You're not gonna make
up this type of a story.

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.880 align:middle line:90%
He was very forthcoming.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And you could just
tell the genuineness

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:56.570 align:middle line:90%
coming from this man.

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:57.580 align:middle line:90%
He was sincere.

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And it was like he was
finally getting this monkey

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:02.320 align:middle line:90%
off his back.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.170 align:middle line:90%
He could share with someone.

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:04.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was
relieved of this, huh?

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:06.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: They would not
let us keep the sketches.

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:07.970 align:middle line:90%
However, I'm a very good artist.

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:09.786 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as I got back
to my hotel room, I--

00:16:09.786 --> 00:16:10.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You sketched 'em.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.851 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: I redid all of them.

00:16:11.851 --> 00:16:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And are they Grays?

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Some of
them were Gray hybrids,

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Gray-animal hybrids, very
strange winged creatures.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:25.810 align:middle line:84%
But the story that he told,
which for me was the clincher,

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:27.520 align:middle line:90%
was this--

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.370 align:middle line:84%
I have received documentation
from Mel Fabregas

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:33.290 align:middle line:84%
from an estate sale
of Paul Bennewitz.

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And in these documents
were handwritten notes

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:37.700 align:middle line:90%
from Paul Bennewitz.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.920 align:middle line:84%
I want to get to
something in a moment.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:43.040 align:middle line:84%
But the story that this
chief of police gave to me

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.290 align:middle line:84%
was that, while he was a
police officer in Dulce,

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:47.930 align:middle line:84%
New Mexico, him and
his partner one evening

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:54.920 align:middle line:84%
were parked beneath the huge
face of the mesa that has the--

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:59.990 align:middle line:84%
it would be the southwestern
facing columnar basalt cliff.

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:03.500 align:middle line:84%
The two of them saw
this light emerge

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.290 align:middle line:84%
from the side of
the columnar basalt.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:07.490 align:middle line:90%
And then a craft emerged.

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:11.079 align:middle line:84%
He described it as a
teardrop-shaped craft.

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:15.079 align:middle line:84%
And it had this
lavenderish-colored fluorescent

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:17.960 align:middle line:90%
lighting emanating from it.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.930 align:middle line:84%
They flashed their
floodlight onto this craft.

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:22.490 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't that far from them.

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:24.128 align:middle line:84%
And then it started
toying with them.

00:17:24.128 --> 00:17:25.919 align:middle line:84%
And he said the two of
them were terrified.

00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:27.085 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like flashing back?

00:17:27.085 --> 00:17:29.240 align:middle line:84%
Almost like "Close Encounters
of the Third Kind."

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And he said they were
terrified at that time.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And as the craft
approached, he swore

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.400 align:middle line:84%
he saw a Gray being
piloting the craft.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is where the
story gets strange.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:43.929 align:middle line:90%
Some 30 years earlier--

00:17:43.929 --> 00:17:46.220 align:middle line:84%
this guy didn't know who Paul
Bennewitz is, by the way.

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.720 align:middle line:84%
Some 30 years earlier,
in the handwritten notes,

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.350 align:middle line:84%
which I do not believe had
been made public at that time--

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:53.620 align:middle line:84%
and I still don't
think they have been,

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:57.340 align:middle line:84%
unless people had
heard it from me--

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Paul Bennewitz described seeing
a teardrop-shaped UFO with

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:05.267 align:middle line:90%
a fluorescent lighting system--

00:18:05.267 --> 00:18:06.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same thing.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.469 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Same thing.

00:18:08.469 --> 00:18:10.010 align:middle line:84%
He never knew who
Paul Bennewitz was.

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Paul Bennewitz died in
2003, I think it was.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.940 align:middle line:90%
So there's your correlation.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is it about
this area that creates

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.940 align:middle line:90%
these incredible sightings?

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Well, let's
assume for a moment

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.880 align:middle line:84%
that there is a massive
underground facility

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.260 align:middle line:90%
beneath both Mt.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.370 align:middle line:84%
Archuleta and the
Archuleta Mesa.

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:33.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: And there
are Gray aliens there.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:40.120 align:middle line:84%
If they are indeed giving us
technology, sharing technology

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:44.200 align:middle line:84%
with us, and helping us to
reverse engineer technology

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.690 align:middle line:84%
that we have from
crash retrievals--

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:49.420 align:middle line:84%
because them being far more
sophisticated technologically

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.040 align:middle line:90%
than we are--

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.600 align:middle line:84%
that would explain the
level of UFO sightings

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.400 align:middle line:90%
that we're seeing.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.355 align:middle line:84%
This could be some sort of
a testing ground, a proving

00:18:57.355 --> 00:18:57.430 align:middle line:90%
ground.

00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:59.471 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And where are
they coming from, exactly?

00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:01.720 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be an
opening somewhere.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: You know,
I have been told

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.440 align:middle line:84%
that off the
eastern slope, there

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:09.370 align:middle line:84%
is a two-story underground
security auxiliary.

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And it has some sort
of hydraulic system

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:17.870 align:middle line:84%
that elevates craft from
beneath, within the facility.

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:19.490 align:middle line:90%
And that's where it's happening.

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:23.990 align:middle line:84%
We have credible sightings,
multiple credible sightings

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:25.430 align:middle line:90%
over decades from the area.

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:28.940 align:middle line:84%
You've got to remember that
it was back in the 1950s,

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:31.970 align:middle line:84%
not far from Dulce,
there was an armada

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:36.800 align:middle line:84%
of UFOs seen over Farmington
flying towards Dulce.

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.050 align:middle line:10%
And that made the newspapers--

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:38.370 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:38.570 align:middle line:90%
That was a huge story.

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: --and
scared the living

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:41.079 align:middle line:84%
daylights out of
entire communities.

00:19:41.079 --> 00:19:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What we
don't know, Anthony,

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:46.880 align:middle line:84%
is whether these
are extraterrestrial

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.550 align:middle line:84%
or from this planet,
a higher civilization.

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:52.660 align:middle line:90%
We don't know that yet, do we?

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: There's
lots of postulation.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.930 align:middle line:84%
If you remember the video
with Bob Lazar, his belief--

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:02.810 align:middle line:84%
and this is a guy
who was there at S-4,

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:05.150 align:middle line:90%
at the S-4 facility in Area 51.

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And he saw things that not
everybody else got to see.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:11.180 align:middle line:84%
His belief is that these are
beings that have been here

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:12.900 align:middle line:90%
for a very long time.

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:16.190 align:middle line:84%
The information that we received
from Dulce from my source

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:18.770 align:middle line:84%
states that these
are Igigis that

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:22.850 align:middle line:84%
were placed there some 25,000
years ago by the Annunaki

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:27.710 align:middle line:84%
because they were seen at that
point as a competing entity

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:31.505 align:middle line:84%
and they did not need that
with regards to control over

00:20:31.505 --> 00:20:32.600 align:middle line:90%
a human population.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.119 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your opinion,
what are these things?

00:20:35.119 --> 00:20:37.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: You know, John
Lear likes to call them

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.430 align:middle line:90%
cybernetic organisms.

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think in some respects
he's very correct because I

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.260 align:middle line:90%
believe that these are Igigi.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.660 align:middle line:84%
I believed that they were
placed there by the Annunaki

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:51.710 align:middle line:84%
to die off, to
disappear, essentially.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:56.000 align:middle line:84%
But over time, using
their advanced technology,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.310 align:middle line:84%
being highly
intelligent, equally

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:01.670 align:middle line:84%
as formidable technologically
with the Annunaki

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:03.830 align:middle line:84%
and the other advanced
races here on Earth,

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:06.940 align:middle line:84%
I think that they've managed
to preserve their existence

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.230 align:middle line:84%
through becoming
cybernetic, through becoming

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:12.450 align:middle line:84%
some hybrid
biological-technological

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:13.250 align:middle line:90%
entity.

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:14.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many do
you think are here?

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: I think there
are thousands of them.

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:17.846 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
when you talk about

00:21:17.846 --> 00:21:20.630 align:middle line:84%
the military applications,
Linda Moulton Howe, of course,

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:23.720 align:middle line:84%
who hosts a series on
Gaia called "Truth Hunter"

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.030 align:middle line:84%
and of course is our
investigative reporter

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:29.240 align:middle line:84%
on "Coast to Coast
AM," she investigated

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:34.070 align:middle line:84%
the military
applications to ufology.

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA MOULTON HOWE: In 1947,
the newly-created Air Force

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:40.780 align:middle line:84%
initiated a program
to investigate

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.330 align:middle line:90%
incidents involving UFOs.

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:47.110 align:middle line:84%
The program was operated under
three different code names--

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:52.600 align:middle line:84%
Grudge, Sign, and
finally Blue Book.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.930 align:middle line:84%
The original mission of
the Air Force program

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:59.890 align:middle line:84%
was to collect and analyze all
reported sightings or incidents

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:04.090 align:middle line:84%
involving UFOs and determine
whether the information could

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:07.510 align:middle line:84%
be interpreted as having
any bearing on the security

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:09.310 align:middle line:90%
of the United States.

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Some information was
evaluated with the idea

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:15.220 align:middle line:84%
of using the gained data
to advance our own space

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:18.500 align:middle line:84%
technology and future
space programs.

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So the military
applications, Anthony,

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:24.210 align:middle line:84%
could be a huge reason why
there's this involvement.

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:26.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:30.169 align:middle line:84%
For instance, when I first
interviewed this retired United

00:22:30.169 --> 00:22:31.960 align:middle line:84%
States Air Force colonel,
one of the things

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.080 align:middle line:84%
he told me was that the
Dulce facility is powered

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.700 align:middle line:90%
by micronuclear reactors.

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:38.920 align:middle line:84%
He said it's this
50-year-old technology that

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.635 align:middle line:84%
was given to them by
these Gray aliens,

00:22:41.635 --> 00:22:48.490 align:middle line:84%
and they were helped along with
understanding it by the Grays

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:49.550 align:middle line:90%
directly.

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:53.380 align:middle line:84%
It's funny, but a year after the
book "UFO Highway" comes out,

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.240 align:middle line:84%
we learned about a
company called Hyperion.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.920 align:middle line:84%
This is information that
was given to me again

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:57.836 align:middle line:90%
by some of my sources.

00:22:57.836 --> 00:23:01.260 align:middle line:84%
They said, look into this
company called Hyperion.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And I did, and this
is what I found--

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Hyperion is based
out of Los Alamos.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:10.060 align:middle line:84%
They have four office
locations, Los Alamos

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:13.100 align:middle line:84%
being where the technology
is emerging from.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.670 align:middle line:84%
They have an office adjacent
to Denver International.

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:17.910 align:middle line:84%
They have an office
in Langley, Virginia.

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:19.829 align:middle line:84%
And then they have
an office in London,

00:23:19.829 --> 00:23:22.120 align:middle line:84%
which happens to be the
financial capital of the globe.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:23.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Big company?

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:25.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Small, powerful,
important company.

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: And
Hyperion had a website.

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:30.730 align:middle line:90%
And I looked into the website.

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:31.930 align:middle line:90%
And what did I find?

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:35.400 align:middle line:84%
I found illustrations of
the micronuclear reactor

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.336 align:middle line:90%
that they are selling.

00:23:36.336 --> 00:23:37.960 align:middle line:84%
But they don't just
sell it to anybody.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, one micronuclear
reactor that they sell

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:44.050 align:middle line:84%
could power a city like
Chicago for a decade.

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:46.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when you talk
about micro, how small?

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:48.775 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Not much
bigger than a VW bug.

00:23:48.775 --> 00:23:49.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're kidding me!

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:50.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: No.

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
had illustrations

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:54.550 align:middle line:90%
of this on their website.

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:59.060 align:middle line:84%
But they only sold to a
select group of individuals--

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:02.610 align:middle line:84%
foreign militaries and offshore
mining and drilling operations.

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:04.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would assume
our government has

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:05.680 align:middle line:90%
to approve these sales?

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: I would imagine
so because that technology

00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:11.920 align:middle line:84%
actually emerged
out of Los Alamos

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:15.400 align:middle line:84%
under the technological and
commercialization office,

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.790 align:middle line:84%
which is this group that
takes military applications

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:20.860 align:middle line:84%
and puts them out into
the private sector.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.536 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this
reverse-engineered technology?

00:24:23.536 --> 00:24:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: I think
at this point,

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:28.210 align:middle line:84%
it's safe to say that, if
initially the micronuclear

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:31.210 align:middle line:84%
reactors were alien
technology, it's

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:33.290 align:middle line:84%
now standardized
application for us.

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:35.890 align:middle line:90%
But here's what's strange--

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:38.710 align:middle line:84%
remember the Paradigm
Symposium in 2012?

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:42.430 align:middle line:84%
You were a speaker there, and
I was also a speaker there.

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Just weeks before
that symposium,

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:51.790 align:middle line:84%
we had obtained
information that Hyperion

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:53.560 align:middle line:90%
had changed their name.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.560 align:middle line:84%
They took all illustrations
of the micronuclear reactor

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.800 align:middle line:90%
technology off their website.

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And they are now concealing
what technologies

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:04.930 align:middle line:90%
it is that they're working on.

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:06.444 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:25:06.444 --> 00:25:07.360 align:middle line:90%
Somebody tell them to?

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:08.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: You have
to look at who's

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:11.930 align:middle line:90%
behind a company like Hyperion.

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:16.670 align:middle line:10%
Lady Barbara Judge was
essentially the de facto head

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:18.620 align:middle line:10%
of this company.

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.080 align:middle line:10%
And she had been knighted
by the Queen of England

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.530 align:middle line:10%
for two reasons--

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:25.430 align:middle line:10%
one, her work in
the nuclear sector,

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:28.290 align:middle line:10%
and then in the
international banking sector.

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:30.650 align:middle line:84%
This is the person that
was behind Hyperion.

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And their board of
directors at the time

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:38.510 align:middle line:84%
had some high-ranking Freemasons
and very powerful individuals.

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And again, this
information initially

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:46.680 align:middle line:84%
was given to me as part of the
disclosure by this colonel.

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:51.030 align:middle line:84%
He said the facility's powered
by this micronuclear reactor.

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And then not long after, another
source related to the colonel

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.687 align:middle line:90%
said, look into Hyperion.

00:25:55.687 --> 00:25:56.520 align:middle line:90%
There's your answer.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:57.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, does
Hyperion exist today?

00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:59.300 align:middle line:90%
And has it changed its name?

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.758 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: They've changed
their name to 4Gen Technologies.

00:26:01.758 --> 00:26:03.930 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what they do
now because they're not

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:05.010 align:middle line:10%
very forthcoming about--

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:05.880 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Private company
or publicly owned?

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.600 align:middle line:10%
>>SANCHEZ: Private company.

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:07.850 align:middle line:10%
Privately-held company.

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, this
reverse technology--

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:11.910 align:middle line:84%
and let's assume
that's what it is--

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:13.410 align:middle line:90%
how did it get to them?

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:15.030 align:middle line:90%
Who gave it to them?

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Well, according to
my sources, it's the Grays.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:22.370 align:middle line:84%
We are working with the Grays
on military applications,

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:24.680 align:middle line:90%
scientific applications.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.360 align:middle line:10%
Remember the whole
Phil Schneider story,

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.450 align:middle line:10%
where he claimed
he had been working

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:30.564 align:middle line:10%
in some sort of
geological capacity

00:26:30.564 --> 00:26:31.730 align:middle line:10%
there at the Dulce facility.

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:33.105 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The late
Phil Schneider.

00:26:33.105 --> 00:26:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Right, the
late Phil Schneider.

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Very mysterious circumstances
around his death.

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:40.375 align:middle line:90%
It was--

00:26:40.375 --> 00:26:41.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe he knew too much.

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.428 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Maybe he
knew too much, right?

00:26:43.428 --> 00:26:46.470 align:middle line:90%
So the fact is, he did.

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:48.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's why he died.

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:50.870 align:middle line:84%
He went on the lecture
circuit back in the mid '90s,

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:53.120 align:middle line:84%
started presenting
geological samples,

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:57.380 align:middle line:84%
talking about synthetics
that had been synthesized

00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:01.940 align:middle line:84%
by the Grays, given to us
for our stealth applications.

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:04.740 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't long after
that that he was done.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:07.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let me ask
you this about the Grays--

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:09.380 align:middle line:84%
why would they want
to work with us?

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:13.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm assuming their technology
is astronomically bigger

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:14.250 align:middle line:90%
than ours.

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:15.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do they
want to work with us?

00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:18.266 align:middle line:84%
What are they
getting out of this?

00:27:18.266 --> 00:27:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Because
remember, the Annunaki

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:25.190 align:middle line:84%
placed them there to go away,
to die off, essentially.

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:28.760 align:middle line:84%
So the story is-- and this
is based on the translations

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.030 align:middle line:90%
of these--

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:32.109 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cuneiforms.

00:27:32.109 --> 00:27:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Right, that
were found there in Dulce.

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And they actually had brought
in an expert from Iraq, Dr.

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:41.600 align:middle line:90%
[? Tahab-- ?]...

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.360 align:middle line:84%
I forget the pronunciation of
his name, but it's in the book.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And the translation
was very detailed.

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And it said that the
Annunaki had placed them

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:50.730 align:middle line:90%
there to die off.

00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:53.360 align:middle line:84%
So when you consider
that the Grays were dying

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:57.450 align:middle line:84%
and you consider that
our atmosphere, the sun

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:00.900 align:middle line:84%
was not conducive to
their biological makeup,

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:03.840 align:middle line:84%
they are on a quest to
essentially survive.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, according
to the colonel, we

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:11.340 align:middle line:84%
provide them with resources,
resources and cooperation.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And in return, we get
advanced technology.

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:16.510 align:middle line:90%
Humans are very intelligent.

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:19.320 align:middle line:84%
We are a highly-intelligent
species going back

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:23.790 align:middle line:84%
to the Renaissance era, prior
to that going to the Greeks

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:25.752 align:middle line:90%
and the Romans and the Chinese.

00:28:25.752 --> 00:28:27.210 align:middle line:84%
All around the
globe, we have shown

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:30.000 align:middle line:84%
that humans have had this
capacity for high levels

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.050 align:middle line:90%
of intelligence.

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:34.290 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't until
the 1940s that we

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:36.376 align:middle line:84%
saw this exponential
jump, this leap forward.

00:28:36.376 --> 00:28:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, we took off.

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:39.413 align:middle line:84%
We learned how to
manipulate the atom.

00:28:39.413 --> 00:28:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what happened then?

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:41.570 align:middle line:90%
Roswell.

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:42.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Exactly.

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:48.090 align:middle line:84%
So Roswell to me
is a telltale sign

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:51.840 align:middle line:84%
that somebody out
there recognized

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.630 align:middle line:84%
what was happening on
this planet with regards

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:58.290 align:middle line:84%
to our advancements in
developing nuclear technology

00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:01.620 align:middle line:84%
or nuclear armament,
nuclear bombs.

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And those were messages sent
out into the cosmos that piqued

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.564 align:middle line:90%
the interest of somebody.

00:29:06.564 --> 00:29:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
when we started

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:12.330 align:middle line:84%
to see this influx
of UFO activity, UFO

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:18.540 align:middle line:84%
sightings, reports of Grays
from that point forward.

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Getting back
to Linda Moulton Howe,

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:24.780 align:middle line:84%
she uncovered some documents
about former President Ronald

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:26.840 align:middle line:90%
Reagan.

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: There are sobering
surprises in the Reagan

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:33.830 align:middle line:84%
briefing as the intelligence
agents explained to President

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:40.070 align:middle line:84%
Reagan that two of the alien
types on the list of five

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:45.440 align:middle line:84%
were genetically cloned,
were hybridized by the Ebens

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:49.210 align:middle line:84%
and distributed to
other star systems.

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many different
species of ETs do you think,

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:56.370 align:middle line:84%
Anthony, might be
visiting us right now?

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:58.180 align:middle line:10%
>>SANCHEZ: I've spoken
for many groups,

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:00.810 align:middle line:10%
like MUFON, across the country.

00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And I've had personal
conversations

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:08.820 align:middle line:84%
with experts in the field of
the alien phenomena, where

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:12.540 align:middle line:84%
they cover this whole
phenomena of alien races.

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:15.635 align:middle line:84%
Now, me personally, I tend
to focus on the Grays.

00:30:15.635 --> 00:30:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But there's got
to be more than just them.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.093 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: There has to be more.

00:30:19.093 --> 00:30:21.150 align:middle line:84%
There has to be more
than one alien race.

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And I've had
conversations with Linda.

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And I've been apprised
on the existence

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.914 align:middle line:84%
of aliens that are working in
collusion with governments--

00:30:31.914 --> 00:30:34.080 align:middle line:84%
not just our government,
but the Russian government,

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.640 align:middle line:90%
the Chinese government.

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.560 align:middle line:90%
An exact number, I don't know.

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:41.070 align:middle line:84%
I have had documents
sent to me over the years

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:45.810 align:middle line:84%
since I've come forth with my
book from government agencies

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:47.100 align:middle line:90%
from abroad.

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:50.170 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why or how.

00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:53.880 align:middle line:84%
But I've been given
documents that

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.956 align:middle line:84%
describe aliens that
are working in collusion

00:30:55.956 --> 00:30:57.080 align:middle line:90%
with their own governments.

00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:59.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Reptilians?

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: This
notion of reptilians,

00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:04.260 align:middle line:84%
it's something that I used
to not take seriously.

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:08.340 align:middle line:84%
But over time, as I've
conducted research,

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:11.190 align:middle line:84%
I've looked at the
history of our planet.

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:12.690 align:middle line:90%
You have to consider this--

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:16.870 align:middle line:84%
beginning with the Pliocene,
477 million years ago,

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:19.950 align:middle line:84%
all the way to the
Cretaceous Period,

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:22.590 align:middle line:84%
there have been five
major mass extinction

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:25.020 align:middle line:90%
events on our planet.

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they think
a sixth is on the way.

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:28.753 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: That it's
already underway.

00:31:28.753 --> 00:31:30.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: If you look
at humanity on the blip--

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:34.512 align:middle line:84%
we're just a blip
on the timeline

00:31:34.512 --> 00:31:35.720 align:middle line:90%
of the history of the planet.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:37.020 align:middle line:90%
Where at the very end.

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And our existence
is really nothing

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:46.020 align:middle line:84%
in comparison to everything
that has existed prior to us.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:51.070 align:middle line:84%
So I truly believe
that between each

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:54.640 align:middle line:84%
and every one of those
extinction events, some of them

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.660 align:middle line:90%
lasting for 100 million--

00:31:56.660 --> 00:32:00.880 align:middle line:84%
so we had 470 million years
ago, then 375 million years ago,

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.600 align:middle line:90%
250 million years ago.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And then we had one
66 million years ago.

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:09.460 align:middle line:84%
There has to have been other
species that evolved here

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:13.240 align:middle line:84%
that developed high levels
of intelligence, technology,

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:19.600 align:middle line:84%
whose signs have disappeared
with these cataclysms.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And these
are earthbound.

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:22.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Earthbound, right.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.120 align:middle line:84%
So I think that it's
possible that maybe

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:28.870 align:middle line:84%
during one of the
dinosaur periods,

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:31.030 align:middle line:84%
there could have been a
highly-intelligent reptoid

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:33.440 align:middle line:90%
species that evolved.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And there could be remnants
of them to this day.

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:40.870 align:middle line:84%
They could have developed
advanced technology that we

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:42.250 align:middle line:90%
just cannot comprehend.

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:43.460 align:middle line:90%
And they are still here.

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:45.970 align:middle line:10%
Look at David Icke and so
many other people that talk

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:48.400 align:middle line:10%
on the existence of reptilians.

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.170 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
most compelling things,

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:57.070 align:middle line:84%
I think, with regards to the
existence of reptilians, Grays,

00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:59.590 align:middle line:90%
and other alien species.

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, there is a
theory that the reptilians

00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:07.480 align:middle line:84%
were animals that survived
some of these cataclysms

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:08.800 align:middle line:90%
and evolved.

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And over the millions and
millions of years of evolution,

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:14.410 align:middle line:90%
they walked upright.

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:16.210 align:middle line:90%
Their brains developed.

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And they became very
sophisticated creatures

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:23.590 align:middle line:84%
with high technology, that
they're earthbound, not

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:25.200 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrials.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.640 align:middle line:84%
But they're clearly
from this planet.

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:30.610 align:middle line:84%
They were dinosaurs
that literally evolved

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:33.212 align:middle line:90%
into modern-thinking creatures.

00:33:33.212 --> 00:33:34.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: I'd buy into that.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:38.240 align:middle line:84%
I could buy into that
because when you couple that

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.040 align:middle line:84%
with the five mass
extinction events

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:43.980 align:middle line:84%
in the age of our planet,
which is 4 billion years old,

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:47.120 align:middle line:84%
with the first mass extinction
event happening almost 500

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:51.110 align:middle line:84%
million years ago,
it is not impossible

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:53.660 align:middle line:84%
that another species could
have emerged on this planet.

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Survived
and kept going.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's very
possible, indeed.

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:02.390 align:middle line:84%
I, for some reason, though,
love the possibilities

00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:05.470 align:middle line:84%
that ETs are not
from this planet,

00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:09.110 align:middle line:84%
that these extraterrestrials
are indeed coming

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:11.960 align:middle line:90%
from other planetary systems.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.239 align:middle line:84%
I don't even like the
dimensional theory.

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:16.580 align:middle line:90%
I want something solid.

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:19.790 align:middle line:84%
I want to believe that we're
not alone in this universe.

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:26.929 align:middle line:84%
And so my whole belief
system and investigations

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:28.790 align:middle line:84%
have led me to
conclude that there

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:32.719 align:middle line:84%
are thousands and
thousands of planets that

00:34:32.719 --> 00:34:36.420 align:middle line:84%
have intelligent creatures
roaming on the planet,

00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:40.760 align:middle line:84%
and that they may have developed
propulsion systems to get here.

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:43.159 align:middle line:84%
They have learned how
to bend space and time.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:44.730 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Well,
as you know, we're

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:51.620 align:middle line:84%
discovering Earthlike
systems all the time now.

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's not beyond possibility
that that is the case.

00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:58.099 align:middle line:90%
I am in agreement with you.

00:34:58.099 --> 00:34:59.640 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there
was a progenitor

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:04.290 align:middle line:84%
race that came to this
planet that essentially--

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:06.060 align:middle line:90%
we know them as the Annunaki.

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:10.261 align:middle line:84%
And the Annunaki have been
here for a very long time.

00:35:10.261 --> 00:35:12.510 align:middle line:84%
If you just look at some of
the ancient writings, some

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:16.110 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient scrolls
that have emerged

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:21.720 align:middle line:84%
from the cradle of civilization,
that whole area in the Middle

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:24.930 align:middle line:84%
East, we see things
like the Sumerian list

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:26.340 align:middle line:90%
of kings and gods.

00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And they talk
about entities that

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:31.230 align:middle line:84%
have been in existence
going as far back

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:33.960 align:middle line:90%
a million years with detail.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:39.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have to consider
that even the Bible has

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:43.170 align:middle line:90%
evidence of nonhuman entities.

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:45.260 align:middle line:84%
In the Bible, there's
a passage that says,

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:49.500 align:middle line:84%
"and there the women sat
and wept for Tammuz."

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.480 align:middle line:90%
Well, if you look at--

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or the Nephilim
coming down here.

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Right.

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:56.310 align:middle line:90%
In Genesis, the Nephilim--

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:59.950 align:middle line:84%
the hybrids, essentially,
between the fallen ones

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:04.020 align:middle line:90%
and human females.

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:07.590 align:middle line:84%
But Tammuz,
essentially, is actually

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:11.890 align:middle line:84%
found in that list of
Sumerian kings and demigods

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And he's listed as a demigod,
but a Sumerian demigod.

00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:18.120 align:middle line:84%
Why in the Bible
are they talking

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:21.360 align:middle line:90%
about a Sumerian demigod?

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:25.410 align:middle line:84%
That just proves the connection
back to this much, much earlier

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:29.222 align:middle line:84%
civilization, predating what we
know from the biblical sense.

00:36:29.222 --> 00:36:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
happening on this planet?

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:33.660 align:middle line:90%
Are we being visited or not?

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:35.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: We're
constantly being visited.

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And there are races among us
who are working in collusion

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.960 align:middle line:84%
with governments, with the
military-industrial complex.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.649 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
what the endgame is.

00:36:44.649 --> 00:36:45.690 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing, George.

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:48.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm still trying to find
out what the endgame is.

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.270 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people telling me I'm
on this fruitless endeavor,

00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:52.770 align:middle line:84%
that I'm never gonna
find out what--

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:53.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But you're not alone.

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:54.300 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of people
looking for these answers.

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: But I'm not alone.

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:55.550 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:57.600 align:middle line:84%
Linda, yourself,
so many people who

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:01.080 align:middle line:84%
are putting the information
out there so that we

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:05.166 align:middle line:84%
can look at it from a high-level
and try and find the details.

00:37:05.166 --> 00:37:06.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
the endgame is.

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:08.250 align:middle line:84%
But I'm still trying
to find that out.

00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:09.999 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: There is one
researcher out there

00:37:09.999 --> 00:37:12.390 align:middle line:10%
by the name of Dr.
David Jacobs who

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:16.680 align:middle line:10%
believes that these
visitations are nefarious,

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:19.890 align:middle line:10%
that they're not good, that
they're dangerous for us.

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:22.810 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:23.610 align:middle line:90%
Stephen Hawking--

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:24.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Stephen Hawking.

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:24.780 align:middle line:10%
I was just--

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:25.655 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Another one.

00:37:25.655 --> 00:37:29.010 align:middle line:10%
He says, be careful of sending
messages out into space.

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:31.525 align:middle line:90%
Don't let them know we're here.

00:37:31.525 --> 00:37:32.520 align:middle line:90%
He's concerned.

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yeah.

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.271 align:middle line:84%
And his analogy is
look what happened

00:37:34.271 --> 00:37:37.770 align:middle line:90%
to the Native Americans.

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:42.420 align:middle line:84%
When the Europeans
arrived, it wasn't

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:43.920 align:middle line:90%
good for the Native Americans.

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And we're possibly facing
that type of a scenario.

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:52.410 align:middle line:84%
I'll go back to China
with the fast radio

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:55.420 align:middle line:84%
telescope and these
underground facilities

00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:57.880 align:middle line:90%
that they're constructing.

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.450 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
their endgame is.

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:03.930 align:middle line:84%
I've had sources tell me that
they are working in collusion

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:07.120 align:middle line:90%
with an off-world entity.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:07.920 align:middle line:90%
Is it true?

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:08.720 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:11.010 align:middle line:84%
But there was the
emergence of this project

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:14.490 align:middle line:84%
called LEONID, Low-Earth Orbit
Nanosatellite Interceptor

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:15.810 align:middle line:90%
Defense.

00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:18.499 align:middle line:84%
It is nanosatellites, CubeSat
satellites that have--

00:38:18.499 --> 00:38:19.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's their technology?

00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: No,
it's our technology

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:24.060 align:middle line:84%
that we launched
into low-Earth orbit.

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's very complex.

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:27.690 align:middle line:90%
It's very involved.

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:33.720 align:middle line:84%
But it involves spacecraft,
these nanosatellites that

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:36.900 align:middle line:84%
are released by the
thousands in constellations,

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:38.640 align:middle line:90%
also known as swarms.

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And that is information that I
was very hot on the trail of.

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:45.390 align:middle line:84%
I even discovered the
congressional budgetary

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:48.720 align:middle line:84%
documentation that proved the
existence of this project.

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:49.840 align:middle line:90%
But I got a lot of flack.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:50.790 align:middle line:90%
I was getting a lot of threats.

00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up giving a
lot of that information

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:55.749 align:middle line:84%
to Linda because Linda's
not afraid, whereas I am.

00:38:55.749 --> 00:38:57.165 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're
Linda's source.

00:38:57.165 --> 00:38:58.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: I'm one
of her sources.

00:38:58.680 --> 00:38:59.744 align:middle line:90%
I'm one of her sources.

00:38:59.744 --> 00:39:00.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You admit it.

00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:02.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: I admit it.

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:05.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'll have to
ask her about that.

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:09.210 align:middle line:10%
The late Zecharia Sitchin
proposed in his theories

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:10.360 align:middle line:10%
of what you said--

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:15.670 align:middle line:10%
the Annunaki coming here,
creating humankind species

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:17.080 align:middle line:10%
as worker bees.

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:20.920 align:middle line:84%
But the Annunaki apparently
then departed the planet.

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.060 align:middle line:90%
They left.

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:24.440 align:middle line:90%
Why do they seem to come and go?

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: It wasn't so
much as coming and going

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:27.980 align:middle line:90%
as disappearing.

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:30.310 align:middle line:84%
So the Annunaki are
the progenitor race.

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And the descendants of the
Annunakis are the Austra-Albas.

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:34.870 align:middle line:90%
And who are the Austra-Albas?

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:38.590 align:middle line:84%
They are the fraction of the
1% that rule this planet, that

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:39.391 align:middle line:90%
own this planet.

00:39:39.391 --> 00:39:40.473 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're here now?

00:39:40.473 --> 00:39:41.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: They're here now.

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And they have a
genetic component

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:46.340 align:middle line:90%
that is alien in nature.

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And I go into detail in the
book about the Austra-Albas.

00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:52.690 align:middle line:84%
This is information provided
to me, again, by my source.

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:56.350 align:middle line:90%
And the evidence is everywhere.

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:58.510 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
Georgia Guidestones

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:01.390 align:middle line:84%
it is essentially the
mandate by the Austra-Albas,

00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:02.740 align:middle line:90%
the descendants of Annunaki.

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:05.520 align:middle line:84%
They want to wipe out the
majority of the population

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:06.320 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They want,
what, 500 million people?

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:08.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: 500 million.

00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Get it down to a workable,
sustainable slave population.

00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:14.710 align:middle line:84%
We live in a society
where everything

00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:17.620 align:middle line:84%
is based on the
fractionalized banking

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:20.860 align:middle line:84%
model, which essentially
leaves us in perpetual debt.

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you concerned
that we're being visited

00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:26.930 align:middle line:90%
by hostile extraterrestrials?

00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: That I am.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:28.800 align:middle line:90%
That I am.

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that humanity
can develop technology

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:37.180 align:middle line:84%
which can put us
on equal footing

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.470 align:middle line:90%
with anybody that's coming.

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:41.320 align:middle line:84%
That's what LEONID supposedly
was supposed to do.

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:43.600 align:middle line:84%
It was supposed to be
sort of like a warning

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:47.150 align:middle line:84%
system and a defensive system
against incoming hostile alien

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:47.950 align:middle line:90%
visitors.

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you think
Dulce, New Mexico

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:54.770 align:middle line:84%
might be a hotbed for where
these ETs are coming and going?

00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:58.630 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think this
is humankind there?

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Well, there are
Gray aliens there in Dulce

00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:02.290 align:middle line:90%
working with humans.

00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:06.630 align:middle line:10%
And I had a conversation with
Travis Walton back in 2013.

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:08.830 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Travis Walton,
of course, being the--

00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:10.720 align:middle line:10%
"Fire in the Sky"--

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:14.440 align:middle line:10%
is the one that apparently
was abducted with his logger

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:16.160 align:middle line:10%
friends witnessing this.

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:17.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Mhm.

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And I said to Travis, you
know, Travis, I read your book.

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's very intriguing
and very informative.

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:28.312 align:middle line:84%
And I said, and I didn't really
buy into the movie, the movie

00:41:28.312 --> 00:41:29.520 align:middle line:90%
version of what had happened.

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:30.603 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's Hollywood.

00:41:30.603 --> 00:41:31.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: It's Hollywood.

00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:34.570 align:middle line:84%
But if you read his book,
he goes into this detailed

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:38.710 align:middle line:84%
description of how Gray aliens
alongside human or humanoid

00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:41.020 align:middle line:84%
entities--
human-looking entities--

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:44.770 align:middle line:84%
were who he ended up with
inside of this massive facility

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:45.810 align:middle line:90%
inside of a mountain.

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:47.095 align:middle line:90%
That's Dulce.

00:41:47.095 --> 00:41:48.020 align:middle line:90%
Dulce--

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's the spot.

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:49.945 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: That's the spot.

00:41:49.945 --> 00:41:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And I've been to
Snowflake, Arizona

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:53.670 align:middle line:90%
to conduct my own research.

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at Snowflake to
Dulce, if you're talking a UFO,

00:41:57.810 --> 00:42:00.730 align:middle line:84%
it's just a skip,
hop, and a jump away.

00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:02.300 align:middle line:90%
It's right there.

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.284 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is Dulce
guarded by the military?

00:42:04.284 --> 00:42:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Yes, it is.

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:06.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.430 align:middle line:10%
>>SANCHEZ: I had a police
officer of the Jicarilla Apache

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:10.660 align:middle line:10%
who's now a guide--

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:12.880 align:middle line:10%
he's a hunter guide--

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:15.850 align:middle line:10%
tell me about two
Phoenix Suns basketball

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:18.010 align:middle line:10%
players who were on a
hunting trip there in Dulce.

00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:21.150 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever been to Dulce,
there are elk everywhere.

00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:22.150 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's incredible.

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:24.245 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: And so
a lot of people

00:42:24.245 --> 00:42:26.160 align:middle line:84%
like to go on
commercial hunts there.

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:28.590 align:middle line:90%
It's a very popular destination.

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And one day, they were up
in this one secluded area

00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:35.260 align:middle line:84%
off of J-2, which is the
road leading up to the Mesa.

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And they were
conducting their hunt.

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And three to four uniformed
military personnel

00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:45.806 align:middle line:84%
approached them, fully
armed, threatening them,

00:42:45.806 --> 00:42:47.305 align:middle line:84%
telling them to
vacate the premises.

00:42:47.305 --> 00:42:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Get out, huh?

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: Get out.

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And he says that they
were black uniforms,

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:53.470 align:middle line:84%
American-style
military uniforms,

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:55.370 align:middle line:90%
but no insignia anywhere.

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And he being Jicarilla and
a former police officer,

00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:01.680 align:middle line:84%
he told 'em, you have no
right to tell me to leave.

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:04.120 align:middle line:90%
And he said it got very heated.

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:06.820 align:middle line:84%
But he realized
staying was not gonna

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:08.320 align:middle line:90%
be in their best interest.

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are there hostile ETs?

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.040 align:middle line:90%
And who are they?

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: I believe
there are hostile ETs.

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:16.390 align:middle line:84%
That's the whole purpose for
some of the defensive systems

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:20.110 align:middle line:84%
that we are developing in secret
as part of the black projects.

00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:22.010 align:middle line:90%
I don't know who they are.

00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:23.592 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do they want?

00:43:23.592 --> 00:43:24.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SANCHEZ: This planet.

00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:26.550 align:middle line:84%
I believe the planet
is already undergoing

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:29.050 align:middle line:90%
a form of terraforming.

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:32.830 align:middle line:84%
With the destruction of the
planet that you see on a daily

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:37.030 align:middle line:84%
basis from various industries,
it is accelerating at a pace

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:38.670 align:middle line:90%
that we cannot repair.

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's
not a human-made condition.

00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:44.530 align:middle line:90%
That is an alien-made condition.

00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And we are just facilitating
the terraforming for them.

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:52.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Anthony, we
are all in this field

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:54.610 align:middle line:90%
to try to get the answers.

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And some of us in
the field believe

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:59.110 align:middle line:84%
that there will be disclosure,
eventually, by government.

00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:01.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't particularly
believe that.

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:03.080 align:middle line:10%
Stephen Bassett believes it.

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:04.960 align:middle line:10%
David Wilcock believes it.

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.170 align:middle line:10%
What about Anthony Sanchez?

00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:07.420 align:middle line:10%
>>SANCHEZ: I don't believe it.

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:08.794 align:middle line:10%
I don't think that
the government

00:44:08.794 --> 00:44:13.570 align:middle line:10%
is willing to face an onslaught
from the public, that onslaught

00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:17.860 align:middle line:10%
being fear, chaos.

00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:21.124 align:middle line:10%
It's a variable that they
cannot predict at this point.

00:44:21.124 --> 00:44:22.540 align:middle line:10%
So I think disclosure
is something

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:24.123 align:middle line:10%
that's not going to
happen, especially

00:44:24.123 --> 00:44:26.402 align:middle line:10%
with respect to the government.

00:44:26.402 --> 00:44:27.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
going to happen.

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:32.295 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you concerned about
the extraterrestrial presence?

00:44:32.295 --> 00:44:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: I wouldn't
be researching it

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.070 align:middle line:90%
if I weren't concerned.

00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:35.870 align:middle line:90%
So yes.

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:36.939 align:middle line:90%
The answer is yes.

00:44:36.939 --> 00:44:39.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Anthony, thanks for
spending some time with us

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:39.480 align:middle line:90%
on "Beyond Belief."

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: Thank
you so much, George.

00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:41.240 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:44.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So the next time
you go down the UFO highway,

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:49.970 align:middle line:84%
look in the sky because they
may be looking down at you.

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:53.000 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.050 align:middle line:90%
