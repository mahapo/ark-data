00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to 'Beyond Belief."

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.843 align:middle line:10%
You know, there are
a number of topics

00:00:22.843 --> 00:00:24.320 align:middle line:10%
we deal with on
this program that

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.170 align:middle line:10%
are so compelling, so riveting.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.510 align:middle line:84%
This subject you're
going to hear today

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.030 align:middle line:84%
is probably one of the
most compelling of all.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.790 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Eben Alexander with
us, author of "Proof

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.250 align:middle line:10%
of Heaven," a neurosurgeon.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.180 align:middle line:10%
And something happened to that
neurosurgeon some time ago.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.570 align:middle line:90%
Eben, welcome to the program.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN ALEXANDER: Well,
George, thanks for having me.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.240 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be back here.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened to you?

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well
you know, it all

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.890 align:middle line:84%
started with 54
years of life working

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.110 align:middle line:84%
as an academic neurosurgeon,
thinking I understood

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.090 align:middle line:90%
brain, mind, and consciousness.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And then 4:30 in the
morning, November 10, 2008,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.180 align:middle line:84%
I suddenly became very ill
with a rapidly progressive

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.110 align:middle line:84%
gram-negative bacterial
meningoencephalitis that

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.500 align:middle line:84%
took over my brain
within a few hours,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.980 align:middle line:84%
drove me into a state of
seizures, deep into coma.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And then I was admitted
to a hospital where

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.860 align:middle line:84%
I had worked as a neurosurgeon,
and I spent seven days

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.180 align:middle line:90%
in that coma.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.080 align:middle line:84%
My doctors basically thought
I had a 10% chance of survival

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.860 align:middle line:84%
early in the week, down to
2% by the end of the week,

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.210 align:middle line:90%
with no chance of recovery.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I started
coming back to this world.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.920 align:middle line:84%
Had an extraordinary
experience that

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.270 align:middle line:84%
by all of current neuroscience
would be completely impossible

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.950 align:middle line:84%
because of the damage
to the human part

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.810 align:middle line:90%
of my brain, my neocortex.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:45.950 align:middle line:90%
And yet, it did happen.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And that has been the
basis of this mystery

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.232 align:middle line:84%
I've been trying to unravel
for the last nine years.

00:01:52.232 --> 00:01:53.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When this
happened to you,

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.980 align:middle line:84%
were there any signs
that you were sick?

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:56.780 align:middle line:90%
Or it was just--

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.990 align:middle line:90%
[SNAPS FINGERS]

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.790 align:middle line:90%
--like that?

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well,
my family and I

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.650 align:middle line:84%
had been trading some viral
symptoms for a few days,

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.890 align:middle line:84%
so I thought early that morning
that maybe this virus had

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.110 align:middle line:90%
really taken off in me.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.510 align:middle line:84%
But other than that, there
was really no warning at all.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And it was so extreme, pain
that I just cannot describe.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.320 align:middle line:84%
Severe back pain,
severe headache,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.670 align:middle line:84%
and then a rapid
descent into deep coma.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.130 align:middle line:84%
So it really was an
extraordinary illness

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.770 align:middle line:84%
that, in fact, to me,
one of the biggest shocks

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.010 align:middle line:84%
when I came back from it all
was reviewing my medical records

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.050 align:middle line:84%
and realizing, this guy couldn't
have had any experience,

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.140 align:middle line:84%
and certainly couldn't have
survived and come back intact.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.390 align:middle line:90%
And yet, that's what happened.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Over eight weeks
after my coma, I

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.950 align:middle line:84%
had a full recovery
of my mental functions

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.420 align:middle line:84%
to a point where
my memories were

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.630 align:middle line:84%
even better and more complete
than they had been before coma.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And that part was
a complete shock.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
going to the other side may

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.387 align:middle line:90%
have helped you heal yourself?

00:02:54.387 --> 00:02:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, I'm convinced
that that's absolutely right.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.540 align:middle line:84%
I would say that all
of our human existence

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.810 align:middle line:84%
is simply a process of
becoming more whole.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.070 align:middle line:84%
That's where the word
healing comes from,

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.290 align:middle line:90%
is becoming more whole.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And in essence, I've
come as a physician

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.970 align:middle line:84%
to realize that any physical,
mental, emotional health is

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.370 align:middle line:84%
first and foremost
spiritual health.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I think
near-death experiences provide

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.780 align:middle line:84%
such a rich kind of example of
the power of spiritual health

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:24.740 align:middle line:90%
and healing.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.830 align:middle line:84%
You find very miraculous
cases of healing

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.320 align:middle line:84%
with no explanation
in Western medicine

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.140 align:middle line:84%
are sprinkled widely
through the NDE literature.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.930 align:middle line:90%
There are many cases out there.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.710 align:middle line:84%
To me, that is one of the
biggest lessons of NDEs

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.570 align:middle line:84%
is an ability to gain far more
complete control of our health

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.900 align:middle line:84%
and healing, and realizing
as spiritual beings

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.420 align:middle line:84%
in a spiritual universe
that that kind of power

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.120 align:middle line:84%
and learning the lessons
is part of our growth

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.440 align:middle line:90%
and becoming more whole.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was an artist
who went to the other side

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.670 align:middle line:90%
and came back as well.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.840 align:middle line:84%
It's an example, of course,
of what happened to you.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.510 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: In 1982, artist
Mellen-Thomas Benedict

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.114 align:middle line:10%
died of terminal cancer.

00:04:07.114 --> 00:04:08.780 align:middle line:10%
While he was traveling
toward the light,

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.670 align:middle line:10%
Benedict decided he had
questions and wanted

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:11.780 align:middle line:10%
to see things first.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.880 align:middle line:10%
In an amazing
near-death experience,

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.920 align:middle line:10%
he recalled flying
through the solar system,

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.350 align:middle line:10%
leaving this galaxy and
traveling to other worlds that

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.640 align:middle line:10%
had other life.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.400 align:middle line:10%
His journey reportedly
took him to far-off worlds

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.490 align:middle line:10%
and even passed the Big Bang
into the void of nothingness.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.520 align:middle line:10%
Benedict awoke an hour and a
half later after he had died.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.020 align:middle line:10%
Later tests showed
that his cancer

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.460 align:middle line:10%
had gone into what the doctors
called spontaneous remission.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Again, somebody goes to
the other side and comes back,

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.760 align:middle line:90%
and his cancer is in remission.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Right.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.026 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well,
these kind of stories

00:04:43.026 --> 00:04:44.990 align:middle line:84%
are all through
the NDE literature.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.390 align:middle line:10%
Whether you look at Anita
Moorjani's beautiful story

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.020 align:middle line:10%
"Dying To Be Me" and her
lymphoma that in her NDE

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.890 align:middle line:10%
she realized she could come back
and the cancer would disappear,

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.510 align:middle line:10%
and that's what happened.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.690 align:middle line:10%
Mary C. Neal's story,
the orthopedic surgeon

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.980 align:middle line:10%
who wrote her book about her
kayaking accident in Chile

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.900 align:middle line:10%
where she was underwater
for 30 minutes.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:06.710 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Flipped right over.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:07.510 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Right.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And people don't
come back from that

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.540 align:middle line:84%
to return to a normal
life, and yet she did.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.760 align:middle line:84%
So these miraculous cases
of healing, I think,

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.780 align:middle line:84%
are one of the most
extraordinary lessons that

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.490 align:middle line:90%
come out of the NDE literature.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And certainly as a
health care person,

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm fascinated by the
clues that they give us

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.360 align:middle line:84%
about how we can all take
control of our own healing,

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.700 align:middle line:84%
and as spiritual
beings, come to realize

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.760 align:middle line:84%
that we can have tremendous
mastery over our destiny.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And that starts first and
foremost with our health.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you went to the
other side, what was it like?

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.200 align:middle line:90%
Describe it for us.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.575 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well,
it all started

00:05:43.575 --> 00:05:45.800 align:middle line:84%
in a very primitive,
coarse, unresponsive realm

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.450 align:middle line:84%
that I call the
earthworm's eye view.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.860 align:middle line:84%
A very dark and murky
kind of coarse reality,

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.260 align:middle line:90%
like being in dirty Jell-O.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ew.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.300 align:middle line:90%
Sounds like Hell.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, people
often ask me when I--

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not that
you would go there.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: No,
well-- but it is

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.150 align:middle line:90%
part of the spiritual realms.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's something we
have no need to fear,

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.600 align:middle line:84%
but that fearlessness
is a crucial part

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.130 align:middle line:90%
of the lesson of my journey.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.870 align:middle line:84%
Turns out that
from that realm, I

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.910 align:middle line:84%
was rescued by a slowly
spinning white light, very clear

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.760 align:middle line:84%
that came bundled with a
perfect musical melody.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And that white light
opened up, like,

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.830 align:middle line:84%
a rip in the fabric of that
ugly earthworm eye view realm

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.500 align:middle line:84%
and led up into an
ultareal valley, what

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.480 align:middle line:84%
I call the gateway
valley, that was filled

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.340 align:middle line:90%
with many Earth-like features.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.670 align:middle line:84%
For example, there was lots
of plant life, lush, growing.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Flowers blossoming,
buds on trees.

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:39.740 align:middle line:90%
No sign of any death or decay.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.410 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful waterfalls
in the sparkling pools,

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.700 align:middle line:84%
thousands of beings dancing
below, tremendous joy

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.750 align:middle line:90%
and merriment.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.280 align:middle line:84%
I saw them all as
souls between lives.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And I was witnessing it
all as a speck of awareness

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.530 align:middle line:90%
on a butterfly wing.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.360 align:middle line:84%
There were millions
of other butterflies--

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Outside looking in?

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.825 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Looking
down on this valley.

00:06:59.825 --> 00:07:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And again, the
thing to stress, it

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.060 align:middle line:84%
was absolutely-- it was far
more real than this world.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.890 align:middle line:90%
This world is the dream.

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.860 align:middle line:84%
This is the murky
kind of surreality.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.640 align:middle line:84%
That is the shocking reality
of our spiritual realm.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And it was all very much
fueled because up above

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.050 align:middle line:84%
in the sky over this
beautiful valley

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.440 align:middle line:84%
were these swooping orbs
of light, golden orbs

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.830 align:middle line:84%
leaving sparkling
trails of golden dust

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.990 align:middle line:84%
against the blue-black
velvety sky.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And these orbs were emanating
chants and anthems, hymns

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.390 align:middle line:90%
that would thunder through me.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.320 align:middle line:84%
This incredible, astonishing
power and majesty

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.170 align:middle line:84%
of the unconditional love
of the deity of that realm,

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.814 align:middle line:84%
that God that drove every
bit of that journey.

00:07:45.814 --> 00:07:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there was a
beautiful girl on the butterfly

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:51.680 align:middle line:84%
wing who later proved
crucial at showing me

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.660 align:middle line:90%
the reality of the journey.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.480 align:middle line:84%
Many months after my coma,
it was identifying her

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.430 align:middle line:84%
that helped me to
understand it all.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:00.140 align:middle line:84%
But that was only
a stepping stone

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.100 align:middle line:90%
to higher and higher levels.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, those angelic
choirs, the music from them

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.940 align:middle line:90%
provided yet another portal.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Music, vibration,
frequency are the way

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.860 align:middle line:84%
that our souls
transcend these realms.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And that particular
portal out of the valley

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.770 align:middle line:84%
led into pure oneness, in
what I call the core realm.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.860 align:middle line:84%
Infinite inky
blackness, but filled

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:25.460 align:middle line:84%
to overflowing with
the healing power

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.330 align:middle line:84%
of that divine loving creative
source, that God or deity.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.179 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I came back
calling that deity Om,

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:35.030 align:middle line:84%
because that was the sound
that I heard in that realm.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.610 align:middle line:84%
But it was just an
extraordinary spiritual journey.

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And the most amazing
thing, of course,

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:43.370 align:middle line:84%
is that it happened when my
brain was demonstrably offline,

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:47.545 align:middle line:84%
when the neocortex was
known by my neurologic exams

00:08:47.545 --> 00:08:49.010 align:middle line:90%
and by my scans.

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.680 align:middle line:84%
My doctors knew that
I could not have

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.680 align:middle line:84%
had any kind of
robust experience,

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:58.040 align:middle line:84%
because this was far more
real than anything I've ever

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.380 align:middle line:90%
experienced in my existence.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A skeptic
would say, this

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:04.850 align:middle line:90%
is a process of your brain.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:08.450 align:middle line:84%
It's creating these
illusions and these images

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.630 align:middle line:90%
while you're in this state.

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:11.916 align:middle line:90%
What would you say to them?

00:09:11.916 --> 00:09:13.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, that's
why my doctors were

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:17.420 align:middle line:84%
in such a good position
to say, absolutely not.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And any doctor who has ever
seen a case of gram-negative

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.090 align:middle line:84%
bacterial meningitis where
someone is driven into coma

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:27.920 align:middle line:84%
over three and a half hours,
spends seven days in coma

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.860 align:middle line:84%
and then comes back from
it, even though my brain was

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.786 align:middle line:84%
absolutely savaged
when I came back--

00:09:32.786 --> 00:09:34.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, an important
thing to point out

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:39.270 align:middle line:84%
is that my NDE was somewhat
different from others

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:43.110 align:middle line:84%
in the fact that I had no
memory of Eben Alexander's life.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:46.440 align:middle line:84%
I was amnesic for everything
on my religious beliefs, words

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.990 align:middle line:84%
and language, all my
scientific knowledge.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:52.980 align:middle line:84%
Every bit of that was deleted
before I went into this coma.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.410 align:middle line:84%
So when I came
back to this world,

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:59.100 align:middle line:84%
all that I knew that
Sunday morning on day seven

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.530 align:middle line:84%
when they extubated me
and I started to come back

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:05.340 align:middle line:84%
to this world, all I knew was
the realms I had just visited.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:11.010 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even recognize
my mother, my sons,

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:12.540 align:middle line:90%
my sisters at the bedside.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.030 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea who
these beings were.

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And all of that
came back quickly,

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.100 align:middle line:84%
words and language
over hours and days,

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.230 align:middle line:84%
childhood memories
over weeks, all

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.900 align:middle line:84%
of my semantic knowledge
of science and physics,

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.400 align:middle line:90%
and all personal life memories.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.606 align:middle line:84%
Every bit of that returned
over about eight weeks.

00:10:29.606 --> 00:10:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And that was what
was so extraordinary.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:34.920 align:middle line:84%
It showed me very clearly
that memories are not

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.920 align:middle line:84%
stored in the physical brain
at all, which is probably

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.744 align:middle line:84%
one of the biggest nails in the
coffin of materialist science.

00:10:40.744 --> 00:10:42.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like on the
cloud somewhere, and then

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:43.826 align:middle line:90%
they bring it back into you.

00:10:43.826 --> 00:10:44.795 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Exactly.

00:10:44.795 --> 00:10:49.380 align:middle line:84%
Our brain serves to access
consciousness and access

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:54.390 align:middle line:84%
memory, but it is not the
repository or generator,

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:56.260 align:middle line:90%
producer of all that.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And the modern
scientific view that

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:01.440 align:middle line:84%
is replacing that old
useless production

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.660 align:middle line:84%
model of brain-producing
consciousness

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.730 align:middle line:84%
is what is called
filter theory, where

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:07.410 align:middle line:90%
consciousness is primordial.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:11.050 align:middle line:84%
The entire universe emerges
out of consciousness itself,

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:14.550 align:middle line:84%
who some might call God or
that creative source or deity.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:17.640 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, I would say it
is so deeply personal to each

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.840 align:middle line:84%
of us that our very
conscious awareness is

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:25.020 align:middle line:84%
identical with that
creative force of oneness

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.300 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness that
creates all of reality.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How common are
near-death experiences?

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well,
they're extremely common.

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:37.410 align:middle line:84%
Probably 15 million or so at
least in the United States

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:38.760 align:middle line:90%
over the last few decades.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:44.010 align:middle line:84%
There was a Gallup poll back
in the early '80s in the United

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:48.210 align:middle line:84%
States that indicated that
roughly 15% of our population

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:50.490 align:middle line:90%
has had a near-death experience.

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Now it turns out those
numbers are probably

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:54.940 align:middle line:84%
expanding, because
back in those days,

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.440 align:middle line:84%
people were not very
likely to report one.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.990 align:middle line:90%
You generally-- I mean, you--

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they probably
didn't know what they were.

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:01.963 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know what they were.

00:12:01.963 --> 00:12:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, they
thought they were crazy.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.940 align:middle line:84%
That's what I thought
when I came back.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.270 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well, this was some
example of the insanity of what

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:10.590 align:middle line:90%
a dying brain can do.

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.630 align:middle line:90%
That's what my doctors told me.

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:15.102 align:middle line:84%
And yet when you went back
through the medical records

00:12:15.102 --> 00:12:16.560 align:middle line:84%
and realized what
was going on, you

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.570 align:middle line:84%
realized, well,
that brain could not

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:22.480 align:middle line:84%
have accomplished any kind
of dream, hallucination, drug

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.280 align:middle line:90%
effect.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.880 align:middle line:84%
That brain was far too impaired
with neocortical damage

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.800 align:middle line:84%
to have come up
with anything other

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.440 align:middle line:84%
than the most rudimentary
forms of consciousness.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I witnessed the
exact opposite of that.

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:37.800 align:middle line:84%
I would say we are conscious
in spite of our brain.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Our brain acts much more as
a reducing valve or filter.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.200 align:middle line:90%
It's an inhibitor.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.870 align:middle line:84%
That's why, for example,
psychedelic drugs can

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:49.830 align:middle line:84%
have such a robust kind of
expansion on our awareness,

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:53.460 align:middle line:84%
is they take down some of the
gating mechanisms and veiling

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.130 align:middle line:84%
functions and inhibitory
actions of the brain,

00:12:56.130 --> 00:13:00.120 align:middle line:84%
and allow a more
full-frontal exposure

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.680 align:middle line:90%
to that universal mind.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:06.030 align:middle line:84%
But from my point of view, the
best way to really access it

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:07.620 align:middle line:90%
is through meditation.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And I try to encourage people
not to use psychedelic drugs,

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.100 align:middle line:84%
although I realize they're
important for the research

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.260 align:middle line:90%
and for sacred purposes.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And also for example,
psilocybin has

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.660 align:middle line:84%
been shown in recent
studies to be extremely

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:25.770 align:middle line:84%
effective at combating
nicotine addiction, alcoholism,

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:28.320 align:middle line:84%
other addictions, but
also the fear of death

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.790 align:middle line:90%
in cancer patients.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:33.360 align:middle line:10%
Psilocybin, a potent
psychedelic drug,

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.110 align:middle line:10%
has tremendous utility in
helping us to deal with things.

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:39.060 align:middle line:10%
But in essence, it's
kind of getting us

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.190 align:middle line:10%
more in touch with
our spiritual self

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:42.570 align:middle line:10%
and that spiritual healing.

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And from my point
of view, we can

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:48.330 align:middle line:84%
be far more effective at driving
that through meditation alone

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.306 align:middle line:84%
and not using
substances to get there.

00:13:50.306 --> 00:13:52.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you say when
you were in this state, Eben,

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.260 align:middle line:84%
that you were in
a state of bliss?

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: It was far
beyond the word bliss.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:01.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is becoming
the love, the oneness,

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:05.460 align:middle line:84%
the complete connectedness
and compassion of all.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:09.690 align:middle line:84%
It's the richest, deepest
form of universal love.

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's something we all
kind of sense and glimpse.

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And yet, unfortunately
in our world,

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:18.900 align:middle line:84%
love is so often
attached to conditions.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, I will love you
if, or do this otherwise.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And yet, unconditional love is
what has such tremendous power

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.160 align:middle line:90%
to heal.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.660 align:middle line:84%
That's why forgiveness is
one of the most potent tools

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.550 align:middle line:90%
a human being has.

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:36.400 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness frees the
forgiver from the shackles

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.070 align:middle line:84%
of the prison of
any kind of conflict

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:41.170 align:middle line:90%
that requires forgiveness.

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's much more
an acknowledgement

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.030 align:middle line:84%
that we are all
part of one mind.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:49.450 align:middle line:84%
We really are the one mind
dreaming this beautiful dream.

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And we're all
different facets of it,

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:53.410 align:middle line:84%
but it's like different
facets of a diamond,

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:55.150 align:middle line:90%
and we're all that diamond.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.980 align:middle line:84%
To even say we're part
of it is misleading.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.190 align:middle line:84%
That's how our language
conspires to give us

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:02.200 align:middle line:90%
a false sense of separation.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.940 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, what
quantum physics has

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.060 align:middle line:84%
been trying to show us,
what this revolution

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:10.060 align:middle line:84%
in understanding the mind and
the nature of consciousness

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:13.000 align:middle line:84%
is trying to show us,
is that we are all one.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.632 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, to hurt
another is to hurt myself.

00:15:16.632 --> 00:15:18.340 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
most beautiful lessons

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:22.000 align:middle line:84%
that comes, for example,
through the life review of NDEs.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.390 align:middle line:84%
The life review occurs
in 30% to 50% of NDEs

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:28.810 align:middle line:84%
and is a very powerful
illustration of the fact

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:30.010 align:middle line:90%
that we really are all one.

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Because in the life review, when
you listen to people tell them,

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.610 align:middle line:84%
it turns out that they're
witnessing their thoughts

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:39.580 align:middle line:84%
and actions on others from the
point of view of the other.

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.820 align:middle line:84%
So the boundary of self
disappears in the life review,

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.790 align:middle line:84%
and it shows you we are
all part of that one mind.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.390 align:middle line:84%
The other important
thing, of course,

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:50.630 align:middle line:84%
is it shows us that Earth
time, the progression past,

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:54.850 align:middle line:84%
present, future that we think
is so written into reality

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:56.470 align:middle line:90%
is all part of the maya.

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:58.520 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the
appearance of the world,

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.030 align:middle line:84%
but it's not part of
the underlying reality.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And life reviews show us that
very quickly and clearly,

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.270 align:middle line:84%
because you can have a
profound life review that

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:08.890 align:middle line:84%
involves everything
in your life, all

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:13.330 align:middle line:84%
the important goods and bads
of lessons still to be learned.

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:15.390 align:middle line:90%
And yet, it can happen--

>>NOORY: Did this
experience erase all doubt

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:23.710 align:middle line:84%
about the existence
of the other side?

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:24.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Yes.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:25.340 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:30.100 align:middle line:84%
It showed the fundamental
reality of the other side.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think this
whole awakening,

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:35.500 align:middle line:84%
coming to the scientific,
philosophical, theological,

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:40.330 align:middle line:84%
and to the broad human community
is one of really coming

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.990 align:middle line:84%
to see that and recognize
that, that we are truly

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:46.390 align:middle line:84%
spiritual beings in
a spiritual universe.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.270 align:middle line:84%
The material world,
which has been

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:54.040 align:middle line:84%
the focus of 400 years of
scientific investigation,

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:58.630 align:middle line:84%
is a beautiful stage setting
on which the drama unfolds.

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:02.800 align:middle line:84%
But the plot and theme are very
much part of a soul journey

that are not mired down in
any kind of chemical reactions

00:17:08.151 --> 00:17:09.609 align:middle line:84%
in the brain, and
things like that.

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:11.560 align:middle line:90%
It's a far richer journey.

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And it points out
very easily how

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:17.859 align:middle line:84%
you can realize why our
current conventional scientific

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:21.849 align:middle line:84%
paradigm is so completely
lost over the phenomenon

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:23.390 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.680 align:middle line:10%
And this is something that
we go into in great detail

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.170 align:middle line:10%
in our next book, "Living
in a Mindful Universe,"

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:31.310 align:middle line:10%
that talks about all of this.

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:33.140 align:middle line:90%
And it's a shift in perspective.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.690 align:middle line:84%
But I would say
there's no way out

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:37.810 align:middle line:84%
for the scientific community
other than admitting this.

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:43.570 align:middle line:84%
That's why quantum physics
has presented such a conundrum

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:44.650 align:middle line:90%
to modern science.

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And as long as they continue
to insist that consciousness

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:50.350 align:middle line:84%
is not real, they're
going to continue circling

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:52.460 align:middle line:90%
the drain of confusion.

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.100 align:middle line:84%
But as you realize
that consciousness

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.200 align:middle line:84%
is the fundamental
reality, and it

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.230 align:middle line:84%
is what generates everything
else, all of the material

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.570 align:middle line:84%
world, including our
body and brain, which

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:05.170 align:middle line:84%
are part of the material world
projected from consciousness,

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:07.510 align:middle line:84%
as we start to shift
that perspective

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:09.460 align:middle line:84%
and take on that new
way of looking at it,

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.620 align:middle line:84%
it starts to make
far more sense.

in 1980, Dr. Brian Weiss

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.770 align:middle line:84%
was using hypnotherapy
with a patient named

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:32.820 align:middle line:84%
Catherine to discover the roots
of her paralyzing phobias.

In his book "Many
Lives, Many Masters,"

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:37.740 align:middle line:10%
he writes that during
one of their sessions,

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:42.120 align:middle line:10%
Catherine regressed back to
a time before she was born,

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.940 align:middle line:10%
recounting a past life as
an 18-year-old girl named

Aronda from the year 1863 BC.

Sounds crazy, I know.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.180 align:middle line:90%
So OK.

You are a Yale-trained,
Columbia-trained doctor,

>>BRIAN WEISS: I said, I
don't know what this is,

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:25.140 align:middle line:10%
but I could already see it
was intense, it was cathartic,

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:26.302 align:middle line:10%
it was emotional.

couldn't believe it herself.

was easier than for me--

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:40.600 align:middle line:90%

so-- yeah, to believe it.

00:19:42.724 --> 00:19:43.830 align:middle line:90%
It was so intense for her.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:47.070 align:middle line:84%
She was experiencing it
with emotions and visually

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:51.210 align:middle line:84%
and in sounds and other
senses that it became easier

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:54.930 align:middle line:84%
over the weeks that followed
for her to change her worldview.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:57.390 align:middle line:84%
But for me, I needed more,
because I was such a skeptic,

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:59.460 align:middle line:90%
so left-brained, so academic.

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.130 align:middle line:84%

in coming out with that.

00:20:11.475 --> 00:20:13.100 align:middle line:84%
I know what that kind
of thing is like.

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:19.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for me, it took an
extremely life-threatening case

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:22.590 align:middle line:84%
of bacterial meningitis
and a week in coma

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:24.900 align:middle line:84%

>>NOORY: Wouldn't
it have been better

00:20:28.203 --> 00:20:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, I guess.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:32.610 align:middle line:84%

As I point out in "Proof
of Heaven," I just--

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:35.610 align:middle line:90%
I was too dense.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:36.855 align:middle line:90%
I just couldn't get it.

>>NOORY: You didn't get it.

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: I kind
of explained it away.

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:43.154 align:middle line:84%
And that's been the problem
with our modern science.

00:20:43.154 --> 00:20:44.820 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'd say it's
one of the biggest

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:47.250 align:middle line:84%
problems with reductive
materialism, which

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.170 align:middle line:84%
is our kind of conventional
view of science.

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:51.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, reduce all
of the physical world

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:53.510 align:middle line:84%
down to its tiniest
little particles,

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:56.160 align:middle line:84%
figure out how they work, and
then you understand reality.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.630 align:middle line:84%
From my point of view, that's
going the wrong direction.

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:00.780 align:middle line:84%
That's the bottom-up
approach that

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.720 align:middle line:84%
can't begin to explain
the richness of all

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.010 align:middle line:90%
of human experience.

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:06.760 align:middle line:90%
We need more of a top-down view.

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And that, of course,
is what I think

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Brian Weiss was
coming to realize,

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:15.180 align:middle line:90%
what I've come to realize.

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And it has everything
to do with just

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:18.150 align:middle line:90%
expanding our field of view.

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:23.310 align:middle line:84%
We have to step outside of
this mind-body relationship,

their kind of interactions

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.460 align:middle line:84%
to start to glimpse
exactly how it all works.

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And that is where
meditation comes in

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.410 align:middle line:84%
so handy, because I
believe in meditation

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:36.690 align:middle line:90%
we actually transcend that veil.

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And by coming more in touch
with the universal mind,

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:42.570 align:middle line:84%
universal consciousness,
we can start to glimpse

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:45.990 align:middle line:84%
how the little details
of apparent parcellation

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:49.080 align:middle line:84%
occur down in this
world in human lives.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With what's going
on in this entire realm

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:56.010 align:middle line:84%
of reincarnation, past lives,
and it's all interconnected,

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:59.480 align:middle line:84%
it's all tied together, did you
have that kind of experience

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.280 align:middle line:90%
as well?

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe you've
had past lives?

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:04.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: I am
certain of that.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.380 align:middle line:84%
In fact, my sons have
shared with me some evidence

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:08.650 align:middle line:90%
of their past lives.

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there's
a great reality to that.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:15.930 align:middle line:84%
Now before my coma, if you had
asked me about reincarnation,

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:18.691 align:middle line:84%
I would have scoffed and kind
of chuckled at your ignorance.

00:22:18.691 --> 00:22:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And examined
me for some problem.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Exactly.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:23.370 align:middle line:84%
We've got to scan you, figure
out where that tumor is.

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:27.570 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out that
the scientific basis

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:29.310 align:middle line:84%
for reincarnation
is quite strong.

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:31.950 align:middle line:10%
If you look at the
works of Ian Stevenson

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:34.950 align:middle line:10%
at the University of Virginia,
his work currently being

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:37.680 align:middle line:10%
carried out by Dr.
Jim Tucker, division

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.470 align:middle line:10%
and perceptual studies,
they've done extraordinary work

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:44.940 align:middle line:10%
and have more than 2,500
cases of past life memories

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:48.690 align:middle line:10%
in children collected over the
last four or five decades where

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:52.200 align:middle line:10%
the most ready explanation
is actually of reincarnation.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.980 align:middle line:84%
To me, reincarnation was
absolutely essential to explain

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.950 align:middle line:90%
anything of my journey.

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:01.050 align:middle line:84%
For example, it was
the only way to make

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:05.820 align:middle line:84%
sense of the infinite
healing power, omnipotence,

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.970 align:middle line:84%
and omniscience of
that deity, of that God

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:11.610 align:middle line:84%
that I witnessed with the
suffering of innocents

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:13.800 align:middle line:90%
like children and animals.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.440 align:middle line:84%
To try and make sense of
that with one incarnation

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.580 align:middle line:90%
made zero sense.

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:20.160 align:middle line:84%
It only made sense to
see the bigger pattern,

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.900 align:middle line:84%
that our souls come
back again and again

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:26.505 align:middle line:84%
in this rich, interwoven
tapestry of soul journey,

00:23:26.505 --> 00:23:27.790 align:middle line:90%
of soul learning.

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:29.910 align:middle line:90%
And this is really soul school.

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of often
would picture us

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.720 align:middle line:90%
like schools of flying fish.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And we come up and
out of the water

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:38.430 align:middle line:84%
and go through our life reviews
and do it with our higher soul,

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:40.590 align:middle line:84%
realize that power of
love, and then dive back

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:43.170 align:middle line:84%
into the water to live
other incarnations

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:45.270 align:middle line:84%
where there's a
program forgetting.

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:48.180 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason we
don't remember everything

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:49.830 align:middle line:84%
from between lives
and past lives,

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:52.810 align:middle line:84%
and that has to do with
the ongoing learning.

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:55.590 align:middle line:84%
It gets a skin in the game
to believe that we only

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:59.010 align:middle line:84%
have this one incarnation
to live these lives,

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:02.790 align:middle line:84%
to feel the power of love
and the power of loss,

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:05.670 align:middle line:84%
and to really live that and
have that rich exposure.

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:07.470 align:middle line:84%
But that's all
part of what drives

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:09.780 align:middle line:84%
the soul school and
this learning and deeper

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:10.800 align:middle line:90%
understanding.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
scared of dying, Eben?

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:13.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: No.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.240 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm in no hurry to die.

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.040 align:middle line:90%
I really--

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.081 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's no rush.

00:24:17.081 --> 00:24:18.180 align:middle line:90%
There's no rush.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:20.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: But I
realize it's an adventure.

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:24.027 align:middle line:84%
I also know that when you
die, it's not a case--

00:24:24.027 --> 00:24:25.860 align:middle line:84%
what I would have told
you before my coma is

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:28.931 align:middle line:84%
that as the brain
flickers out, so

00:24:28.931 --> 00:24:30.180 align:middle line:90%
does your conscious awareness.

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:32.970 align:middle line:10%
In fact, what happens is
your conscious awareness

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:35.010 align:middle line:10%
expands tremendously.

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:36.600 align:middle line:10%
Because once again,
your awareness

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:40.350 align:middle line:10%
is liberated from the shackles
of the physical brain that

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:44.430 align:middle line:10%
have to maintain this kind of
illusion of our incarnation

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:45.760 align:middle line:10%
in these physical bodies.

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:46.930 align:middle line:90%
But that's how we grow.

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:49.140 align:middle line:90%
That's how all of soul grows.

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:52.710 align:middle line:84%
That's how this mind
dreams in its progression.

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:57.660 align:middle line:84%
I like to say, it's often
like Teilhard de Chardin

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.910 align:middle line:84%
in his beautiful
mid-20th century

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:01.800 align:middle line:84%
book, "The Phenomenon
of the Man,"

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.020 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
evolution of consciousness.

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:06.390 align:middle line:84%
That's what I would say
this is really all about,

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:09.040 align:middle line:84%
is all of consciousness
is evolving.

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:11.010 align:middle line:84%
It's not just human
consciousness.

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:13.300 align:middle line:84%
This is consciousness
throughout the universe.

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And it is what generates
all of reality.

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
are all part of.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.190 align:middle line:90%
But it does not--

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:23.670 align:middle line:84%
we do not accomplish any of
those goals in one incarnation.

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:25.710 align:middle line:90%
We come back repeatedly.

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And for me, kind
of a litmus test

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:30.480 align:middle line:84%
of how far advanced a
soul is in that process

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.850 align:middle line:84%
is how much they've
liberated themselves

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:35.700 align:middle line:90%
from the false notion of self.

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.256 align:middle line:84%
The more free they
are of the ego,

00:25:37.256 --> 00:25:38.880 align:middle line:84%
the more they realize
we're all in this

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.690 align:middle line:84%
together, that it's all about
love, compassion, mercy,

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:46.560 align:middle line:84%
forgiveness, and taking
care of each other, that

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.470 align:middle line:84%
is the deep soul lesson
that humanity has

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:52.110 align:middle line:84%
been charged with learning
for the last many thousands

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:53.100 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And we still haven't
quite learned it.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:58.010 align:middle line:84%
I think we're on the cusp
of some major learning.

00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a friend
who passed away recently.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:05.370 align:middle line:84%
He had been paraplegic for
seven years after falling.

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:07.590 align:middle line:84%
He had stenosis of
the spinal cord,

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:10.140 align:middle line:84%
and then he fell
and hit his neck,

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.640 align:middle line:90%
and he was just a paraplegic.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.980 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't move
his arms and legs.

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And so for seven years, he
was confined to a wheelchair,

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.420 align:middle line:84%
pushing his buttons
with his little fingers.

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.320 align:middle line:90%
But he finally passed on.

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:24.300 align:middle line:84%
At that moment of
death, Eben, I've

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:27.840 align:middle line:84%
always wondered, what
is that crossover like?

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:33.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so he's alive and
alert, and then he dies.

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:34.830 align:middle line:90%
Then what?

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:38.670 align:middle line:84%
How does it pick up, and how
soon with our kind of time

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:40.150 align:middle line:90%
does it pick up again?

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:42.000 align:middle line:10%
>>ALEXANDER: I would
say a perfect example

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.320 align:middle line:10%
of what happens there are the
last words of Steven Jobs.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Many people think Apple
computer was his--

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: "Oh wow."

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:51.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: "Wow
oh wow oh wow."

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Because what he was
seeing-- and those words

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:57.660 align:middle line:84%
I've heard in various forms
from hundreds of people

00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.640 align:middle line:90%
describing similar situations.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.830 align:middle line:90%
But it happens right away.

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:06.030 align:middle line:84%
There are what are called
episodes of terminal lucidity.

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:10.290 align:middle line:84%
I mention terminal lucidity
in the book "Proof of Heaven."

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:13.590 align:middle line:84%
These are examples
where someone who

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:16.530 align:middle line:84%
has been getting progressively
demented over time,

00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:19.200 align:middle line:84%
they may have spent weeks
or months unable to utter

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.700 align:middle line:90%
a meaningful phrase at all.

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.220 align:middle line:84%
But then as they
get close to death,

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:24.510 align:middle line:90%
they come right back to life.

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And this can even
happen in people

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.560 align:middle line:84%
whose brains have been
completely overtaken

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.330 align:middle line:90%
by metastatic cancer.

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:33.210 align:middle line:84%
It's a clear example
of how the brain is not

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:35.100 align:middle line:84%
the producer of
consciousness at all.

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:38.850 align:middle line:84%
But terminal lucidity-- and
hospice workers know this

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:41.350 align:middle line:90%
phenomenon very well--

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:43.350 align:middle line:84%
is a beautiful
gift that shows us

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:45.840 align:middle line:84%
that that transition
is very powerful,

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.820 align:middle line:84%
and it happens when
we leave this world.

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And it actually starts
when we're still

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.660 align:middle line:84%
kind of with one
foot in this world

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:54.480 align:middle line:90%
and one foot in that world.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.130 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful gift.

00:27:56.130 --> 00:28:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Michael Nahm, N-A-H-M, wrote
a fantastic book on terminal

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:04.059 align:middle line:84%
lucidity with, I
believe, 83 cases.

00:28:04.059 --> 00:28:05.350 align:middle line:90%
And they're just extraordinary.

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And I've encountered several
of those examples myself.

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:11.700 align:middle line:84%
But they show us clearly
that we are spiritual beings,

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.620 align:middle line:84%
that the brain is
more of a prison,

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:17.220 align:middle line:84%
and that that awakening
that profound enlightenment

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:20.324 align:middle line:84%
comes to all of us as we leave
our physical bodies behind.

00:28:20.324 --> 00:28:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that
helps explain really

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:24.960 align:middle line:84%
an argument of without
the physical brain,

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.730 align:middle line:90%
does any of this exist?

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And based on your experience
and Brian Weiss's and so many

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.450 align:middle line:84%
other people, the brain
is not the catalyst

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:35.010 align:middle line:90%
for what's happening afterward.

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:35.810 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Right.

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:38.670 align:middle line:90%
The brain is like a transceiver.

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:39.570 align:middle line:90%
It's like the radio.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.370 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes use
the analogy, it's

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:43.590 align:middle line:84%
kind of like the
computer display.

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:45.060 align:middle line:84%
So yes, you can
do a lot of things

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:48.049 align:middle line:84%
to understand the workings
of the computer display,

00:28:48.049 --> 00:28:49.590 align:middle line:84%
and that helps you
to understand what

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:50.940 align:middle line:90%
you're seeing with your eyes.

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.440 align:middle line:84%
But if you really
want to understand

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:56.670 align:middle line:84%
what is being displayed, you
have to go beyond that monitor.

00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:59.640 align:middle line:84%
You have to go deep within
the workings of the CPU.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And that is transcending
the physical universe

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:05.100 align:middle line:84%
and going into where
really it all happens,

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.970 align:middle line:90%
which is the spiritual realm.

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:10.770 align:middle line:84%
As I said earlier,
time flow, all

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:12.300 align:middle line:84%
of the kind of
physical workings,

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:15.720 align:middle line:84%
this is like the facade
in a Western movie being

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.580 align:middle line:90%
filmed by Hollywood.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And you can understand
the laws of physics, which

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.480 align:middle line:90%
are the laws of that facade.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:24.840 align:middle line:84%
But if you really want to
understand the workings of what

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:28.860 align:middle line:84%
happens in human lives, and
kind of why, for example,

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:33.000 align:middle line:84%
placebo effect, why we have
such power over our health,

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.750 align:middle line:84%
why incredible synchronicities
can come into our lives, things

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:39.300 align:middle line:84%
that have absolutely
no explanation

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.580 align:middle line:84%
from a conventional
scientific viewpoint,

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:46.280 align:middle line:84%
and yet they occur in our lives
with this profound lesson,

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:49.067 align:middle line:84%
realize that there are
higher-ordering principles.

00:29:49.067 --> 00:29:50.775 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do
with our understanding

00:29:50.775 --> 00:29:53.220 align:middle line:84%
and our spiritual nature,
the spiritual nature

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:56.430 align:middle line:84%
of this entire universe,
and why we are here.

00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:59.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's a beautiful gift to
start to take this bigger

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:01.350 align:middle line:90%
picture into our lives.

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of my favorite
news people, ABC'S Bob Woodruff

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:06.780 align:middle line:84%
had his own
near-death experience.

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DIANE SAWYER: It is
the eternal question.

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:10.750 align:middle line:90%
What happens after we die?

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:12.930 align:middle line:84%
ABC's Bob Woodruff,
you may know,

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:14.626 align:middle line:84%
had his own
near-death experience

00:30:14.626 --> 00:30:16.500 align:middle line:84%
five and a half years
ago when he was injured

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.720 align:middle line:90%
by a roadside bomb in Iraq.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And he decided to talk
to some people who

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:24.582 align:middle line:84%
think they know the
answer to the question.

00:30:24.582 --> 00:30:26.790 align:middle line:10%
>>BOB WOODRUFF: What I saw
that day while unconscious

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:28.720 align:middle line:10%
is seared in my memory.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.410 align:middle line:10%
My own body floating
below me; a light,

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:34.940 align:middle line:10%
painless and comfortable,
engulfing me.

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:38.590 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to meet others who
had seen the same like Mary Jo

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:39.517 align:middle line:10%
Rapini.

00:30:39.517 --> 00:30:41.850 align:middle line:10%
>>MARY JO RAPINI: All of a
sudden, it just came over me,

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:42.900 align:middle line:10%
and I was--

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.730 align:middle line:10%
I was in it.

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:46.530 align:middle line:10%
I was in that light.

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>>WOODRUFF: A few years
ago, Mary Jo almost

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:50.820 align:middle line:84%
died while lifting
weights at the gym.

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.610 align:middle line:84%
She felt a pop in
the back of the neck.

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:56.760 align:middle line:10%
A blood vessel in her
brain had suddenly burst.

00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.190 align:middle line:10%
>>RAPINI: I entered this room.

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:00.360 align:middle line:10%
God held me.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.600 align:middle line:10%
And I never saw God's
face, but I felt him.

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.360 align:middle line:10%
The first thing he said
was, you can't stay.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.110 align:middle line:10%
>>WOODRUFF: Were you
ever above your body?

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:10.026 align:middle line:10%
Or did you see yourself
at all in any of this?

00:31:10.026 --> 00:31:12.385 align:middle line:10%
>>RAPINI: Well, I--
when I was going up,

00:31:12.385 --> 00:31:14.430 align:middle line:10%
I knew my body was back there.

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:16.050 align:middle line:10%
Like, I caught a glimpse of it.

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:17.670 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't afraid at all.

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:18.470 align:middle line:90%
>>WOODRUFF: Yeah.

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:19.650 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I saw mine.

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:21.337 align:middle line:10%
I felt like I had
become a stranger.

00:31:21.337 --> 00:31:22.920 align:middle line:10%
You know, but at
this moment, I just--

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:31.350 align:middle line:10%
for a small period of time, I
was watching myself below me.

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:34.110 align:middle line:10%
And then I changed
direction and woke up again.

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:36.920 align:middle line:10%
Scientists say there is
still no clear evidence

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:38.910 align:middle line:10%
of what causes these visions.

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:40.270 align:middle line:10%
Are they voyages?

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:41.094 align:middle line:90%
Are they dreams?

00:31:41.094 --> 00:31:43.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: These things
really get your attention,

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:44.940 align:middle line:84%
and they can be
the most profound,

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:49.060 align:middle line:84%
life-changing experience
anyone ever has.

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And a general effect, of
course, is that people come away

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:55.800 align:middle line:84%
realizing that death
is not to be feared,

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:59.950 align:middle line:84%
that it's a transition
to a much higher level.

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is one
of the biggest gifts.

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:04.770 align:middle line:84%
But of course, there are
tremendous other gifts.

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:08.010 align:middle line:84%
I would say that near-death
experiences in many ways

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:10.680 align:middle line:84%
are the tip of the
spear in the awakening

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.630 align:middle line:84%
of the modern
scientific community

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:18.600 align:middle line:84%
to the incredible repertoire
of the mind-brain relationship,

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:21.300 align:middle line:84%
and how our deeper understanding
of that and of the very nature

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:24.510 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness leads us
into tremendous territory

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:27.690 align:middle line:84%
in our understanding of
the nature of reality

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:32.400 align:middle line:84%
that has been hamstrung
for hundreds of years

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.980 align:middle line:84%
by the materialist
scientific effort

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:37.260 align:middle line:84%
to try and prove that
the physical world is

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:39.324 align:middle line:90%
the only thing that exists.

00:32:39.324 --> 00:32:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
reason for that

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:43.950 align:middle line:84%
is that was the focus of
their work over centuries.

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And early on, if
they strayed too far

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:49.500 align:middle line:84%
into the world of
consciousness and mind,

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:52.020 align:middle line:84%
they were getting into the
territory of the church

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:54.210 align:middle line:84%
and they risked getting
burned at the stake.

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that's
a huge reason why

00:32:56.190 --> 00:33:00.540 align:middle line:84%
they fought so hard to keep
consciousness and mind out

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:01.860 align:middle line:90%
of the picture.

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And yet, quantum
physics forces us

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.590 align:middle line:84%
to bring mind and consciousness
right back into the picture.

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:10.170 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but to
put it front and center

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:13.270 align:middle line:84%
as the determinant of what
evolves in this universe

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:15.990 align:middle line:84%
and at the very fundament
of all of a human's

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:17.330 align:middle line:90%
perception of reality.

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Eben, what has
this experience done to you

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.320 align:middle line:90%
personally at this point?

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.340 align:middle line:90%
How has it changed you?

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, I would
say it's changed everything.

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:27.240 align:middle line:90%
It really--

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:27.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a game changer.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: It is a
complete game changer.

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And I had to start over
really at square one

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:36.900 align:middle line:90%
when I came back from my coma.

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Now of course, initially,
I just believed

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.340 align:middle line:84%
what my doctors told me,
that the dying brain can

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:43.140 align:middle line:90%
play all kinds of tricks.

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to
dismiss it as that

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:47.190 align:middle line:84%
and then explain it
from my medical records

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:51.420 align:middle line:84%
as a predictable effect of
destroying the neocortex.

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And yet the more I
did that, the more I

00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:56.670 align:middle line:84%
realized the lessons were
there that were very profound,

00:33:56.670 --> 00:34:00.030 align:middle line:84%
and demanded that I could
no longer just put Band-Aid

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:03.300 align:middle line:84%
on an old broken worldview
of scientific materialism,

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:05.610 align:middle line:84%
that I had to really go
back to the very fundaments

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:07.380 align:middle line:90%
of everything I believed.

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:09.179 align:middle line:84%
This is really about
our metaphysics.

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:12.000 align:middle line:84%
The metaphysics is kind of
the underlying assumptions

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.400 align:middle line:90%
about the nature of reality.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Like a metaphysical
idea would be

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:19.290 align:middle line:84%
that the world is
comprehensible,

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:21.179 align:middle line:84%
or that all of the world
is just a physical,

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:23.080 align:middle line:90%
that there is nothing more.

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:26.340 align:middle line:84%
So I had to really go down
and question all those beliefs

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:27.989 align:middle line:90%
at a very fundamental level.

00:34:27.989 --> 00:34:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's completely changed
my kind of understanding

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:34.290 align:middle line:84%
of interrelationships with
people, about the very nature

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:37.949 align:middle line:84%
of illness and of injury,
of why we have these things.

00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:40.949 align:middle line:84%
And I came back seeing that
the hardships and challenges

00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:44.670 align:middle line:84%
in life, the difficulties
of illness, injury, these

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:45.900 align:middle line:90%
are gifts.

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:50.190 align:middle line:84%
These are what drive our soul
lesson and our understanding.

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's by how we address
these challenges that we

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:55.230 align:middle line:90%
can come to grow spiritually.

00:34:55.230 --> 00:35:00.300 align:middle line:84%
That's why, for example, I would
say that as we talked earlier

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:02.820 align:middle line:84%
about the healing
power that often comes

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:05.700 align:middle line:84%
with very profound spiritual
near-death experiences that

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:09.960 align:middle line:84%
completely defies Western
medical explanation is part

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:10.930 align:middle line:90%
of the package.

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:13.050 align:middle line:90%
But we all have access to that.

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's by opening
our minds and having

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:17.760 align:middle line:84%
that much broader view
of why we're here,

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.310 align:middle line:84%
facing up to those
hardships and difficulties--

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:24.930 align:middle line:84%
why am I encountering this
meningitis or this terminal

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:28.320 align:middle line:84%
diagnosis or a child
who committed suicide?

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.800 align:middle line:84%
These very tough things that
happen to people I believe

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.870 align:middle line:90%
are there for a reason.

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not that you
weren't, but has it

00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:39.629 align:middle line:90%
made you a better person today?

00:35:39.629 --> 00:35:42.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, let's just
say that I am much more focused

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:45.050 align:middle line:84%
on the good of all,
and that this is really

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:48.080 align:middle line:84%
about taking care of
each other and really

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:52.370 align:middle line:84%
trying to manifest that love,
that unconditional love.

00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:56.570 align:middle line:84%
I came to realize that most
of the world's problems

00:35:56.570 --> 00:35:58.670 align:middle line:84%
are because of the
fact that we don't even

00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:00.740 align:middle line:90%
love ourselves enough.

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:02.654 align:middle line:90%
That's the real problem.

00:36:02.654 --> 00:36:04.070 align:middle line:84%
I might have told
you before coma,

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:06.980 align:middle line:84%
well, the challenge is
loving your neighbor,

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:08.180 align:middle line:90%
loving your enemy.

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:11.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, in fact, that challenge is
loving yourself and recovering

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:15.320 align:middle line:84%
that memory of self
as being connected

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:18.860 align:middle line:84%
to the divine, an
infinitely loving source

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:23.140 align:middle line:84%
at the core of this universe
that we are part of.

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:26.630 align:middle line:84%
"Part of" is a bad
word, because you know,

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:28.660 align:middle line:84%
that implies that
there's a separation.

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:31.220 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, it is
truly that oneness.

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:34.900 align:middle line:10%
And our language conspires,
because language,

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:38.150 align:middle line:10%
as Rene Descartes said,
"to define is to limit."

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:41.210 align:middle line:90%
Those limits are very confusing.

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's only by realizing that
what quantum physics is trying

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:46.820 align:middle line:84%
to tell us and what the hard
problem of consciousness

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:51.710 align:middle line:84%
is trying to tell us is that we
are all part of that one mind.

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's the one mind
dreaming this beautiful dream,

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:57.140 align:middle line:84%
and we're all constituents
of that dream.

00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:01.790 align:middle line:84%
But we need to realize that
and take it into our worldview

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:03.680 align:middle line:84%
that we are part
of that oneness,

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:07.400 align:middle line:84%
and that it is all bound
together through love.

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And another lesson
from my journey

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:13.670 align:middle line:84%
is that this is not a battle
between good and evil,

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:16.250 align:middle line:84%
the forces of light
and the forces of dark.

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:21.050 align:middle line:84%
But that in fact, unconditional
love and that light

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:24.440 align:middle line:84%
has infinite power to
overwhelm the darkness

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:28.910 align:middle line:84%
and an apparent evil, because
the darkness and apparent evil

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:32.370 align:middle line:84%
are only the lack of
the love and the light.

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've talked
about meditation before

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:37.490 align:middle line:84%
and how important it is to
the functions of our brain

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:38.940 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:39.740 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:42.500 align:middle line:90%


00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Right
now, the pulsing sound

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:47.530 align:middle line:84%
you are hearing
in the background

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:51.740 align:middle line:84%
is gently helping your
brain to move into what is

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:56.060 align:middle line:90%
known as the alpha frequency.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:38:00.030 align:middle line:84%
This will allow you to achieve
a more relaxed frame of mind.

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:04.630 align:middle line:90%


00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:11.840 align:middle line:84%
To get the most out of this
sample track, close your eyes,

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:18.450 align:middle line:84%
take some nice deep breaths,
and focus on that pulsing sound.

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:21.900 align:middle line:84%
As we go within and realize
that the consciousness we're

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:26.700 align:middle line:84%
encountering is not that
puny little version created

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:28.440 align:middle line:84%
by the brain that
would have been part

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:30.990 align:middle line:84%
of my old model of brain
produces consciousness,

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:32.860 align:middle line:84%
but it's universal
consciousness.

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:34.560 align:middle line:84%
It is the source
of all that comes

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.310 align:middle line:90%
into existence in this world.

00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:39.809 align:middle line:84%
So meditation is a form
of transcending the veil.

00:38:39.809 --> 00:38:41.350 align:middle line:84%
It's another way of
coming to realize

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:45.210 align:middle line:84%
that the thoughts in our head,
that little linguistic brain,

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:47.100 align:middle line:90%
that voice--

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:49.800 align:middle line:84%
and of course, that's
the voice of logic

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.530 align:middle line:84%
and of rational, scientific
thought and all of that.

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:54.060 align:middle line:84%
But that little
voice, especially

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:56.790 align:middle line:84%
as it pertains to our
ego, is little more

00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:58.380 align:middle line:90%
than a parlor trick.

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:00.810 align:middle line:90%
Consciousness is the observer.

00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:03.240 align:middle line:84%
That's what we can develop
in deep meditation is

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.590 align:middle line:90%
that observer self.

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:07.330 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're talking about the
hard problem of consciousness,

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:11.370 align:middle line:84%
which is the impossibility
of anyone explaining

00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:14.640 align:middle line:84%
the physical brain as the
source of consciousness itself

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.190 align:middle line:84%
or the measurement paradox
in quantum physics,

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:21.120 align:middle line:84%
both of those at the
front edge of the mystery

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:25.440 align:middle line:84%
of modern science take us
right into the observer.

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And the observer or awareness
is the deep mystery.

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we can
develop in meditation,

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:34.800 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I'm such a big
proponent of the work that I

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:38.230 align:middle line:84%
do with Sacred Acoustics
and using sound frequency.

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And slight differences in
sound frequency presented

00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:43.580 align:middle line:84%
to the two ears intersect
in the lower brain

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:46.020 align:middle line:84%
stem in a very
ancient circuit that

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:48.030 align:middle line:84%
arose probably 200
million years ago

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:50.280 align:middle line:90%
in evolutionary neurobiology.

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's taking
that circuit that

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:55.720 align:middle line:84%
then enables conscious
awareness to break free.

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that I was attracted

00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:00.480 align:middle line:84%
to beginning about two
years after my coma when

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:03.810 align:middle line:84%
I came to realize that
slight differential sound

00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:05.460 align:middle line:84%
frequencies to the
two ears can have

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:09.090 align:middle line:84%
a profound effect on
conscious awareness.

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And that is really kind
of the magic behind

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:13.500 align:middle line:90%
what are called binaural beats.

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:15.630 align:middle line:10%
And the most
powerful form of them

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:17.480 align:middle line:10%
comes from the group
Sacred Acoustics,

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:18.870 align:middle line:10%
and I work very
closely with them

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:21.180 align:middle line:10%
on some of the development
of those tones.

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:24.210 align:middle line:84%
But it enables us to
really break free.

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has your
near-death experience convinced

00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:30.530 align:middle line:90%
you of God?

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, it has
convinced me completely of God.

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:34.620 align:middle line:84%
I think what it
has done, though,

00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:38.090 align:middle line:84%
is changed kind of
how I see that God.

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:41.570 align:middle line:84%
I see that God is far more
powerful now than anything

00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:45.597 align:middle line:84%
I thought of before, but also
deeply interconnected with each

00:40:45.597 --> 00:40:46.430 align:middle line:90%
and every one of us.

00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:48.950 align:middle line:84%
The very spark of
awareness, the very thing

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:52.730 align:middle line:84%
that keeps us from being what is
known in philosophical circles

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:55.040 align:middle line:90%
as a philosophical zombie--

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.650 align:middle line:84%
that is, something that
looks and acts and quacks

00:40:57.650 --> 00:41:01.520 align:middle line:84%
just like a human being, but
has no inner mental experience.

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:06.500 align:middle line:84%
The thing that keeps that from
being the case is exactly that,

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:09.470 align:middle line:84%
is that deity, the
sanctity within us,

00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:12.450 align:middle line:84%
which is the creative force
of the entire universe.

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:16.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's not to be diminished
as some little personal God.

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:17.870 align:middle line:90%
This is far grander than that.

00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:22.370 align:middle line:84%
What it shows really is
that we are co-creators

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:24.020 align:middle line:90%
of the universe as it evolves.

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:27.200 align:middle line:84%
We co-create with
that infinite power,

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:28.670 align:middle line:90%
that all-loving power of God.

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And the more we can
align with that love,

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:34.760 align:middle line:84%
with that oneness, with
we're all in this together

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:36.690 align:middle line:84%
and that we need to
take care of each other,

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:38.570 align:middle line:84%
the more aligned
we are with that,

00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:41.930 align:middle line:84%
the more we have escaped
those boundaries of self

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:44.390 align:middle line:84%
that to me are an
indicator of very

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:46.760 align:middle line:90%
early soul in this journey.

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:49.250 align:middle line:84%
I was saying a little
while ago about kind

00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:54.230 align:middle line:84%
of that litmus test that shows
how far along a soul might

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:56.930 align:middle line:84%
be in the journey through
multiple reincarnations

00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:59.570 align:middle line:84%
is the degree to which
they've freed themselves

00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:02.750 align:middle line:84%
from the notion of just being
a little self and an ego

00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:04.670 align:middle line:84%
with all of its petty
little interests.

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:06.740 align:middle line:84%
Those souls are very
early on in the game,

00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:09.080 align:middle line:84%
whereas the more
advanced souls are

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.960 align:middle line:84%
the ones who realize
we're all part of one mind

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.420 align:middle line:90%
and that it's all about love.

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As we wrap this up,
Eben, this final question,

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:21.460 align:middle line:84%
which is probably the most
perplexing of all of them,

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:23.930 align:middle line:90%
how did this come to be?

00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:27.730 align:middle line:84%
How did we get to
where we are, where

00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:31.510 align:middle line:84%
we have this existence; we
have this life after death?

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:33.230 align:middle line:90%
How did it happen?

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, I
think, again, I kind of

00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:40.600 align:middle line:84%
put this all down to being this
beautiful dream of discovery

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.250 align:middle line:90%
of the one mind.

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And the one mind
is living this out

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:47.740 align:middle line:84%
through each and
every one of us,

00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:51.910 align:middle line:84%
this drama, this
beautiful kind of--

00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:53.230 align:middle line:90%
it's a progression, though.

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:55.490 align:middle line:84%
It's a learning
teaching experience.

00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:57.280 align:middle line:90%
So it's not static.

00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's the evolution
of information.

00:42:59.770 --> 00:43:03.280 align:middle line:84%
I would also say it's not a
cold, mechanistic wheel that

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.890 align:middle line:84%
might be part of some
theological systems.

00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:07.820 align:middle line:84%
It really is, from
my point of view,

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:11.230 align:middle line:84%
very much aligned with the
way that Teilhard de Chardin

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:14.470 align:middle line:84%
painted the picture in
"The Phenomenon of the Man"

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:16.360 align:middle line:84%
back in the mid-20th
century, that this

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:18.890 align:middle line:84%
is an evolution
of consciousness,

00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:21.290 align:middle line:84%
and we are all part
of that process.

00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about
learning and growing

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:27.190 align:middle line:84%
and about manifesting that
love and sense of connectedness

00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:28.570 align:middle line:90%
with all that is.

00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:31.630 align:middle line:10%
And I would say that
it very likely--

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:35.350 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the thing that was
clear to me in my journey

00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:40.600 align:middle line:10%
is that we are on the cusp
of really becoming part

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:44.080 align:middle line:10%
of that far grander
cosmic community that

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:48.520 align:middle line:10%
is rich throughout this
cosmos of this kind of growth.

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And human beings to date have
this kind of limited mindset

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:56.290 align:middle line:84%
that we're kind of the
pinnacle of evolution on Earth,

00:43:56.290 --> 00:43:57.850 align:middle line:84%
that we're the
main show in town.

00:43:57.850 --> 00:44:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And yet I believe that
much of this awakening

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:03.580 align:middle line:84%
that I think is part of
human destiny over at least

00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:06.700 align:middle line:84%
the last 3,000
years or so is part

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:09.610 align:middle line:84%
of joining a much bigger
club, and that that

00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:12.190 align:middle line:84%
is why all of this
awakening is happening now.

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I am glad you
have come back to tell us

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:16.167 align:middle line:90%
about the other side.

00:44:16.167 --> 00:44:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, it's a
beautiful gift to share.

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And what I can tell you
is that I get much more

00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:26.890 align:middle line:84%
from all of my fellow
journeyers out there than I

00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:28.750 align:middle line:90%
feel I give to this world.

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I give
presentations, talk

00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:33.430 align:middle line:84%
with other souls
on this journey,

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:36.370 align:middle line:84%
they give me far better
gifts than I feel I deliver.

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:40.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's all a mutual
journey of discovery,

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:42.130 align:middle line:84%
and where we're
all in it together.

00:44:42.130 --> 00:44:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
something that I think

00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:45.735 align:middle line:90%
is cause for great optimism.

00:44:45.735 --> 00:44:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Eben, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:49.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, George,
thank you so much for having me.

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:50.556 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be back.

00:44:50.556 --> 00:44:53.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A neurosurgeon
who died and had

00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:55.180 align:middle line:84%
that capability of
coming back to tell us

00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:58.030 align:middle line:90%
all what's on the other side.

00:44:58.030 --> 00:45:01.750 align:middle line:84%
As he said, we're in
no rush to get there.

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:03.730 align:middle line:84%
But when it does
happen, at least

00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:05.410 align:middle line:84%
we'll have a better
understanding

00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:07.120 align:middle line:84%
that you don't
have to be scared.

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:10.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
