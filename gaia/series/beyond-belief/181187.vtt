00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.570 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.460 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory with
our special guest,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.520 align:middle line:10%
Michael Jaye, a former
army officer who

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.870 align:middle line:10%
taught at West Point.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.450 align:middle line:10%
He taught mathematics
and has written a book

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.400 align:middle line:10%
called "The Worldwide Flood."

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.650 align:middle line:84%
How did you get
involved in studying

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.649 align:middle line:84%
the worldwide flood, which
happened 12,000 some years ago?

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHAEL JAYE: Yes, sir.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.230 align:middle line:10%
So I just retired
from West Point,

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.372 align:middle line:10%
and we moved out to
Monterey, California.

00:00:51.372 --> 00:00:52.400 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: California.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.300 align:middle line:10%
>>JAYE: And someone
who had known me

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.070 align:middle line:10%
from my undergraduate
days suggested

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.550 align:middle line:10%
that I take a look at Monterey
Canyon right off the coast.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.250 align:middle line:84%
Now we moved there
just about the time

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.860 align:middle line:84%
when Google was making
its maps available to us.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: And so I
turned on Google Maps.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at this
image of Monterey Canyon.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.700 align:middle line:90%
And what I saw raised--

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.309 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Red flags?

00:01:19.309 --> 00:01:20.850 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: --some
interesting questions.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.660 align:middle line:10%
First, there are
submerged rivers

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.550 align:middle line:10%
underneath two miles of water.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.410 align:middle line:90%
I said, how can that happen?

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'd sort of known that
science holds that there

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.940 align:middle line:90%
was never a worldwide flood.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a
disparity between the two.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
I'm a scientist.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.150 align:middle line:90%
Let's look into it.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not a geologist.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.366 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: I'm not a geologist.

00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:43.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But a
scientist, like this.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.530 align:middle line:90%
What are we looking at here?

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.520 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: So you can see the
Monterey Peninsula sort of just

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.720 align:middle line:90%
right of center of the image.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And we can see
what appears to be

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.750 align:middle line:90%
a river system that flows out.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.050 align:middle line:90%
We can see a meander.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.070 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Just to the
east of Monterey

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.800 align:middle line:84%
is the Salinas Valley,
which was once a lake.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And that lake drained down
the continental margin,

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.690 align:middle line:84%
which is approximately two miles
high, and created that system.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.754 align:middle line:84%
That's water that carved
that, at least so I thought

00:02:12.754 --> 00:02:13.920 align:middle line:90%
it was water that carved it.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.503 align:middle line:84%
And we can see that there is a
system that came from the Santa

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Cruz area, and it merged in
with the river, the main system,

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.340 align:middle line:90%
down to the right.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.756 align:middle line:10%
And sort of lower from
Monterey is the Big Sur area.

00:02:28.756 --> 00:02:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And we can see all the drainage
is there and how they combined.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.645 align:middle line:90%
And one of them flowed out.

00:02:32.645 --> 00:02:34.020 align:middle line:84%
Now we can't quite
see it so well

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.030 align:middle line:84%
because in the
abyssal plain, it's

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.010 align:middle line:90%
flat pretty much down there.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's all filled
in with sand,

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.970 align:middle line:84%
but that system also
merged with the main one.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And we can't see the end of it,
but it flowed over 100 miles.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:46.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.160 align:middle line:84%
When you looked
at this, Michael,

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.100 align:middle line:84%
tell me what the
significance was

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.880 align:middle line:84%
of what you saw that
was so mind boggling

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.820 align:middle line:90%
from what others have seen.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Well, ah,
so this is new data.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.960 align:middle line:84%
This is the first
time that we humans

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.610 align:middle line:90%
could see into the bathymetry.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.590 align:middle line:84%
We can see the topography
of submerged landscapes.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.090 align:middle line:84%
It's the first time
we could see it.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that's what
we were looking at,

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.490 align:middle line:90%
submerged landscapes.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:12.450 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: So that's new data.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Those are
submerged landscapes.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.690 align:middle line:84%
The first time we
could see it was

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.280 align:middle line:90%
when Google published its map.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
that tell you?

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.810 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: So from a historical,
from a scientific standpoint,

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.000 align:middle line:90%
what we're--

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.710 align:middle line:84%
Marcelo Gleiser
has a book called

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.100 align:middle line:90%
"The Island of Knowledge."

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And one of his
chapters is titled

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.090 align:middle line:84%
"The Transformative Power of
a New Observational Tool."

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And what we'll see is that
this event is equivalent.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.490 align:middle line:84%
It falls into his
classification because the tool

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.600 align:middle line:84%
that he talks about in this
chapter is the telescope.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.877 align:middle line:84%
And the paradigm that
existed at the time

00:03:50.877 --> 00:03:52.960 align:middle line:84%
was that the Earth was the
center of the universe.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.140 align:middle line:84%
So this is a new
observational tool,

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.580 align:middle line:84%
the new observational tool that
undid a prevailing paradigm.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.800 align:middle line:84%
It was a scientific
revolution, was the telescope.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And the telescope
allowed Galileo

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.885 align:middle line:84%
to see that the moons of Jupiter
went around Jupiter, all right.

00:04:09.885 --> 00:04:10.685 align:middle line:90%
It was an anomaly.

00:04:10.685 --> 00:04:11.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.828 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: It was an
observation or it

00:04:12.828 --> 00:04:15.210 align:middle line:84%
was a piece of data that
didn't fit into the prevailing

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:16.010 align:middle line:90%
paradigm.

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Point is is that
the observation,

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.999 align:middle line:84%
the data contradicted
theory that the Earth

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:23.290 align:middle line:90%
was the center of the universe.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.832 align:middle line:84%
And so the theory
had to be rejected.

00:04:24.832 --> 00:04:25.631 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:26.520 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: And it was.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.540 align:middle line:84%
So now here we are 200 years
after geologists decided

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.290 align:middle line:90%
that there was never a flood.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.020 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about
that in a moment.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Big mistake.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.890 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: It's a big mistake
in the history of science.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.000 align:middle line:84%
I'll be borne out in
time with that claim.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.595 align:middle line:84%
So 200 years ago,
geologists decided

00:04:44.595 --> 00:04:46.260 align:middle line:90%
that there wasn't a flood.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And there's been no
contradictory evidence--

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.230 align:middle line:84%
we'll talk about that-- until
the publication of those maps.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.770 align:middle line:84%
So that's why Google Maps
are the historical equivalent

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.510 align:middle line:90%
of Galileo's telescope.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How could the
Bible depict the flood

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.570 align:middle line:84%
and then geologists
refute it 200 years ago?

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Well, that's a
fascinating part of the story.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.850 align:middle line:84%
First of all, flood traditions,
the story of a flood

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.479 align:middle line:90%
is not just in the Bible.

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's everywhere.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: They're
ubiquitous in cultures

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.060 align:middle line:90%
from around the planet.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Correct.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: It was a big event,
this contradiction of science

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.580 align:middle line:84%
and the human
narrative tradition.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.302 align:middle line:84%
So the question then really
is, why do we believe

00:05:26.302 --> 00:05:27.510 align:middle line:90%
that there was never a flood?

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.230 align:middle line:90%
Why does geology hold that?

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.412 align:middle line:84%
This is where I started
digging into geology.

00:05:33.412 --> 00:05:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because you
believe there was a flood.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.890 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Well, at the time I'm
a scientist, and I was told,

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.110 align:middle line:84%
I believed, I had in
the back of my mind

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.510 align:middle line:90%
that there was never a flood.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.710 align:middle line:90%
So I wanted to know why.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that we believe
that there was never a flood?

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.360 align:middle line:90%
And the story goes like this.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.440 align:middle line:84%
It's the early
decades of the 1800s.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And the question before
science-- science

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:00.060 align:middle line:84%
is just getting formalized as
organized societies, publishing

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.350 align:middle line:90%
materials.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And at the Geological Society
of London, its chair at the time

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.450 align:middle line:84%
was a gentleman
named Adam Sedgwick.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And not only was he the
chair of the society,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.229 align:middle line:84%
he was also a
professor at Cambridge.

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And he was also an
ordained minister.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, jeez.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.120 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: In the
Church of England.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And so Sedgwick set about
Europe with his colleagues,

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.690 align:middle line:84%
and they're looking for
the signs of a flood.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Now I live on a river, and
we've had a lot of rain

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.400 align:middle line:90%
back in Pennsylvania.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.075 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:06:29.075 --> 00:06:29.875 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:06:29.875 --> 00:06:32.670 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: And when the rivers
flood, they bring material up,

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.200 align:middle line:90%
and they deposit it.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And so these geologists
set about Europe

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.110 align:middle line:84%
looking for a common deposit
layer left by the flood.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.070 align:middle line:90%
And they couldn't find it.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.720 align:middle line:84%
So because they
couldn't find it--

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No flood.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.905 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: They conclude that
there was never a flood.

00:06:47.905 --> 00:06:50.634 align:middle line:84%
So in his 1831 address
to his society,

00:06:50.634 --> 00:06:51.800 align:middle line:90%
Sedgwick said the following.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.508 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to quote
him as close as I can.

00:06:53.508 --> 00:06:56.300 align:middle line:84%
He said, "The vast
masses of diluvial gravel

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.270 align:middle line:84%
do not belong to one violent
and transitory period.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:00.910 align:middle line:84%
It was the most
unwarranted conclusion.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.600 align:middle line:84%
We had assumed the
contemporaneity

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.000 align:middle line:84%
of all the superficial
gravels on the earth.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Having been myself a believer
and the best of my power

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.070 align:middle line:84%
a propagator of what I now
regard as a philosophic heresy,

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.820 align:middle line:84%
I think it right that
I read my recantation."

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.780 align:middle line:90%
So he addressed his society.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Here's a professor, an
ordained minister saying,

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.980 align:middle line:90%
I no longer believe in a flood.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Whoa, which was
dramatic at that time,

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:25.070 align:middle line:90%
wasn't it?

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.870 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: It was.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And it remains
celebrated as the triumph

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.990 align:middle line:90%
of science over religion.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because by
saying that, you're

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.430 align:middle line:84%
saying that the
Bible is inaccurate.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.230 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Correct.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if it's
wrong about the flood,

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.040 align:middle line:84%
it could be wrong
about everything.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: So in a book called
"The Flamingo's Smile,"

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:47.750 align:middle line:84%
I think it is, the author talks
about Sedgwick and the courage

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.300 align:middle line:84%
that it took for
Sedgwick to make

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.840 align:middle line:84%
this recantation because he
was an ordained minister.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it
courage or stupidity?

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.792 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Oh no, it was
courage on his part.

00:07:57.792 --> 00:07:57.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was courage.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:00.170 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: I mean, to renounce
his belief in something

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:01.610 align:middle line:90%
that he professed.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:03.540 align:middle line:90%
So that was a big event.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:07.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you set out to
prove the flood did occur.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Well, so-- not yet.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.150 align:middle line:84%
I guess we'll get
right to it then.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.420 align:middle line:84%
What is the problem with
what Sedgwick concluded?

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.840 align:middle line:84%
So I looked at these maps,
and they led me to realize--

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:25.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't get
carved water or these rivers

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.390 align:middle line:90%
submerged.

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:27.830 align:middle line:84%
The density of
water is too much.

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.390 align:middle line:84%
You can't have
concentrated flows.

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:32.570 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there's large
scale flows, but not

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:36.140 align:middle line:84%
concentrated flows going out
hundreds of miles subsurface.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's not just
Monterey, it's everywhere.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.289 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: They're
around the planet.

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:42.785 align:middle line:90%
So I set out to find out why.

00:08:42.785 --> 00:08:45.210 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that we believe
that there was never a flood?

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And so as I've
described, Sedgwick

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:49.506 align:middle line:84%
is the person who is
responsible for the belief.

00:08:49.506 --> 00:08:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And it was celebrated
as a triumph of science

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.930 align:middle line:84%
over religion, and it
remains so to this day.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they come up with
these reasons and rationale

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.710 align:middle line:90%
to destroy the Bible?

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.830 align:middle line:84%
Or do they really believe
that there was no flood?

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:06.189 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Science believes
that there was never a flood.

00:09:06.189 --> 00:09:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
still believe that.

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:10.742 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Correct,
to this day science

00:09:10.742 --> 00:09:12.200 align:middle line:84%
holds that there
was never a flood.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.016 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, if there was
a flood, when did it occur?

00:09:15.016 --> 00:09:16.890 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Well, can we
get to that in a minute?

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:20.562 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like to talk about
before that is the error.

00:09:20.562 --> 00:09:21.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Their mistake?

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.930 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Sedgwick's mistake.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:23.905 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:09:23.905 --> 00:09:25.280 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: So he said
about Europe--

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.680 align:middle line:84%
and actually, there were
geologists in America looking

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:28.930 align:middle line:90%
for this common deposit layer.

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:29.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:30.890 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Couldn't be found.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:33.860 align:middle line:84%
He concluded that there was
never a worldwide flood.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:35.150 align:middle line:90%
It's the wrong conclusion.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:36.860 align:middle line:84%
From the evidence,
the only thing

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.800 align:middle line:84%
that he could have concluded
is that where we are now,

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.740 align:middle line:84%
presently exposed
landscapes were never

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.360 align:middle line:90%
subjected to a flood.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:48.110 align:middle line:84%
That is a true statement, and
no one would argue with it.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Where we are now
was never flooded.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.210 align:middle line:84%
That is not the same thing as
saying that there was never

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:54.380 align:middle line:90%
a worldwide flood.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.760 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
water out there.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.520 align:middle line:84%
But Sedgwick passed
judgment on landscapes

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.096 align:middle line:90%
that he could not observe.

00:10:00.096 --> 00:10:02.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, so what
are we looking at here?

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: All right, so
these are two images.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.300 align:middle line:90%
They're the same.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.360 align:middle line:84%
The upper one does not
have my drawing on it.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: But the upper one is
the western Mediterranean.

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And we can see just above
center there is a drainage there

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:20.840 align:middle line:84%
that is almost equivalent
size to Monterey Canyon.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And if you look all the way
around the Mediterranean,

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.870 align:middle line:84%
you'll see, even off the
coast of Africa, the north

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.390 align:middle line:84%
coast of Africa, you
can see these drainages

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:33.300 align:middle line:84%
that went down into what
was a lake or a large sea.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And so in the lower image,
it's the same as the upper one,

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:39.487 align:middle line:84%
but I just sketched in as close
as I can the former coastline.

00:10:39.487 --> 00:10:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the
white line around there?

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.361 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Correct, correct.

00:10:42.361 --> 00:10:43.910 align:middle line:84%
So it sketches the
former coastline.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:45.710 align:middle line:90%
And this is published, actually.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:48.230 align:middle line:90%
This was published in 2009.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And geologists
recognized that the Med

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.980 align:middle line:84%
flooded through the
Strait of Gibraltar, which

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:54.780 align:middle line:90%
is in this paper.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.480 align:middle line:84%
They had the timing off,
but nonetheless they

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.160 align:middle line:84%
get the fundamental
correct, that there

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.070 align:middle line:84%
was a body of water down
in the Mediterranean

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:05.680 align:middle line:84%
prior to the flood and that
these systems, these drainages,

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.570 align:middle line:84%
just flowed down and carved over
millions, in tens of millions

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:13.100 align:middle line:84%
of years, they carved and
drained into this former sea.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So clearly
this region had a flood.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:16.700 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: It did.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.080 align:middle line:90%
And geologists recognize it.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And what is vital in this
image and the outline

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:28.460 align:middle line:84%
of the former coastline
is that the carving,

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.800 align:middle line:84%
the erosion from
these systems did not

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.780 align:middle line:90%
go beyond the former coastline.

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:37.010 align:middle line:90%


00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.620 align:middle line:84%
The subsurface
carving doesn't exist.

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:45.470 align:middle line:84%
When these systems hit
that lake or that sea,

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:46.550 align:middle line:90%
the carving stopped.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:49.340 align:middle line:84%
The erosive power
of flowing water

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:55.220 align:middle line:84%
stopped because the water loses
all of its momentum in the sea.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And this happened--

00:11:56.410 --> 00:12:01.759 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Oh, this is over
tens of millions of years,

00:12:01.759 --> 00:12:02.925 align:middle line:90%
the drainage systems formed.

00:12:02.925 --> 00:12:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
floods have we had?

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.370 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Well,
certainly one big one.

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:09.365 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get to
that in a second.

00:12:09.365 --> 00:12:12.150 align:middle line:84%
In fact, now if we could
put the Gulf of Alaska up.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:middle line:90%
So here's the Gulf of Alaska.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.060 align:middle line:90%
And what do we see?

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.350 align:middle line:90%
Well, we see very similar.

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:19.050 align:middle line:84%
We see river systems that
came off of the-- in fact,

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:24.410 align:middle line:84%
you can actually see
systems where present water,

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:25.700 align:middle line:90%
present drainages are.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.160 align:middle line:84%
You can see where they flow
through the continental margin

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.210 align:middle line:90%
down the shelf.

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And this upward,
the northernmost

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:34.840 align:middle line:84%
of the system, that's
500 miles from--

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's huge.

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Now geologists
want us to believe

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:44.810 align:middle line:84%
that these concentrated
flows continued

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:47.450 align:middle line:90%
500 miles, carving underwater.

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:49.010 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible,
when they've already

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:51.860 align:middle line:84%
recognized in a previous
paper that the carving stopped

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.220 align:middle line:90%
subsurface.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.490 align:middle line:84%
So geologists have
got a problem.

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:58.519 align:middle line:84%
So really what we
come down to is,

00:12:58.519 --> 00:12:59.810 align:middle line:90%
what's the source of the flood?

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:01.976 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are these
little bumps I'm looking at?

00:13:01.976 --> 00:13:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Those are
submerged volcanoes.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.540 align:middle line:90%
And which are kind of neat.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.377 align:middle line:10%
In the lower images,
down in this--

00:13:07.377 --> 00:13:08.960 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Each one
is a little volcano?

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:09.835 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: I believe so.

00:13:09.835 --> 00:13:12.790 align:middle line:84%
You can see in the very
southeast of this image,

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:16.130 align:middle line:84%
you can see where a river came
down, wound its way around one

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:19.340 align:middle line:84%
volcano and around-- it
shushed its way around the two.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.400 align:middle line:84%
Now we're supposed to believe
that subsurface flows shushed

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.570 align:middle line:90%
their way around mountains?

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:25.700 align:middle line:84%
In fact, even to the north,
you can see other ones

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:26.810 align:middle line:90%
that meander back and forth.

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this is all
underwater right now?

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:29.466 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Absolutely.

00:13:29.466 --> 00:13:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How are we able
to see these things?

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:35.640 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Ah, so Google
makes this available to us.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.790 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: And Google has--

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:40.332 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, from above you
would just see ocean, right?

00:13:40.332 --> 00:13:41.290 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: That's correct.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:41.635 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:13:41.635 --> 00:13:43.640 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: So that's the
big news in these.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:48.330 align:middle line:84%
Now we can see the topography
of the submerged landscapes.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.459 align:middle line:84%
And so that's under two
miles or more of water.

00:13:51.459 --> 00:13:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And so the uppermost
system float out

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.040 align:middle line:84%
to where the Aleutians
are, where there was once--

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:56.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:56.950 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Now what's
interesting about this is we,

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:00.378 align:middle line:84%
unlike the Mediterranean,
we can't really

00:14:00.378 --> 00:14:02.540 align:middle line:84%
tell where the
former coastline was.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:05.930 align:middle line:84%
But these systems, prior to
the flood, for tens of millions

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:09.950 align:middle line:84%
of years, they carved their way
down and drained upland areas

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:12.606 align:middle line:90%
into their collection basins.

00:14:12.606 --> 00:14:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now the fact
that this is happening,

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Michael, tell me the
significance of all this.

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:19.260 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean to us?

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.560 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: It means that
geology is wrong.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And because geology is wrong
in a fundamental tenant,

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:26.882 align:middle line:84%
that means that anthropology
is going to be wrong.

00:14:26.882 --> 00:14:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Robert
Ballard, of course,

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:30.080 align:middle line:90%
is a scientist and researcher.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And he believes the
worldwide flood occurred.

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:34.220 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.290 align:middle line:90%
Then I'll get your comments.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:40.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Our journey to investigate
the story of Noah and his ark

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.900 align:middle line:10%
led us to the banks of
the Black Sea in Turkey,

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:46.400 align:middle line:10%
where we heard that tantalizing
clues were being uncovered

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:50.300 align:middle line:10%
by Dr. Robert Ballard, one of
the world's leading underwater

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:51.350 align:middle line:10%
archaeologists.

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:53.420 align:middle line:10%
>> All right, let's
get closer down.

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.930 align:middle line:10%
>> We were astonished to learn
that he believes the biblical

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:59.210 align:middle line:10%
flood could have
actually happened.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:01.020 align:middle line:10%
And he says he can find proof.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:01.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Something here.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:02.520 align:middle line:10%
What's this?

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.320 align:middle line:10%
What's this?

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.500 align:middle line:10%
>> If you were to discover
definitively something that

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:11.000 align:middle line:10%
could pin science
on the Noah story,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.690 align:middle line:10%
how fantastic would that be?

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:14.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, it would
be pretty cool.

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:16.160 align:middle line:10%
And I'm confident we can.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.150 align:middle line:10%
We just have to look.

he's traveling even
further back in time.

of money in the water,

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:31.490 align:middle line:10%
and obviously can't wait to
see what it's going to see.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:34.560 align:middle line:10%
We talk about the floods
of our living history.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.800 align:middle line:10%
Boy, they don't compare at all
to the floods of ancient time.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.770 align:middle line:10%
The question is, was there
a mother of all floods?

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:42.570 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:45.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Ballard thinks there was,
and he's testing a controversial

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:49.260 align:middle line:10%
theory that the biblical
flood happened here.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:50.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Why the Black Sea?

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:52.860 align:middle line:10%
Well, because the
Black Sea appears

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:57.240 align:middle line:10%
to have had a giant flood,
not just a slow moving,

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:01.200 align:middle line:10%
advancing rise of sea level,
but a really big flood.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.510 align:middle line:10%
And people were living there.

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:07.980 align:middle line:10%
>> The theory goes this was once
an isolated freshwater lake.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.740 align:middle line:10%
But then when the
Mediterranean swelled--

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:15.000 align:middle line:10%
>> At some magic moment, it
broke through and flooded this

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.950 align:middle line:10%
place violently.

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:20.370 align:middle line:10%
>> What did Noah or the people
who lived there during what you

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:23.460 align:middle line:10%
believe to be this huge
flood, what did they see?

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.890 align:middle line:10%
>> It probably was a bad day.

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:29.280 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of real estate,
150,000 square kilometers

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.230 align:middle line:10%
of land went under.

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:34.020 align:middle line:10%
>> And 400 feet
below the surface,

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:37.380 align:middle line:10%
Ballard believes he's found
proof of that catastrophic

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:38.240 align:middle line:10%
event.

I love it.

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:43.100 align:middle line:10%
>> They unearthed an
ancient shoreline.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.415 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, we've actually
dated it about 5,000 BC.

00:16:46.415 --> 00:16:48.540 align:middle line:10%
>> And that is about the
time that the Bible said--

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:48.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Exactly.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.700 align:middle line:10%

Great Flood happened.

>> Wow.

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:53.850 align:middle line:90%

>>NOORY: What do you
think of that, Michael?

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.440 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Well, I'm not going
to argue with Mr. Ballard.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.540 align:middle line:90%
He is famous.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:59.460 align:middle line:84%
I've actually tried
to get him to--

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:00.340 align:middle line:90%
he's got equipment.

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.730 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: And I would like to--

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:03.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tap into that.

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:04.660 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Exactly.

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:08.222 align:middle line:84%
Because there is a place that
will put an end to everything.

00:17:08.222 --> 00:17:10.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is he accurate
with what you just saw?

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Well, the Mediterranean,
as geologists have published,

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:17.460 align:middle line:84%
the Mediterranean did
flood through the Strait

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:18.585 align:middle line:90%
of Gibraltar.

00:17:18.585 --> 00:17:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Black Sea.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:21.569 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: So it flooded
the Black Sea.

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:23.280 align:middle line:90%
That much I will agree to.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.661 align:middle line:90%
The time, no.

00:17:24.661 --> 00:17:26.452 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think it
happened before that?

00:17:26.452 --> 00:17:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: It was 12,800 years ago.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:29.670 align:middle line:90%
And it was not just that.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:33.870 align:middle line:84%
That's a small flood compared
to what I'm talking about.

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:38.400 align:middle line:84%
We've seen now rivers
that are submerged

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.114 align:middle line:90%
in more than two miles of water.

00:17:40.114 --> 00:17:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you believe
it was a bigger flood?

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:42.988 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Oh, absolutely.

00:17:42.988 --> 00:17:45.900 align:middle line:90%
It flooded the planet.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.430 align:middle line:90%
We're in a whole new--

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
the Noah flood,

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.048 align:middle line:90%
the one you're talking about?

00:17:50.048 --> 00:17:51.402 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Sure, it's the same.

00:17:51.402 --> 00:17:55.045 align:middle line:90%
It's the same flood.

00:17:55.045 --> 00:17:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Whether he had
pre-knowledge and had

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.560 align:middle line:84%
built an ark, that's
a different show.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Well, I actually--

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.610 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to get into this.

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:07.410 align:middle line:84%
But I think Noah was working
in the Mediterranean.

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:08.730 align:middle line:90%
And that sea that we saw--

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:11.381 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: --that is already
recognized of having existed.

00:18:11.381 --> 00:18:13.110 align:middle line:84%
I think that Noah
was down there.

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And when we talk about the event
that actually caused the flood,

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.460 align:middle line:84%
then we'll see,
yeah, it's probably

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.880 align:middle line:90%
just a legend from that event.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.410 align:middle line:84%
Because there was
a sea down there,

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:29.490 align:middle line:84%
he could have been
transporting whatever.

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:30.690 align:middle line:90%
He may have existed.

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:32.045 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point, good point.

00:18:32.045 --> 00:18:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Now we have heard
all kinds of things

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:37.020 align:middle line:90%
about the cause of the flood.

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Some say an asteroid
hit into the ocean

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:41.700 align:middle line:90%
and caused this massive water.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:45.360 align:middle line:84%
What do you think it was,
rain, just constant rain?

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: No, no, no, no.

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:49.464 align:middle line:90%
No, it cannot be.

00:18:49.464 --> 00:18:50.880 align:middle line:84%
Again, what we're
going to do now,

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.090 align:middle line:90%
we're going do an exercise.

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And the exercise is, OK, let's
remove two miles of water.

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:58.170 align:middle line:90%
We have to.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:00.150 align:middle line:84%
That two miles of water
all around the planet,

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:03.380 align:middle line:84%
at least two miles of
water, let's remove it.

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And by removing it, we
now allow those rivers

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.070 align:middle line:84%
to be exposed, the ones
that were now submerged.

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:09.750 align:middle line:84%
We just saw them in
the Mediterranean.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:11.784 align:middle line:84%
We saw them right off
the coast of California.

00:19:11.784 --> 00:19:13.200 align:middle line:84%
We saw them in the
Gulf of Alaska.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.900 align:middle line:84%
They're all over the planet,
these drainage systems that

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.060 align:middle line:84%
are under two miles
or more of water.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:21.000 align:middle line:84%
They had to have been
exposed at one time.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.650 align:middle line:84%
They were exposed for
tens of millions of years.

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:26.150 align:middle line:84%
So the question then is,
what's the source of the water?

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:27.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What caused it?

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:28.080 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: That's right.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.100 align:middle line:84%
So we have to talk about
a couple of things.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.620 align:middle line:90%
One is the Younger Dryas event.

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Geologists recognize that
12,800 years ago, a major event

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:38.329 align:middle line:90%
happened to the Earth.

00:19:38.329 --> 00:19:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And in this event,
first of all, they

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:41.880 align:middle line:90%
know it was a cosmic impact.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.000 align:middle line:84%
They know it was a cosmic impact
because there was a micro--

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.030 align:middle line:84%
so when there's a cosmic
impact, the velocity

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:52.810 align:middle line:84%
is so high that the
interaction with the land

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:55.540 align:middle line:84%
causes the creation of
microscopic diamonds,

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:56.860 align:middle line:90%
nanodiamonds.

00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And there is a nanodiamond layer
found throughout the planet.

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:03.820 align:middle line:84%
So this had to have
been a huge impact.

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, it probably,
if we think about this,

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:08.320 align:middle line:84%
it couldn't have
been a comet on ice

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:11.260 align:middle line:90%
because a comet is mostly ice.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Ice on ice, there's not
enough carbon there.

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:14.220 align:middle line:90%
It's H2O, H2O.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.184 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Where's the carbon?

00:20:16.184 --> 00:20:17.850 align:middle line:84%
All right, but if we
take another object

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:20.020 align:middle line:90%
and it hits the landscape--

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.270 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to see in a
moment it's a huge object.

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:24.149 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think it
hit land or the ocean?

00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: It hit
formerly exposed land.

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:25.975 align:middle line:90%
It did.

00:20:25.975 --> 00:20:26.775 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:20:26.775 --> 00:20:28.870 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: And again,
the oceans are gone.

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:31.150 align:middle line:90%
The oceans are new.

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:33.520 align:middle line:84%
The oceans are, as
we experience them,

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.460 align:middle line:90%
they're only 12,800 years old.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.717 align:middle line:90%
It is this cosmic impact--

00:20:37.717 --> 00:20:38.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That caused that?

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: That is going
to bring the flood.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to do it in
a very short period of time.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:45.830 align:middle line:10%
Because it's happening in
such a short period of time,

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:48.530 align:middle line:10%
all of those submerged rivers
are going to be preserved.

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:49.696 align:middle line:90%
They're very well preserved.

00:20:49.696 --> 00:20:52.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was this impact a
planet killer at the time,

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:52.920 align:middle line:90%
in your opinion?

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: It was an
extinction event.

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:55.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was.

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: It nearly killed us.

00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:57.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: OK, so we have to
talk about-- so not only

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:00.907 align:middle line:90%
was there a cosmic impact.

00:21:00.907 --> 00:21:02.740 align:middle line:10%
They know that there
were major extinctions.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:09.146 align:middle line:84%
There was a period of intense
cold right after this impact.

00:21:09.146 --> 00:21:10.270 align:middle line:90%
They know that there were--

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's because the
sun was blotted out, right?

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:15.820 align:middle line:10%
>>JAYE: Well, there's
going to be so much ice

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:19.330 align:middle line:10%
introduced that
that's a heat sink.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:21.470 align:middle line:10%
And that's going to take
a while to melt the stuff.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:22.270 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:23.920 align:middle line:10%
>>JAYE: And that heat
sink from the ice

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:29.900 align:middle line:10%
is largely attributable to the
dramatic drop in temperature.

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:33.460 align:middle line:84%
There were also huge
changes to ecosystems

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:37.494 align:middle line:84%
that lead to major forests
are going to become extinct.

00:21:37.494 --> 00:21:38.410 align:middle line:90%
They're going to burn.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So they know that there
are major forest fires.

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:43.945 align:middle line:84%
This is a major event,
the Younger Dryas event.

00:21:43.945 --> 00:21:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
let's look at that first.

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.200 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Between 15,000
and 11,000 years ago,

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:53.410 align:middle line:10%
the Earth and its inhabitants
experienced a series

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:55.840 align:middle line:10%
of climatic fluctuations.

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.810 align:middle line:84%
During the Ice Age, it
had been extremely cold,

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:01.660 align:middle line:84%
with continental glaciers
extending much further

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:02.870 align:middle line:90%
than they do today.

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:04.840 align:middle line:90%
But the climates began to warm.

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.950 align:middle line:10%
Temperatures then
suddenly reverted back

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:09.010 align:middle line:10%
and there was a short
cold spell as temperatures

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:12.640 align:middle line:10%
plunged, an event known
today as the Younger Dryas.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.650 align:middle line:84%
When the Earth
finally warmed again,

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:17.740 align:middle line:84%
the last ice age
officially ended.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:20.030 align:middle line:10%
During this time
in North America,

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:23.410 align:middle line:10%
a massive 95% of
megafauna became extinct,

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:25.090 align:middle line:10%
these being
predominantly mammals

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:28.450 align:middle line:10%
with body weights greater
than 25 to 50 kilograms.

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:31.150 align:middle line:10%
But small animals
were also affected.

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:33.670 align:middle line:10%
North America was the most
strongly affected area,

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:36.700 align:middle line:10%
but the events also
impacted Europe, Siberia,

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:38.470 align:middle line:10%
and South America.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:41.200 align:middle line:84%
As we know from ice core
data from Greenland,

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.330 align:middle line:84%
the Younger Dryas
began and ended

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:46.630 align:middle line:84%
very abruptly, which implies
an event or two events which

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:49.750 align:middle line:84%
took place, which must have
been external forces that

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:52.840 align:middle line:84%
caused these huge effects
on global temperature.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:56.620 align:middle line:10%
The start of the Younger
Dryas was around 10,900 BC,

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.800 align:middle line:10%
ending in
approximately 9,700 BC,

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.660 align:middle line:10%
which was a change that
may have taken place

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:03.670 align:middle line:10%
in as little as three years.

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:07.030 align:middle line:84%
We cannot, with any clarity,
pinpoint this in detail.

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:08.860 align:middle line:84%
But is it even
possible that whatever

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:12.220 align:middle line:84%
happened could have
literally happened overnight?

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:13.690 align:middle line:10%
So how do we
explain this pattern

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:15.730 align:middle line:10%
of abrupt climate shifts?

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:18.850 align:middle line:84%
Many people, such as Randall
Carlson and Graham Hancock,

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:21.220 align:middle line:84%
hypothesized that
comets were responsible,

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.110 align:middle line:84%
hitting the land
or shallow seas,

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:25.390 align:middle line:84%
or exploding above
the Earth's surface,

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:29.360 align:middle line:84%
scattering huge amounts of dust
and debris into the atmosphere.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.330 align:middle line:84%
This hypothesis means
that the sun's light

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:34.240 align:middle line:84%
would have been blocked out,
resulting in a global cooling

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.740 align:middle line:90%
event.

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Although this
hypothesis may be true,

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:39.730 align:middle line:84%
researchers such as
Dr. Robert Schoch

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:42.880 align:middle line:84%
say there is not enough evidence
to support a comet impact

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.940 align:middle line:84%
hypothesis, a claim that
advocates of this theory

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:47.489 align:middle line:90%
strongly refute.

00:23:47.489 --> 00:23:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what do
you say, Michael?

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:50.350 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Well, it wasn't a comet.

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:51.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was not a comet.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:52.420 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Comets are too small.

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Comets are on the order of 10
to 15 kilometers in diameter.

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:56.428 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This was
bigger than that?

00:23:56.428 --> 00:23:57.700 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Oh my goodness.

00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.380 align:middle line:84%
This is going to
deliver the oceans.

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:02.847 align:middle line:90%
So it had to be a large impact.

00:24:02.847 --> 00:24:04.930 align:middle line:84%
So we have to talk about
comets and how they form.

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:05.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Or how we might
perceive that they form.

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And so that brings us
out to the Oort Cloud.

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And the Oort Cloud is far
away from all solar systems,

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:16.220 align:middle line:90%
very, very cold region.

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's a cloud, where it's
assumed that there is ice

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:20.980 align:middle line:90%
and other smaller particles.

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's a cloud
because these objects

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.510 align:middle line:90%
are in gravitational stasis.

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:28.900 align:middle line:84%
There's not enough pull
from any one object

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.270 align:middle line:90%
to start amassing other ones.

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:32.510 align:middle line:90%
But let's take an asteroid.

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:34.385 align:middle line:84%
So now an asteroid is
different from a comet.

00:24:34.385 --> 00:24:36.858 align:middle line:84%
An asteroid is a very solid
object, iron, manganese.

00:24:36.858 --> 00:24:38.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it could be
small, could be large.

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:39.815 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Well,
we're going to take

00:24:39.815 --> 00:24:42.340 align:middle line:84%
one-- let's take one that's
100 miles in diameter.

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to put it
out into the Oort Cloud.

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.120 align:middle line:84%
So now it becomes the
gravitational center

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:47.920 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:48.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: The Oort Cloud.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many miles is
the Oort Cloud from here?

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:52.315 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Oh, I have no idea.

00:24:52.315 --> 00:24:53.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Millions, right?

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:54.130 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: It's millions.

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:55.671 align:middle line:84%
And it's outside of
our solar system.

00:24:55.671 --> 00:24:56.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:00.310 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: So we take this massive
object and we introduce it.

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:03.017 align:middle line:84%
And how this massive object
gets out there, I don't know.

00:25:03.017 --> 00:25:03.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Encaptured.

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: So what
it does over time

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:08.800 align:middle line:84%
is it starts bringing
in these ice chunks,

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.560 align:middle line:84%
but they don't come in at 9.8
meters per second squared.

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:14.350 align:middle line:84%
They're not accelerating
like Earth's acceleration

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:16.699 align:middle line:84%
because the gravitational
acceleration's

00:25:16.699 --> 00:25:17.740 align:middle line:90%
proportional to the mass.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:21.910 align:middle line:84%
And the mass of this object
is fractional of the Earth.

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:25.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's like 1/100 of the
acceleration or the velocities.

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:27.700 align:middle line:84%
So these ice chunks
are coming in,

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:31.060 align:middle line:84%
and they're coming in from
all directions over time.

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:32.230 align:middle line:90%
And we get a sphere.

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:34.729 align:middle line:84%
And this sphere is sitting out
there for who knows how long,

00:25:34.729 --> 00:25:36.190 align:middle line:90%
billions of years.

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:39.496 align:middle line:90%
And 70,000 years ago--

00:25:39.496 --> 00:25:42.100 align:middle line:90%
this is a published paper--

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:45.880 align:middle line:84%
a binary star system passed
through the Oort Cloud.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.625 align:middle line:84%
So here now we have
two massive stars.

00:25:47.625 --> 00:25:49.000 align:middle line:84%
They pass through
the Oort Cloud.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.070 align:middle line:90%
They likely perturb this object.

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:54.820 align:middle line:84%
So here this object has got
100-mile diameter center

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:57.550 align:middle line:84%
solid core, and it's
surrounded on the outside

00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:01.441 align:middle line:84%
by ice chunks that
came in very slowly.

00:26:01.441 --> 00:26:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Building on it.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.856 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Another
thing about comets

00:26:03.856 --> 00:26:06.080 align:middle line:84%
is the United States
sent a probe into a comet

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:06.880 align:middle line:90%
not too long ago.

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.460 align:middle line:84%
It was called Deep
Impact Mission.

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Michael A'Hearn from
University of Maryland

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:13.510 align:middle line:90%
was the project chair.

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:16.120 align:middle line:84%
There were two objects
that we sent out.

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.770 align:middle line:84%
One was going to
be a probe that's

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:19.037 align:middle line:90%
going to go into the comet.

00:26:19.037 --> 00:26:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And the other one's
going to observe--

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:22.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From above.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.699 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Outside and
see what happens.

00:26:23.699 --> 00:26:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that they found

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:29.560 align:middle line:84%
is that comets are mostly
open space, 75% open space.

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Of the mass of a comet,
2/3 of the mass is ice.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And the other third of the mass
would be minerals and whatnot.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.160 align:middle line:90%
That's important.

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.460 align:middle line:84%
So the object-- so
we've got this sphere.

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:45.800 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be 1,500-mile-wide
sphere, diameter sphere.

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:46.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.960 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: It's a big
object, but it's porous.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a sixth
of the size of the planet.

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:54.250 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: It's a big object.

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And it gets perturbed by
this binary star system,

00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:59.120 align:middle line:90%
and it gets some velocity.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.245 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And here it comes.

00:27:00.245 --> 00:27:05.750 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: And 57,000 years later,
it comes and it hits the Earth.

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:06.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sheesh.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.950 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: If we could put up that
one image of what it looked

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:09.070 align:middle line:90%
like.

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:10.187 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
let's take a look.

00:27:10.187 --> 00:27:12.280 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: So it's the
schematic-- there it is.

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:17.970 align:middle line:84%
So it has an ice outer layer,
and it's got this solid core.

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:19.219 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And how big is that?

00:27:19.219 --> 00:27:20.760 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Well, in
our case, it's going

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.580 align:middle line:84%
to be 1,500 miles in
diameter, roughly.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:23.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:28.320 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: And it's-- but it's
really key, its composition.

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.400 align:middle line:90%
It's not solidly packed.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It would have destroyed
the planet if it was solid.

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.330 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: No, no, no, no.

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:34.920 align:middle line:90%
It's loosely packed.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
had it been solid--

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:36.690 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: That's right.

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:38.055 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --it would've
annihilated us.

00:27:38.055 --> 00:27:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: It would have
been a significant event.

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:39.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:41.698 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Well, it was
a significant event.

00:27:41.698 --> 00:27:44.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it breaks up
and melts as it gets closer?

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:47.850 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Well, so the comets
that we observe-- in fact, I

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:49.350 align:middle line:84%
think all the comets
that we observe

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:51.600 align:middle line:84%
are fragments of the object
that end up hitting the Earth.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.808 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a good point.

00:27:52.808 --> 00:27:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: So I call this object--

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:56.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
intrude upon cosmology,

00:27:56.910 --> 00:28:01.540 align:middle line:84%
so I simply call it the
impacting object, the IO.

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And so the question
is, what's it

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.940 align:middle line:84%
going to be like when
it hits the Earth?

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:06.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: It's less
strong than a snowbank.

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:11.970 align:middle line:84%
So when this thing hits,
it's going to be a thud.

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:16.680 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to be a planet
killing event, but that center

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.720 align:middle line:84%
core, what's the center
core going to do?

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.190 align:middle line:84%
When that thing
hits, it's solid.

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:22.113 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That iron core
you're talking about.

00:28:22.113 --> 00:28:22.913 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Yeah.

00:28:22.913 --> 00:28:24.690 align:middle line:84%
So when it hits,
it's going to gouge.

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:26.280 align:middle line:84%
So if we could see
the next image,

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.810 align:middle line:84%
this is going to
be the impact site.

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:28.872 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:28:28.872 --> 00:28:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: So there it is.

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:32.970 align:middle line:84%
I have superimposed
on it a diameter.

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:35.400 align:middle line:90%
That diameter is 1,500 miles.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:39.362 align:middle line:84%
We can see the central scrape
that was carved by the--

00:28:39.362 --> 00:28:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's where
you believe it hit?

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:42.180 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Yes.

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:44.020 align:middle line:90%
That's South Africa.

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:46.090 align:middle line:90%
It's southeast of South Africa.

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:47.160 align:middle line:90%
It's north of Antarctica.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.970 align:middle line:90%
And it is south of Madagascar.

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:52.440 align:middle line:90%
So it's in the Southern Ocean.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.590 align:middle line:84%
We can see the arc
from the impact.

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:56.460 align:middle line:90%
It gives us an idea.

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:57.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not circular.

00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:59.540 align:middle line:84%
So that gives us an
idea that it approached

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.860 align:middle line:90%
at a somewhat shallow angle.

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.145 align:middle line:90%
We have a gap in the center.

00:29:03.145 --> 00:29:07.500 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we could put the
next slide up that shows--

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.600 align:middle line:84%
will show the impact
site as well as

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.220 align:middle line:90%
an overlay, a magnetic anomaly.

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.250 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:14.100 align:middle line:84%
So we have the exact
same image on top.

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And from the exact same
Google Earth perspective,

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:20.400 align:middle line:84%
we have shown below a
magnetic anomaly overlay that

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:24.060 align:middle line:84%
shows that there were materials
strewn by the impact velocity

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:26.322 align:middle line:90%
through the crescent gap.

00:29:26.322 --> 00:29:28.530 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that we see
there's a crescent gap almost

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:31.140 align:middle line:84%
implies that the object,
because it was so fragile when

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:33.230 align:middle line:84%
it started interacting
with Earth's atmosphere,

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:35.440 align:middle line:90%
it split in two.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.330 align:middle line:90%
And so it hits.

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:41.040 align:middle line:84%
It creates these crescents,
these half crescents.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And eventually when
this ice melts,

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:46.530 align:middle line:84%
well, we get a couple
deposit mounds.

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:48.363 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you can see
there's a raised region

00:29:48.363 --> 00:29:51.240 align:middle line:84%
just on the left
side of the diameter.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.790 align:middle line:84%
That's a deposit mound from
the minerals and whatnot

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:55.230 align:middle line:90%
that the thing brought.

00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Minerals were strewn through
the gap about 1,000 miles due

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.121 align:middle line:90%
to impact velocities.

00:30:00.121 --> 00:30:01.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
have heard it from here

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:03.344 align:middle line:90%
if it had hit this impact?

00:30:03.344 --> 00:30:05.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: You probably
would have felt it.

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:07.210 align:middle line:90%
There probably was a worldwide--

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:08.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jarring.

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:08.190 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Right.

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:10.380 align:middle line:84%
But imagine what this thing
looked like as it was coming.

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:11.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Coming in.

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:13.176 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Imagine what it
looked like coming in.

00:30:13.176 --> 00:30:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It took
up the whole sky.

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: So we can see comets
from millions of miles away,

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:21.250 align:middle line:84%
and they're but fractions
of the size of this thing.

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:24.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Halley's-- we
could fit roughly a million

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:25.410 align:middle line:90%
Halley's Comets into--

00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:27.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did it get so big?

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.290 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Well, it was
in the Oort Cloud.

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:29.690 align:middle line:84%
It sat there for
bazillions of years.

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:30.697 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just building
up, building up.

00:30:30.697 --> 00:30:32.821 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Collecting up that
ice and little minerals.

00:30:32.821 --> 00:30:34.680 align:middle line:90%
And it got displaced.

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:35.490 align:middle line:90%
And here it is.

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Big sky, little bullet,
it hits the Earth

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.220 align:middle line:90%
roughly 13,000 years ago.

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And the ice that
it brings is going

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.894 align:middle line:90%
to melt and flood the planet.

00:30:46.894 --> 00:30:49.249 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ah, and the
oceans and everything else.

00:30:49.249 --> 00:30:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: And so because we
know how comets are composed,

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:52.831 align:middle line:90%
we can do a little bit of math.

00:30:52.831 --> 00:30:55.650 align:middle line:84%
We can find the volume of the
sphere of that 1,500-mile-wide

00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:56.450 align:middle line:90%
sphere.

00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:58.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because it was
all frozen water basically,

00:30:58.170 --> 00:30:58.970 align:middle line:90%
wasn't it?

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Well, one sixth of the
volume would have been ice.

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.530 align:middle line:90%
We can convert the ice to water.

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And then we can take
that volume and divide it

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:11.382 align:middle line:84%
by the Earth's known
surface area of the oceans.

00:31:11.382 --> 00:31:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And take the volume,
divide it by surface area,

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:14.340 align:middle line:90%
you get a height.

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And that height is just a
little bit over two miles.

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:19.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Two miles of
water basically came in?

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:21.660 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: This object
delivered two miles of water

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:22.930 align:middle line:90%
13,000 years ago.

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:23.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sheesh.

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: And it
flooded the planet.

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Now we humans, we're
not from up here.

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:32.010 align:middle line:84%
We are not from presently
exposed landscapes.

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:36.210 align:middle line:84%
We are from landscapes that are
now under two miles of water.

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could Atlantis have
been one of these areas?

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:40.750 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: I gave a talk
a couple years ago

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:42.480 align:middle line:84%
at the Explorers Club
called "Resolving

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.130 align:middle line:90%
the Problem of Atlantis."

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:46.220 align:middle line:84%
Yes, Atlantis existed,
so did Lemuria,

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:52.110 align:middle line:84%
two famous civilizations
that are discounted as myth.

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:56.340 align:middle line:84%
They're the ramblings
of rubes, ancients.

00:31:56.340 --> 00:32:00.970 align:middle line:84%
They're all discounted because
of this error in geology.

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:02.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is amazing.

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:03.270 align:middle line:90%
Great work.

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:05.436 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Maybe to have a
little further more evidence

00:32:05.436 --> 00:32:08.140 align:middle line:90%
of the flood.

00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:10.590 align:middle line:90%
So the next image, I think, is--

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:11.700 align:middle line:90%
oh, yes.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:15.249 align:middle line:84%
This is from a cave in
Fouriesburg, South Africa.

00:32:15.249 --> 00:32:16.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From inside of a cave?

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:18.123 align:middle line:10%
>>JAYE: This is from
inside of a cave.

00:32:18.123 --> 00:32:20.510 align:middle line:84%
So we humans were flushed
out of the landscapes where

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:25.410 align:middle line:84%
we evolved, where we were living
for tens of millions of years

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:26.390 align:middle line:90%
probably.

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And survivors, their
first place to go

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:33.560 align:middle line:84%
was a cave because the
landscapes are colder.

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Everything is different
to the survivors.

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:37.700 align:middle line:90%
They needed warmth.

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:38.960 align:middle line:90%
They needed shelter.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.770 align:middle line:90%
Immediate place to go is a cave.

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:42.500 align:middle line:84%
So this is in
Fouriesburg, South Africa.

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
survivors sketched

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:51.380 align:middle line:84%
on this cave what I
believe is his recounting

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:54.270 align:middle line:84%
of how the impacting
object looked to him.

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:56.927 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it's
drawn in light color.

00:32:56.927 --> 00:32:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it that
line we're seeing?

00:32:58.510 --> 00:32:59.310 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Yeah.

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:02.090 align:middle line:10%
So coming from right to left,
notice the shallow angle.

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:05.120 align:middle line:10%
This impacting object came
in at a fairly shallow angle,

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.750 align:middle line:10%
which is why we don't see
a full circular crescent.

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:10.940 align:middle line:10%
We see a semicircle crescent.

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:13.100 align:middle line:90%
Notice that it bifurcates.

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.740 align:middle line:84%
So this individual who
is in South Africa,

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:18.110 align:middle line:84%
to this individual
the impacting object

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:22.010 align:middle line:84%
would have come from his right,
or his or her right to left.

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was this
a witness to this?

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:24.500 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Yes.

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:25.890 align:middle line:90%
This is an eyewitness account.

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:28.606 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: There are lots
of eyewitness accounts.

00:33:28.606 --> 00:33:33.350 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese New Year dragon,
this serpent above the clouds.

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:34.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was this object.

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:37.210 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: With water
emanating from its mouth.

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:39.350 align:middle line:84%
That is celebrated
every so many years.

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:43.580 align:middle line:84%
That is a memorialization
of the impacting object

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:44.480 align:middle line:90%
as it appeared.

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.580 align:middle line:84%
Water emanating from
a dragon's mouth?

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:48.035 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting.

00:33:48.035 --> 00:33:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And of course, survivors have
maintained this event, even

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.135 align:middle line:90%
though it's 13,000 years ago.

00:33:55.135 --> 00:33:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And despite the last
200 years of no flood,

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:02.060 align:middle line:84%
the legend of the
flood remains with us.

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:05.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't it
amazing at how humankind

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:07.787 align:middle line:90%
carries that story forward?

00:34:07.787 --> 00:34:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Because we're survivors.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With different
interpretations, obviously.

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:15.080 align:middle line:84%
But it's still the
basis of a major flood.

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:18.320 align:middle line:84%
That's something that actually
happened on this planet 12,

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.350 align:middle line:90%
13,000 years ago.

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:20.150 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Indeed.

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:23.640 align:middle line:84%
So what's fascinating
is to consider the Earth

00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:24.440 align:middle line:90%
before the flood.

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.630 align:middle line:84%
What did it look like
before the flood?

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:29.239 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, your concept
of a comet, of course,

00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:31.310 align:middle line:90%
has been kicked around.

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:37.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Currently there's over 170
known impacts that have been

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:41.210 align:middle line:10%
absolutely validated
by physical methods.

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Of those impacts that
have been documented,

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:45.949 align:middle line:84%
there are none in the
ocean, and yet the oceans

00:34:45.949 --> 00:34:48.960 align:middle line:84%
cover more than 70% of
the Earth's landmass.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:52.969 align:middle line:10%
So we are missing a large
percentage of recent impacts

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:55.820 align:middle line:10%
because they occurred
in the ocean.

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>> According to Drs.

00:34:57.210 --> 00:35:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Abbott and Masse, one
of those missing impacts

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:04.770 align:middle line:84%
may have happened
4,800 years ago.

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:06.860 align:middle line:84%
They believe that its
catastrophic effects

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:09.800 align:middle line:84%
could have inspired the story
of the Great Flood found

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.740 align:middle line:90%
in the Bible and other accounts.

from Europe and Asia
to the Americas,

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:21.350 align:middle line:90%
had legends of a great flood.

oceans, but they were

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:54.090 align:middle line:84%
was the impact in the Southern

There's no question.

00:37:07.013 --> 00:37:09.060 align:middle line:84%
The ancients, they're
looking at the skies,

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.890 align:middle line:84%
and they were
witnessing this object.

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And it got closer and closer
until finally, boom, it hits.

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:17.970 align:middle line:84%
That central trough that was
carved by the massive nucleus

00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:20.250 align:middle line:84%
as it skidded
forward after impact,

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:22.370 align:middle line:90%
we can back propagate that.

00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And by back propagating
that trough,

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:28.680 align:middle line:84%
we get an idea of the
direction over which

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:33.560 align:middle line:84%
or the landscapes over which
the object flew prior to impact.

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:36.960 align:middle line:90%
And here's this huge--

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.610 align:middle line:84%
it's dropping ice
as it comes in.

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:41.580 align:middle line:90%
And so we can back propagate it.

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And the object overflew
South America, Argentina,

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:48.270 align:middle line:84%
skirted the coast
of South America,

00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:51.360 align:middle line:90%
and overflew North America.

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:55.797 align:middle line:84%
And it deposited or is
dropping ice just as it comes.

>>NOORY: As it was coming.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.046 align:middle line:90%

00:37:58.046 --> 00:37:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And these ice chunks
hit the earth.

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:01.410 align:middle line:90%
And we find ice chunks.

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I bet
they were huge.

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Some of them
are fairly large.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.780 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I flew into Denver
airport about a year ago.

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And as we were coming
in for landing,

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:16.110 align:middle line:84%
I could see in the
Platte River Valley,

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:18.570 align:middle line:84%
I could actually see these
impact craters from the plane

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:21.390 align:middle line:84%
as we were coming in
our final approach.

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:23.110 align:middle line:90%
But they're in North America.

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:24.997 align:middle line:84%
And of course, as
the object got closer

00:38:24.997 --> 00:38:26.580 align:middle line:84%
it was shedding more
and more of them.

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:27.871 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That kept falling off.

00:38:27.871 --> 00:38:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: And as it
got closer to impact,

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:34.360 align:middle line:84%
the density of these
objects, these craters,

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.400 align:middle line:90%
these impact craters--

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:38.329 align:middle line:84%
and they're oriented from the
northwest to the southeast

00:38:38.329 --> 00:38:40.245 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
direction of which it flew.

00:38:40.245 --> 00:38:41.887 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:38:41.887 --> 00:38:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: So it flew
over North America,

00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:48.330 align:middle line:84%
dropped these ice impact
craters, left a huge trail.

00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:52.945 align:middle line:84%
It's been commemorated as
a huge comet, the dragon.

00:38:52.945 --> 00:38:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And then it hits in
the Southern Ocean,

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:55.950 align:middle line:90%
what is now the Southern Ocean.

00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And it forever
changes the planet.

00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what are we
looking at here, Michael?

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:00.771 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: So what
we're looking at here

00:39:00.771 --> 00:39:03.780 align:middle line:84%
are ice impact
craters in Argentina

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:07.740 align:middle line:84%
that were caused by
materials falling off

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:10.630 align:middle line:84%
of the impacting object as
it overflew the Earth just

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:11.430 align:middle line:90%
prior to impact.

00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Notice how closely
and densely populated

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:17.480 align:middle line:90%
these ice impact craters are.

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:20.475 align:middle line:84%
So the object overflew
the South Pole.

00:39:20.475 --> 00:39:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your work
is remarkable.

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:22.540 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Well, thank you.

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:23.956 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I really
got to tell you.

00:39:23.956 --> 00:39:24.990 align:middle line:90%
It's something.

00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:29.220 align:middle line:84%
I've always believed
in the biblical flood.

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:32.170 align:middle line:84%
What I didn't
understand was how.

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And you have explained
it pretty graphically.

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: What's fascinating is
that the story of Adam and Eve

00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:40.609 align:middle line:90%
is but another flood story.

00:39:40.609 --> 00:39:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And if we could put
up the next image

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:45.180 align:middle line:84%
of the map of the Earth
prior to the flood,

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:46.890 align:middle line:90%
this one tells a great story.

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:49.710 align:middle line:84%
So this is what the Earth
looked like prior to the flood.

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Before
12,500 years ago?

00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:52.410 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Correct.

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:54.270 align:middle line:84%
So the yellow
landscapes are those

00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:55.770 align:middle line:90%
that are currently exposed.

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:57.120 align:middle line:90%
And what is in brown--

00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:58.080 align:middle line:90%
now this is a model.

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:01.470 align:middle line:84%
I asked a mapmaker
to create for me

00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:06.930 align:middle line:84%
a map by removing essentially
an average of two miles of water

00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:08.040 align:middle line:90%
from the planet.

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:11.370 align:middle line:84%
We can see that there were large
oceans, but they were disjoint.

00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
we're looking at is

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:16.240 align:middle line:84%
a map of the planet
12,500 years ago,

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.760 align:middle line:90%
prior to this comet impact.

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Now the blue,
Michael, what is that?

00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:29.210 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: So the blue are what the
map created for me as basins.

00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:32.357 align:middle line:84%
They were below a certain
altitude, if you will.

00:40:32.357 --> 00:40:33.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But that's water?

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:35.220 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: That would have been
water prior to the flood.

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:36.553 align:middle line:90%
So yes, there were major oceans.

00:40:36.553 --> 00:40:38.250 align:middle line:90%
There was a large Pacific Ocean.

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:39.420 align:middle line:90%
It was exposed.

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the yellow
around the continents?

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:43.552 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:40:43.552 --> 00:40:46.440 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: So the yellow are the
presently exposed landscapes.

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that
was just bare land?

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: So what is
brown, the darker brown,

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:57.420 align:middle line:84%
that is landscapes that were
exposed and that are now--

00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:58.246 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ocean.

00:40:58.246 --> 00:40:59.120 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: --underwater.

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:00.411 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But they weren't then?

00:41:00.411 --> 00:41:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: They were not.

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:02.610 align:middle line:90%
That's where we're from.

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:03.663 align:middle line:90%
We are from landscapes.

00:41:03.663 --> 00:41:04.659 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I see.

00:41:04.659 --> 00:41:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: So now, here's
the mental exercise.

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:08.517 align:middle line:90%
We remove two miles of water.

00:41:08.517 --> 00:41:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We didn't have
a lot of water then.

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:11.670 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: We did not.

00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:17.640 align:middle line:84%
This event brought roughly 90%
of the current Earth's waters.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It may have saved
this planet by bringing

00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:21.720 align:middle line:90%
that kind of water here.

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.460 align:middle line:90%
That's nothing then.

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: From our perspective,
from a human perspective,

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:27.810 align:middle line:90%
it nearly killed us.

00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:29.200 align:middle line:90%
We're a surviving species.

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.350 align:middle line:90%
It almost made us extinct.

00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:32.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The impact did?

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:33.610 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Well, the flood.

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:34.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: But prior to
it, this was Eden.

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.600 align:middle line:90%
So we are furless.

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:41.190 align:middle line:84%
We humans are furless
because it was warmer.

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:46.051 align:middle line:84%
Without the oceans to suck
out all the heat from the sun,

00:41:46.051 --> 00:41:47.842 align:middle line:84%
landscapes would've
been heated by the sun.

00:41:47.842 --> 00:41:48.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: It would've been
much warmer down there.

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
what happened to Mars.

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: So we humans are
adapted for the ecosystem that

00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:56.510 align:middle line:90%
no longer exists.

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:59.280 align:middle line:84%
It is the ecosystem
that is two miles,

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.579 align:middle line:84%
was two miles, below
the present sea level.

00:42:01.579 --> 00:42:03.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And where
did the comet hit?

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.212 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Between
Africa and Antarctica,

00:42:05.212 --> 00:42:06.420 align:middle line:90%
and just south of Madagascar.

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Way down there.

00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:07.380 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Right.

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:08.670 align:middle line:90%
That's where the impact hit.

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:11.190 align:middle line:90%
And it strew the ice.

00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And water
filled everywhere.

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.400 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Right.

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And so prior to the flood, we
humans are living down there.

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Lemuria existed between
Australia and South America,

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:27.860 align:middle line:90%
thousands of miles, one huge--

00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:28.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: And it was
one vast plain.

00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:35.290 align:middle line:90%
It was warm, tropical.

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:36.660 align:middle line:90%
That's why we're furless.

00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:40.050 align:middle line:84%
We could walk around down there
without the need for clothing.

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:43.500 align:middle line:84%
We light-skinned humans came
from the Atlantic region,

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:47.120 align:middle line:84%
the Atlantis region, which was
three miles below sea level.

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:49.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And where do
you think Atlantis was?

00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:51.600 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: It is exactly
where we think

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:57.260 align:middle line:84%
it would have been, outside
the Strait of Gibraltar,

00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:58.696 align:middle line:90%
southwest of Spain.

00:42:58.696 --> 00:42:59.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Plato was correct?

00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:01.361 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Plato was
absolutely correct.

00:43:01.361 --> 00:43:02.480 align:middle line:90%
Plato had it right.

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:06.360 align:middle line:84%
We light-skinned humans
are from the deepest

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:09.360 align:middle line:84%
parts of the previously
exposed landscape.

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:10.320 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.730 align:middle line:90%
Why are we light skinned?

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:14.310 align:middle line:84%
Because the atmosphere,
which would have fallen down

00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:18.900 align:middle line:84%
in there, would have
attenuated away the ultraviolet

00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:20.320 align:middle line:90%
and blue light waves.

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:21.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point.

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: In fact,
a recent finding

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:26.672 align:middle line:84%
is that some humans didn't
see blue until only recently.

00:43:26.672 --> 00:43:27.630 align:middle line:90%
Well, that explains it.

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:30.490 align:middle line:84%
The blue wavelengths would
have been attenuated away

00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:31.290 align:middle line:90%
by the atmosphere.

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: So lighter
skinned humans

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:37.260 align:middle line:84%
are from the deepest
part of the Atlantic.

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Darker skinned humans, they
had more need for melanin.

00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:43.290 align:middle line:84%
They would have come from
probably more tropical regions

00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:45.720 align:middle line:90%
and higher regions.

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:48.380 align:middle line:84%
So we can explain human
skin pigmentation.

00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:49.580 align:middle line:90%
We can explain Lemuria.

00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:51.380 align:middle line:90%
We can explain Atlantis.

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:55.160 align:middle line:84%
We can explain what we're
properly adapted for.

00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:57.950 align:middle line:84%
So the story of Adam and
Eve with the naked humans,

00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:59.270 align:middle line:90%
we're living in Eden.

00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:01.535 align:middle line:84%
They're the landscapes for
which we were properly--

00:44:01.535 --> 00:44:02.766 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A real story.

00:44:02.766 --> 00:44:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: --for which we
were properly adapted.

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:07.190 align:middle line:84%
The snake, Satan--
so this object

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:10.190 align:middle line:84%
that hit the Earth has several
names in the various cultures.

00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:14.500 align:middle line:84%
It is known as Phaethon,
Set, and Satan--

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:15.770 align:middle line:90%
Satan.

00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:17.567 align:middle line:84%
When I saw that it
was called Satan,

00:44:17.567 --> 00:44:18.900 align:middle line:90%
I just had one of these moments.

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:20.290 align:middle line:90%
I'll be darned.

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:21.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: An aha moment.

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:23.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: So the serpent
is just an allegory

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:27.410 align:middle line:84%
for the object, the snake-like
object as it appeared,

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:28.374 align:middle line:90%
as it came into Earth.

00:44:28.374 --> 00:44:29.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As it was coming in.

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:31.043 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: There you have it.

00:44:31.043 --> 00:44:32.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Atlantis, Lemuria.

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:37.550 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: So that star, those
are the canals of Atlantis.

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:41.060 align:middle line:84%
Roughly on each
edge, it's 80 miles.

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:43.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
that perfect square?

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: So those are
the canals of Atlantis.

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:47.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Those were man made.

00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:49.610 align:middle line:84%
Nothing could happen
naturally like that.

00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:50.568 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: So there we go.

00:44:50.568 --> 00:44:53.884 align:middle line:10%
So if Mr. Ballard wants
to use his equipment

00:44:53.884 --> 00:44:55.550 align:middle line:10%
to go and investigate
a particular area,

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:58.070 align:middle line:10%
I'd be happy to talk to
him about very special--

00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:00.546 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I believe there's going
to be pyramids down there.

00:45:00.546 --> 00:45:01.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It could be.

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: So the people
of Atlantis were carving

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:05.330 align:middle line:90%
for thousands--

00:45:05.330 --> 00:45:08.544 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's over essentially
1,000 miles of canals

00:45:08.544 --> 00:45:09.460 align:middle line:90%
that we're looking at.

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:11.335 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's all
submerged now, right?

00:45:11.335 --> 00:45:13.730 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: It is under three miles.

00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:17.930 align:middle line:84%
The star, it shows one
of the seamounts there.

00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:21.110 align:middle line:84%
It's over 4,000 meters
below present sea level.

00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:23.540 align:middle line:10%
It takes special equipment
to get down there.

00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:25.040 align:middle line:84%
So those are the
canals of Atlantis.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And they match very closely
with Plato's description.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.500 align:middle line:84%
He tells us they wound
around the plain.

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:32.360 align:middle line:90%
They were straight.

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:34.490 align:middle line:84%
They were 10,000
stadia in length.

00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:37.080 align:middle line:84%
So a stadia is
roughly 200 yards.

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:37.880 align:middle line:90%
You do the math.

00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:42.270 align:middle line:90%


00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:44.210 align:middle line:90%
It's 1,000 miles.

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:45.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Square miles?

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: No, 1,000
miles of canals.

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:47.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: And so what
I did is I took--

00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:54.050 align:middle line:84%
with ArcGIS, you can
actually measure lengths.

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:57.260 align:middle line:84%
So I laid, end to end,
straight lines over those.

00:45:57.260 --> 00:45:58.100 align:middle line:90%
And I measured.

00:45:58.100 --> 00:45:58.910 align:middle line:90%
And I'll be darned.

00:45:58.910 --> 00:46:02.771 align:middle line:84%
It's within 4% of
Plato's description.

00:46:02.771 --> 00:46:03.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:05.750 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: It is,
Plato's description

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:07.040 align:middle line:90%
of the canals of Atlantis.

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Now Google, unfortunately we
can't see these on Google.

00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:14.180 align:middle line:84%
So when the maps first
came out, so many people

00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:18.590 align:middle line:84%
were hitting on
this that Google,

00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:22.850 align:middle line:84%
and with others,
they've averaged away

00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:25.640 align:middle line:84%
some of the canals
on the western side.

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:29.690 align:middle line:84%
But this is available in
NOAA maps, National Oceanic

00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:31.070 align:middle line:90%
Atmospheric Agency.

00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:32.960 align:middle line:84%
This map, if you go
to the Madeira bit,

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:35.410 align:middle line:84%
you can see the Madeira Abyssal
Plain where that star is.

00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And so on the lower
map, I just have

00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:39.199 align:middle line:84%
where is that star located,
which answers your earlier

00:46:39.199 --> 00:46:40.910 align:middle line:90%
question, where was it.

00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:42.440 align:middle line:90%
So you can see Spain.

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:44.500 align:middle line:90%
You can see Africa.

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:46.459 align:middle line:90%
What about Lemuria?

00:46:46.459 --> 00:46:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: So we know about
Lemuria from a gentleman

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:50.480 align:middle line:90%
named Churchward.

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Churchward-- he
was Colonel Churchward.

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:56.000 align:middle line:90%
He was a British officer.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And he was admitted
to very special places

00:46:59.330 --> 00:47:03.500 align:middle line:84%
in India and other
temples, if you will,

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:07.046 align:middle line:90%
where there were writings.

00:47:07.046 --> 00:47:08.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
call them sacred,

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:10.820 align:middle line:84%
but they were writings,
historical writings

00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:13.490 align:middle line:90%
from the different cultures.

00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And from these
cultures, he learned

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:18.864 align:middle line:90%
about this civilization--

00:47:18.864 --> 00:47:19.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is this?

00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:21.196 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: --that was
called Lemuria.

00:47:21.196 --> 00:47:23.680 align:middle line:84%
What we see here, this
is a DNA heat map.

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:25.047 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A DNA heat map?

00:47:25.047 --> 00:47:26.190 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: DNA heat map.

00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:28.500 align:middle line:84%
This was published
a couple years ago.

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And what it shows is-- so
in the red and darker colors

00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:37.220 align:middle line:84%
show the largest, the closest
DNA similarities between people

00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:39.770 align:middle line:90%
in Australia and South America.

00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:42.170 align:middle line:84%
Yet, there is no
DNA similarities

00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:44.970 align:middle line:84%
through the Americas
or through Asia.

00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:46.970 align:middle line:10%
Well, we're supposed
to believe that somehow

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:51.140 align:middle line:10%
during a hypothesized ice age
when the oceans supposedly

00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:53.930 align:middle line:10%
sank, that these people
down in warm cultures

00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:56.390 align:middle line:10%
are going to somehow
cross the Bering Sea

00:47:56.390 --> 00:48:02.000 align:middle line:10%
and travel 20,000 miles by
land from Australia to South

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.500 align:middle line:10%
America, and yet leave no DNA
similarities where they passed?

00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:08.745 align:middle line:84%
That's fantasy
masquerading as science.

00:48:08.745 --> 00:48:09.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: So what
happened was Lemuria

00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:13.600 align:middle line:84%
existed just where
Churchward told us was.

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.050 align:middle line:90%
It was a vast society.

00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:16.702 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Smaller than Atlantis.

00:48:16.702 --> 00:48:17.660 align:middle line:10%
>>JAYE: Oh, no, bigger.

00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:18.460 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Bigger?

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:19.610 align:middle line:10%
>>JAYE: Oh, yes.

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:21.409 align:middle line:10%
We don't see canals.

00:48:21.409 --> 00:48:22.700 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if we're going to.

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:25.910 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's so hard
to see detail that far

00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:27.650 align:middle line:10%
below the surface.

00:48:27.650 --> 00:48:29.690 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to find
civilizations or remnants

00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:31.670 align:middle line:90%
of cities or whatnot in Lemuria?

00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:33.020 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:38.070 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things we
do see, the survivors.

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Churchward tells us 64
million inhabitants were lost.

00:48:41.810 --> 00:48:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 64 million?

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: 64 million.

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:45.275 align:middle line:90%
He recounts this in his book.

00:48:45.275 --> 00:48:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wiped out.

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:47.730 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Were lost in the flood.

00:48:47.730 --> 00:48:48.530 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:50.706 align:middle line:90%
This water is introduced.

00:48:50.706 --> 00:48:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, it's horrible.

00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:53.150 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: It's incredible.

00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:55.290 align:middle line:84%
The volume of water
that's introduced--

00:48:55.290 --> 00:48:56.090 align:middle line:90%
he was an artist.

00:48:56.090 --> 00:48:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We hear about 17
people dying in hurricanes.

00:48:59.910 --> 00:49:01.373 align:middle line:90%
64 million.

00:49:01.373 --> 00:49:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: 64 million that
he knows about in Lemuria.

00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Who knows how many were in
the Atlantic and other places.

00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:11.870 align:middle line:84%
There's no way that the
folks that were in the middle

00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:13.200 align:middle line:90%
survived.

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, the
impact was too much.

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:17.950 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Well, the water
would have been too cold.

00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:20.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, they would
have drowned instantly.

00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:20.780 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Or froze.

00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:21.880 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Or froze.

00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:22.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or froze.

00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:24.606 align:middle line:10%
>>JAYE: But what's
interesting though is

00:49:24.606 --> 00:49:26.900 align:middle line:10%
that some survivors made
their way to Australia

00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:28.340 align:middle line:10%
and the islands.

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:29.897 align:middle line:10%
Some made their way to--

00:49:29.897 --> 00:49:30.980 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, we can see.

00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:31.980 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: --South America.

00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, they remain DNA
linked to their predecessors.

00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:38.795 align:middle line:84%
That's the important
part of this.

00:49:38.795 --> 00:49:41.355 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How come they
didn't make far north?

00:49:41.355 --> 00:49:43.730 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: There was no need to
go north prior to the flood.

00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:44.716 align:middle line:90%
There was no need to go north.

00:49:44.716 --> 00:49:45.591 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No need, OK.

00:49:45.591 --> 00:49:48.607 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Because they were living
in an idyllic environment.

00:49:48.607 --> 00:49:49.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you know Frank Hoff?

00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:51.260 align:middle line:90%
Frank was on "Beyond Belief."

00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:52.250 align:middle line:90%
He's a researcher.

00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:54.260 align:middle line:84%
He talked a little
bit about this too.

00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:57.460 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANK HOFF: Approximately
74 to 75,000 years ago,

00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:00.500 align:middle line:10%
the supervolcano
Toba did go off.

00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:04.100 align:middle line:10%
And that decimated and
destroyed a lot of the area.

00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:07.370 align:middle line:84%
As far as sinking,
maybe not so much

00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:11.570 align:middle line:84%
in this case as maybe Atlantis,
and actually it never did sink.

00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:13.015 align:middle line:90%
That's an optical illusion.

00:50:13.015 --> 00:50:13.815 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:50:13.815 --> 00:50:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: It's really
that sea levels rose.

00:50:15.550 --> 00:50:16.745 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we can
talk more about that.

00:50:16.745 --> 00:50:17.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It didn't go down?

00:50:17.370 --> 00:50:17.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: No.

00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:18.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The water just went up?

00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:19.984 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: The waters went up.

00:50:19.984 --> 00:50:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And again, we have this
a couple different times

00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:28.220 align:middle line:84%
in recent history with the
Banda Aceh or Aceh area back in

00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:33.560 align:middle line:90%
December 26 of 2004, when the--

00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:37.280 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a
9.0, 9.1 earthquake

00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:38.870 align:middle line:90%
took place up in that area.

00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:39.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Huge.

00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:40.830 align:middle line:90%
And it sent the tsunami up.

00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:42.160 align:middle line:90%
But the difference is--

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:46.810 align:middle line:84%
and whether it be what's Lemuria
Atlantis or Atlantis itself--

00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:52.390 align:middle line:84%
is that instead of just sending
a wave of water up maybe 20

00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:56.060 align:middle line:84%
meters high, at the
time of Atlantis,

00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:58.930 align:middle line:84%
it was a little closer
to 2,000 meters high.

00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:00.636 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Holy-- oh, meters.

00:51:00.636 --> 00:51:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Yeah, meters.

00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:02.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Yeah.

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:07.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With a force that is
unbelievable, the strength.

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:08.824 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Right.

00:51:08.824 --> 00:51:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And again, I don't
know if it's so

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:12.820 align:middle line:84%
much in this case with
Lemuria Atlantis that happened

00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:14.830 align:middle line:90%
as it did happen with Atlantis.

00:51:14.830 --> 00:51:17.710 align:middle line:84%
But either way,
it sent the water

00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:21.865 align:middle line:84%
in in a great deluge
that ended up reaching up

00:51:21.865 --> 00:51:23.650 align:middle line:90%
to some of the highest peaks.

00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:25.750 align:middle line:84%
But again, what happened
is that water ended up

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:27.820 align:middle line:84%
receding eventually,
just like it

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:32.025 align:middle line:84%
did in this case, the
Aceh area and other areas,

00:51:32.025 --> 00:51:33.400 align:middle line:84%
the surrounding
area of Indonesia

00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:37.090 align:middle line:84%
where we lost almost
400,000 people,

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:39.590 align:middle line:84%
but also when we had it
in Japan in Sendai too.

00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:40.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:41.389 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: When it went in.

00:51:41.389 --> 00:51:42.460 align:middle line:90%
But also it does recede.

00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now the
time period is off,

00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:46.360 align:middle line:84%
but could this have
been the flood of Noah?

00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:47.320 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Yes.

00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:49.120 align:middle line:84%
This has a lot to
do with the flood.

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And what you have is you have
a great deluge which came in,

00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:55.190 align:middle line:84%
and that's just
the initial flood.

00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:57.070 align:middle line:90%
But again, it recedes.

00:51:57.070 --> 00:51:58.720 align:middle line:90%
And it's an optical illusion.

00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:01.580 align:middle line:84%
So if you're out in a vessel
and you take a look at it,

00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:03.340 align:middle line:84%
it looks like, in
this case, maybe

00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:06.970 align:middle line:84%
Lemuria had sank, Lemuria
Atlantis, or Atlantis.

00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:07.930 align:middle line:90%
But it really didn't.

00:52:07.930 --> 00:52:09.340 align:middle line:90%
It's the sea levels rose.

00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:10.335 align:middle line:90%
And then later on--

00:52:10.335 --> 00:52:11.710 align:middle line:84%
and I'll have to
talk to you more

00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:13.940 align:middle line:90%
about this in another program--

00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:16.000 align:middle line:84%
there was also a universal
flood that took place

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.572 align:middle line:90%
over a period of time as well.

00:52:17.572 --> 00:52:19.780 align:middle line:84%
So there's really a couple
different types of floods.

00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:22.147 align:middle line:84%
And that's what ended
up confusing people.

00:52:22.147 --> 00:52:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think of that, Michael?

00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:25.021 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Well, he's right.

00:52:25.021 --> 00:52:26.620 align:middle line:90%
The sea levels rose.

00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:28.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Similarities
are uncanny.

00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:31.480 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: So Churchward,
just like your guest,

00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:34.270 align:middle line:84%
they're constrained by
the prevailing paradigm

00:52:34.270 --> 00:52:38.314 align:middle line:84%
that there was never a
flood, which is wrong.

00:52:38.314 --> 00:52:40.480 align:middle line:84%
We've already shown that
that is the biggest error--

00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:41.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something happened.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: It's the biggest error
in the history of science.

00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:44.120 align:middle line:90%
It's logically incorrect.

00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why can't
scientists see what you see?

00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:47.100 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Well, that's a--

00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:50.950 align:middle line:84%
[SIGHS] So just six
months ago, an article

00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:52.870 align:middle line:90%
came out about Monterey Canyon.

00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And here are these geologists
who said in the article

00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:00.040 align:middle line:84%
that it would look exactly
like a river system

00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:02.040 align:middle line:90%
if we took away this water.

00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:02.930 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: [CHUCKLING]

00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:04.420 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Well, it
gives you an idea

00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:08.980 align:middle line:84%
of the constraining power that
this incorrect paradigm holds

00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:10.800 align:middle line:90%
over modern thought.

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:11.700 align:middle line:90%
It's wrong.

00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's wrong.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.410 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: I mean, here you
get these smart people doing

00:53:14.410 --> 00:53:15.900 align:middle line:90%
research in their fields.

00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:16.700 align:middle line:90%
They're PhDs.

00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:17.500 align:middle line:90%
They're smart.

00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:19.600 align:middle line:84%
But they're so
constrained by no flood

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:21.770 align:middle line:90%
that they can't look beyond it.

00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:25.120 align:middle line:84%
But getting back to Churchward,
Churchward, in his writing,

00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:28.370 align:middle line:84%
says that Lemuria sank, which
is consistent with your guest.

00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:29.170 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't.

00:53:29.170 --> 00:53:30.550 align:middle line:10%
It didn't sink.

00:53:30.550 --> 00:53:32.835 align:middle line:84%
Churchward said that because
he was constrained by--

00:53:32.835 --> 00:53:33.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It couldn't sink.

00:53:33.490 --> 00:53:34.420 align:middle line:90%
It was overwhelmed.

00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Exactly, it was flooded.

00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:39.100 align:middle line:84%
Now what's interesting, that
Churchward was an artist.

00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And he has painted some images
of the destruction of Mu.

00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:46.630 align:middle line:90%
And they're fascinating images.

00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And those could have
happened like that, the flood?

00:53:49.370 --> 00:53:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: One of his images shows
the water coming in with ice.

00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:54.490 align:middle line:90%
Now how did he know?

00:53:54.490 --> 00:53:55.480 align:middle line:90%
He's absolutely right.

00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's right.

00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:58.864 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Because this object,
this impacting object--

00:53:58.864 --> 00:53:59.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Chunk of ice.

00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:01.960 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: --consisted
almost completely-- well,

00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:04.600 align:middle line:84%
the largest part of
its mass was ice.

00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:07.840 align:middle line:84%
When it hits, some of it
melts almost immediately.

00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:10.210 align:middle line:84%
We have water that's
introduced immediately.

00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:13.584 align:middle line:84%
The warmth of the Earth is going
to cause this thing to melt.

00:54:13.584 --> 00:54:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And break up.

00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: And it's going to
take this ice around with it.

00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:19.050 align:middle line:84%
So yes, it's very
likely that when

00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:22.630 align:middle line:84%
Lemuria was submerged that
there were ice chunks coming in.

00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And some survivor must
have written about it.

00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:29.467 align:middle line:84%
And Churchward saw it
and incorporated it

00:54:29.467 --> 00:54:30.550 align:middle line:90%
into one of his paintings.

00:54:30.550 --> 00:54:31.716 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely fascinating.

00:54:31.716 --> 00:54:35.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Michael, how will
this change science, what

00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:36.880 align:middle line:90%
you've been working on?

00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And I assume there
are a few others.

00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:40.150 align:middle line:90%
How will this change science?

00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: I just described to
you the constraining power

00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:50.360 align:middle line:84%
that this no flood holds
over scientists, geologists,

00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:52.160 align:middle line:90%
everyone.

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:54.320 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, it
might be the essence

00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:57.140 align:middle line:90%
of what divides us as a people.

00:54:57.140 --> 00:54:58.920 align:middle line:84%
We have those who
believe in science,

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:01.520 align:middle line:84%
and then we have those
who are rubes that listen

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:03.300 align:middle line:90%
to the narrative tradition.

00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I love
biblical versions

00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:08.190 align:middle line:90%
where science backs it up.

00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, if they were
to jump on this flood theory,

00:55:11.210 --> 00:55:12.890 align:middle line:90%
it would be perfect for me.

00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Well, what
are we up against?

00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:15.870 align:middle line:90%
What am I up against?

00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:17.150 align:middle line:90%
So I'm a scientist.

00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:22.280 align:middle line:84%
I submitted papers to the
highest journals in geology.

00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:27.450 align:middle line:84%
As soon as we talk about
flood, they don't send it out.

00:55:27.450 --> 00:55:28.250 align:middle line:90%
You're just a rube.

00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what's the
reaction been to your work?

00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: From lettered
geologists, PhDs

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:36.182 align:middle line:84%
and geologists, as soon
as you mention flood,

00:55:36.182 --> 00:55:37.640 align:middle line:84%
they discount the
work immediately.

00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:38.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:55:38.850 --> 00:55:40.400 align:middle line:84%
They think you're
a wacko or what?

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Absolutely, because
of this finding 200 years ago.

00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:47.210 align:middle line:84%
It dominates
science to this day.

00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:49.730 align:middle line:90%
It is a paradigm.

00:55:49.730 --> 00:55:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One finding
200 years ago will not

00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:54.290 align:middle line:90%
budge these scientists?

00:55:54.290 --> 00:55:57.020 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: It is what separates us.

00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's remarkable.

00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: So there is the issue.

00:56:00.380 --> 00:56:04.580 align:middle line:84%
How do we get these geologists
to recognize and admit

00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:06.640 align:middle line:90%
to their error?

00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:08.770 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how to do it.

00:56:08.770 --> 00:56:10.340 align:middle line:10%
I've written papers to them.

00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:11.720 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Are there conferences?

00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:13.070 align:middle line:10%
>>JAYE: I've been
to two conferences.

00:56:13.070 --> 00:56:15.400 align:middle line:84%
I presented at the Geological
Society of America twice.

00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:16.608 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they applaud you?

00:56:16.608 --> 00:56:18.470 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Absolutely not.

00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:21.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they aghast?

00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:21.860 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Absolutely.

00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:25.640 align:middle line:84%
The first time I presented
was a poster session.

00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And I can remember
a Penn State faculty

00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:32.640 align:middle line:84%
member and his coterie of
undergraduates or graduate

00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:33.440 align:middle line:90%
students.

00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:35.280 align:middle line:90%
And they mocked me.

00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:36.080 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
time, I actually

00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:41.767 align:middle line:90%
got a speaking engagement.

00:56:41.767 --> 00:56:42.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same thing?

00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: It was like
I was talking to--

00:56:44.650 --> 00:56:45.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were there boos?

00:56:45.890 --> 00:56:46.690 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: In essence.

00:56:46.690 --> 00:56:47.167 align:middle line:90%
I was mocked.

00:56:47.167 --> 00:56:47.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And hisses?

00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:49.200 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: No, no,
but I was mocked.

00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:50.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gosh.

00:56:50.010 --> 00:56:50.730 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: But that's OK.

00:56:50.730 --> 00:56:51.530 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:53.170 align:middle line:90%
My recourse was to write a book.

00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:53.970 align:middle line:90%
And I wrote a book.

00:56:53.970 --> 00:56:55.990 align:middle line:90%
And it is my testament.

00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:58.990 align:middle line:90%
It is my testament to the error.

00:56:58.990 --> 00:57:00.540 align:middle line:90%
The error is inescapable.

00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:02.520 align:middle line:84%
That is the big
takeaway, I think.

00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:05.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want you to put
yourself in Noah's shoes

00:57:05.370 --> 00:57:07.150 align:middle line:90%
for a moment for us.

00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's take the biblical version
out of it, in terms of God

00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:12.700 align:middle line:84%
telling him to build an
ark and stuff like that.

00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Sure.

00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But what do
you think he sees?

00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:20.620 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: Like I said, assuming
that he was a real person,

00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:23.430 align:middle line:84%
I believe that he existed in
the western Mediterranean.

00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:26.910 align:middle line:84%
His boat was designed for
whatever that ecosystem was.

00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:33.090 align:middle line:84%
He was sailing about the
former western Mediterranean.

00:57:33.090 --> 00:57:37.234 align:middle line:84%
The last place to flood is
going to be the Mediterranean.

00:57:37.234 --> 00:57:39.067 align:middle line:84%
So the waters are rising
and rising outside.

00:57:39.067 --> 00:57:39.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All over the place.

00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:41.620 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: They're rising
outside the planet.

00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:44.820 align:middle line:84%
When the waters get to
the Strait of Gibraltar

00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:48.120 align:middle line:84%
and they start now
flooding into the--

00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:51.390 align:middle line:84%
now prior to that,
during the flooding

00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:55.450 align:middle line:84%
of all places prior
to the Mediterranean,

00:57:55.450 --> 00:57:57.760 align:middle line:84%
the folks down below
are witnessing--

00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:58.560 align:middle line:90%
it's colder.

00:57:58.560 --> 00:57:59.940 align:middle line:84%
There's probably a
whole bunch more rain

00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:02.027 align:middle line:84%
because there's a lot more
water in our ecosystem.

00:58:02.027 --> 00:58:04.110 align:middle line:84%
They're probably going,
something's going on here.

00:58:04.110 --> 00:58:04.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something's happening.

00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:06.600 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: And it may have been
raining for however many days

00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:06.750 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:07.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 40 days.

00:58:07.550 --> 00:58:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: It may
have been raining.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.260 align:middle line:90%
And then what happens?

00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:13.860 align:middle line:84%
The waters finally get up
to the Strait of Gibraltar,

00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:15.900 align:middle line:90%
and they start flooding down in.

00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:18.270 align:middle line:90%
Then the Mediterranean floods.

00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:20.630 align:middle line:84%
Now while the
Mediterranean floods,

00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:25.770 align:middle line:84%
there is a pause everywhere
else while the Mediterranean

00:58:25.770 --> 00:58:27.270 align:middle line:90%
floods in.

00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:33.660 align:middle line:84%
There is the Haida Gwaii in the
Pacific Northwest in Canada.

00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:37.260 align:middle line:84%
I hope I'm getting this right,
but they were noted seafarers.

00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:39.070 align:middle line:84%
They were seafarers
prior to the flood.

00:58:39.070 --> 00:58:39.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah.

00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: And they're going
to survive this event.

00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:43.560 align:middle line:84%
They had boats
prior to the flood.

00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And they made their way
eastward, following the waters.

00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:48.300 align:middle line:90%
And they're surviving in this.

00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And they make their way
to the Pacific Northwest.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.190 align:middle line:84%
I think it's in Vancouver
or near Vancouver,

00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:56.190 align:middle line:90%
British Columbia.

00:58:56.190 --> 00:59:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Scientists found some of
their previous remnants

00:59:02.550 --> 00:59:05.020 align:middle line:84%
from their previous
civilization.

00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:08.070 align:middle line:90%
Well, what happened?

00:59:08.070 --> 00:59:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And they found it in
about 100 meters of water.

00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:12.590 align:middle line:84%
As the Mediterranean
is flooding,

00:59:12.590 --> 00:59:14.820 align:middle line:84%
there is a pause
around the planet.

00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And the folks who had been
riding this thing out,

00:59:18.930 --> 00:59:20.790 align:middle line:84%
finally it looks like
it's going to stop.

00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:22.260 align:middle line:90%
So they start breaking camp.

00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:24.250 align:middle line:84%
They start establishing
a civilization.

00:59:24.250 --> 00:59:25.050 align:middle line:90%
Then what happens?

00:59:25.050 --> 00:59:27.030 align:middle line:90%
The Med finishes its flooding.

00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:28.350 align:middle line:90%
And we're not done with it yet.

00:59:28.350 --> 00:59:30.520 align:middle line:84%
We still have 200
more meters to go.

00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, they
get back in their boats,

00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:35.790 align:middle line:84%
and they make their way
up to where we are now.

00:59:35.790 --> 00:59:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And the survivors from
around the planet,

00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:42.380 align:middle line:84%
wasn't just the Haida, but
survivors around the planet,

00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:43.780 align:middle line:90%
their first--

00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:45.390 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's cold.

00:59:45.390 --> 00:59:47.497 align:middle line:84%
There's a huge change
to the ecosystem.

00:59:47.497 --> 00:59:48.330 align:middle line:90%
They're ill adapted.

00:59:48.330 --> 00:59:51.192 align:middle line:84%
They've got to start
thinking about clothing.

00:59:51.192 --> 00:59:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah,
things have changed.

00:59:52.650 --> 00:59:54.566 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: There's going
to be major extinctions.

00:59:54.566 --> 00:59:56.790 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be
incredible ecosystem changes.

00:59:56.790 --> 00:59:58.610 align:middle line:84%
As ecosystems begin
to change, there

00:59:58.610 --> 01:00:00.480 align:middle line:90%
are going to be migrations.

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:03.540 align:middle line:84%
The survivors, maybe there was
a place it was working out.

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:06.600 align:middle line:84%
But as the ecosystem started
to change to the new Earth

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:09.480 align:middle line:84%
environment, they've got
to move about to where

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.460 align:middle line:84%
they can find resources
that are going

01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:14.832 align:middle line:90%
to be supportive of our life.

01:00:14.832 --> 01:00:17.040 align:middle line:10%
And that's really what it's
been all about afterward.

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.690 align:middle line:10%
We abuse our environment.

01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:20.700 align:middle line:90%
We need resources.

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:22.380 align:middle line:90%
It's all about resources.

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:25.380 align:middle line:84%
We have to find things that are
going to enable us to survive

01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:26.737 align:middle line:90%
in the post-flood ecosystem.

01:00:26.737 --> 01:00:27.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:29.611 align:middle line:84%
>>JAYE: So that's why we
see these houses dotting

01:00:29.611 --> 01:00:31.610 align:middle line:90%
the countrysides.

01:00:31.610 --> 01:00:32.760 align:middle line:90%
They're shelters.

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.500 align:middle line:90%
They allow us to survive.

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:36.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Michael, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>>JAYE: Thank you for having me.

01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:39.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm very grateful
for this opportunity.

01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:41.714 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's very compelling,
the possibility of a comet

01:00:41.714 --> 01:00:43.980 align:middle line:10%
full of ice hitting the planet.

01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:46.980 align:middle line:10%
It happened 12,500 years ago.

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:48.860 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it could happen again.

01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:49.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:52.200 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
