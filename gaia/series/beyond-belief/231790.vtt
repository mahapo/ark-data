00:00:19.292 --> 00:00:21.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.350 align:middle line:10%
Eric Hecker is with us.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.900 align:middle line:10%
He was part of the Stargate
Program as a child,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.950 align:middle line:10%
and later served in the Navy,
where he worked with a Raytheon

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.070 align:middle line:10%
scientist.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.970 align:middle line:84%
After the Navy, he was
selected by Raytheon

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.330 align:middle line:84%
for the US Antarctic
Program, where he witnessed

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.180 align:middle line:84%
advanced directed energy
weapons at the South Pole.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.990 align:middle line:84%
He has testified
before Congress and is

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.450 align:middle line:84%
committed to exposing
these technologies

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.020 align:middle line:90%
for the good of humanity.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.425 align:middle line:90%
Eric, welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:47.425 --> 00:00:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ERIC HECKER: Thank you very
much for having me today, sir.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.145 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did they
recruit you as a kid?

00:00:51.145 --> 00:00:52.687 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: I gather
they found me when

00:00:52.687 --> 00:00:56.160 align:middle line:84%
I was in elementary school
in my earlier years.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.310 align:middle line:10%
I was, um, taken out
of the classroom,

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.730 align:middle line:10%
brought to the
library in the school,

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.340 align:middle line:10%
and there were tests
that were given to us,

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.628 align:middle line:10%
and I can only assume I
did well enough on them

00:01:05.628 --> 00:01:06.920 align:middle line:10%
to be selected for the program.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Eric, you grew
up in a small town.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:09.845 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:01:09.845 --> 00:01:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: I grew up in a town
called Levittown in New York,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.860 align:middle line:84%
on Long Island, and it was
the first suburb in the United

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.170 align:middle line:84%
States, and it was
built for the express

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.630 align:middle line:84%
purpose of all the returning
veterans from World War II.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, tell us about the
military family you came from.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: My father
was in the Navy.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.290 align:middle line:84%
My grandfather was in the
Navy, and in actuality, it just

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.200 align:middle line:84%
seemed like it was inevitable
that I was going to cross paths

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.622 align:middle line:90%
with the Navy at some point.

00:01:36.622 --> 00:01:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And my great grandfather
was a ship's carpenter.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.210 align:middle line:90%
So a bunch of sailors.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about
your grandfather.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: My grandfather is
a very interesting person,

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.520 align:middle line:84%
and I'm doing due
diligence to research

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.570 align:middle line:90%
that aspect of my family.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.240 align:middle line:84%
He was part of what is known
as the American Bund, which

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.090 align:middle line:84%
in reality was very
sympathetic to the activities

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.130 align:middle line:84%
of the Nazi party both before,
during, and after World War II

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.930 align:middle line:90%
officially.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As a little boy,
you saw some lights outside

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.240 align:middle line:90%
of your window.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.739 align:middle line:84%
What did they look like and
what do you think they were?

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: I would wake up
sometimes or as going to bed,

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.700 align:middle line:84%
and in the community
that I was at,

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.680 align:middle line:84%
the houses were very
close to each other.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.940 align:middle line:84%
So what I saw from
my perspective

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.480 align:middle line:84%
was like reflections on
the sides of the houses,

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.340 align:middle line:90%
like lights hitting it almost--

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.330 align:middle line:84%
it seemed to me like, almost
like there was a disco ball

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.380 align:middle line:90%
passing between the houses.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.738 align:middle line:84%
And the effect of that type
of activity on the house walls

00:02:38.738 --> 00:02:39.780 align:middle line:90%
was what I was observing.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think it was?

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: Wow.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.830 align:middle line:84%
In hindsight-- I
mean, with everything

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.270 align:middle line:84%
that I've learned up
until this point, I mean,

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.840 align:middle line:84%
there's a high
probability that it

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.390 align:middle line:90%
was some sort of UFO activity.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Eric, at
the age of seven,

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.890 align:middle line:84%
you were trained for
Project Stargate.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.390 align:middle line:90%
Who recruited you?

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: You know, to be
completely honest, they were

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.315 align:middle line:84%
lying to me top to
bottom as a child,

00:03:04.315 --> 00:03:05.940 align:middle line:84%
so I wish I could
answer that question.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm still trying
to figure it out.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.050 align:middle line:84%
It's my understanding that the
Stargate Program in the early

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.560 align:middle line:84%
80s was being run by either
the CIA, the DIA, or the NSA,

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.510 align:middle line:84%
but it's a very difficult
paperwork trail to follow.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, as an adult,
you saw some similarities

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.155 align:middle line:84%
in your schoolwork with Ed
Dames the Remote Viewer.

00:03:26.155 --> 00:03:27.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: Yes, sir.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.380 align:middle line:84%
In doing my research, trying to
connect the dots to my own past,

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.410 align:middle line:84%
I came across a
video of Ed Dames

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.260 align:middle line:84%
going through the
Monroe Institute

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.330 align:middle line:84%
remote viewing protocols
with his own son,

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.670 align:middle line:84%
and it turned out that was the
identical process that we were

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.162 align:middle line:90%
utilizing in my grammar school.

00:03:45.162 --> 00:03:47.370 align:middle line:84%
So it was like a dead
reckoning as I was watching it,

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.500 align:middle line:90%
and it was jaw-dropping for me.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I had
a clear connection

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.210 align:middle line:84%
that that's what was going
on in my school as a child,

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.740 align:middle line:84%
because again, they weren't
being forthwith to the children

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.190 align:middle line:90%
about what the activity was.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.720 align:middle line:90%
They had them participating in.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.428 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are some
of the things they

00:04:03.428 --> 00:04:04.750 align:middle line:90%
did to train you in Stargate?

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: They
used what I believe

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.610 align:middle line:84%
was called the
Tequesta-scope, which

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.380 align:middle line:84%
was an optical viewer
that we would look into,

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.180 align:middle line:84%
and they would put
headphones on us.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.540 align:middle line:84%
They would have
us observe images

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.500 align:middle line:84%
and then have a series of
questions, which I recall,

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.820 align:middle line:84%
we would make the selection
for the answer with your eyes.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:84%
You would just
look on the screen.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
keying in as a child

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.430 align:middle line:84%
and being completely fascinated
at whatever this technology was

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.305 align:middle line:90%
they were presenting.

00:04:33.305 --> 00:04:34.415 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What was it for?

00:04:34.415 --> 00:04:37.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: I guess they wanted
us to absorb information,

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.870 align:middle line:84%
that they were trying
to practice the activity

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.010 align:middle line:90%
of somehow--

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.440 align:middle line:84%
because of the-- I guess
it was the rate of fire

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.860 align:middle line:84%
that the images were
being presented at,

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.310 align:middle line:84%
along with the sounds that they
were applying, that there was

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.430 align:middle line:84%
attempts at trying to get
you to absorb information

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.840 align:middle line:84%
in some sort of a
subconscious way,

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.020 align:middle line:84%
that there were images
that you were seeing

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.220 align:middle line:84%
and images that were
being presented,

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.340 align:middle line:84%
but at a frame rate that you
weren't actively seeing it

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.140 align:middle line:90%
with your eyes.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.932 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why train you
at such a young age?

00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: That's a
fantastic question,

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.310 align:middle line:84%
and I believe it has a lot to
do with what we're seeing now

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.340 align:middle line:84%
publicly, with connections
between the remote viewing

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.960 align:middle line:84%
programs in the
submarine service.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.840 align:middle line:84%
I think it's beyond
a coincidence

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.060 align:middle line:84%
that I was being tapped as a
child to be in these programs,

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.210 align:middle line:84%
and then eventually made it
into the submarine service.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.863 align:middle line:84%
It seems par for the course for
the Remote Viewing Institute,

00:05:28.863 --> 00:05:30.280 align:middle line:84%
the protocols that
they were doing

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.710 align:middle line:84%
and the product they
were trying to produce.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.570 align:middle line:84%
It appears to me
that I'm just caught

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.885 align:middle line:84%
in some decades-long
program of manipulation.

00:05:36.885 --> 00:05:39.315 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you being
trained and groomed for this?

00:05:39.315 --> 00:05:40.535 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: I believe so, Sir.

00:05:40.535 --> 00:05:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people
were involved in i?

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: In the library,
when I was a child,

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.220 align:middle line:84%
there was approximately a half
a dozen to maybe eight children.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And I would say there was at
least equal to that or more

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.385 align:middle line:84%
on the adults that were
partaking in the training.

00:05:56.385 --> 00:05:58.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you able to
go home as a little kid?

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: Yeah, this
all happened in school.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they
didn't keep you?

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: They didn't keep us
after school for this program.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.880 align:middle line:84%
They removed us from
the regular classes,

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.180 align:middle line:84%
brought us to the library,
returned us back to the classes,

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.265 align:middle line:84%
and then discharged us from the
school at the standard time.

00:06:14.265 --> 00:06:17.043 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they tell you to
be confidential about this?

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:19.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: They didn't tell us
to be confidential about it.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.370 align:middle line:84%
It was a very
old-fashioned, I would say,

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.860 align:middle line:84%
German-Irish Catholic
school to begin with.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.430 align:middle line:84%
So it was very
regimented, very strict.

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.180 align:middle line:90%
We got hit all the time.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.170 align:middle line:90%
We got put in check.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the last
thing you ever wanted

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.430 align:middle line:84%
was a phone call
home from school

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.180 align:middle line:84%
because you're just
going to get it again.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.450 align:middle line:84%
So pretty much I was
under the presumption

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.580 align:middle line:84%
that if my parents are paying
for me to go to this school,

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.170 align:middle line:84%
they know what's going on
and this is what they want.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:47.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What responsibilities
did you have, Eric, in the Navy?

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: In the Navy, I
was mostly just training.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.510 align:middle line:84%
So it was a lot of school
and just doing duty watches

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.630 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.572 align:middle line:84%
As far as responsibility,
it was just

00:06:56.572 --> 00:06:58.280 align:middle line:84%
to try to learn the
information they were

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.572 align:middle line:90%
presenting as fast as possible.

00:06:59.572 --> 00:07:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they bring you
into a nuclear weapons program?

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: I was training
for the position--

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.520 align:middle line:84%
the rate is known as a
fire control technician,

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.372 align:middle line:84%
and that is the weapon systems
for the Los Angeles class

00:07:11.372 --> 00:07:13.830 align:middle line:84%
nuclear submarines that I was
being brought up to speed on.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:14.955 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very confidential.

00:07:14.955 --> 00:07:16.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: Super confidential.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Back when I even
enlisted for that rate,

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:24.170 align:middle line:84%
the NSA got involved because
of the type of information

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.490 align:middle line:84%
that I would have
put across my bow.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I specifically
remember the moment

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.730 align:middle line:84%
where I was sitting down with
the NSA Investigation team

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.360 align:middle line:84%
and they said,
basically, here it is.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.530 align:middle line:90%
You sign right here.

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:38.520 align:middle line:84%
From this day forward, we
will always follow you.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.203 align:middle line:84%
They certainly kept
their word on that.

00:07:40.203 --> 00:07:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about your
involvement with this Raytheon

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:43.060 align:middle line:90%
scientist.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:43.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: Ah!

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:44.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes!

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.360 align:middle line:84%
The Raytheon scientist
was a gentleman

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.950 align:middle line:84%
that I met when I was in
submarine school in Groton,

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:50.050 align:middle line:90%
Connecticut.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:53.480 align:middle line:84%
I was having issues for which
I was looking to separate,

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.570 align:middle line:84%
and I came across this
gentleman as an opportunity,

00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:00.650 align:middle line:84%
and I was told that if I worked
with this Raytheon scientist,

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:02.530 align:middle line:84%
that he could make
sure that I would

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:04.780 align:middle line:84%
get a proper separation
from the service

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.590 align:middle line:90%
and it wouldn't be problematic.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:07.940 align:middle line:90%
So I agreed.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:11.890 align:middle line:84%
I went to building
518, which was a school

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.490 align:middle line:84%
building that I attended, super
top secret security clearance

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:15.290 align:middle line:90%
stuff.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:16.998 align:middle line:84%
And it was in the
bottom of that building

00:08:16.998 --> 00:08:19.870 align:middle line:84%
that I partook in some
very peculiar activities

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:20.900 align:middle line:90%
with this gentleman.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And to be completely honest,
I do have some memory loss

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.420 align:middle line:90%
in regards to that activity.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:27.920 align:middle line:90%
I remember entering the room.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.150 align:middle line:84%
I remember seeing a curtain,
almost like an emergency room

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.159 align:middle line:84%
type setup, where the
curtain moves around where

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:34.242 align:middle line:90%
there's normally a gurney.

00:08:34.242 --> 00:08:36.100 align:middle line:84%
But when he moved
the curtain, there

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:40.820 align:middle line:84%
was a very peculiar chair there
that I was directed to get into.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.699 align:middle line:84%
And that's basically the
extent of my recollections

00:08:43.699 --> 00:08:44.499 align:middle line:90%
in that room.

00:08:44.499 --> 00:08:46.365 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did they
take your memory away?

00:08:46.365 --> 00:08:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: That's
a great question

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.865 align:middle line:84%
because I feel like they've
done it more than once.

00:08:49.865 --> 00:08:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's often
times that folks get access

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.980 align:middle line:84%
to information,
albeit on purpose

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:00.190 align:middle line:84%
or by accident, that certain
technologies are utilized

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:04.525 align:middle line:84%
to remove it from immediate
grasp in some of these memory

00:09:04.525 --> 00:09:05.325 align:middle line:90%
banks.

00:09:05.325 --> 00:09:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, in
2010, Raytheon grabbed

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.370 align:middle line:90%
you to work in Antarctica.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.000 align:middle line:84%
What the heck was
going on there?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.510 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: That's correct.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:15.490 align:middle line:84%
In 2010, I did go
under a contract

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:17.330 align:middle line:84%
to go down to the
South Pole station.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.900 align:middle line:84%
I was hired by Raytheon
Polar Services Corporation,

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.940 align:middle line:84%
and I absolutely had
great pause because they

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:26.800 align:middle line:84%
were the hiring
contractor and my history

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.490 align:middle line:90%
with the submarine service.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.183 align:middle line:84%
But I had children
to feed, and they

00:09:30.183 --> 00:09:32.350 align:middle line:84%
were the only people on the
planet willing to cut me

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:33.680 align:middle line:90%
a check at that point in time.

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.585 align:middle line:84%
So I took the gig and spent a
year at the South Pole station.

00:09:36.585 --> 00:09:37.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did you see?

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: I learned that
what they are pretending

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:45.110 align:middle line:84%
is scientific research is
actually directed energy weapons

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.960 align:middle line:84%
platforms, and that
the level of technology

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.150 align:middle line:84%
that the average mortgage
payer on this planet

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:54.800 align:middle line:84%
is allowed to consider is way
lower than what's actually

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.545 align:middle line:84%
being utilized in
the world around us.

00:09:56.545 --> 00:09:58.288 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You saw a
UFO in the South Pole?

00:09:58.288 --> 00:10:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: I did see a
UFO at the South Pole

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.320 align:middle line:90%
during my winter season.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.340 align:middle line:84%
It was flying over
the elevated station

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:08.210 align:middle line:84%
as I was returning from doing
my rounds out in what's commonly

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:09.625 align:middle line:90%
referred to as the Dark Sector.

00:10:09.625 --> 00:10:10.885 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Clearly a UFO?

00:10:10.885 --> 00:10:12.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: It looked
to me at the time

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:17.130 align:middle line:84%
like a massive,
round, flaming meteor.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And at the time I just
took it as a meteor

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.650 align:middle line:84%
because I had
never heard anybody

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:24.150 align:middle line:90%
discuss a UFO of that variant.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.460 align:middle line:84%
But since that time
in my research,

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.780 align:middle line:84%
I have heard a lot of other
people see very similar things

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.040 align:middle line:90%
and ascribe the term UFO to it.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not uncomfortable
doing that because what

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:40.110 align:middle line:84%
I saw was a very parallel flight
path to the surface of the Earth

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.150 align:middle line:84%
there from horizon
to horizon, which to

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.400 align:middle line:84%
me was indicative of a
controlled flight path.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Eric, what is
the Raytheon ELF system?

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:48.395 align:middle line:90%
What was it set up to do?

00:10:48.395 --> 00:10:51.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: There is an ELF system
at the South Pole station,

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:54.070 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want to lay it
at the feet of Raytheon,

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.900 align:middle line:84%
because now there's a
new contractor there.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.910 align:middle line:84%
So now they have
responsibility for it.

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:00.990 align:middle line:84%
But the ELF system is
something that when

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:04.260 align:middle line:84%
I arrived at the facility, I was
told was not energized and was

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.470 align:middle line:90%
not being used.

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:09.400 align:middle line:84%
But in my standard routine work,
I learned that they were lying.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And it absolutely
is an active system.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:16.510 align:middle line:84%
So besides super secret stuff
like submarine communications,

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:20.880 align:middle line:84%
there is quite a treasure trove
of possible directed energy

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:26.020 align:middle line:84%
weapons applications that could
be utilized through ELF systems.

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.350 align:middle line:84%
One of the more concerning
ones contemporarily

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.380 align:middle line:84%
would be things like
Voice-to-Skull technology.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.576 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they monitoring
the magnetosphere?

00:11:32.576 --> 00:11:35.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: They are actually
utilizing the ELF system

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.020 align:middle line:84%
to monitor the
magnetosphere as well.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And I have concerns
that that activity

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:47.740 align:middle line:84%
is for monitoring the impact of
the IceCube Neutrino Detector

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:50.055 align:middle line:90%
Array in its transmit mode.

00:11:50.055 --> 00:11:52.335 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us more about
the Neutrino Detector.

00:11:52.335 --> 00:11:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: The Neutrino Detector
is presented as a research

00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:00.490 align:middle line:84%
project for passively observing
the interactions of neutrinos

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:04.210 align:middle line:84%
in the ice through digital
optical modules that

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:06.970 align:middle line:84%
are registering
the blue Cherenkov

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:11.510 align:middle line:84%
radiation, the light that comes
off during this interaction.

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:16.120 align:middle line:84%
The nucleus of the ice molecule
is disintegrated as well as

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:19.670 align:middle line:84%
the neutrino and
a muon is ejected.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:22.420 align:middle line:84%
That's what they're
presenting this system

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.800 align:middle line:90%
as doing exclusively.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.180 align:middle line:84%
What I presented in
Washington, DC, when I testify,

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:32.920 align:middle line:84%
was documentation that shows
that the detector array also

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.270 align:middle line:90%
has the ability to transmit.

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:37.910 align:middle line:84%
So these are one of the
things, as I mentioned

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:40.050 align:middle line:84%
a couple of years ago now
in the Shawn Ryan Show,

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:44.120 align:middle line:84%
was that the world really needs
to get the term directed-energy

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:47.730 align:middle line:84%
weapons systems into
their vocabulary,

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:49.330 align:middle line:90%
more so today than ever.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Eric, this detector
can be used as a directed energy

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:53.730 align:middle line:90%
weapon.

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:54.900 align:middle line:90%
How would they use it?

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: Well, basically,
sir, it's just--

00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:01.400 align:middle line:84%
people have to consider that
the transmit side allows

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.660 align:middle line:90%
it to deliver energy.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:06.650 align:middle line:84%
So this gets into Tesla
technology and the ability

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:10.580 align:middle line:84%
to move energy from point A
to point B without the express

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:11.440 align:middle line:90%
use of wires.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
something nefarious here?

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: Absolutely
because it's being secreted.

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:16.968 align:middle line:84%
That's the only
way that I can look

00:13:16.968 --> 00:13:20.480 align:middle line:84%
at it at this point, and
especially the resistance

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.640 align:middle line:84%
that I'm getting
in the community

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.650 align:middle line:84%
from trying to get this
information out, again,

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:27.030 align:middle line:90%
it's more than a coincidence.

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.060 align:middle line:84%
There's too much
intention and effort

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:34.500 align:middle line:84%
to keep this topic out of the
spotlight that it's just only--

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.050 align:middle line:90%
inclines me to push harder.

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:37.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's scary.

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:38.935 align:middle line:84%
Are other countries
doing this too?

00:13:38.935 --> 00:13:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: I believe that this is
happening all over the planet.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:46.090 align:middle line:84%
I believe it is not limited
to nation states as a problem.

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:49.900 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's risen to a
level above and beyond that.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And the nation states are now
stuck in roles of puppets.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.480 align:middle line:84%
They're being manipulated by
the same factions that have

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.460 align:middle line:90%
these monopolized technologies.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And we, the people
of the planet,

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.510 align:middle line:84%
need to figure this out very
fast because these technologies

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:09.970 align:middle line:84%
are being rolled out
into society, around us,

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:12.300 align:middle line:84%
and we, the people,
are basically

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:16.480 align:middle line:84%
caught in the crossfire
of modern warfare,

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.990 align:middle line:84%
of weapons that were
completely unfamiliar with.

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:22.015 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is Voice-to-Skull
technology, Eric?

00:14:22.015 --> 00:14:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: The
Voice-to-Skull technology

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:29.020 align:middle line:84%
would be the ability to have,
what I call, intrusive thoughts.

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:30.120 align:middle line:90%
A voice in your head.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Like, imagine if I
had a microphone,

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:36.580 align:middle line:84%
and I could transmit, but the
receiver was in your head.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.790 align:middle line:84%
So now if I had the
ability to mimic your voice

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:43.120 align:middle line:84%
and deliver that
to you, I can now

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.720 align:middle line:84%
start putting my
thoughts into your head.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.295 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How often
is this happening?

00:14:47.295 --> 00:14:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: I'm
concerned that it's

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:50.770 align:middle line:84%
been an ongoing activity
for a couple of decades

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.725 align:middle line:84%
now to the general
population of this planet.

00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:54.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's the motivation?

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:55.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: Control.

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could Neuralink
be the same thing?

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: I think that the
Neuralink is a distraction,

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.450 align:middle line:84%
and it gives the false
pretense that you

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:04.600 align:middle line:84%
need some sort of
hardware installed

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.140 align:middle line:90%
to make that connection.

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:09.830 align:middle line:84%
I do not believe that
Neuralink is required.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And again, I'm concerned
that these technologies

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.165 align:middle line:90%
are being used right now.

00:15:15.165 --> 00:15:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the Genesis
and microwave beam communication

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:19.810 align:middle line:90%
technology?

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: The Genesis, I
think was back in World War II

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:27.220 align:middle line:84%
when they started doing
the line-of-sight microwave

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.600 align:middle line:90%
communications.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.198 align:middle line:84%
I forget the title
of the systems

00:15:30.198 --> 00:15:31.490 align:middle line:90%
back then when they originated.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:32.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's it used for?

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: Back then, they
said that they were using it

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:37.270 align:middle line:84%
as top secret line-of-sight
communications,

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:40.620 align:middle line:84%
but it seems looking back, they
may have been utilizing them

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:44.300 align:middle line:84%
to down a particular
craft of unknown origins.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.325 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they
tracking them?

00:15:46.325 --> 00:15:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: Yeah, I would
imagine they must have just

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:51.550 align:middle line:84%
been-- as we were firing
up radar systems back then,

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:54.510 align:middle line:84%
there were probably some
peculiarly fast things

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:55.310 align:middle line:90%
on the screen.

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:59.495 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Neutrino Detector
used to track UFOs, I'm told.

00:15:59.495 --> 00:16:04.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: One of its secondary
abilities is that if these

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.990 align:middle line:84%
unidentified flying objects are
moving around in a propelled,

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:10.300 align:middle line:90%
obviously by exotic systems--

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.260 align:middle line:84%
what I'm learning from
networking with folks

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.170 align:middle line:84%
is there's a high probability
that these propulsion systems

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:19.230 align:middle line:84%
eject neutrinos as part
of their activity, which

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:24.210 align:middle line:84%
would make the Neutrino
Detector a very viable hardware

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:28.290 align:middle line:84%
system for an air traffic
control tower type

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:30.380 align:middle line:84%
operation for all
of these things

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:31.980 align:middle line:90%
moving through our atmosphere.

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:34.375 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Alien
technology or ours?

00:16:34.375 --> 00:16:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: Alien and
ours, because if it's

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.430 align:middle line:84%
propelled by these exotic
systems and neutrinos

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:42.620 align:middle line:84%
are being ejected,
then I think it's just

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.625 align:middle line:84%
going to be a full spectrum
observation of that activity.

00:16:45.625 --> 00:16:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who came up with
this Neutrino Detector?

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:51.290 align:middle line:84%
It seems like it's being used
for all kinds of space things.

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: If I
remember correctly,

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.060 align:middle line:84%
it was a scientist from the
Brookhaven National Laboratories

00:16:56.060 --> 00:17:00.080 align:middle line:84%
on Long Island, which is,
again, an interesting connection

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:03.600 align:middle line:84%
between Antarctica, the
military industrial complex,

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.970 align:middle line:90%
and monopolized technologies.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:09.200 align:middle line:84%
Lest we forget that
Operation Paperclip made

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.050 align:middle line:84%
Long Island quite the
repository for Nazi scientists

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:14.389 align:middle line:90%
post World War II.

00:17:14.389 --> 00:17:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the detector
being used for space assets?

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: I absolutely believe
that the Neutrino Detector also

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.819 align:middle line:84%
has the capability
to provide what

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:25.290 align:middle line:84%
is referred to as
quantum-entangled

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:27.710 align:middle line:84%
faster-than-light
communications.

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:32.320 align:middle line:84%
Gary McKinnon, a few years
back, hacked into NASA

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:35.120 align:middle line:84%
and discovered that they
had an off-world fleet.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And he listed the names of
the ships and the captains.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.590 align:middle line:84%
So to me, it seems
very reasonable

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:45.140 align:middle line:84%
that if we were to have a
fleet out there being active,

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.110 align:middle line:84%
we would have to have
some sort of a means

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:48.770 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with them.

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:51.325 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe that the
South Pole station would be

00:17:51.325 --> 00:17:52.575 align:middle line:90%
able to provide that capacity.

00:17:52.575 --> 00:17:56.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Back in 2011, Eric,
there was a New Zealand

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:57.230 align:middle line:90%
earthquake.

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:00.185 align:middle line:84%
Did this technology have
anything to do with it?

00:18:00.185 --> 00:18:01.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: Absolutely.

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:04.270 align:middle line:84%
It's my understanding
in February of 2011

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:07.780 align:middle line:84%
is when the IceCube
Neutrino Detector went

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:11.090 align:middle line:84%
from construction phase to
operations and maintenance.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.040 align:middle line:84%
That was the season
that I was present.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And it is my understanding
that when they first

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:19.630 align:middle line:84%
fired that system up in
its transmit capacity,

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:24.340 align:middle line:84%
it misfired basically,
and hit Christchurch, New

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:26.095 align:middle line:90%
Zealand by accident.

00:18:26.095 --> 00:18:26.895 align:middle line:90%
Twice--

00:18:26.895 --> 00:18:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.805 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: --before they
were able to dial it in.

00:18:29.805 --> 00:18:31.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they still
using it for that purpose?

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: I have no reason to
believe they would have stopped.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Whatever their motives
were, to instigate

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:41.590 align:middle line:84%
their nefarious
secret activity, I

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:43.670 align:middle line:90%
can only assume have continued.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:47.210 align:middle line:84%
They're going to make that
facility 10 times bigger.

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:50.350 align:middle line:84%
The IceCube Neutrino
Detector is slated

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:52.866 align:middle line:90%
to be increased in size tenfold.

00:18:52.866 --> 00:18:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Aren't you
afraid for yourself?

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: No.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.217 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: I don't live that way.

00:18:59.217 --> 00:19:01.300 align:middle line:84%
I kind of almost just feel
like that's programming

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.710 align:middle line:84%
that they want everybody
to be afraid to speak up.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:05.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm a bit more old-fashioned.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And the way I've always looked
at life is if somebody--

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.130 align:middle line:84%
if I'm trying to do something
and somebody's trying

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:16.550 align:middle line:84%
to tell me not to do that
or another way to do it,

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:19.695 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty much just going to
double down on doing it my way.

00:19:19.695 --> 00:19:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: HAARP in Alaska may
be used for weather control.

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.295 align:middle line:84%
What about the
Neutrino Detector?

00:19:24.295 --> 00:19:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: Fantastic question.

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:30.140 align:middle line:84%
I think that Nick Begich has
done the lion's share of work

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.250 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to
the topic of HAARP,

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:36.200 align:middle line:84%
and has certainly proven the
potential directed-energy weapon

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.868 align:middle line:90%
uses for that platform.

00:19:37.868 --> 00:19:39.410 align:middle line:84%
What I'm trying to
bring to the table

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:43.610 align:middle line:84%
is to express to people that
the IceCube Neutrino Detector is

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:46.080 align:middle line:90%
like HAARP on steroids.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.770 align:middle line:84%
The HAARP Array in Alaska is
on the surface of the Earth,

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:51.810 align:middle line:84%
and it has the dimensions
of length and width.

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:56.760 align:middle line:10%
The IceCube Neutrino Detector
is embedded in the ice as well,

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.990 align:middle line:10%
so it adds a third
dimension to it.

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:03.240 align:middle line:84%
So now you have length,
width, and height to it.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's magnitudes when we're
talking these type of systems.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which of
the technologies

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:12.310 align:middle line:84%
is the latest, HAARP or
the Neutrino Detector?

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:15.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: The Neutrino Detector
would be the newer of the two

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:16.720 align:middle line:90%
technologies, sir.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it would
probably do more things.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:20.185 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: Yes, sir.

00:20:20.185 --> 00:20:21.935 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who controls
the weather and why?

00:20:21.935 --> 00:20:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: I don't know, and
that's another great question.

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:29.010 align:middle line:84%
When I went to Washington, DC,
and testified for the Senate

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:31.320 align:middle line:90%
Intelligence Committee and ARO.

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.330 align:middle line:84%
At the end of those
testimonies, that

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:36.850 align:middle line:84%
was basically where we were
left sitting at the table, was,

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:41.310 align:middle line:84%
what do we do now that we're
cognizant that there are

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:45.870 align:middle line:84%
rogue factions with monopolized
technology operating

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:49.080 align:middle line:84%
without oversight from
the American government

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.525 align:middle line:84%
and therefore the
American people?

00:20:50.525 --> 00:20:52.565 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
the ARO building?

00:20:52.565 --> 00:20:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: The ARO building
at the South Pole station

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:57.816 align:middle line:84%
is the Atmospheric
Research Observatory.

00:20:57.816 --> 00:21:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you witnessed some
kind of strange green laser

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:01.960 align:middle line:90%
fired from there?

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:02.420 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:03.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: Yes, sir.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:09.210 align:middle line:84%
On multiple occasions, I would
see a very strong green laser

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:13.028 align:middle line:84%
beam fire from the top
floor of that building.

00:21:13.028 --> 00:21:14.320 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I know the arrangement.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.360 align:middle line:84%
It was coming from
the top floor,

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.480 align:middle line:90%
would go through the roof.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.330 align:middle line:84%
They had a hatch
that they would open

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:22.320 align:middle line:84%
and this thing would just
shoot out up into the cosmos.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:23.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Chemical lasers?

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:24.580 align:middle line:90%
Superfluids?

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:25.730 align:middle line:90%
What's going on there?

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: That's
my understanding.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:28.317 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
things that I'm

00:21:28.317 --> 00:21:30.730 align:middle line:84%
learning the most
about right now

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:34.340 align:middle line:90%
is the concept of superfluids.

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:37.210 align:middle line:84%
Things that are chilled
to really ridiculously

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:38.180 align:middle line:90%
low temperatures.

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:41.410 align:middle line:84%
At the South Pole, we had
about a half a million gallons

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:45.650 align:middle line:84%
of helium stored at
four degrees Kelvin,

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:48.920 align:middle line:84%
which is only four degrees
above absolute zero.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:52.100 align:middle line:84%
So in regards to
chemical lasers,

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:56.990 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if this type of
system is utilizing the helium.

00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:58.755 align:middle line:84%
I have spoken to
other personnel.

00:21:58.755 --> 00:22:00.130 align:middle line:84%
I've spoken to a
lot of personnel

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:02.030 align:middle line:84%
about things that go
on at the South Pole,

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:05.740 align:middle line:84%
and I wound up crossing paths
with the gentleman who once

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:11.440 align:middle line:84%
had the task of transporting
the helium from the bulk storage

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.350 align:middle line:84%
to the actual science
projects, and he

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:18.620 align:middle line:84%
agreed that the very minute
amount of helium that they were

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:22.580 align:middle line:84%
using for science did not
justify the bulk that they

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.150 align:middle line:90%
had maintained there.

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:26.480 align:middle line:84%
So again, it brings me
back to that question of,

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.485 align:middle line:84%
what are they doing as
their primary presentation?

00:22:29.485 --> 00:22:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And then what are
these resources

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:33.820 align:middle line:84%
being utilized for in secondary
and tertiary capacities?

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:37.136 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Eric, is this
reversed alien technology?

00:22:37.136 --> 00:22:39.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: You know, it could be.

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:41.960 align:middle line:90%
It's very possible that it is.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
we oftentimes get

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.300 align:middle line:84%
too locked up in these
types of conversations

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:52.490 align:middle line:84%
because once we you have a bad
guy with the gun in his hand

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:54.900 align:middle line:84%
pointing it at you, I
mean, at that point,

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the
conversation really

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.550 align:middle line:90%
matters where he got it from.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:22:59.833 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Because he has it.

00:22:59.833 --> 00:23:02.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: He's got the gun and
he's got it pointed at you.

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's been talk
about an upcoming false flag

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:06.297 align:middle line:90%
of an alien invasion.

00:23:06.297 --> 00:23:07.380 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard about that?

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:12.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: I absolutely have,
and I find it very concerning.

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:16.080 align:middle line:84%
I wholly believe in
the potential for there

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:19.320 align:middle line:84%
to be a massive amount
of technology that

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.950 align:middle line:84%
could be applied that, for
all practical purposes,

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:25.030 align:middle line:84%
to the average person
on this planet,

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:28.590 align:middle line:84%
would be very convincing
that something off world

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:29.630 align:middle line:90%
is coming on world.

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would
they do this to us?

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.160 align:middle line:90%
Holograms?

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:32.993 align:middle line:90%
What would they use?

00:23:32.993 --> 00:23:34.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: Holograms, vehicles.

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:39.510 align:middle line:84%
I have no doubt in my mind that
the many factions of this planet

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:42.630 align:middle line:84%
are utilizing what
we would commonly

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:46.780 align:middle line:84%
refer to as UFO technology,
anti-gravitic technology.

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.780 align:middle line:84%
There's been folks like T
Townsend Brown, Nikola Tesla,

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:50.693 align:middle line:90%
Viktor Schauberger.

00:23:50.693 --> 00:23:52.110 align:middle line:84%
There's been all
kinds of research

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:55.020 align:middle line:84%
on this stuff for decades, and
it doesn't really seem to me

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:56.980 align:middle line:90%
that they didn't figure it out.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:59.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm more walking the line
that they did figure it out

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:03.200 align:middle line:84%
and they just absconded it
into certain communities.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There is a
syndrome called the Havana

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:11.520 align:middle line:84%
syndrome, which our people
believe originated in a USA

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:15.700 align:middle line:84%
embassy, and that the
Cubans were bombarding us

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.990 align:middle line:90%
with some kind of particle beam.

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:19.305 align:middle line:90%
What do you know about that?

00:24:19.305 --> 00:24:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: I have done a
bit of research on that.

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:24.820 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a worthy
direction for anybody

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:28.090 align:middle line:84%
to look into because it
follows the technology.

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:30.448 align:middle line:84%
The Department of
Defense even put out

00:24:30.448 --> 00:24:32.740 align:middle line:84%
literature, which I've provided
in the archives section

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:33.590 align:middle line:90%
of my website.

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:35.830 align:middle line:90%
People can reference it.

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:38.157 align:middle line:84%
In order for their
personnel to follow up--

00:24:38.157 --> 00:24:39.532 align:middle line:84%
you were in the
service, you know

00:24:39.532 --> 00:24:41.410 align:middle line:84%
that they have a
responsibility to the health

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:42.530 align:middle line:90%
of their personnel.

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:45.430 align:middle line:84%
So the Department of Defense
has provided an avenue

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:48.190 align:middle line:84%
for their employees and
families of their employees

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:51.700 align:middle line:84%
to report Havana
syndrome symptoms

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.440 align:middle line:84%
so that they can get the medical
attention that they deserve.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:59.240 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, making it
real for everybody.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.810 align:middle line:84%
If the Department of Defense
has to protect their personnel

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:03.720 align:middle line:84%
from these symptoms,
it's not fake.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You testified before
the Senate about this too,

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:07.220 align:middle line:90%
didn't you?

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: Yes, sir.

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
they want to know?

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: They wanted to know
what I had observed in the South

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:13.350 align:middle line:90%
Pole station.

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:15.210 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to know
about power supplies.

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:17.870 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to know about
potential locations of power

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:19.080 align:middle line:90%
supplies.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.690 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to know
who was in charge

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:22.500 align:middle line:84%
and what I thought
about who was in charge.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:25.320 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't have any pertinent
information in that regard.

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:29.660 align:middle line:84%
So it was a lot about just
confirming things that I

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.450 align:middle line:84%
had been public about
before, but they just

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:34.033 align:middle line:84%
wanted to hear it
from me specifically

00:25:34.033 --> 00:25:35.533 align:middle line:84%
to make sure there
was no confusion.

00:25:35.533 --> 00:25:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does your gut
tell you about the syndrome?

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: What my gut tells me
is that these technologies are

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:45.240 align:middle line:84%
being used in mass
all around us,

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:50.100 align:middle line:84%
and everybody is starting
to suffer these symptoms,

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.385 align:middle line:90%
but nobody's paying attention.

00:25:51.385 --> 00:25:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
the symptoms, Eric?

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: Fatigue,
Voice-to-Skull stuff

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.520 align:middle line:84%
has been on the list
as well, so that

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.330 align:middle line:90%
would be intrusive thoughts.

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:01.920 align:middle line:90%
Nausea, vertigo.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.390 align:middle line:90%
They're very referenceable.

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Anybody can Google
Havana syndrome symptoms.

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:09.362 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they tests
for something larger?

00:26:09.362 --> 00:26:10.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: What do
you mean by that?

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:12.195 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Perhaps
they would do it

00:26:12.195 --> 00:26:14.495 align:middle line:84%
on masses instead of
a little building.

00:26:14.495 --> 00:26:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: Oh, absolutely.

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:18.337 align:middle line:84%
I think that there's been a lot
of research and development done

00:26:18.337 --> 00:26:22.770 align:middle line:84%
through the decades to get
it dialed in to this point

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:25.740 align:middle line:84%
where they can now,
instead of just targeting

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:28.230 align:middle line:84%
small groups of people
and testing for outcomes

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:30.520 align:middle line:84%
and getting control over
it and manipulations,

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.810 align:middle line:84%
I think what I'm observing
around me is that it's just--

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:34.895 align:middle line:90%
it's happening in mass.

00:26:34.895 --> 00:26:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you testified
before the Senate,

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:38.586 align:middle line:90%
did they seem baffled?

00:26:38.586 --> 00:26:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: No.

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:40.238 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Concerned?

00:26:40.238 --> 00:26:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: The Senate
Intelligence Committee

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:43.600 align:middle line:84%
had a scientist,
and I apologize,

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.010 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember his name.

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:46.480 align:middle line:90%
He was very concerned.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.400 align:middle line:90%
Everybody was very concerned.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.640 align:middle line:84%
But he was kind of
like the point person

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.270 align:middle line:90%
that I would communicate with.

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And then he would translate
the science aspect to it,

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:57.122 align:middle line:84%
to the other people in
the room so that could

00:26:57.122 --> 00:26:59.580 align:middle line:84%
wrap their heads around where
we were going with this stuff

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:02.560 align:middle line:90%
because it's pretty threatening.

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:08.090 align:middle line:84%
The ramifications of what
I am presenting is huge.

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:12.290 align:middle line:84%
So when the implications
get this high,

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:15.806 align:middle line:84%
I feel like it just
necessitates the consideration.

00:27:15.806 --> 00:27:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who do you
think is behind it?

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: Very wealthy people.

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:20.830 align:middle line:90%
I think this is--

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:23.750 align:middle line:84%
as history has shown
us time and time again,

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:26.680 align:middle line:84%
the rich people will step
on the throats of the poor

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.820 align:middle line:84%
until the poor do
something about it.

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:30.360 align:middle line:90%
I believe this is a class war.

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in all this, Eric?

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:34.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: Well, I
guess they tapped me

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:37.370 align:middle line:84%
as a kid in grammar school and
said, welcome to the program.

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
people like you?

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: That's
a great question.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm thoroughly concerned
that since this processing

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:47.800 align:middle line:84%
of children seems to be
going unchecked from my youth

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:51.370 align:middle line:84%
until now, I think if we
ever do an investigation

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:54.970 align:middle line:84%
into these groups
that are experimenting

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:57.110 align:middle line:84%
on children without their
parents' permission,

00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:59.235 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going to find
some sickening numbers.

00:27:59.235 --> 00:28:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why you?

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:01.320 align:middle line:90%
How did they find you?

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: I happened to
test well, apparently.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:07.540 align:middle line:84%
I had no problems with
academics as a child,

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:10.370 align:middle line:84%
I absorbed information
very rapidly.

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:13.340 align:middle line:90%
I was in my early school years.

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:15.145 align:middle line:90%
I was doing very advanced stuff.

00:28:15.145 --> 00:28:17.020 align:middle line:84%
If I was in first grade,
I sat in first grade

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:18.470 align:middle line:84%
and I had to do all
the first grade work,

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:20.262 align:middle line:84%
but I also had teachers
coming from second,

00:28:20.262 --> 00:28:22.600 align:middle line:84%
and third grade that would
come in and give me more

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.015 align:middle line:90%
work from the higher levels.

00:28:24.015 --> 00:28:27.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So as you're testing,
that's kind of got them to go,

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:28.890 align:middle line:90%
hey, we got to watch this kid.

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:30.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think so.

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:32.155 align:middle line:90%
And then I think there's other--

00:28:32.155 --> 00:28:34.390 align:middle line:84%
I hear people say
like bloodline things,

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:37.430 align:middle line:84%
just like you asked
about my family history.

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:40.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the whys and
wherefores of their interest,

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:44.380 align:middle line:84%
but it does appear that there's
bloodline stuff going on

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:47.180 align:middle line:84%
or genetics and
things like that.

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:51.260 align:middle line:84%
I do recall part of
my submarine service,

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:53.650 align:middle line:84%
besides the NSA
investigation, they

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:58.900 align:middle line:84%
do a wild physical inspection
and mental checks and things

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:00.590 align:middle line:90%
like that, all kinds of stuff.

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And in that process, I
learned that apparently I'm

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:09.690 align:middle line:84%
physically interesting, that
I'm in the top 2% of humanity

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:11.800 align:middle line:90%
in regards to I don't get sick.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.350 align:middle line:84%
If I get sick, I respond
well to light medication.

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:16.060 align:middle line:90%
Just silly things like that.

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:18.820 align:middle line:84%
So apparently it's
important to them.

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:20.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what their list is.

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you concerned
about your own family

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.655 align:middle line:90%
being centered for this?

00:29:23.655 --> 00:29:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: I've had threats
across the board for myself

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:27.430 align:middle line:90%
personally.

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:30.880 align:middle line:84%
I've had threats
fired at loved ones,

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:34.390 align:middle line:84%
and I've spoken to my
loved ones about it.

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:38.088 align:middle line:84%
And I guess I come from a family
that says, don't back down.

00:29:38.088 --> 00:29:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you don't hear
too much about the Havana

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:41.920 align:middle line:90%
syndrome anymore.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:42.930 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: I don't think we hear
much about it to begin with.

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:46.805 align:middle line:84%
Even when they
did roll it out, I

00:29:46.805 --> 00:29:49.260 align:middle line:84%
don't think that it got the
attention that it deserved.

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think much of this
monopolized technology,

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:56.670 align:middle line:84%
they don't want it in
the general conversation

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:57.805 align:middle line:90%
of the population.

00:29:57.805 --> 00:29:59.930 align:middle line:84%
They really want to keep
this stuff in the shadows.

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:02.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: I believe
there's a lot of profit

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:05.320 align:middle line:84%
in the monopoly
of the technology.

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Once you make a technology
public, it becomes regulated

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:13.570 align:middle line:90%
and then, in a sense, shared.

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Everybody else gets
access to it in a way.

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if you don't
go down that road,

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:22.346 align:middle line:84%
there seems to be a lot of
benefit in the monopoly.

00:30:22.346 --> 00:30:24.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
actionable intelligence

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:27.670 align:middle line:84%
did you pass on to Congress,
and what have they done with it?

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:28.590 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: Excellent.

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:32.970 align:middle line:84%
The actionable intelligence that
I passed on to Congress and ARO

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:37.060 align:middle line:84%
was the actual capabilities
of these systems,

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:40.870 align:middle line:84%
the actual state
of these systems,

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:45.480 align:middle line:84%
the location of these systems,
the potential locations

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:49.090 align:middle line:84%
of the power sources
for these systems,

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:53.100 align:middle line:84%
and the companies that
have a paperwork trail

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:56.610 align:middle line:84%
to be affiliated with, at least
at some point in the history

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:58.470 align:middle line:84%
of their company
being affiliated

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:02.450 align:middle line:84%
with the misuse, abuse and
operations without oversight.

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:05.530 align:middle line:84%
So every bit of this is
worthy of consideration

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:09.620 align:middle line:84%
for our government to move to
action and investigate further.

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:13.970 align:middle line:84%
I was under the impression that
was the whole point of gathering

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:18.020 align:middle line:84%
the information was for them
to figure out what to do next.

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:21.040 align:middle line:84%
From my perspective,
it appears that they

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:26.590 align:middle line:84%
have accomplished doing nothing
and/or damage to the topic

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:29.930 align:middle line:84%
and is so far as
ARO has actually,

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:35.480 align:middle line:84%
in their summary report,
lied about my testimony.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:38.450 align:middle line:84%
I clearly shared
everything with them,

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:43.270 align:middle line:84%
which involved the damage
to myself and my crew

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:45.820 align:middle line:84%
regarding proximity to the
directed energy, weapons

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:48.590 align:middle line:84%
and suffering Havana
syndrome symptoms.

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:50.930 align:middle line:84%
When they gave their
summary report publicly,

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:53.350 align:middle line:84%
they stated with great
clarity that there

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:57.640 align:middle line:84%
were reports of Havana
syndrome symptom victims

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:02.095 align:middle line:84%
from every single continent
except for Antarctica.

00:32:02.095 --> 00:32:03.775 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which
was totally wrong.

00:32:03.775 --> 00:32:04.775 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: They're lying.

00:32:04.775 --> 00:32:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there specific
companies involved in this?

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: Raytheon polar
services for the time period

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:11.010 align:middle line:90%
that I was there.

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:14.540 align:middle line:84%
I believe Lockheed Martin
currently has the contract.

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:18.150 align:middle line:90%
PAE was involved at some point.

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:19.770 align:middle line:84%
But to the best of
my recollection,

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:22.830 align:middle line:84%
if you simply go to the National
Science Foundation's website,

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:25.790 align:middle line:84%
they will list for you all the
third party contractors that

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:27.360 align:middle line:90%
are currently affiliated with.

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think this machine

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:31.820 align:middle line:90%
that they turn on looks like?

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:35.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: The domes are
basically basketball-sized items

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:39.740 align:middle line:84%
that are embedded in the
ice in a one kilometer

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:42.620 align:middle line:84%
by one kilometer by
one kilometer phased

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:44.340 align:middle line:90%
array orientation.

00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:46.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost
like a whole bunch

00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:49.810 align:middle line:84%
of strings with basketballs
hanging on them, just embedded

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:50.610 align:middle line:90%
in the ice.

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:56.026 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we ignoring these
actionable intelligence ideas?

00:32:56.026 --> 00:32:58.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER:
Unfortunately, yes, sir.

00:32:58.210 --> 00:32:59.520 align:middle line:90%
I do not believe--

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:01.830 align:middle line:84%
part of me-- I'm sure you
recall a couple of years

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:05.042 align:middle line:84%
ago they were talking
about, invade Area 51,

00:33:05.042 --> 00:33:06.125 align:middle line:90%
and it was kind of a joke.

00:33:06.125 --> 00:33:07.175 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, right.

00:33:07.175 --> 00:33:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: But I kind
of feel like there

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:12.220 align:middle line:84%
should have been activity,
investigate South Pole.

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:13.830 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
call it an invasion,

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:16.120 align:middle line:84%
but it's worthy
of investigation.

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:20.290 align:middle line:84%
Why not send folks in there
to see what can be seen?

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:22.780 align:middle line:90%
I volunteer my services.

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:25.800 align:middle line:84%
I would be happy to go in there
with an investigative team

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:30.330 align:middle line:84%
and open the doors and inspect
and look and show everybody

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:32.080 align:middle line:84%
on the map, like,
let's look over here,

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.005 align:middle line:90%
let's look over there.

00:33:33.005 --> 00:33:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could be
an American hero, Eric.

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:36.675 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: Or freeze trying.

00:33:36.675 --> 00:33:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would you like
people to learn from you?

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: I would
like people to learn

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:44.520 align:middle line:84%
that there is a lot
of technology that

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:47.640 align:middle line:84%
has been utilized for
many years, that's

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:51.190 align:middle line:84%
just outside of their
purview, that we, the people,

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:54.730 align:middle line:84%
have invested our tax
dollars into the research

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:57.820 align:middle line:84%
and development of technologies
that not only are we

00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:00.820 align:middle line:84%
not getting the
benefit of, they're

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:02.570 align:middle line:84%
being used against
us negatively.

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:03.770 align:middle line:90%
And it's a sin.

00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:06.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a sin what's going
on right now in the world.

00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is anybody
reacting to your testimony?

00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:11.389 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: I don't think enough.

00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:13.840 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate being
brought in here today.

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:15.699 align:middle line:84%
I do appreciate the
folks that I have

00:34:15.699 --> 00:34:19.150 align:middle line:84%
engaged with that do
see eye to eye with me

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:21.699 align:middle line:90%
on the potential problems.

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:25.000 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, I think a
lot of people in the disclosure

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.100 align:middle line:84%
communities are really here
for the spectacle, which

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:35.835 align:middle line:84%
sounds fun and interesting and
love and light in the future--

00:34:35.835 --> 00:34:37.210 align:middle line:84%
the information
that I'm bringing

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:40.840 align:middle line:84%
is a bit on the darker
side and obliges

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:44.630 align:middle line:84%
people that respect the
information to do something.

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think ignorance is
bliss, and a lot of people

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:49.989 align:middle line:84%
just want to ignore
what I'm saying

00:34:49.989 --> 00:34:53.475 align:middle line:84%
because it absolves them of
any responsibility to action.

00:34:53.475 --> 00:34:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have there been
any ramifications for you

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.155 align:middle line:90%
based on your testimony?

00:34:58.155 --> 00:34:59.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: Absolutely.

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:01.350 align:middle line:84%
I get threats all
the time, which

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:03.510 align:middle line:84%
is neither here nor there
because it doesn't really

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:04.530 align:middle line:90%
bother me.

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:07.830 align:middle line:84%
But the things that
do impact me is I

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:11.710 align:middle line:84%
have a really hard time staying
properly employed at this point,

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:15.545 align:middle line:84%
and I'm well aware of the fact
that at any point in time,

00:35:15.545 --> 00:35:16.920 align:middle line:84%
the right people
can make a phone

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.960 align:middle line:84%
call to the right people in
any company that I work for,

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.700 align:middle line:90%
and next thing I'm out of work.

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And that happens
quite regularly now.

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: Because they
don't want me funded.

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:32.230 align:middle line:84%
If I have money in the bank,
I will fight this beast.

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And I am doing
this all on my own.

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.280 align:middle line:90%
I do not have deep pockets.

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't have sponsors.

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:38.500 align:middle line:90%
I have nothing.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:41.030 align:middle line:84%
I work, I make money, I
travel, I try to disclose.

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is your
biggest concern, Eric?

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:45.833 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Running out
of money, and before I

00:35:45.833 --> 00:35:47.000 align:middle line:90%
get disclosure accomplished.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.282 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:35:48.282 --> 00:35:49.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fight it!

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:50.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: Yeah.

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:51.010 align:middle line:90%
It is what it is.

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:52.450 align:middle line:90%
I can still sling tools.

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:55.170 align:middle line:84%
I can still keep
fighting the good fight.

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:56.810 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, I don't
go homeless first.

00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:59.102 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why doesn't the
media do more on this?

00:35:59.102 --> 00:36:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: Because the
media is bought and sold.

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:02.650 align:middle line:90%
We've known that for decades.

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:08.050 align:middle line:84%
Now we have-- the internet is
just the modern mass media.

00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:11.040 align:middle line:84%
I've said it plenty of times
that if I make the statement

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.300 align:middle line:84%
that the mass media
is wholly corrupted,

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:14.890 align:middle line:90%
nobody really argues with me.

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:17.910 align:middle line:84%
But if I then say,
and the internet

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:21.460 align:middle line:84%
is part of the mass media,
everybody gets furious.

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:24.028 align:middle line:84%
How dare you say that the
internet's wholly corrupted?

00:36:24.028 --> 00:36:25.070 align:middle line:90%
Well, take a look around.

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you convinced that
UFO and directed-energy weapons

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:29.915 align:middle line:90%
are being suppressed?

00:36:29.915 --> 00:36:31.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: Absolutely.

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm 100% convinced of it.

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:35.280 align:middle line:84%
From my perspective,
that seems to be

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:39.060 align:middle line:84%
the big skeleton in the
closet for a lot of people,

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.770 align:middle line:84%
is they want to
distance themselves

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:44.340 align:middle line:84%
from the liability of all of
these decades of activities

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:45.220 align:middle line:90%
of cover up.

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:46.428 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why the suppression?

00:36:46.428 --> 00:36:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: Because
of the liability.

00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:53.525 align:middle line:84%
All these people have
basically gotten--

00:36:53.525 --> 00:36:54.860 align:middle line:90%
they got their hands dirty.

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:57.318 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they don't know
how to get out of it, do they?

00:36:57.318 --> 00:36:59.912 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: They
can't get out of it.

00:36:59.912 --> 00:37:00.745 align:middle line:90%
They're in too deep.

00:37:00.745 --> 00:37:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can you name names?

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:05.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: I don't think I
can name anyone specifically.

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:08.570 align:middle line:84%
I think we just
need to look at what

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:13.580 align:middle line:84%
we know are the military
industrial complex contractors

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:16.400 align:middle line:84%
and just call it
the usual suspects.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Within all
the countries or just--

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:19.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: Oh, absolutely.

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:19.775 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:37:19.775 --> 00:37:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not
just a US problem?

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: This is
not a US problem.

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.830 align:middle line:90%
This is way above nation states.

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:27.303 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about disclosure?

00:37:27.303 --> 00:37:28.220 align:middle line:90%
Is that going to come?

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: Not at the rate
that we're being presented.

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:32.358 align:middle line:84%
What's going on in the
disclosure community right now

00:37:32.358 --> 00:37:33.600 align:middle line:90%
is just a joke.

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.430 align:middle line:90%
It's a total joke.

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:38.720 align:middle line:84%
There are whistleblowers
out there right now

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:43.790 align:middle line:84%
that went to Washington, DC
when I was a whistleblower,

00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:45.480 align:middle line:84%
but they weren't
whistleblowers then.

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:50.060 align:middle line:84%
They represented factions that
were there to investigate me,

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:54.900 align:middle line:84%
to have me arrested by the FBI
or removed through wetworks,

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:56.040 align:middle line:90%
which is murder.

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.990 align:middle line:84%
So now these same people
that went to Washington, DC

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:05.990 align:middle line:84%
to perform that activity against
me are now in the public forum

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:09.860 align:middle line:84%
presenting themselves as
whistleblowers, regurgitating

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:14.870 align:middle line:84%
the information that was
collected by ARO from myself

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:17.480 align:middle line:84%
and others, and now
I'm watching them

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:20.890 align:middle line:84%
become the mouthpiece for topics
that I don't think are theirs.

00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can these
technologies, Eric,

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:26.365 align:middle line:84%
be used for torturing people,
for controlling people?

00:38:26.365 --> 00:38:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: It's my
understanding that they can.

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:30.930 align:middle line:84%
There's a term called
targeted individuals,

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:34.940 align:middle line:84%
and that seems to me to be what
has been decades of research

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:38.550 align:middle line:84%
and development on how they
can fine tune these things,

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:41.240 align:middle line:84%
to appropriately
connect to people

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:44.200 align:middle line:84%
and engage and manipulate
and modify behavior.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The technology
that must be within humanity

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:48.941 align:middle line:90%
has got to be unbelievable.

00:38:48.941 --> 00:38:50.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: Oh, absolutely.

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:51.210 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't agree more.

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:54.240 align:middle line:84%
I think we're probably--
from the early 80s,

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:58.790 align:middle line:84%
I heard that they said the
military technology would

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:03.410 align:middle line:84%
advance 50 years for every year
that the civilian technology

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:04.350 align:middle line:90%
increased.

00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:08.390 align:middle line:84%
So I think the disparity
that exists right now

00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:10.180 align:middle line:84%
would really just
blow people's minds.

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long do you
think the Havana syndrome was

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.638 align:middle line:84%
happening before
we heard about it?

00:39:15.638 --> 00:39:16.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: Great question.

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:20.390 align:middle line:84%
I think the Havana syndrome
activity from the time that it

00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:24.255 align:middle line:84%
was reported was probably going
on, I would say, for at least

00:39:24.255 --> 00:39:25.055 align:middle line:90%
a decade prior.

00:39:25.055 --> 00:39:26.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That long?

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:27.925 align:middle line:90%
Why conceal the truth?

00:39:27.925 --> 00:39:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: Control, monopoly.

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:31.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
they afraid of?

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:33.745 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: Lacking
power and control.

00:39:33.745 --> 00:39:36.845 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How serious is the
UFO disclosure movement?

00:39:36.845 --> 00:39:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: I think the UFO
disclosure movement currently is

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:44.280 align:middle line:84%
working very seriously at
not disclosing anything

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:51.330 align:middle line:84%
and pretending like humanity
on this planet does not possess

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:56.260 align:middle line:84%
these technologies in mass,
and is attempting to--

00:39:56.260 --> 00:40:00.820 align:middle line:84%
every time man-made
activities are observed,

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:05.410 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to rebrand
it as offworld UFO activity.

00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:07.710 align:middle line:84%
Unbeknownst to
us, our government

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:09.400 align:middle line:90%
can't have this technology.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:12.760 align:middle line:84%
No other government is known
to have this technology.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.010 align:middle line:90%
It's what we keep hearing.

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:15.240 align:middle line:90%
Those are the lies.

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has the UFO
disclosure movement

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:20.930 align:middle line:84%
been infiltrated
by those people?

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:24.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: The UFO
disclosure community

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:31.650 align:middle line:84%
has always been owned and
operated by these people.

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:36.120 align:middle line:84%
You may recall in the 1970s a
faction known as COINTELPRO that

00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:39.010 align:middle line:90%
was outed as an arm of the FBI.

00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:44.410 align:middle line:84%
I would suggest that COINTELPRO
type activities have always

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:46.650 align:middle line:90%
controlled the UFO narrative.

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They never
went away, didn't they?

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: Never went
away, from day one.

00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:54.230 align:middle line:84%
The narrative started before
there was any public knowledge,

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:55.030 align:middle line:90%
probably.

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:58.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is how these
operations function.

00:40:58.190 --> 00:41:01.580 align:middle line:84%
The split second they know that
they have something to cover up,

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:04.610 align:middle line:84%
they start the cover up before
any information gets out.

00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:06.180 align:middle line:90%
That's what disinformation is.

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've talked

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:10.960 align:middle line:90%
about an alien false flag.

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HECKER: Absolutely.

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:17.380 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going to happen
probably pretty soon the way

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:20.048 align:middle line:84%
things have been
looking as of late.

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:23.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: Oh, I think
it'll be a big power play.

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:27.070 align:middle line:84%
It'll be almost like a
martial law type situation.

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:31.630 align:middle line:84%
It'll be similar to when
9/11 got us the Patriot Act.

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:34.530 align:middle line:84%
We lost a lot of rights
when 9/11 occurred.

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:35.600 align:middle line:90%

available legislation on what
we all need to do immediately.

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:50.180 align:middle line:84%
What rights we have

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:52.020 align:middle line:90%
curfews we have to follow this.

00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:57.180 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be all kinds of
attacks on individual liberties,

00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:58.970 align:middle line:84%
and that will be
a clear indicator

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:00.265 align:middle line:90%
that it's a false flag.

00:42:00.265 --> 00:42:01.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
you think they'll

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.890 align:middle line:90%
drop this false flag on us?

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:07.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: I think we're going
to get a fantastic magic show

00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:08.386 align:middle line:90%

00:42:08.386 --> 00:42:09.432 align:middle line:90%

>>HECKER: Absolutely.

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:12.660 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
something off the wall.

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:15.350 align:middle line:84%
I feel like they've been
pumping everybody into this,

00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:19.460 align:middle line:84%
you know, you can't believe it
unless you see it mentality,

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:22.320 align:middle line:84%
which I get the logic
and reasoning behind it,

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:26.870 align:middle line:84%
but it seems to be being
watered very heavily as of

00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:30.680 align:middle line:84%
late because I think they want
to present something visually

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.230 align:middle line:84%
that they want to make
sure everyone believes.

people will believe it?

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: I think
the vast majority,

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:39.320 align:middle line:84%
just like we went through
the whole COVID debacle.

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:42.590 align:middle line:84%
In hindsight, look at all
the people now that believed,

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:45.460 align:middle line:84%
that learned that
they shouldn't have.

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:47.380 align:middle line:84%
So I think that was
a wonderful test run

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:50.360 align:middle line:84%
to see how much garbage you
can shove in someone's head,

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.150 align:middle line:90%
and get them to accept it.

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:54.696 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Eric, how do people
track your information?

00:42:54.696 --> 00:42:57.404 align:middle line:10%
>>HECKER: The best way for folks
to get a hold of my information,

00:42:57.404 --> 00:43:00.765 align:middle line:10%
sir, would be at my
website deciphering.tv.

00:43:00.765 --> 00:43:02.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Eric, how
soon will it happen?

00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: I think it's
the sooner the better.

00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:07.280 align:middle line:90%
It's time to get it over with.

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:11.470 align:middle line:84%
I think once people realize what
potentially could be going on

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:14.200 align:middle line:84%
and they realize
the actual truth,

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.432 align:middle line:84%
we can start to move forwards
with what reality really is.

00:43:17.432 --> 00:43:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on the program.

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:20.765 align:middle line:84%
>>HECKER: Thank you
for having me, sir.

00:43:20.765 --> 00:43:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Rest
assured, if there's

00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:26.230 align:middle line:84%
information like a false flag,
we'll have information for you

00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:27.920 align:middle line:90%
right here on Beyond Belief.

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.450 align:middle line:90%
We won't let you down.

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:30.820 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for watching.
