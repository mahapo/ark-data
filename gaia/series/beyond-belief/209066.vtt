a soul contract?

What is that?

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.470 align:middle line:10%
>>SOLARIS: A soul
contract is an agreement

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.750 align:middle line:10%
that one soul will
have with another soul

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.390 align:middle line:10%
in order to learn
lessons or to go

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.430 align:middle line:10%
through different
experiences together.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.040 align:middle line:90%
As souls, we're very expansive.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And this is
something that I work

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.990 align:middle line:84%

>>NOORY: So give me an
example of a soul contract.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: For instance,
a lot of people

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.050 align:middle line:84%
know the terminology
soulmates, that's

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.560 align:middle line:90%
an example of a soul contract.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.540 align:middle line:10%
A soulmate is usually somebody
that we've had past lives with,

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.740 align:middle line:10%
usually romantic, not always.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.900 align:middle line:84%
But usually, we feel
this familiarity

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.503 align:middle line:84%
when we meet a soulmate
even in this lifetime.

00:02:02.503 --> 00:02:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or at least an
emotional connection, right?

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.962 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, absolutely, yes.

00:02:05.962 --> 00:02:07.138 align:middle line:90%
Yes, very much so.

00:02:07.138 --> 00:02:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So many people,
when they break up

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.670 align:middle line:84%
with a soulmate think
it's the end of the world.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.590 align:middle line:90%
It's not, is it?

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Not at all.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.760 align:middle line:84%
Unlike twin flames, which we'll
also talk about, soulmates,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.710 align:middle line:90%
we have many soulmates.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.998 align:middle line:84%
So there's an endless
amount of soulmates--

00:02:23.998 --> 00:02:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So not just one?

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: No, not at all.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:26.570 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.445 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's good.

00:02:27.445 --> 00:02:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, why is it so important
during this time period

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.300 align:middle line:90%
to have the soul connection?

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: The reason why
soul contracts are very,

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.320 align:middle line:84%
I think, popular these
days, people are really

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.520 align:middle line:90%
looking at them.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.040 align:middle line:84%
When I do Akashic readings,
people are always asking me

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.000 align:middle line:84%
about their soul
contracts, is because we've

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.790 align:middle line:84%
gone through many lifetimes
where we're learning lessons

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.740 align:middle line:84%
through these soul contracts
that we have with others.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And so we go through many, many
lessons with the same souls.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.620 align:middle line:84%
So in this particular lifetime,
because we're all here

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.530 align:middle line:84%
to help Earth ascend
to the fifth dimension,

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.470 align:middle line:84%
we are all trying to clear
out our soul contracts

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.570 align:middle line:84%
and work through
those old lessons

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.170 align:middle line:84%
in order to help Earth
ascend to the fifth dimension

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.450 align:middle line:84%
and also to help raise
our consciousness

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.500 align:middle line:90%
to the level of consciousness.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.380 align:middle line:84%
So we're clearing away the
feelings of resentment, hate,

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.460 align:middle line:84%
grief, sadness, depression
in our contracts

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.763 align:middle line:84%
in order to achieve that
higher love consciousness.

00:03:32.763 --> 00:03:33.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is this a contract?

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.690 align:middle line:90%
Is this a deal with God?

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: It can be, yes.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.600 align:middle line:84%
I think as-- we're all
so shards of source

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.760 align:middle line:90%
so we're all pieces of God.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.270 align:middle line:90%
That's what I believe, anyway.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And so part of us
separating from source

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.010 align:middle line:84%
is to have different
experiences.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And we all want to have a
multitude of experiences

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.320 align:middle line:90%
with our soul contracts.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And even we learned a lot
of times, our most valuable

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.740 align:middle line:84%
lessons, even through some
of the so-called negative

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.100 align:middle line:84%
experiences we might
have with souls.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.020 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I think
it definitely is

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.840 align:middle line:84%
part of a contract we have with
God or source or the higher

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.640 align:middle line:90%
intelligence.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.713 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does everyone have
that soul contract ability?

00:04:17.713 --> 00:04:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Absolutely.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We do?

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.279 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:23.400 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has soul contracts.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Some of us might have
different soul contracts

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.830 align:middle line:84%
depending on what
lessons we've chosen

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.530 align:middle line:90%
to have in our incarnations.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.470 align:middle line:84%
Usually, we make decisions
about soul contracts

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.150 align:middle line:84%
in between life state
where it's called

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.100 align:middle line:90%
Bardo and Tibetan Buddhism.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's between death
and reincarnation.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.020 align:middle line:84%
So in between that
time, we usually

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.100 align:middle line:84%
go through a life review and
we're setting up decisions

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.990 align:middle line:90%
that are made during--

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.930 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to have
in our next incarnation.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.250 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, they definitely make--

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.910 align:middle line:84%
so everybody makes
these soul contracts.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.723 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
break the contract?

00:05:07.723 --> 00:05:09.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yes, you
can break contracts.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's probably
not a good idea, right?

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Actually, in some
cases, it is a good idea.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh really?

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:15.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh yeah.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I think so.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.610 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we might
repeat old lessons

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.060 align:middle line:84%
over and over and over
again, and it's no longer

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.215 align:middle line:90%
serving our highest good.

00:05:25.215 --> 00:05:27.780 align:middle line:90%


00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.730 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes you might want to
do an Akashic clearing or maybe

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.790 align:middle line:84%
some shadow work to release
those contracts that

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.680 align:middle line:84%
are no longer serving
your highest good

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.590 align:middle line:84%
and contributing to
your soul growth.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do people
generally make contracts

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.590 align:middle line:84%
with friends, loved
ones, employers?

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.880 align:middle line:90%
Who did they make it with?

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, there's a
multitude of different types

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.010 align:middle line:90%
of contracts.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.260 align:middle line:84%
There's twin flame
relationships,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.780 align:middle line:84%
they're soulmates which
we mentioned before,

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.680 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people are very
focused on the twin flame

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.907 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:06:02.907 --> 00:06:03.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what is that?

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: A twin
flame is a soul,

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.700 align:middle line:84%
and you usually
only have one, that

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.680 align:middle line:90%
is the other half of your soul.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.200 align:middle line:90%
So a lot of times when souls--

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --doppelganger
type thing?

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: It's a little bit
more complicated than that,

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.360 align:middle line:84%
but it's kind of like the
other half of your soul.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.020 align:middle line:84%
So when souls are formulated
in the beginning of time,

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.640 align:middle line:90%
they're very large.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.110 align:middle line:84%
So when a soul chooses to
incarnate in physicality,

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.670 align:middle line:90%
they might have to split.

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And usually, they split as
a Father-God consciousness

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.990 align:middle line:84%
or a divine masculinist
expression of the soul.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And a Mother-God
is consciousness

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.730 align:middle line:84%
or a divine feminine
expression of the soul.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.240 align:middle line:84%
So you might have a twin
flame that's more masculine

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.040 align:middle line:84%
and another one that's
more feminine even

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.375 align:middle line:90%
if they are the same sex.

00:06:51.375 --> 00:06:54.270 align:middle line:90%


00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.250 align:middle line:84%
But usually with
twin flames, it's

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.500 align:middle line:90%
usually romantic but not always.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.790 align:middle line:90%
I've known of twin flames.

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:03.410 align:middle line:84%
That are maybe brother and
sister or grandmother--

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But there is
a close relationship.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Absolutely, yeah.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.960 align:middle line:90%
It's very magnetic relationship.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.600 align:middle line:84%
You learn a lot of lessons
with your twin flame.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
that connection,

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.230 align:middle line:84%
Debbie, when we
find our soulmate?

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:19.110 align:middle line:84%
How do we know
this is a soulmate?

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, that's a question
I get a lot, especially when I

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.540 align:middle line:90%
do Akashic readings.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.760 align:middle line:84%
A soulmate is
somebody that we just

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.150 align:middle line:84%
feel that instant
connection, that familiarity.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.940 align:middle line:84%
We feel like we've
known them for and--

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Many .

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, many , yes.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And we usually feel like
there's a connection

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.920 align:middle line:84%
there, there's a soul
connection, there's many--

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.080 align:middle line:90%
like a contract with them.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.050 align:middle line:84%
Usually, the contract might be
we might share missions or we

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.000 align:middle line:90%
might share our .

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.180 align:middle line:84%
It's usually somebody that
we end up either marrying

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.197 align:middle line:84%
or somebody that we might have
a long-term relationship with.

00:07:58.197 --> 00:08:00.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it doesn't
have to be romantic?

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:00.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Not at all, yeah.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.460 align:middle line:84%
No, there's many
types of soulmates.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On the Gaia
show Open Minds,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Arielle Ford talked
about soulmates

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.700 align:middle line:84%
and how soulmates can
recognize each other.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:10.538 align:middle line:90%
This is fascinating.

00:08:10.538 --> 00:08:11.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, very cool.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ARIELLE FORD: So my
definition of a soulmate

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.170 align:middle line:84%
is that it's, first
and foremost, somebody

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.780 align:middle line:84%
you can completely
be yourself with,

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:22.020 align:middle line:84%
somebody with whom you
share unconditional love.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
into their eyes,

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.180 align:middle line:84%
you have the experience
of being home.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.520 align:middle line:10%
And if you accept
that definition,

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.820 align:middle line:10%
then I want to expand it
even further because we're

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.400 align:middle line:10%
going to be talking about
romantic soulmates today,

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:39.130 align:middle line:10%
but your kids, your parents,
your siblings, your coworkers,

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:42.210 align:middle line:10%
your best friend, your
cat, your dog, all

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:45.720 align:middle line:10%
are also soulmates if
they fit that definition.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.330 align:middle line:10%
And to take it even a
step further than that,

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.780 align:middle line:10%
I would also say a
soulmate is somebody

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:55.230 align:middle line:10%
that you feel emotionally
and physically safe with.

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.530 align:middle line:84%
We have a tribe and
we have recognition

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:00.510 align:middle line:90%
when we connect with our tribe.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe when
we're planning to hook up

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.890 align:middle line:84%
in a particular lifetime with a
soulmate, that we go to a place

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.320 align:middle line:84%
that they call
recognition school.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And we plan out the coincidences
and the synchronicity

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:16.570 align:middle line:84%
so that we can
recognize each other.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:20.910 align:middle line:84%
We can fall into nature's
trick and be crazy in love

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.630 align:middle line:84%
and see this, so that we can
get together and grow and heal

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.275 align:middle line:90%
each other as a couple.

00:09:26.275 --> 00:09:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Debbie, what do you
think of what she just said?

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.192 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I love
what she just said.

00:09:30.192 --> 00:09:33.510 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly the same way
how I feel about soulmates.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.270 align:middle line:84%
The beautiful thing about
a soulmate relationship

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:41.400 align:middle line:84%
is that we oftentimes
embark on those contracts

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.230 align:middle line:90%
in order to learn self-love.

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:47.490 align:middle line:84%
So when we get into a
relationship with a soulmate,

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.420 align:middle line:90%
they're reflecting love to us.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And so we're learning,
hey, this person loves me

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:55.500 align:middle line:90%
so maybe I'm not so unlovable.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.150 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I can love myself.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And so we get to see ourselves
mirrored in that other person.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we be cutting
contracts and we don't even

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.630 align:middle line:90%
know we're doing it?

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Sometimes,
yes, I would say.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:middle line:84%
I've seen that happen
before with some

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.460 align:middle line:84%
of the Akashic clearing
work I've done with clients.

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.460 align:middle line:84%
But usually, I think
it's a higher-self,

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.110 align:middle line:84%
our higher-self kind of
takes over at that point.

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:23.340 align:middle line:84%
So the higher-self will
say, OK, we no longer need

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:24.160 align:middle line:90%
this contract.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.910 align:middle line:84%
Let's go ahead and
dissipate the contract.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what causes the
disruption between soulmates

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:33.270 align:middle line:90%
when things fall apart?

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:35.970 align:middle line:84%
The relationship falls
apart, the friendship

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:38.940 align:middle line:84%
falls apart,
whatever it might be.

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: There's many
reasons why that might happen.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.600 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times when I
do work with clients,

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.490 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at
their Akashic Records

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:49.650 align:middle line:84%
in order to see
where the dissolution

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:50.890 align:middle line:90%
of the relationship--

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:51.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
happened to it, yeah.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:52.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.340 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's caused by a past,
maybe an old trauma signature

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:03.360 align:middle line:84%
from a past life, maybe
it's because the other party

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.910 align:middle line:84%
in the contract doesn't
want to learn their lessons.

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:11.160 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes the relationship
just falls apart.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.847 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting
how this is done,

00:11:12.847 --> 00:11:15.430 align:middle line:84%
and it's been going on since the
beginning of time, hasn't it?

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Absolutely,
yeah, I know.

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:21.090 align:middle line:84%
That's why-- and during
this timeline here on Earth,

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:24.210 align:middle line:84%
the reason why so many of us
are trying to clear and work

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:27.030 align:middle line:84%
with our soul contracts
is because we all

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:28.920 align:middle line:84%
want to ascend to
the fifth dimension.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.300 align:middle line:84%
At least, those of us that
are on the spiritual path.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:35.430 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of my clients
now are coming to me

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:36.990 align:middle line:84%
and they're asking
a lot of questions

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:40.350 align:middle line:84%
about their twin flame,
soulmates, karmic partners,

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:41.280 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
have a relationship,

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.557 align:middle line:84%
a contract with someone
you don't get along with?

00:11:46.557 --> 00:11:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, absolutely.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.723 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That happens too?

00:11:48.723 --> 00:11:50.020 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: That's called
to karmic partnership.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And I deal with a lot of
those too with my readings.

00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Our karmic partnership
is usually somebody--

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.180 align:middle line:84%
it's usually a contract
where we didn't learn

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:05.080 align:middle line:90%
a lesson from a previous life.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.370 align:middle line:84%
So then we contract
with a master soul.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:11.700 align:middle line:84%
Usually, it's a master soul
that actually loves us.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:15.870 align:middle line:84%
But they choose to play
the bad guy in our life

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:19.420 align:middle line:84%
in order to help us master
this lesson in this life.

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.990 align:middle line:84%
So the quicker we can
transcend the lesson,

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:24.810 align:middle line:84%
the quicker we can close
out that soul contract

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:27.815 align:middle line:84%
and move on to more
positive relationships.

00:12:27.815 --> 00:12:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Back to
Open Minds again

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:32.290 align:middle line:84%
where Nicolas David
Ngan discusses

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:35.500 align:middle line:84%
what you've just talked about--
these karmic relationships.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, wonderful.

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
That's interesting

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.150 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people
experience this especially

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.280 align:middle line:84%
in their personal
relationships where

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.325 align:middle line:84%
they have this internal
conflict all the time.

00:12:44.325 --> 00:12:45.700 align:middle line:84%
But then when
they're apart, they

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.080 align:middle line:90%
think fondly of each other.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.038 align:middle line:10%
>>NICOLAS DAVID NGAN:
Yeah, because they're not

00:12:49.038 --> 00:12:51.400 align:middle line:10%
in what I call the
cauldron of karmic relating

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.740 align:middle line:10%
which is how a lot of
initial relationships

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:58.175 align:middle line:10%
are to bring our
attention to our patterns.

00:12:58.175 --> 00:13:00.050 align:middle line:10%
The other thing that
happens is, for example,

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:04.810 align:middle line:10%
if I had a, say, you had
physical karmic sevens which

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:08.320 align:middle line:10%
are about healing
the heart and opening

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.700 align:middle line:10%
to show your true feelings
and thoughts in the world,

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.600 align:middle line:10%
and I had physical
talent sevens,

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.260 align:middle line:10%
my positive energy would go into
your physical talent gateway

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.870 align:middle line:10%
up into your
physical karma and it

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.790 align:middle line:10%
would help you heal the heart.

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:24.820 align:middle line:90%
So that's called a karmic lock.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.863 align:middle line:84%
So that is actually what
draws people together.

00:13:26.863 --> 00:13:29.530 align:middle line:84%
That's actually the tractor beam
effect, actually pulls people--

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:31.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: That's what happens
when they're falling in love.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:31.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yes.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.607 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: A lot of the times,
you just get pulled in--

00:13:34.607 --> 00:13:35.740 align:middle line:90%
what's happened?

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.480 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.210 align:middle line:84%
It's because you're getting
the positive frequency that you

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:41.990 align:middle line:90%
need as a perfect match.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And so you will grow much
faster by going through that.

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:47.920 align:middle line:84%
But you have to feel your
way through a lot more

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.590 align:middle line:84%
of the negative karmic
issue initially.

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:53.650 align:middle line:84%
But if you stay with
it, then you'll find,

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:55.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't have that
feeling of heartbreak,

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:57.310 align:middle line:84%
I actually feel
more decisive, which

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:59.020 align:middle line:90%
is what a sevens is all about.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.450 align:middle line:84%
I feel I want to show myself
and in fact, I'm opening

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:02.733 align:middle line:90%
and I feel safe.

00:14:02.733 --> 00:14:04.150 align:middle line:10%
And so those sort
of relationships

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:07.630 align:middle line:10%
are where people grow much
more rapidly than they would

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:11.470 align:middle line:10%
by themselves because they're
getting this transmission 12

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:13.610 align:middle line:10%
hours out of 7 days a week.

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have a friend
in Saint Louis, Debbie,

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:17.680 align:middle line:84%
whose wife died a
couple of years ago

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.390 align:middle line:84%
and he's been
brokenhearted ever since.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And I got a text from a buddy
of mine last week who said,

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:26.080 align:middle line:90%
Steve just died.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor said it
was broken heart syndrome.

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.417 align:middle line:90%
That's tied into all of this.

00:14:32.417 --> 00:14:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, absolutely.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.490 align:middle line:84%
That happens
actually quite a bit.

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:40.790 align:middle line:84%
I also have a friend recently
who her husband passed away

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:43.040 align:middle line:84%
or I would say her
partner passed away

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.460 align:middle line:84%
because his brother passed
away two weeks earlier

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:47.990 align:middle line:84%
and he was very
close to his brother

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:53.690 align:middle line:84%
and felt that he was so
heartbroken that he ended up

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:56.240 align:middle line:84%
having a heart attack two
weeks after his brother passed.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.600 align:middle line:90%
So it's very common.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's something
that it affects the heart

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:01.190 align:middle line:90%
physically, doesn't it?

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This emotion.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:07.040 align:middle line:84%
These contracts, how
important are they?

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I would say
they're extremely important,

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.740 align:middle line:84%
especially during this timeline
because this is our apex life

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.800 align:middle line:84%
as far as a lot of us have
chosen to be here on Earth

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.082 align:middle line:84%
during this time because
this is an evolutionary--

00:15:18.082 --> 00:15:19.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And these
are interesting times.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:20.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh--

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:21.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's that
saying, the best of times

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:23.060 align:middle line:90%
and the worst of times?

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:23.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh yeah, definitely.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:24.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here we are.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:25.798 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, here we are.

00:15:25.798 --> 00:15:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so we are having some
interesting experiences

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:34.880 align:middle line:84%
and even on a global scale,
a lot of these contracts

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:39.110 align:middle line:84%
are being played out even
with some of the world events.

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.477 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do children
make contracts?

00:15:41.477 --> 00:15:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, absolutely.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With adults and
parents and stuff like that?

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Absolutely.

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:46.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At a young age?

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah,
it's all determined

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.500 align:middle line:90%
even before they've incarnated.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.540 align:middle line:84%
Children will often have
contracts with their parents,

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.870 align:middle line:90%
with family members.

00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:00.470 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times when I'm
doing Akashic readings,

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:03.320 align:middle line:84%
I'll have parents that ask
me about their children

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.570 align:middle line:84%
and their connection, their soul
contracts with their children.

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.960 align:middle line:90%
So very much so.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:13.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some people do
contracts with the devil.

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:16.130 align:middle line:90%
Is that the same thing?

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:19.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: That is more what I
would call spiritual suicide.

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:26.000 align:middle line:84%
So what spiritual suicide
is, is when you're

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.243 align:middle line:90%
turning away from the light.

00:16:27.243 --> 00:16:28.910 align:middle line:84%
You're turning away
from the light path.

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:29.868 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Intentionally.

00:16:29.868 --> 00:16:31.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Intentionally, yes.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would
somebody want to do that?

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:37.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Maybe to
gain power, fame, money.

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:37.970 align:middle line:90%
There's many--

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can't you do it by
not doing the evil end of it?

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Can't you cut a deal
with an angel or God

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:46.820 align:middle line:90%
to do the same thing?

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Why do you have to cut
a deal with the devil?

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: I don't know.

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:53.380 align:middle line:84%
I think sometimes when
you go the dark path,

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:57.700 align:middle line:84%
you get that more
instantaneous gratification.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.080 align:middle line:84%
So some people
want things faster.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:00.880 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes--

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They can't wait.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.532 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, they can't wait.

00:17:03.532 --> 00:17:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What, Debbie, is
a walk-in or parallel soul

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:07.180 align:middle line:90%
agreement?

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: That's a really
interesting soul contract.

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:13.569 align:middle line:84%
It's not one I see very
often even with my work,

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:17.170 align:middle line:84%
but I have worked
with walk-in souls.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:21.609 align:middle line:84%
That is a contract
where a person is born

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:23.630 align:middle line:90%
and they're born with a soul.

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:24.430 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:25.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As we all are.

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:26.885 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah,
like we all are.

00:17:26.885 --> 00:17:28.329 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we all have a soul.

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And that soul
decides to walk out.

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:36.670 align:middle line:84%
But another soul, usually a more
advanced soul, will walk in.

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's usually happens
during an accident

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:46.300 align:middle line:84%
or some sort of traumatic event,
maybe a near-death experience.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:51.670 align:middle line:84%
But it's a contract that's made
even before the physical body

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:53.020 align:middle line:90%
is incarnated.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:56.320 align:middle line:84%
So one soul will oftentimes--
and there's many reasons

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.180 align:middle line:90%
why they agree to this.

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:01.720 align:middle line:84%
But one soul will walk out,
the other one will walk in.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Usually, the walk-in soul
comes from a more advanced star

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:06.320 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So when
you say walk-in,

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:11.480 align:middle line:84%
are you talking about literally
walking into the physical body?

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh yeah.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --of the
other individual?

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh yeah.

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:15.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it like possession?

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: It's a little--

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.180 align:middle line:84%
it could be seen that
way but it's more

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.670 align:middle line:90%
like they're taking over.

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:24.087 align:middle line:90%
So it's like the other soul--

00:18:24.087 --> 00:18:25.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The walk-in is taking--

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:26.628 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Taking over, yeah.

00:18:26.628 --> 00:18:28.570 align:middle line:84%
It's just kind of
taking over the contract

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:31.060 align:middle line:90%
with that particular lifetime.

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that done with
the individual's acceptance?

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, absolutely
on a higher level.

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, on a higher level.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:43.540 align:middle line:84%
It's usually done maybe not
consciously on the 3D person's

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:47.320 align:middle line:84%
level, but on the fifth
dimensional higher-self level.

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that is an agreement.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
break a contract?

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:54.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: There's many ways
you can break a contract.

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Some of my clients will
choose to break contracts

00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:00.130 align:middle line:84%
through doing an Akashic
Records clearing.

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Some of them will do shadow work
in order to break a contract.

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:07.060 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes when they learn
their lessons with that soul,

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:10.660 align:middle line:84%
the contract is then
broken so there's no longer

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:12.160 align:middle line:90%
an attachment of some sort.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.310 align:middle line:84%
So there's different ways
you can break a contract.

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lived out its
agreement, I guess.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Exactly.

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:17.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting
take on all of that.

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Generally, in terms
of male/female,

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:24.040 align:middle line:90%
who cuts the most contracts?

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.868 align:middle line:90%
Or it doesn't matter?

00:19:25.868 --> 00:19:26.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: You know what?

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:30.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it even
matters as far as sex.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.830 align:middle line:84%
I had as many women
break contracts as men

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:36.660 align:middle line:90%
so it's not a gender thing.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.660 align:middle line:90%
It's more of a soul decision.

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we as humans cut
deals with extraterrestrials?

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, absolutely.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:48.740 align:middle line:84%
That is a question I get a
lot and we have soul contracts

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:53.270 align:middle line:84%
with both benevolent
and malevolent

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:54.583 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial beings.

00:19:54.583 --> 00:19:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And where are these
beings from, generally?

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:58.612 align:middle line:90%
What star systems?

00:19:58.612 --> 00:20:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Sometimes
we'll have contracts

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:04.250 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrials
of star systems

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:05.810 align:middle line:84%
that we have a
connection with such

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:08.413 align:middle line:90%
as maybe the Pleiades or Lyra.

00:20:08.413 --> 00:20:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've heard a lot
about those systems, too.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:11.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, yeah.

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And some people might
even have contracts

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:17.150 align:middle line:84%
with beings from Zeta
Reticuli or even Draconian

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:18.830 align:middle line:90%
beings or benevolent or--

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:22.100 align:middle line:84%
I would say malevolent
beings from Orions.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the
contracts different

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:26.900 align:middle line:90%
depending on the star system?

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yes, they
can be different.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:30.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.650 align:middle line:84%
Usually with a
malevolent race, it's

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:39.110 align:middle line:84%
usually some sort of agreement
where they're working out

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:41.700 align:middle line:90%
shadow aspects of themselves.

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:46.790 align:middle line:84%
So maybe a soul
has chosen to delve

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:50.120 align:middle line:84%
into dark aspects of themselves,
and so they make contracts

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:53.120 align:middle line:90%
with dark beings.

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.190 align:middle line:84%
Most of us, however,
I think choose

00:20:55.190 --> 00:21:01.220 align:middle line:84%
to have more light
or more benevolent

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:04.550 align:middle line:84%
contracts with higher
dimensional beings.

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:07.730 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times what I see with
more of the benevolent beings

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:10.100 align:middle line:84%
is that maybe for
some reason, we've

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.950 align:middle line:90%
chosen to help them through--

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:14.750 align:middle line:84%
because I get a
lot of abductees--

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:16.708 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or they help us.

00:21:16.708 --> 00:21:17.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: In a way, yes.

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:20.510 align:middle line:84%
In a way, yeah, it's
like we're helping them

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:21.778 align:middle line:90%
and they're helping us.

00:21:21.778 --> 00:21:23.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we
know, Debbie, that we've

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:27.398 align:middle line:84%
made this connection,
this soul agreement?

00:21:27.398 --> 00:21:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Usually,
you have a sense of it.

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:32.158 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times I
have clients that say,

00:21:32.158 --> 00:21:33.950 align:middle line:84%
you know, I think I'm
being abducted a lot.

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:37.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if I have a
contract with grey aliens,

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.430 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:41.720 align:middle line:84%
You know, I remember
my childhood,

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting abducted.

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:47.187 align:middle line:84%
And so what we do is we look
in their Akashic Records

00:21:47.187 --> 00:21:48.770 align:middle line:84%
and we'll say, oh
yeah, you definitely

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:50.300 align:middle line:90%
have a contract with them.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.780 align:middle line:84%
So that's why you
keep getting abducted.

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it's
because they've agreed

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.730 align:middle line:84%
to let them use their
DNA or they've agreed

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:02.360 align:middle line:90%
to let them experiment on them.

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.240 align:middle line:84%
So we can definitely have those
types of contracts as well.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
a guiding force

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:10.430 align:middle line:84%
that kind of overlooks
these agreements

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:11.870 align:middle line:90%
and settles in on them?

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Or is everything done
on an individual basis?

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I would
say there's probably

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.430 align:middle line:90%
a higher reason for it.

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:22.280 align:middle line:84%
But I would say
it's more individual

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:26.370 align:middle line:84%
because we are freewill
souls so we all can make--

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:29.280 align:middle line:84%
so we're all able to
make our own choices.

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:33.110 align:middle line:84%
So as souls, we can choose
to have negative experiences

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:34.850 align:middle line:90%
or positive experiences.

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:36.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's a guiding force?

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:40.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: A guiding force
would be like your higher self

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:45.560 align:middle line:84%
or your higher guides,
which basically--

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could it be angelic?

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:50.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, absolutely
angelic, or our star families.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Might be a higher force
or even ascended masters

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.050 align:middle line:84%
or any types of higher
dimensional beings

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:58.310 align:middle line:90%
that we have connections with.

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I keep thinking about
that wonderful Christmas movie,

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:04.910 align:middle line:84%
It's A Wonderful Life where
Jimmy Stewart was contemplating

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:06.500 align:middle line:90%
doing himself in.

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And his angel was
sent down to save him.

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And do they get involved
that way really?

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.260 align:middle line:84%
Because that sounds
like a soul contract

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:18.707 align:middle line:84%
that he tried to break but they
wouldn't let them break it.

00:23:18.707 --> 00:23:19.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, absolutely.

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:22.070 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and I've had that
happen even with myself

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:24.950 align:middle line:84%
where there was times
where I was down and out,

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:29.150 align:middle line:84%
and there was an
angelic being that

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:32.750 align:middle line:84%
showed up even in my
life that prevented me

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:34.340 align:middle line:90%
from doing any harm to myself.

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:37.550 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, so I've
experienced that personally.

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
kind of harm could

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:42.050 align:middle line:84%
come to somebody who breaks
a contract like that?

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:45.493 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Usually they end up
having to repeat the lesson.

00:23:45.493 --> 00:23:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In a
different life form?

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:47.952 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:23:47.952 --> 00:23:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like a
reincarnated situation?

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:50.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:54.770 align:middle line:10%
So a lot of times it's
more-- it behooves us to I

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:57.320 align:middle line:10%
think to go ahead
and as difficult

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.030 align:middle line:10%
as some of these
contracts might be,

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:03.050 align:middle line:10%
it behooves us to get through
that lesson in this lifetime

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:06.290 align:middle line:10%
and master it so we don't
have to keep repeating it.

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
get involved in this?

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I think we talked
about this in some of our prior

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:12.953 align:middle line:90%
shows--

00:24:12.953 --> 00:24:14.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: New people here
all the time, Debbie.

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:15.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, I know.

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:21.050 align:middle line:90%
It's like-- I was actually--

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:26.600 align:middle line:84%
I was an ET abductee
myself and during the time

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:30.410 align:middle line:84%
of my abductions, I've
learned quite a bit.

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:34.250 align:middle line:84%
I just got a bunch of
downloads of information

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:37.490 align:middle line:84%
about spirituality,
about Akashic Records,

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:40.130 align:middle line:84%
about our connection
with the universe.

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And also because I do a lot of
Akashic readings, particularly

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:53.720 align:middle line:84%
Galactic Akashic readings,
I've seen patterns in people

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:59.120 align:middle line:84%
with certain star lineages
or patterns with certain soul

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.040 align:middle line:90%
groups.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.540 align:middle line:84%
So this is a topic
that's really,

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:03.945 align:middle line:90%
I'm very, very fascinated with.

00:25:03.945 --> 00:25:05.570 align:middle line:84%
So I love working
with soul connection.

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, we read another
Gaia series called initiation

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:13.010 align:middle line:84%
and the host Matias de Stefano
talks about the Pleiadians

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:15.478 align:middle line:90%
as you have and the Arcturians.

00:25:15.478 --> 00:25:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, very good.

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --as humanity's
first guiding forces.

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:21.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Very good, very good.

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MATIAS DE STEFANO: So the
purpose of clearing people

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:29.170 align:middle line:84%
is like being those high masters
and guides in the matter that

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:32.860 align:middle line:84%
tells us why we
are here and what

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:35.920 align:middle line:84%
we can do to improve
ourselves, what

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:40.570 align:middle line:84%
we can do to enlight ourselves,
to understand reality,

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:46.600 align:middle line:84%
how we can transform matter
and time in every reality

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:47.810 align:middle line:90%
that we have created.

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:52.660 align:middle line:84%
So they are the guides of the
spiritual world in the material

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:53.560 align:middle line:90%
worlds.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And the Arcturian people are the
ones taking care of the matter,

00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:59.980 align:middle line:90%
of the structures.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:05.920 align:middle line:84%
They are like the doctors and
the scientists of the galaxy.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.860 align:middle line:10%
They were the ones
trying to bring

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:14.860 align:middle line:10%
all these enlightened concepts
of spiral and understanding

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:19.000 align:middle line:10%
the importance of these
spiritual patterns

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.430 align:middle line:10%
to the physical ones and
put them all together.

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:26.980 align:middle line:10%
So they discover how
spirituality moves through DNA,

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:30.010 align:middle line:10%
through evolution,
and they evolve

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:35.560 align:middle line:10%
in their own planets trying to
take as much power as possible

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:41.350 align:middle line:10%
from the spiritual world
through the physical bodies.

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:45.940 align:middle line:10%
So both of them are
kind of the same,

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.730 align:middle line:10%
looking in different
perspectives.

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:53.080 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiadians has the goal
to bring heaven on Earth,

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:58.150 align:middle line:84%
and the Arcturians has a goal
to bring that Earth to heaven.

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:04.420 align:middle line:10%
But it's not a goal that they
want to leave the material

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:10.030 align:middle line:10%
world, but they want to create
a physical world that is exactly

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:12.920 align:middle line:10%
the same as the ethereal one.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:17.410 align:middle line:84%
So improving this reality,
improving the matter in order

00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:21.490 align:middle line:84%
to create civilizations
and create beings

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:26.110 align:middle line:84%
aligned with the light that
is within the structures

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:29.290 align:middle line:84%
of the three-dimensional
realities.

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Debbie,
how does this star

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:34.630 align:middle line:84%
lineage that Matias is talking
about affect all of us?

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, that's
something that I

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:40.820 align:middle line:84%
am particularly interested
in with the work that I do.

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:44.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's a lot of what
I teach through even

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.050 align:middle line:90%
some of my trainings.

00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:53.290 align:middle line:84%
As souls have had experiences
in other star systems,

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:56.620 align:middle line:84%
we come here to Earth to
learn certain life lessons.

00:27:56.620 --> 00:28:00.670 align:middle line:84%
We come here to learn
the human condition.

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:03.610 align:middle line:84%
When we come from systems
such as the Pleiades

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:05.522 align:middle line:90%
or Arcturus or Sirius or--

00:28:05.522 --> 00:28:06.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And we might, right?

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:08.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:10.810 align:middle line:84%
I would say during
this timeline,

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:12.790 align:middle line:84%
I would say the
majority of us that

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:15.430 align:middle line:84%
have been born during
this particular timeline

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:20.650 align:middle line:84%
since World War II
are mostly Starseeds.

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:23.200 align:middle line:84%
There might be some
younger souls still here

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:27.170 align:middle line:84%
on Earth that have only
had Earth incarnations,

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:31.240 align:middle line:84%
but I would say the majority of
us at this time are Starseeds.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:36.220 align:middle line:84%
But we have forgotten
and we have purposefully

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:39.310 align:middle line:84%
forgotten so that we can go
through the Earth experience

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:41.200 align:middle line:84%
and learn certain
lessons including

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:44.740 align:middle line:84%
those with our soul contracts
and our relationships

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:46.600 align:middle line:90%
with others.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:50.260 align:middle line:84%
As far as the star
lineage, I do see patterns

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.070 align:middle line:90%
with certain star lineages.

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:57.250 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, somebody
that comes from the Pleiades,

00:28:57.250 --> 00:29:01.090 align:middle line:84%
I do get a lot of clients
who are Pleiadians Starseeds

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:05.230 align:middle line:84%
and I see patterns with
some of their relationships.

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:09.190 align:middle line:84%
Pleiadians in the
Pleiades, because it's

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:12.460 align:middle line:84%
such a high vibrational
star system,

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:14.140 align:middle line:90%
they have perfect relationships.

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:16.990 align:middle line:84%
They have many
relationships and--

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:19.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
perfect relationship?

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: They do in the
Pleiades, but on Earth,

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:24.460 align:middle line:90%
there certainly isn't.

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:27.628 align:middle line:90%
So we're playing out our 3D .

00:29:27.628 --> 00:29:29.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do they have a
perfect relationship and we

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:30.720 align:middle line:90%
don't?

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Because they've
mastered their lessons.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They've
ascended a little higher?

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:37.313 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: They're, yeah,
definitely more ascended

00:29:37.313 --> 00:29:38.210 align:middle line:90%
than we are.

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:40.085 align:middle line:84%
I would say quite a bit,
probably quite a bit

00:29:40.085 --> 00:29:41.920 align:middle line:90%
more ascended.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:45.580 align:middle line:84%
But for us here on Earth and
sometimes even as Starseeds,

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:49.000 align:middle line:84%
we might choose to have
those karmic partnerships

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.240 align:middle line:84%
or those twin
flame relationships

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.510 align:middle line:84%
in order to learn
certain lessons.

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.730 align:middle line:84%
For a Pleiadian
Starseed, what I usually

00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:01.030 align:middle line:84%
see is that because
they're so empathic

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:05.500 align:middle line:84%
and they're so
open-hearted, and so they

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:08.440 align:middle line:84%
look at the bright side
of the relationship,

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:11.590 align:middle line:84%
sometimes they'll get in
co-dependent situations

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:13.360 align:middle line:90%
with their relationships.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.910 align:middle line:84%
They tend to attract,
at least until they

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:17.620 align:middle line:84%
get more
well-integrated, they'll

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.740 align:middle line:84%
attract narcissistic
types that might

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:22.647 align:middle line:90%
try to take advantage of them.

00:30:22.647 --> 00:30:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, that happens too.

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:24.813 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, yeah.

00:30:24.813 --> 00:30:25.850 align:middle line:90%
Oh, absolutely.

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:27.153 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:27.153 --> 00:30:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, it's
because the Pleiadians soul

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.390 align:middle line:84%
will look at the
individual that they

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:34.550 align:middle line:84%
feel an attraction to
and say, oh my gosh,

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:37.710 align:middle line:84%
that person has
so much potential.

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:41.760 align:middle line:84%
Maybe if I just love
them a little bit more,

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.570 align:middle line:90%
they'll become this great human.

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:44.650 align:middle line:90%
I just need to love them.

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
that doesn't happen.

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:50.130 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times what happens
is the Pleiadian soul

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:54.210 align:middle line:84%
will just give, give, give, give
and the narcissist will just

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:56.802 align:middle line:90%
take and keep taking.

00:30:56.802 --> 00:30:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Almost like
they feed off of it.

00:30:58.510 --> 00:30:59.552 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:30:59.552 --> 00:31:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Yes, so the Pleiadian
soul will oftentimes

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:08.520 align:middle line:84%
do this until they finally
learn that they just

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:10.290 align:middle line:84%
can't keep giving
all the time and they

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:11.760 align:middle line:84%
need to take a
stand for themselves

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.260 align:middle line:90%
and start setting boundaries.

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And so once they
mastered this lesson,

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:19.800 align:middle line:84%
they usually end up
breaking off that contract

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:22.597 align:middle line:84%
and attracting more healthier
relationships in their life.

00:31:22.597 --> 00:31:24.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And getting
another contract.

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:25.097 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Absolutely.

00:31:25.097 --> 00:31:28.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many contracts
can one take in one's lifetime?

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, a
multitude of them.

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:32.610 align:middle line:90%
It's endless.

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:35.730 align:middle line:84%
I can't even put a
number to it, George.

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:38.750 align:middle line:84%
We can have many different
types of contracts.

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it a good
thing or a bad thing

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.540 align:middle line:90%
to break these contracts?

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I would say
in most of the time

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.310 align:middle line:84%
if it's not serving
your highest good,

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:49.180 align:middle line:84%
it is a good idea to
break the contract.

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:49.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:51.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:53.908 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how do
it's not working?

00:31:53.908 --> 00:31:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: A lot of times
what my clients will describe

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.360 align:middle line:84%
to me when I'm doing
Akashic Records

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:02.110 align:middle line:84%
work with them is that
they feel like they're

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:03.280 align:middle line:90%
in the stuck pattern.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:04.120 align:middle line:90%
They feel stuck.

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.400 align:middle line:84%
They keep repeating
the same patterns

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.590 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And they're frustrated because
they want to move forward.

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of
times what we'll do

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.910 align:middle line:84%
is when I'm doing an
Akashic Records clearing,

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:18.700 align:middle line:84%
for instance, we'll look
at some of their contracts

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:21.208 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes I'll
tell them, hey, I

00:32:21.208 --> 00:32:22.750 align:middle line:84%
think you need to
keep this contract.

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:24.868 align:middle line:84%
I think it's working
for your highest good.

00:32:24.868 --> 00:32:26.660 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes I'll look
at it and I'll say,

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:27.790 align:middle line:84%
you know what, I
don't think this

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:28.900 align:middle line:90%
is working for you anymore.

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:29.700 align:middle line:90%
Let's break it.

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:30.845 align:middle line:90%
And so we do that.

00:32:30.845 --> 00:32:32.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
see their contract?

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:33.580 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:36.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: When I'm doing
an Akashic Records reading

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:41.140 align:middle line:84%
or clearing, I'm able to access
that person's soul journey,

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:45.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to access other souls
that they have connections

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:46.150 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:47.770 align:middle line:84%
So like you were
mentioning before,

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:50.180 align:middle line:90%
we're all part of soul families.

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And so I can take a
look at their past lives

00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:00.610 align:middle line:84%
with certain souls
and we can see, OK,

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:03.770 align:middle line:84%
have you learned your lessons
from this ongoing soul

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:04.570 align:middle line:90%
contract?

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:08.810 align:middle line:84%
Or have you transcended those
lessons but for whatever reason

00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:10.435 align:middle line:84%
you're not able to
break that contract?

00:33:10.435 --> 00:33:13.330 align:middle line:90%


00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:16.840 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually access
a lot of information

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:17.973 align:middle line:90%
from the Akashic Records.

00:33:17.973 --> 00:33:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You
mentioned past lives.

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:24.300 align:middle line:84%
Do you do that and
find it in hypnosis?

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: As far as me
being in hypnosis or--

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:29.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hypnotizing
people, do you do that?

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:30.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, no.

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:31.570 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:33.960 align:middle line:84%
I just have a direct
connection to the records

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:35.970 align:middle line:84%
so I don't need to
hypnotize people.

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:37.030 align:middle line:90%
I do all the work.

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:38.430 align:middle line:90%
So I just download--

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it ever
get tiring for you?

00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yes.

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Akashic readings
can be very tiring.

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:46.530 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't realize
that when you're in the Akashic

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:51.680 align:middle line:84%
Records, you're using all
of your clair abilities,

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:56.810 align:middle line:84%
so you're using clairvoyance,
clairsentience, clairaudient,

00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:58.670 align:middle line:84%
and so you're
getting information

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:01.330 align:middle line:84%
from many different
types of avenues.

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:04.100 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, you might be
talking to the Akashic guides

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.110 align:middle line:90%
or talking to their guides.

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:07.790 align:middle line:90%
So it can be very exhausting.

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:10.040 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I can only
do a certain amount of--

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.447 align:middle line:84%
certain number of
Akashic readings a day.

00:34:12.447 --> 00:34:14.239 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It doesn't
sound like a great idea

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:17.420 align:middle line:84%
to break these contracts,
though, does it?

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:18.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: For the
most part, I would

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:21.949 align:middle line:84%
say there's a higher
reason why we've

00:34:21.949 --> 00:34:23.670 align:middle line:90%
chosen to have these contracts.

00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:27.620 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times, we just
need to play them out.

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:31.790 align:middle line:84%
But I have seen
situations where people

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:35.600 align:middle line:84%
keep repeating old
contracts and it's

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.897 align:middle line:84%
because maybe on a
higher soul level

00:34:37.897 --> 00:34:39.480 align:middle line:84%
they don't know how
to close them out.

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:41.150 align:middle line:84%
So if it's for
their highest good,

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:43.699 align:middle line:84%
we'll definitely
close it out for them.

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:48.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Generally, when you've
met someone that you really

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:52.975 align:middle line:84%
like, can you tell that they've
got good contracts out there?

00:34:52.975 --> 00:34:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: As far as
with other people?

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With other people,
with themselves, can you

00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:59.120 align:middle line:90%
have a contract with yourself?

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:00.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, absolutely.

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:02.370 align:middle line:84%
I would say that's the
biggest contract we have,

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:03.170 align:middle line:90%
is with ourselves.

00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:03.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good.

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:07.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Good, and how
do you compose that?

00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:09.390 align:middle line:90%
How do you put it together?

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:12.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Well, I think
a lot of times in our ,

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.650 align:middle line:84%
particularly when we're in a
third-dimensional incarnation

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:23.420 align:middle line:84%
or reality, we're playing out
certain lessons that we need

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.370 align:middle line:84%
to learn in order to accelerate
our spiritual growth.

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And so certain
lessons might be even

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:34.520 align:middle line:84%
if I'm separated from source,
can I still love myself?

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Even if I'm separated
from source,

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:40.350 align:middle line:84%
can I still have
unconditional love for others?

00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And so throughout these certain
different soul contracts

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:47.600 align:middle line:84%
that we have with
other people, we

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:51.260 align:middle line:84%
are able to replay those
lessons over and over again

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:55.700 align:middle line:84%
in many different
variations and nuances.

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And it ends up becoming
a beautiful tapestry

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:02.420 align:middle line:84%
of experiences that our soul
will have while we're here.

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And helps us to
ascend even further.

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:08.633 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it healthy
for us to ascend this way?

00:36:08.633 --> 00:36:09.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: I would say yes--

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:10.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Physically?

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:11.137 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Definitely.

00:36:11.137 --> 00:36:12.590 align:middle line:90%
Oh, absolutely.

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:14.690 align:middle line:90%
I would say--

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:18.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I would think
as souls that come here

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:23.210 align:middle line:84%
to help the planet ascend and
also to help humanity ascend,

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:25.010 align:middle line:84%
it is very healthy
to play out all

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:26.660 align:middle line:84%
of these different
types of contracts

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:31.560 align:middle line:84%
and to have these experiences
so that we can evolve and move

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:32.360 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
find that people who

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.500 align:middle line:84%
have these good
contracts in place

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:39.980 align:middle line:84%
are generally happier
people, healthier people?

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:41.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, definitely.

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:44.720 align:middle line:84%
I would say people
that are awakened

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:47.690 align:middle line:84%
or on the spiritual
path that have

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:49.670 align:middle line:84%
a certain level
of self-awareness

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:53.960 align:middle line:84%
about themselves, about
others, generally I

00:36:53.960 --> 00:37:01.460 align:middle line:84%
think tend to be people that
are emotionally more healthier,

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:07.670 align:middle line:84%
they're more open to maybe
looking at themselves

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:10.550 align:middle line:84%
and seeing what part they
play and some of the contracts

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:12.060 align:middle line:90%
they have with others.

00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:14.120 align:middle line:84%
So yes, I would
say definitely yes.

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Akashic
Records, can we rewrite them?

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yes, to
a certain degree.

00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:20.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:22.460 align:middle line:84%
I do that all the time with
Akashic Records clearings.

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:24.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when you say
to a certain degree, what

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:27.230 align:middle line:90%
restricts us?

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:29.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: There are
certain things that

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:33.510 align:middle line:84%
are more in concrete
so there might be,

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:37.740 align:middle line:84%
for instance, some of our past
lives, they're very concrete.

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:39.950 align:middle line:84%
But when we're talking
about future probabilities,

00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:42.000 align:middle line:84%
we can rewrite
those all the time.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, we can even
rewrite a certain timeline

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.770 align:middle line:84%
through maybe
neurolinguistic reprogramming

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:56.630 align:middle line:84%
or through Akashic Records
clearings or through QHHT

00:37:56.630 --> 00:38:02.010 align:middle line:84%
where maybe the records
aren't exactly changed

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:04.730 align:middle line:84%
but our response to the
records have changed.

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:08.720 align:middle line:84%
So maybe our response to
a past situation changes.

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And so then we're able to
grow and heal from that.

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When Kelly
Jones was on our program,

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:17.480 align:middle line:84%
she talked about how to
rewrite the Akashic Records

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:20.698 align:middle line:84%
and how to unlearn our
human conditioning.

00:38:20.698 --> 00:38:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, wonderful.

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY JONES: We
rewrite our records--

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pick off the bad stuff.

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:25.027 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: All the time.

00:38:25.027 --> 00:38:26.840 align:middle line:10%
Well, and how we do
that is by shifting

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:30.920 align:middle line:10%
the matrix of our perception
of that which we perceived

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.360 align:middle line:10%
as having experienced.

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:35.330 align:middle line:10%
So for example, if I
look back in childhood

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:37.910 align:middle line:10%
or somebody's experience in
childhood to say, you know,

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:39.495 align:middle line:10%
what was my mother
or father doing

00:38:39.495 --> 00:38:40.620 align:middle line:10%
or what were they thinking?

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:45.050 align:middle line:10%
What was the truth of their
behavior and their actions?

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:47.240 align:middle line:10%
And when that information
is brought forward,

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:53.570 align:middle line:10%
the energetic space within
one's beingness shifts.

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:55.940 align:middle line:84%
They have a whole new
perspective and understanding

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:58.700 align:middle line:84%
of what transpired,
let's say, in childhood.

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And in that, the records,
their perception is rewritten.

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Truth has been revealed
and they know it.

00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:08.180 align:middle line:84%
There's an internal
feeling that says, yes.

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:11.030 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How soon in
one's life do they start?

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:12.110 align:middle line:90%
A little baby?

00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:13.700 align:middle line:90%
When?

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:17.150 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: So it's really
since we decided as soul

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:19.880 align:middle line:90%
to individuate from source.

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:22.057 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So that could
be almost at any time?

00:39:22.057 --> 00:39:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: The records
are always there.

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And so we-- it's called the
recording of our soul's journey

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:29.490 align:middle line:90%
through lifetimes.

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:33.470 align:middle line:84%
So it's every lifetime
that we've experienced.

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like
what you're speaking

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:39.080 align:middle line:84%
to might be a little
different, which

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:43.140 align:middle line:84%
has to do with innocence, which
has to do with the truth of who

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:43.940 align:middle line:90%
we are.

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:44.740 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:50.340 align:middle line:10%
And so we overlay shall we say
the personality or the ego,

00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:56.090 align:middle line:10%
which begins to judge or mask
the pureness of who we are

00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:58.940 align:middle line:10%
and we start being conditioned
by the human condition.

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:00.920 align:middle line:10%
And what we're learning
to do is actually

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:03.050 align:middle line:10%
unlearn the human conditioning.

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:06.350 align:middle line:10%
And so we can access the Akashic
Records which brings forth

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:09.290 align:middle line:10%
that wisdom that assist
us in understanding even

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:13.670 align:middle line:10%
the deeper pieces or the lessons
that we came here to learn.

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And so those are
vital and they're

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:18.050 align:middle line:90%
important to our soul journey.

00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And they're recorded
in the records as well.

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When people come
to you for assistance,

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:26.280 align:middle line:90%
are they troubled?

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:27.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Some are.

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:29.580 align:middle line:90%
Some are just curious.

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:32.760 align:middle line:84%
So it just depends on what
that person's, I guess,

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.840 align:middle line:84%
intention is for their
reading at the time.

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do they find you?

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:37.923 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how do people
wake up in the morning

00:40:37.923 --> 00:40:42.930 align:middle line:84%
and say, I got to talk
to Debbie about my soul?

00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:44.050 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I guess, I've
been out there for a while.

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:47.700 align:middle line:90%
I have a YouTube channel--

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:48.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Your name's out there.

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:49.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, so
my name is out there

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:51.330 align:middle line:90%
so people know what I do.

00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:53.430 align:middle line:84%
But I have a lot
of people that want

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:57.030 align:middle line:84%
to have readings with
me at this time which

00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:59.220 align:middle line:84%
is, I think, a real
blessing because it shows me

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:00.480 align:middle line:90%
that people are awakening.

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:02.100 align:middle line:84%
They're getting
interested and working

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:07.230 align:middle line:84%
on themselves and on their
soul and their contracts.

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:10.500 align:middle line:84%
So people can generally
find me through my website.

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:11.860 align:middle line:90%
So I do have a website.

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:12.660 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Which is?

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:16.917 align:middle line:10%
>>SOLARIS: DebbieSolaris.com,
D-E-B-B-I-E-S-O-L-A-R-I-S dot

00:41:16.917 --> 00:41:18.210 align:middle line:10%
com.

00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And I do offer trainings
in soul contracts

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:23.940 align:middle line:84%
so they can definitely
go into my website

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.740 align:middle line:90%
and sign up for a training.

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:27.532 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they can
do their own readings?

00:41:27.532 --> 00:41:29.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Well, not so
much their own readings

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:32.340 align:middle line:84%
but it teaches them how to
recognize soul contracts

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:33.685 align:middle line:90%
that they might be having.

00:41:33.685 --> 00:41:34.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With others?

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.018 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: With
others, absolutely.

00:41:36.018 --> 00:41:38.815 align:middle line:84%
And how that connects
to their star origins.

00:41:38.815 --> 00:41:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's an
old saying, Debbie,

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:44.280 align:middle line:84%
that in order to
heal something, you

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:47.820 align:middle line:84%
have to look within and
see what your self is.

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:48.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Absolutely.

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
basically what we've

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:51.660 align:middle line:90%
been talking about tonight.

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:53.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, absolutely.

00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:55.650 align:middle line:84%
The best way to heal
our soul contracts

00:41:55.650 --> 00:41:57.450 align:middle line:84%
is to work on
ourselves and to work

00:41:57.450 --> 00:42:01.530 align:middle line:84%
on our own spiritual growth and
our own spiritual evolution.

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:04.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If somebody
cannot connect--

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:07.080 align:middle line:84%
cannot connect with
contracts, cannot connect with

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:08.860 align:middle line:90%
themselves--

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:11.358 align:middle line:90%
are they headed for doom?

00:42:11.358 --> 00:42:13.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I wouldn't say
they're headed for doom

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:15.800 align:middle line:84%
but they might be
headed to repeat

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:20.700 align:middle line:84%
some of these lessons
in future lifetimes.

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has
been for you one

00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:25.380 align:middle line:84%
of the most astounding
cases you've ever dealt

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:30.560 align:middle line:90%
with that just overwhelmed you?

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:31.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: As far as--

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: An individual
who came to you.

00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:34.887 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:34.887 --> 00:42:37.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I will say the
most interesting one that I've

00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:40.880 align:middle line:90%
had was a walk-in experience.

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:49.060 align:middle line:84%
I had a lady that was a
walk-in and her soul actually

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:50.860 align:middle line:90%
came from a different universe.

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And it was like a
triangle headed beings

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:56.440 align:middle line:90%
and it was really--

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:59.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean when I saw her records,
I was just like, I was amazed.

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:03.460 align:middle line:84%
I was just amazed at
the depths of her soul

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:10.120 align:middle line:84%
and even just the contract
that the walk-in soul

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.620 align:middle line:90%
had with her at that time.

00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And I will never
forget that case.

00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:16.180 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually, if you
go on my YouTube channel,

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:20.890 align:middle line:90%
you can actually hear about--

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:23.350 align:middle line:84%
hear her reading because it
is on my YouTube channel.

00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:26.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long does it
take you to analyze somebody?

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:29.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Usually when
I start doing a reading,

00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:32.800 align:middle line:84%
it's almost instantaneous and
it's not really coming from me,

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.390 align:middle line:84%
it's coming from
the Akashic guides.

00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:35.890 align:middle line:84%
It's coming from
the Akashic Record.

00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Anything coming
from the guts, your gut?

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:40.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, I
do use my intuition

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:45.430 align:middle line:84%
so I always tell people that,
yes I'm doing your reading

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:48.640 align:middle line:84%
but I'm also doing it from
my frame of reference,

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:50.020 align:middle line:90%
from my intuition.

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:51.700 align:middle line:84%
So if something
doesn't resonate,

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:56.390 align:middle line:84%
it might be because it's my
interpretation of the records.

00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:58.420 align:middle line:90%
But the records never lie.

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:01.150 align:middle line:84%
The records are
always based in truth.

00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many contracts
can an individual handle?

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I would
say a multitude.

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:10.610 align:middle line:84%
I think it depends
on different souls.

00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Like some souls may choose
to have fewer contracts,

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:15.860 align:middle line:84%
some souls may choose to
have a lot of contracts.

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:16.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:17.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Me, personally,
I have a lot of contracts.

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we have
contracts with everyone

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:21.080 align:middle line:90%
we're in touch with?

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: In a way, yes.

00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Even if it seems like
a casual connection,

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:28.730 align:middle line:84%
there might be a certain
level of a contract

00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:30.260 align:middle line:90%
with that individual.

00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If an individual
dies that you've

00:44:33.110 --> 00:44:37.235 align:middle line:84%
got a contract with, does
that kill the contract?

00:44:37.235 --> 00:44:38.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Not necessarily.

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:40.490 align:middle line:10%
No, I mean, you can
have an ongoing contract

00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:42.000 align:middle line:10%
even for lifetimes.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.290 align:middle line:10%
So even if that person
physically dies,

00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:47.600 align:middle line:10%
more than likely, you
might even see them again

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:48.770 align:middle line:10%
in future lifetimes.

00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:51.110 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What is
your next project?

00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:58.670 align:middle line:10%
>>SOLARIS: Right now, I am
working on some more webinars.

00:44:58.670 --> 00:45:04.100 align:middle line:10%
We're going to do a webinar
on Starseeds and health.

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:07.685 align:middle line:84%
So certain trends that we see
with certain star lineages,

00:45:07.685 --> 00:45:09.670 align:middle line:90%
their health conditions.

00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:12.470 align:middle line:90%


00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:14.660 align:middle line:90%
So those types of things.

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:17.540 align:middle line:84%
How to navigate
through today's reality

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:19.370 align:middle line:90%
with COVID and everything else.

00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm pretty excited
about that project

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:23.390 align:middle line:84%
actually because
I'm somebody that

00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:26.125 align:middle line:84%
has been able to transcend
and improve my own health.

00:45:26.125 --> 00:45:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Debbie, thanks
for being on Beyond Belief.

00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Thank
you for having me.

00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:30.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We really
appreciate it.

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Really awesome
to be here with you.

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:34.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Truly remarkable
how you can cut contracts

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:38.210 align:middle line:84%
with people you care about and
people you don't care about.

00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:41.930 align:middle line:10%
And the end result, of course,
is making you a better person.

00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:45.140 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching Beyond Belief.
