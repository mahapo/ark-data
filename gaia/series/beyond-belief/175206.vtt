00:00:19.959 --> 00:00:21.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.600 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.220 align:middle line:10%
And we have a very special guest
for you today, Dr. Ken Hanson.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.150 align:middle line:10%
He's a professor, of course,
and heads up Treasures in Time,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.930 align:middle line:10%
which really deals with biblical
prophecy and incredible things

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.470 align:middle line:10%
that he has been researching.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.270 align:middle line:90%
Ken, welcome.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.100 align:middle line:84%
It's good to see you
in the flesh again.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KEN HANSON: Good to be here
in the flesh again, George.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, you've
been such a great guest

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.454 align:middle line:90%
on the radio program.

00:00:42.454 --> 00:00:43.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Always a pleasure.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just
remarkable, your work.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Always
great to talk to you.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.499 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're going to talk
about a lot of different things

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:50.280 align:middle line:84%
today, and we're
going to highlight

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.580 align:middle line:84%
some special things about the
Torah and what it all means,

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.790 align:middle line:84%
but I want to talk with you for
a little bit about something

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.700 align:middle line:84%
that scares the living
daylights out of people

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.920 align:middle line:90%
and that's end times prophecy.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And so many people say, Ken,
you're in end times right now.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.010 align:middle line:90%
It's over for all of us.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.340 align:middle line:90%
Where are we with that?

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.715 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Where
are we with that?

00:01:10.715 --> 00:01:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, somebody
asked a great rabbi

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.730 align:middle line:90%
when will the messiah come?

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.470 align:middle line:90%
When will the end be?

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.970 align:middle line:90%
And he answered, every day.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.150 align:middle line:90%
But when?

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.950 align:middle line:90%
When?

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.220 align:middle line:90%
Can you give me a clue?

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And he said, when we make the
world ready to receive Him,

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.310 align:middle line:90%
that's the human goal.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.110 align:middle line:90%
That's our burden.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.693 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're not
ready for that yet.

00:01:31.693 --> 00:01:34.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: We have to
actually repair the world

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.890 align:middle line:84%
to appoint where we're ready
to receive the messiah,

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.250 align:middle line:84%
the Anointed One, One who
will sit on David's throne.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.500 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you that
traditional Judaism, and that

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.180 align:middle line:84%
includes modern Judaism, tends
to shy away from eschatology

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.390 align:middle line:90%
and the end time.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.190 align:middle line:90%
And why is that?

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Because Judaism, as it's
evolved and developed

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.060 align:middle line:84%
through the centuries, wants
to focus on the here and now.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.735 align:middle line:84%
It's life right now that's
important, how we live today.

00:02:00.735 --> 00:02:01.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree with that.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And if
we live correctly,

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.400 align:middle line:84%
if we live well, the good life,
the [HEBREW],, we say in Hebrew,

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.260 align:middle line:84%
then the world to come
will take care of itself.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.100 align:middle line:84%
But Jews talk about this
as the world to come,

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.530 align:middle line:84%
and it is an
important affirmation

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.780 align:middle line:84%
in Judaism all
through the centuries,

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.840 align:middle line:84%
from the days of the
great rabbi Maimonides all

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.950 align:middle line:90%
the way to the present.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.670 align:middle line:84%
"I believe with perfect
faith," said Maimonides,

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.860 align:middle line:90%
"in the coming of the messiah."

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.130 align:middle line:90%
This is essential.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.700 align:middle line:84%
There is a world to come,
because let's face it,

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.967 align:middle line:90%
we're messed up.

00:02:33.967 --> 00:02:34.800 align:middle line:90%
Now when will that--

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's no
doubt about that.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: No doubt about that.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.950 align:middle line:90%
When will it be?

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, that gets into
one branch of Judaism

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.930 align:middle line:84%
called Kabbalah,
Jewish mysticism.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And the mystics have
generally felt that history

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.514 align:middle line:90%
is a 6,000 year cycle.

00:02:53.514 --> 00:02:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And if you actually
go back and do

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:02.760 align:middle line:84%
the strict biblical chronology,
we're already in the year 5776.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.020 align:middle line:84%
We're getting on, and we've
got another couple of centuries

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.730 align:middle line:84%
plus before we actually
get to the final year.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's according to strict
mystical Judaism Kabbalah.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So we don't have
to worry about it right now.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: But then
again, who knows?

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Because that's just
one interpretation,

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.419 align:middle line:84%
and the thing about Judaism
is that there are many--

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:26.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interpretations?

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.793 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah, and I like that.

00:03:27.793 --> 00:03:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's nice about
it, because no one can say

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.400 align:middle line:84%
and you can't say you're
wrong, you're wrong, I'm right.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.200 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We don't
want them to be right.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: God only knows.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We don't
want end times, do we?

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Exactly.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And there other
interpretations that

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.470 align:middle line:84%
would put the end
much, much nearer.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.510 align:middle line:84%
After all, there are
major milestones.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.635 align:middle line:84%
There is the rebirth of the
Jewish state in the year 1948.

00:03:49.635 --> 00:03:51.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: '48, that's when
the clock started, right?

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.093 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: After 2,000 years
of dispersion and suffering.

00:03:54.093 --> 00:03:55.350 align:middle line:90%
There's also the Holocaust.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Horrible, milestone,
however, in,

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.870 align:middle line:84%
if you want to think
about it, prophecy.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.230 align:middle line:84%
Then, of course, there's the
reunification of Jerusalem

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.370 align:middle line:90%
in 1967, the June 1967 War.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So the signs are there.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: So yes,
the signs are there,

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.930 align:middle line:84%
and especially as we
go back into history.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Judaism has changed a
lot as it's evolved.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.200 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned, it's
much less inclined

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.170 align:middle line:84%
to talk about such things,
but in the days of Jesus

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.230 align:middle line:84%
and the centuries
even before Jesus,

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.170 align:middle line:84%
who was a historical
character in ancient Judaism,

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.980 align:middle line:84%
there was a much
greater sensitivity

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.320 align:middle line:84%
to this kind of apocalyptic
ideology within Judaism.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, they
believed back then

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.640 align:middle line:84%
that we are in a great cosmic
struggle, a great conflict

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.570 align:middle line:84%
between powers of good and
evil, between the Sons of Light

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.570 align:middle line:84%
as the Dead Sea sect likes
to refer to themselves

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.580 align:middle line:90%
and the Sons of Darkness

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And then the Apostle
Paul, who even though we

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.190 align:middle line:84%
think of him as a Christian,
he was a good Jewish guy

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.390 align:middle line:90%
back in his day.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And he talked about
powers and principalities

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.100 align:middle line:84%
that we're constantly
at battle with.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And they had a sense,
even in the first century,

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.850 align:middle line:84%
that we've got maybe
a generation, if that,

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.260 align:middle line:90%
before the end.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, didn't quite
pan out that way,

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.500 align:middle line:84%
but nonetheless, because
of that imminent idea

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.070 align:middle line:84%
that the end is near,
we do know historically

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.640 align:middle line:84%
that this early
Judeo-Christian Nazarene

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.370 align:middle line:84%
sect, as I like
to refer to them,

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.870 align:middle line:90%
took those warnings seriously.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.970 align:middle line:84%
They fled from the
city of Jerusalem

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.150 align:middle line:84%
in the first century
of the Common Era

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.340 align:middle line:84%
just within a generation
of Jesus himself.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.650 align:middle line:84%
They were convinced
this was the end,

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.420 align:middle line:84%
and because they
fled Jerusalem, they

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.780 align:middle line:84%
were not caught up in the
great revolt that would

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.220 align:middle line:90%
have massacred all of them.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Every
civilization believes

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.850 align:middle line:84%
that they are in the end
times, every civilization.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:56.880 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't stopped.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: It hasn't stopped.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And one of these days, if
you believe the great Rabbi

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:01.650 align:middle line:90%
Maimonides--

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The last one
will be the right one.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.936 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: The last one will
be the right one, the messiah,

00:06:04.936 --> 00:06:08.610 align:middle line:84%
the Anointed One, one who will
sit on the throne of David,

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.410 align:middle line:84%
even as the great prophet
Isaiah declared that from Zion

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.120 align:middle line:90%
shall go forth the Torah.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.550 align:middle line:84%
That all nations will come up
and worship the divine presence

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.840 align:middle line:90%
in Israel.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.430 align:middle line:84%
That, as we read on the face
of the United Nations building

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.460 align:middle line:84%
in New York, quoting
from the prophet Isaiah,

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.640 align:middle line:84%
"nations shall not lift
up sword against nation,

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.370 align:middle line:84%
neither shall they
learn war anymore."

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That would be nice.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: That's
the prophet Isaiah.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about
the Book of Revelation.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.240 align:middle line:84%
How did it get written, and
what does that mean to us?

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: The Book
of Revelation--

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.390 align:middle line:84%
lot of speculation about
who wrote it and when.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:55.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to go out
on a limb academically

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.280 align:middle line:84%
and take a very minority
view, but I like the idea

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.020 align:middle line:84%
that there was, as it were,
a 13th disciple of Jesus--

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:06.000 align:middle line:90%
Not 12?

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: --hiding in the
shadows by the name of John.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is not John the
Galilean, the fisherman.

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:18.300 align:middle line:84%
This is a John who had some
close contact with the Dead Sea

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.370 align:middle line:84%
sect, that is the
Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.920 align:middle line:84%
That is also John
the Baptist, who had

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.200 align:middle line:90%
a very apocalyptic mentality.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.400 align:middle line:90%
The end is near.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.200 align:middle line:84%
This is all over the
Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.990 align:middle line:84%
If we read what is attributed
to John the Baptist

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.590 align:middle line:84%
in the gospels, he's talking
about fire and brimstone

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:36.460 align:middle line:90%
to come down and judge humanity.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.310 align:middle line:90%
And it's soon, it's soon coming.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:44.580 align:middle line:84%
There was a disciple of John
the Baptist, another John, whom

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.130 align:middle line:90%
I believe was a Jewish priest.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
the 13th person.

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: This is
the 13th person

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:54.270 align:middle line:84%
who is responsible for
the Gospel of John.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He doesn't show up in
the picture of the Last Supper.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:57.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Well.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.410 align:middle line:84%
We've got some
telltale evidence.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.780 align:middle line:90%
He shows up at the Resurrection.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe he's the
one who took the picture.

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:06.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Could be.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.130 align:middle line:90%
Could be.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:12.240 align:middle line:84%
But we're told even at the
time of the Resurrection

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.390 align:middle line:84%
and the empty tomb of
Jesus that the disciples--

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Mary is running up ahead
and Peter rushes in.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.270 align:middle line:90%
John is first, but he stops.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:middle line:90%
He does not enter the tomb.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.510 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:30.030 align:middle line:84%
Because a priest is not to have
contact with a deceased body,

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:32.100 align:middle line:90%
a corpse, and he doesn't know.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's a little
detail in the Gospels

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.320 align:middle line:90%
that is just missed.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.120 align:middle line:90%
We would think--

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they didn't
know he was gone, right?

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Exactly.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.240 align:middle line:84%
So here's this
mysterious 13th disciple,

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.780 align:middle line:84%
and he writes not only
his memoirs, which

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:49.650 align:middle line:84%
become the Gospel of John,
but he also produces something

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:53.040 align:middle line:84%
else while in exile
on the Isle of Patmos

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.650 align:middle line:84%
that we call the
Book of Revelation.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:57.495 align:middle line:90%
Very apocalyptic and contains--

00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very scary.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Scary and
contains precise warnings

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.020 align:middle line:84%
to those early
followers of Jesus.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:08.730 align:middle line:84%
When you see armies surrounding
Jerusalem, said Jesus himself,

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:10.202 align:middle line:90%
flee into the hills.

00:09:10.202 --> 00:09:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, people who don't
know their history

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.280 align:middle line:84%
have no idea what is
being referred to,

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.150 align:middle line:84%
and they're trying to somehow
fit this into modern times.

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.850 align:middle line:84%
But hey, there
was a great revolt

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.400 align:middle line:84%
in the first century
of the Common Era that

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.260 align:middle line:90%
broke out against Rome.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:30.660 align:middle line:84%
The Jews rose up
66 AD against Rome.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And Rome came in the
days of the Emperor Nero

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.370 align:middle line:90%
and put it down ferociously.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:42.930 align:middle line:84%
Now Nero, if you put his name
in Hebrew, is Neron Kaisar.

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And in Kabbalah, that
is, Jewish mysticism,

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.530 align:middle line:84%
every letter has
a numerical value.

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, you add up those
Hebrew letters of Nero Kaisar

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.130 align:middle line:84%
take it out of Latin,
put it in Hebrew,

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:58.320 align:middle line:90%
Neron Kaisar becomes 666.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, the
sign of the beast.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: There you go.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And those early followers,
whom I really think

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.090 align:middle line:84%
had at least parts of what we
call the Book of Revelation

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.430 align:middle line:84%
today as prophetic
warnings to them-- again,

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm going out on a
limb here academically,

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.930 align:middle line:84%
but it's entirely
feasible that they

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:17.490 align:middle line:90%
took those warnings seriously.

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And we are told by
other historians

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.740 align:middle line:90%
that they fled Jerusalem.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.800 align:middle line:84%
They went eastward
across the Jordan River

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.980 align:middle line:84%
into a city called
Pella in Transjordan.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And they alone were saved
from the destruction that

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:33.550 align:middle line:84%
befell the city in the year
70 of the Common Era, when

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:34.960 align:middle line:90%
the temple was destroyed.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Josephus tells us that one
million Jews were slaughtered

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:41.020 align:middle line:84%
in that Roman campaign,
and that would

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:44.280 align:middle line:84%
have annihilated this entire
Judeo-Christian movement

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.080 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:45.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At the time, yeah.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: There would be
no Christian face today,

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.550 align:middle line:84%
arguably, had they stayed
in the city of Jerusalem

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:54.460 align:middle line:84%
and not believed themselves
that these are the end of days.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.200 align:middle line:90%
That this is the end time.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, are we in end
times now, in your opinion?

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Coming from
traditional Judaism,

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.620 align:middle line:90%
we don't know.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.420 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I'm alarmed at
what I'm seeing round about.

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:09.760 align:middle line:90%
You're seeing this?

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:09.910 align:middle line:90%
You're seeing the--

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:11.822 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: On a personal
level, I am alarmed.

00:11:11.822 --> 00:11:13.780 align:middle line:84%
I can't say that
academically, and I can't even

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.420 align:middle line:84%
say it Jewishly, because
we focus on today,

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:17.690 align:middle line:90%
on the here and now.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.690 align:middle line:84%
But there are things going
on in this world that

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:22.180 align:middle line:84%
are more alarming
than certainly,

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.220 align:middle line:84%
in my short lifetime,
I've ever experienced.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:25.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So you see signs?

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: The nuclear
threat, of course,

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.080 align:middle line:84%
and then on, I think,
the good side, we

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.830 align:middle line:84%
have the establishment
of Jerusalem

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:39.160 align:middle line:84%
or the recognition of Jerusalem,
at last, as Israel's capital

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.740 align:middle line:84%
by the United States
government, but even this

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:42.712 align:middle line:90%
is an incendiary thing.

00:11:42.712 --> 00:11:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
happened to Tel Aviv?

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: What
happened to Tel Aviv?

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:46.666 align:middle line:84%
Well, we were, of
course, reticent

00:11:46.666 --> 00:11:49.690 align:middle line:84%
even to recognize Jerusalem
as Israel's capital.

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:52.390 align:middle line:84%
So we'll just put our
embassy in Tel Aviv.

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And there it sat, even though
Congress, many years ago,

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.100 align:middle line:84%
voted that Jerusalem should
be the capital, recognized

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.060 align:middle line:90%
as the capital.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:05.560 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have an actual
presidential proclamation

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.770 align:middle line:90%
that now is the time until now.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:12.570 align:middle line:84%
But even that is an
incendiary thing.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a
warning, isn't it?

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Sure.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.556 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A timetable war.

00:12:15.556 --> 00:12:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And we
throw archeology

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:20.290 align:middle line:84%
then into the mix,
which is another part

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:23.230 align:middle line:84%
of this incendiary
thing going on.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:27.220 align:middle line:84%
Archeology is taking place
in the city of Jerusalem now

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:30.550 align:middle line:84%
which is contested, because
Jerusalem is supposed

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:35.650 align:middle line:84%
to be a divided city, if ever
a Palestinian state is created.

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the richest archeology
being undertaken as we speak

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:44.470 align:middle line:84%
is over the Green Line,
over the Green Line

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:46.180 align:middle line:84%
into the part that
is supposed to be

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.730 align:middle line:90%
the new state of Palestine.

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:54.790 align:middle line:84%
So here, archeology meets modern
geopolitics right in the face.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:56.185 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievable.

00:12:56.185 --> 00:12:57.310 align:middle line:90%
And yes, it has potential--

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did they know this?

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: --to spark conflict.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who was Isaiah?

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Who was Isaiah?

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:11.260 align:middle line:84%
He was, I would argue, the
greatest prophet ever to exist.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.750 align:middle line:84%
He was the one
who gave us firmly

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.750 align:middle line:90%
what we call monotheism today.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:23.020 align:middle line:84%
We cannot overestimate
the importance of Isaiah.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:28.150 align:middle line:84%
He was a member of the ruling
class back in ancient Israel,

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:32.410 align:middle line:84%
in the 700s BC, that is,
before the Common Era

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:35.980 align:middle line:84%
in the days of King Ahaz and
another King, maybe we've

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.230 align:middle line:90%
heard of, called Hezekiah.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.180 align:middle line:90%
And he lived at this time.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And here he was, this member
of an aristocratic family,

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:49.390 align:middle line:84%
and yet, he chastised his
people and at the same time,

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:54.910 align:middle line:84%
identified with the lowly,
the underclass, the oppressed.

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And he gave us a new
religious sensitivity

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:02.830 align:middle line:84%
that was as revolutionary as
the wheel in human civilization.

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:04.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who is exactly Isaiah?

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.470 align:middle line:90%


00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: As the age
of prophecy unfolds,

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:12.280 align:middle line:84%
we find ourselves
in the year 742 BCE.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:17.270 align:middle line:84%
The place, the
temple in Jerusalem.

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:21.440 align:middle line:84%
A man named Isaiah is
called by God to prophesies,

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.020 align:middle line:90%
and he has a fateful vision.

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:25.620 align:middle line:90%


00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMAN: "I saw the Lord seated
on a throne high and exalted,

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.834 align:middle line:84%
and the skirt of his
robe filled the temple.

00:14:33.834 --> 00:14:36.670 align:middle line:84%
Seraphim were in
attendance on Him.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.770 align:middle line:84%
One of the seraphim
touched my mouth and said,

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:42.020 align:middle line:90%
this has touched your lips.

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:47.303 align:middle line:84%
Now your iniquity is removed,
and your sin is wiped out."

00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:51.080 align:middle line:90%
Isaiah 6:1.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: The book of Isaiah
is the longest prophetic text

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.490 align:middle line:90%
in the Bible.

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Isaiah's voice is a perpetual
plea for peace and tolerance.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.720 align:middle line:90%


00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.220 align:middle line:10%
His prophecies are
an enduring legacy

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:07.860 align:middle line:10%
that are relevant even today.

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:11.010 align:middle line:10%
It is from Isaiah that one
of the greatest quotations

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:14.959 align:middle line:10%
has come down to us
through the ages.

00:15:14.959 --> 00:15:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMAN: "They will
beat their swords

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:21.600 align:middle line:84%
into plowshares and their
spears into pruning hooks.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Nation will not take up
sword against nation,

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:28.810 align:middle line:84%
nor will they
learn war anymore."

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:30.330 align:middle line:90%
Isaiah 2:4.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.050 align:middle line:90%


00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They will
not know war anymore.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Anymore.

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And he gave us this concept of
the Messianic Age, a messiah,

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.290 align:middle line:84%
an anointed one,
someone who will

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:48.440 align:middle line:84%
sit on the throne of
the great King David

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:52.130 align:middle line:84%
and really bring
a universal peace.

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, bear in mind, this is in
the midst of a sea of paganism.

00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:00.570 align:middle line:84%
There was no monotheism known
to anyone in those days.

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:01.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:04.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And all you had were
various gods and goddesses who

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.780 align:middle line:84%
represent the physical forces
of the universe, the sun,

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:14.420 align:middle line:84%
the moon, the babbling brook,
whatever, the atmosphere,

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:17.090 align:middle line:84%
whether it's Mesopotamia
or Egypt or Canaan.

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:19.620 align:middle line:84%
And these gods are all
at war with one another.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:20.480 align:middle line:90%
They're fickle.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.260 align:middle line:90%
They're capricious.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:27.890 align:middle line:84%
So basically, everyone is simply
at the hands of fickle fate.

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why can't
the prophecies

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.900 align:middle line:90%
give us specific dates?

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Because it's the
concept and the idea that's

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:37.670 align:middle line:90%
most important.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:42.020 align:middle line:84%
That God, as we
understand the divine,

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.620 align:middle line:84%
is really not part of
this physical universe.

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Is completely
separate, is other,

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:51.830 align:middle line:84%
who sits above and
beyond human civilization

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:56.270 align:middle line:84%
and who actually judges the
world with righteousness,

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:57.830 align:middle line:90%
with justice.

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:01.010 align:middle line:84%
That's more important
than any dates,

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:02.930 align:middle line:84%
as far as the prophets
are concerned.

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And I should add that that
concept became ensconced

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:10.109 align:middle line:90%
in Western thought and culture.

00:17:10.109 --> 00:17:13.760 align:middle line:84%
It was picked up by great
Renaissance philosophers,

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.470 align:middle line:90%
by Enlightenment philosophers.

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:19.310 align:middle line:84%
John Locke developed
the idea of natural law.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:21.599 align:middle line:90%
This is incredible.

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:25.400 align:middle line:84%
He took these religious ideas
of the greatest prophet of all,

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.240 align:middle line:84%
and he secularized
them, but he said,

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.140 align:middle line:84%
look, there is a law
that's above everything,

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.940 align:middle line:90%
a justice and a righteousness.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And one person,
even any individual

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:38.150 align:middle line:84%
can stand up with a Torah
or a Bible in his hand

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.700 align:middle line:84%
and say the rest of
you have missed it,

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.750 align:middle line:84%
because you have
oppressed those who are

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:46.880 align:middle line:90%
weak and defenseless among you.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.560 align:middle line:90%
That's the revolutionary idea.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And the United States
of America, of course,

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:55.460 align:middle line:84%
embraced those ideas
and embellished them

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.970 align:middle line:84%
and placed them into our own
Declaration of Independence,

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:01.564 align:middle line:84%
talking about God and
the law of nature's God.

00:18:01.564 --> 00:18:02.480 align:middle line:90%
And the Constitution--

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.688 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But they fight that.

00:18:03.688 --> 00:18:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Natural law
is an amazing concept.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:07.820 align:middle line:90%
It's in the universe.

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.000 align:middle line:90%
Where did this come from?

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And I should add
Martin Luther King--

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:16.160 align:middle line:84%
the whole concept of civil
rights and justice and equality

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.181 align:middle line:84%
of all people, where
did this come from?

00:18:19.181 --> 00:18:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But nowadays,
Ken, when you

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.870 align:middle line:84%
talk about the Pledge of
Allegiance, for example,

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:27.400 align:middle line:84%
"liberty and justice for
all," talk about one God,

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.730 align:middle line:90%
they frown on this.

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:29.530 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:30.400 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well, thank Isaiah
that it's there to begin with.

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:38.330 align:middle line:84%
But what we've tried to do is
to secularize these concepts,

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:41.740 align:middle line:84%
and so we don't want to mention
the source of natural law.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, John Locke,
as a philosopher,

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:46.090 align:middle line:84%
he didn't-- he wasn't a
preacher or a theologian.

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:48.160 align:middle line:84%
He didn't talk about
God, God, God, God.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.830 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to,
but he knew where

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:56.020 align:middle line:84%
the source came from and so
did our founders and framers.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.510 align:middle line:90%
Many of them were deists.

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.550 align:middle line:84%
Some of them had
no formal religion,

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:03.460 align:middle line:84%
but everybody came
from a consensus

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:09.340 align:middle line:84%
that there is a divine order
out there in the universe,

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:13.180 align:middle line:84%
and that did not exist until the
Israelite prophets came along.

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:15.760 align:middle line:84%
They are the most
incredible phenomenon,

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.310 align:middle line:84%
perhaps in human history,
because they were born out

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:22.180 align:middle line:84%
of nowhere, just didn't
exist in the ancient world.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.220 align:middle line:84%
They just cropped
up, Isaiah, and then

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.560 align:middle line:84%
a slew of others
in his footsteps,

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.552 align:middle line:84%
and then they vanished,
also out of nowhere.

00:19:28.552 --> 00:19:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As quickly
as they appear.

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:31.509 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: As quickly
as they appear.

00:19:31.509 --> 00:19:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Isaiah's seal.

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: In December 2015,
Jerusalem archaeologist Eilat

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Mazar announced the discovery of
an ancient clay seal or bulla.

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:46.180 align:middle line:84%
The bulla contained an
astonishing inscription.

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:52.840 align:middle line:84%
It read, "belonging to Hezekiah,
son of Ahaz, King of Judah."

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:56.860 align:middle line:84%
This tiny artifact carried
a sensational message.

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:59.530 align:middle line:84%
This seal proved
the existence of one

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:02.320 align:middle line:84%
of ancient Judah's
greatest kings

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.650 align:middle line:84%
and proved the accuracy
of the biblical record.

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:08.560 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Mazar didn't
know it at the time,

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:12.370 align:middle line:84%
but another bulla, bearing
an intriguing inscription

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:16.180 align:middle line:84%
was waiting to be placed
under her microscope.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:19.120 align:middle line:84%
The Old Testament record
shows that King Hezekiah

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:22.450 align:middle line:84%
was a contemporary
of Isaiah the prophet

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:26.290 align:middle line:84%
the biblical books of Kings,
Chronicles, and Isaiah

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:30.460 align:middle line:84%
show that this prophet played
a central role in Hezekiah's

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:33.460 align:middle line:90%
remarkable reign over Judah.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Today, we have indisputable
scientific evidence

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:40.570 align:middle line:84%
proving the existence
of King Hezekiah,

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:43.510 align:middle line:84%
but what about Hezekiah
as chief counselor

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:46.810 align:middle line:84%
and one of the Bible's
greatest prophets?

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:50.830 align:middle line:84%
Is there archaeological
evidence proving the existence

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:52.468 align:middle line:90%
of the prophet Isaiah?

00:20:52.468 --> 00:20:54.858 align:middle line:90%

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:57.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You would say yes.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Now I would, and this
is very exciting and of course,

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.370 align:middle line:90%
also very controversial.

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:08.720 align:middle line:84%
I like to tell my students,
we can never really understand

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:13.460 align:middle line:84%
an idea or a concept unless
we understand also what

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:16.250 align:middle line:84%
it's pitted against,
because everything

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:19.069 align:middle line:84%
is a great debate, especially
in the academic world.

00:21:19.069 --> 00:21:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my gosh, constant.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And I can
tell you that there

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:26.930 align:middle line:84%
are a whole lot of what we
call Biblical minimalists.

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:29.420 align:middle line:84%
This is very much in
vogue, and I would even

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:31.880 align:middle line:84%
call them the majority
now, who essentially

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:35.420 align:middle line:84%
minimize anything and
everything in the biblical text.

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:38.600 align:middle line:84%
There are those who
say, Isaiah, well,

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.670 align:middle line:84%
there wasn't just a
single prophet Isaiah.

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:42.590 align:middle line:90%
There were multiple Isaiahs.

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:45.437 align:middle line:84%
There was a second Isaiah
from chapters 40 through 66.

00:21:45.437 --> 00:21:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were all
called Isaiah, right.

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And they
were all called Isaiah.

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:52.370 align:middle line:84%
There was a Trito-Isaiah
from chapters 55 through 66.

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Then the first Isaiah,
the first so many--

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:01.400 align:middle line:84%
29 chapters are also subdivided,
five different groups

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.250 align:middle line:90%
of various Isaiah prophets.

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:07.520 align:middle line:84%
So one scholar even says
that the historical Isaiah

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.310 align:middle line:84%
has vanished, and
it's all in vogue

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:12.080 align:middle line:90%
to say that sort of thing.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, out of nowhere,
when we least expect it,

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:19.160 align:middle line:84%
we have a tiny
little seal, a bulla,

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:22.380 align:middle line:84%
discovered in the excavations
at the south end of the Temple

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:23.180 align:middle line:90%

>>NOORY: How big would that be?

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:27.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: It's not a
half an inch in diameter.

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:28.550 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine?

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:30.258 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What we just
saw was just a half

00:22:30.258 --> 00:22:31.151 align:middle line:90%
an inch in diameter?

00:22:31.151 --> 00:22:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: It's a half
an inch in diameter.

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:34.774 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Almost like a
little quarter, right?

00:22:34.774 --> 00:22:38.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Yeah, and it was
thrown out of a royal bakery

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:45.980 align:middle line:84%
adjacent to the palace of
King Hezekiah in the 700s

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:47.750 align:middle line:90%
before the Common Era.

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And there it lay undisturbed
for thousands of years

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:55.237 align:middle line:84%
until Jerusalem is conquered
by the Israelis in 1967.

00:22:55.237 --> 00:22:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what's the
significance of the seal,

00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.120 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well, now, we
have a little clay object.

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:06.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a stamp, just like
the founders of America

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:09.050 align:middle line:84%
would put a stamp
on the parchment,

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:10.352 align:middle line:90%
right, to say it's sealed.

00:23:10.352 --> 00:23:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, like
a notary would.

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Like a
notary, precisely.

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:17.970 align:middle line:84%
But it says, plain
as day, [HEBREW]

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:22.830 align:middle line:90%
which means of or for Isaiah.

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:26.930 align:middle line:84%
The next part of it underneath
is the complicated part,

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:30.230 align:middle line:84%
because we read in
Hebrew [HEBREW],,

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:33.470 align:middle line:90%
three Hebrew letters [HEBREW].

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:38.510 align:middle line:10%
Well, I want to pronounce that
prophet, Isaiah the prophet.

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:42.410 align:middle line:84%
Except [HEBREW],, prophet, is
spelled with an extra letter

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:45.980 align:middle line:84%
at the end, an aleph,
and it's not there.

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:50.210 align:middle line:84%
However, tiny as this
seal is, the part where

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:53.210 align:middle line:84%
that letter would be
has been rubbed away,

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:55.740 align:middle line:84%
because it was wet
clay at the time,

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:58.440 align:middle line:84%
and there is a
fingerprint there.

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:01.257 align:middle line:84%
Someone had touched
that wet piece of clay.

00:24:01.257 --> 00:24:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On purpose.

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:04.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: No, just affixing
it to the parchment

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:06.020 align:middle line:90%
or the papyrus.

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:07.320 align:middle line:90%
Stick it down on it.

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:07.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, to push it down.

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:09.216 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And his
fingerprint, got left,

00:24:09.216 --> 00:24:12.510 align:middle line:84%
and it smudged away that
last letter, whatever it was.

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is even
more intriguing,

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:17.480 align:middle line:84%
because if this is
the letter aleph,

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.930 align:middle line:84%
then it's no doubt that
this is Isaiah the prophet.

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And do you suppose
that we might now

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.639 align:middle line:84%
have the fingerprint
of the prophet Isaiah?

00:24:26.639 --> 00:24:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is amazing.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: That is a smoking gun.

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And what about all
those minimalists

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:35.114 align:middle line:84%
who say that the historical
Isaiah has vanished?

00:24:35.114 --> 00:24:36.530 align:middle line:84%
There was just a
school of Isaiah,

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.460 align:middle line:84%
people calling
themselves Isaiah.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:42.260 align:middle line:84%
We have the actual ancient
Martin Luther King.

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:43.640 align:middle line:90%
He was that important.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Just as Martin Luther
King knew presidents,

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:51.260 align:middle line:84%
the ancient prophet knew kings,
he knew King Ahaz, King Ahaz,

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:54.860 align:middle line:84%
and he made a prophecy to King
Ahaz, one of the most famous,

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:59.450 align:middle line:84%
that says a maiden
shall be with child.

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:02.940 align:middle line:84%
[HEBREW] Emmanuel,
it says in Hebrew.

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: When was that done?

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: That was in,
also, the early 700s BCE,

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.256 align:middle line:90%
but you shall call his name--

00:25:11.256 --> 00:25:12.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Way before Christ.

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: [SPEAKING HEBREW],, you
shall call his name Emmanuel.

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:21.040 align:middle line:84%
Wow, and what is the
significance of all of that?

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.000 align:middle line:84%
There is someone
whose name will be

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.920 align:middle line:90%
God is with us, who will come.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And he says don't
worry, King Ahaz,

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:30.800 align:middle line:84%
because by the time this
child knows right from wrong,

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.380 align:middle line:84%
those enemies whom you
fear-- in those days,

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:36.170 align:middle line:84%
the King of the northern
tribes and the King

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:39.560 align:middle line:84%
of Syria, who were attacking
Judah in the south,

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.117 align:middle line:90%
they will be kaput essentially.

00:25:41.117 --> 00:25:42.200 align:middle line:90%
So don't worry about them.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they were talking
about the birth of Jesus,

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:44.810 align:middle line:90%
no doubt.

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: This is where
it gets interesting,

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:47.516 align:middle line:84%
because Christians,
of course, see

00:25:47.516 --> 00:25:51.590 align:middle line:84%
that as the birth of Jesus,
but then not everyone

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:52.520 align:middle line:90%
is a Christian.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And what, in fact, was
Isaiah talking about?

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's a
hidden reference,

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:59.550 align:middle line:84%
as far as Christians are
concerned, the Book of Jesus,

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:01.770 align:middle line:84%
but do you think Isaiah
had that in mind?

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:04.550 align:middle line:84%
He's thinking of
his own day and age,

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:08.670 align:middle line:84%
and in his day, who would
be this child who was born?

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Most scholars will tell
you it was probably

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:14.670 align:middle line:84%
the next King along the line,
King Hezekiah, who we just

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:18.660 align:middle line:84%
saw in the video, [HEBREW],,
and we have his seal also,

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:22.977 align:middle line:84%
which lays not 10 feet
away from the Isaiah seal.

00:26:22.977 --> 00:26:24.810 align:middle line:84%
They're, like, adjacent
to each other, found

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:27.330 align:middle line:84%
in the same strata
of the archeology

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:31.020 align:middle line:84%
because the King and the
prophet knew each other.

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was there a King David?

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:34.050 align:middle line:90%
Did he exist?

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:35.625 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: That's also contested.

00:26:35.625 --> 00:26:36.750 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look.

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:38.714 align:middle line:10%


00:26:38.714 --> 00:26:40.860 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:41.660 align:middle line:10%


00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:43.035 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANCESCA
STAVRAKOPOULOU: There

00:26:43.035 --> 00:26:44.670 align:middle line:10%
is one figure in
the Hebrew Bible

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:47.880 align:middle line:10%
who divides opinion
like no other.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:52.350 align:middle line:84%
To many, he's a simple shepherd
boy who defeated a giant.

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:56.730 align:middle line:84%
But for modern Israelis,
David is a founding father,

00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:01.520 align:middle line:84%
a hero whose star adorns
their national flag.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.500 align:middle line:84%
The Hebrew scriptures
describe how

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:07.130 align:middle line:84%
he united the tribes of
Israel into one nation

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:09.025 align:middle line:90%
and made Jerusalem his capital.

00:27:09.025 --> 00:27:11.530 align:middle line:90%


00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:14.320 align:middle line:10%
But the account of King
David in the Hebrew Bible,

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.700 align:middle line:10%
once considered a
timeless record,

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:18.301 align:middle line:10%
is built on shifting sands.

00:27:18.301 --> 00:27:22.150 align:middle line:90%


00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:25.230 align:middle line:84%
Modern archeology is challenging
the historical accuracy

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:28.790 align:middle line:84%
of the Bible, and this
has huge implications

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:31.106 align:middle line:90%
for the region and the world.

00:27:31.106 --> 00:27:33.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ISRAEL FINKELSTEIN: There
is very little evidence

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:35.300 align:middle line:84%
for the empire of King
David in Jerusalem.

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:37.280 align:middle line:84%
Around it is the
most excavated piece

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:38.780 align:middle line:84%
of land on the
face of the Earth.

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:42.170 align:middle line:84%
Still, a century and a
half reveal very little.

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>>STAVRAKOPOULOU: But
for many Israelis,

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:48.272 align:middle line:84%
archeology is also a way to
prove their claim to this land.

>>MAN: If anything
we've ever found

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:53.140 align:middle line:84%
in Israel, this really
sheds light on King David

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:55.195 align:middle line:84%
and on his first
empire in Jerusalem.

>>STAVRAKOPOULOU: In a
country as fought over

00:27:57.070 --> 00:28:00.860 align:middle line:10%
and contested as
Israel, David's legacy,

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:03.850 align:middle line:10%
as set out in the
Bible, is ammunition

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:06.930 align:middle line:10%
in an ideological war.

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:10.050 align:middle line:84%
But some scholars are
questioning the Bible's version

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:12.100 align:middle line:90%
of events.

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:17.970 align:middle line:10%
They claim David's kingdom may
not have been vast or united.

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:23.070 align:middle line:84%
Can we even talk about an
historical David at all?

David who killed Goliath?

>>HANSON: Same one, same one.

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:28.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, he
was real, wasn't he?

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:31.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well, if we listen
to our minimalist friends,

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:34.380 align:middle line:84%
like Israel Finkelstein, who
was just speaking on our video

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:39.370 align:middle line:84%
there, David was probably about
as historical as King Arthur.

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:40.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:41.942 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: A lot of
legends about him but--

00:28:41.942 --> 00:28:42.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very mystical.

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: --if there
were a King Arthur,

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:47.610 align:middle line:84%
he was probably just a
local chieftain somewhere.

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:49.830 align:middle line:10%
If there were a King
David, he might have just

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:52.380 align:middle line:10%
been sitting on a
hilltop in a tent,

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:56.700 align:middle line:10%
and his kingdom might have
existed perhaps mythologically,

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.110 align:middle line:10%
maybe just a few acres.

00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:58.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Why do we have these
two different views?

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Because
the minimalists,

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.310 align:middle line:84%
our minimalist friends--
and they're good scholars,

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:06.570 align:middle line:90%
I know some of them--

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:09.090 align:middle line:84%
will say, look, where
is the evidence?

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Skepticism is rampant,
as it should be, in fact.

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:14.685 align:middle line:90%
Show me--

00:29:14.685 --> 00:29:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
saying that there's--

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:17.319 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Where's the
beef, they will ask.

00:29:17.319 --> 00:29:18.150 align:middle line:90%
Where's the beef?

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:20.970 align:middle line:84%
So show me the archeology
that supports David.

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:23.100 align:middle line:84%
All we have are
some biblical texts.

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:24.460 align:middle line:90%
Just like King Arthur, show me.

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:26.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, there
may not be any.

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:27.371 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:29:27.371 --> 00:29:28.620 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't mean he doesn't exist.

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well, we've got
the city of Jerusalem,

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:34.530 align:middle line:84%
and that is ground zero
in terms of archeology.

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:37.147 align:middle line:84%
It's also ground zero
in geopolitics today.

00:29:37.147 --> 00:29:37.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sure is.

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:40.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And also
on our video, we

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:44.340 align:middle line:84%
just saw some of those
involved in the excavation

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:48.540 align:middle line:84%
to the south end of the Temple
Mount, just a tad further south

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:54.030 align:middle line:84%
of where the Isaiah seal was
found, we call it [HEBREW],,

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:56.010 align:middle line:90%
David's City.

00:29:56.010 --> 00:30:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And the excavators have actually
gone way down underneath,

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:02.040 align:middle line:90%
digging tunnels.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.930 align:middle line:84%
This is Indiana
Jones kind of stuff.

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:07.470 align:middle line:84%
Like in the old days,
literally digging tunnels,

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:10.500 align:middle line:84%
and there is some
good reason to believe

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:15.210 align:middle line:84%
that they may have found
the palace of King David

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:19.390 align:middle line:84%
and his son, Solomon and that
it was a massive structure.

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
then he does exist.

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:22.290 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: If they are right.

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:25.340 align:middle line:84%
But this is where the
controversy comes in.

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:28.702 align:middle line:84%
And as I say, you can never
understand an idea or concept

00:30:28.702 --> 00:30:30.660 align:middle line:84%
unless you understand
what it's pitted against.

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:31.993 align:middle line:90%
That's when it gets interesting.

00:30:31.993 --> 00:30:33.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
Dr. Ken Hanson say?

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:35.100 align:middle line:90%
Did David exist?

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:37.140 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSON: I'm down
with saying he did.

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The story of David
and Goliath, did that happen?

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:44.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: I'm down with
saying that these stories rest

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.530 align:middle line:90%
on something historical.

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether every
detail is correct--

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:51.162 align:middle line:84%
these are not written
as history books.

00:30:51.162 --> 00:30:53.370 align:middle line:84%
These are not written as
history books to begin with.

00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:54.828 align:middle line:84%
They're written as
religious texts.

00:30:54.828 --> 00:30:55.960 align:middle line:90%
But when it comes--

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.620 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, we have George
Washington and his story

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:01.560 align:middle line:84%
of chopping down the
cherry tree and throwing

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.840 align:middle line:84%
the silver dollar
across the Potomac,

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.650 align:middle line:90%
and does that really bother me?

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:06.690 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:08.610 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not
that happened, I'm

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:09.906 align:middle line:90%
a Washington fan, by the way.

00:31:09.906 --> 00:31:11.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm a real George
Washington fan.

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.230 align:middle line:84%
Yes, he existed,
and by the way, we

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:15.290 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't have the United
States without him.

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:17.040 align:middle line:84%
I'll go on record as
saying that, as well.

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree with that.

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: One man, that's
how important David was.

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:24.937 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If David did not exist,
big if, if he did not exist,

00:31:24.937 --> 00:31:25.770 align:middle line:90%
what does that mean?

00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:27.353 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: We would
have to invent him,

00:31:27.353 --> 00:31:30.290 align:middle line:84%
because great nations
and great peoples

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:33.140 align:middle line:84%
don't, in general,
crop out of nowhere.

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:39.200 align:middle line:10%
Just like Moses, he's also in
contest, contested controversy.

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.790 align:middle line:90%
Nations need founders.

00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:44.330 align:middle line:84%
They need leaders and
hence, George Washington,

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:46.760 align:middle line:90%
hence Moses, hence David.

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:51.320 align:middle line:84%
It would be hard to explain how
this people, Israel, survived

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:54.200 align:middle line:84%
and even survived
destruction and exile

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:57.470 align:middle line:84%
and captivity without
at least the memory,

00:31:57.470 --> 00:32:01.556 align:middle line:84%
and this also dovetails with
the idea of the messiah.

00:32:01.556 --> 00:32:02.930 align:middle line:84%
That's what Isaiah
was all about.

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:05.270 align:middle line:84%
He lived well after King
David, but he's saying, look,

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:08.600 align:middle line:84%
someday, someday, someone
will sit on that same throne

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.900 align:middle line:84%
that David established and like
David, he will bring peace.

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:14.780 align:middle line:84%
Even better than David,
he'll bring world peace.

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is prophecy so
important in Jewish mysticism?

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:21.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well, "prophecy,"
as a word itself,

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:24.260 align:middle line:84%
that word, "navi," which
means prophet, it comes

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:29.690 align:middle line:84%
from the Hebrew verb [HEBREW],,
which means to foretell,

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:33.410 align:middle line:84%
not just to foretell, but to
forth tell, to speak forth.

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:37.100 align:middle line:84%
I think of it more as the Martin
Luther King type of prophet.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:40.430 align:middle line:84%
That is the proper understanding
of biblical prophecy.

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:44.690 align:middle line:84%
But the mystics come along, and
they are much more interested

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:47.390 align:middle line:84%
in finding an intimacy
with the divine,

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:51.540 align:middle line:84%
knowing secrets that are
not known to everybody else.

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And among those
secrets, of course,

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.850 align:middle line:90%
are the messiah, the messiah.

00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:58.310 align:middle line:90%
When will this messiah come?

00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And when you're asking that
question, well, ipso facto,

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:04.340 align:middle line:84%
you're asking, when
will the end be?

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And there have been
multiple Jewish messiahs

00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:08.660 align:middle line:90%
down through history.

00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:11.300 align:middle line:90%
There was one in the 1600s.

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:14.240 align:middle line:84%
His name was
Sabbatai Zevi, and he

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:18.110 align:middle line:84%
proclaimed that he was, in
fact, the Jewish messiah.

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:20.090 align:middle line:90%
And it was an enormous movement.

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:22.970 align:middle line:84%
We believe that in his
day, the majority of Jews

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:25.790 align:middle line:84%
worldwide believed that
he was the messiah.

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:28.100 align:middle line:84%
The end was near,
and they actually

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:30.330 align:middle line:84%
began selling all of
their possessions.

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:32.600 align:middle line:84%
They got on ships
all over Europe,

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.200 align:middle line:84%
and they began converging
in wooden ships on Palestine

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:39.560 align:middle line:84%
in those days, because they
believed that this was it.

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.000 align:middle line:90%
This was the end.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.670 align:middle line:84%
The false messiah, as
we know now, himself,

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:46.850 align:middle line:84%
was captured by the Turks
and brought in chains

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:50.780 align:middle line:84%
before the sultan and given
the option, the ultimatum,

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:53.270 align:middle line:90%
choose Allah or die.

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:54.200 align:middle line:90%
And he chose Allah.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.830 align:middle line:90%
He converted to Islam.

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:58.085 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ken, why
is the planned move

00:33:58.085 --> 00:34:01.800 align:middle line:84%
of the embassy, our embassy,
from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.290 align:middle line:90%
so controversial?

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Because the other
side, the Palestinian side,

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:11.480 align:middle line:84%
denies that there ever
was a temple in Jerusalem,

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.830 align:middle line:84%
that there ever was a
King David, many of them.

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:17.179 align:middle line:84%
They're certainly on
the minimalist side.

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:23.060 align:middle line:84%
So all of this idea linking
Jews with this land of Israel

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:26.484 align:middle line:84%
is an imaginary history, exactly
as our minimalist friends say.

00:34:26.484 --> 00:34:28.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which they want
the world to believe.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:33.949 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well, exactly, because
Jews should not have a right

00:34:33.949 --> 00:34:35.989 align:middle line:90%
to this city and this land.

00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:38.480 align:middle line:84%
They have actually
come in and taken it

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.030 align:middle line:84%
from Palestinian people,
that's their argument.

00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:44.179 align:middle line:84%
And consequently, if the
United States and other nations

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:48.139 align:middle line:84%
begin to recognize Jerusalem
as Israel's capital, what

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:51.000 align:middle line:84%
does that say about the
whole east side of Jerusalem,

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.290 align:middle line:84%
which is largely
Arab in population?

00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:57.950 align:middle line:84%
Which in a new state, by
the way, would be divided--

00:34:57.950 --> 00:35:00.875 align:middle line:84%
the city of Jerusalem would
have to be divided, according

00:35:00.875 --> 00:35:02.000 align:middle line:90%
to the two-state Jerusalem.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it's the
right thing to do, isn't it?

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well, if it
happens, what that does

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:09.740 align:middle line:84%
is to turn Jerusalem
into the new Berlin,

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:15.849 align:middle line:84%
and it would have
walls and checkpoints.

00:35:15.849 --> 00:35:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the
unfortunate part.

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: What about
the holy sites?

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:22.410 align:middle line:84%
The holiest site
in all of Judaism,

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:24.590 align:middle line:84%
which is the wall, of
course, the great Western

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:27.040 align:middle line:90%
Wall, that's in the Arab side.

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.940 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to put an
international border

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:31.730 align:middle line:84%
right at the Western Wall, and
we think that's going to hold?

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:34.820 align:middle line:84%
This is why I'm
so skittish and, I

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.580 align:middle line:84%
hate to say, afraid,
not as a scholar,

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:42.980 align:middle line:84%
mind you, but just as a
person about apocalyptic kind

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:44.410 align:middle line:90%
of prognoses.

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:47.030 align:middle line:84%
Because when that
happens, if that happens--

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:49.130 align:middle line:84%
they call it a peace
process, I'm sorry.

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:51.170 align:middle line:84%
I see it as a war
process, and it

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:55.310 align:middle line:84%
could be a war to end all
wars focused on ground zero,

00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:58.730 align:middle line:84%
right where David's palace
is, where the Isaiah seal was

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:00.060 align:middle line:90%
found, et cetera.

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:01.640 align:middle line:90%
It's not a pretty picture.

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Should we be putting
an embassy in Jerusalem?

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: In a word, yes,
because it's the right thing

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:07.270 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And what we find
archaeologically, substantiates

00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:14.960 align:middle line:84%
the claim, and let
me say, the Jewish

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:19.460 align:middle line:84%
claim on not just West
Jerusalem but the whole city

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:22.987 align:middle line:84%
of Jerusalem, even the sites
where Muslims have holy sites.

00:36:22.987 --> 00:36:24.320 align:middle line:90%
Now, I've been there many times.

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:25.760 align:middle line:90%
I respect Islam.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:29.990 align:middle line:84%
I have great respect for Islam
as a faith and as a religion.

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:31.430 align:middle line:90%
I've been in those holy sites.

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:33.020 align:middle line:84%
I've prayed in the
mosques, in fact.

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:35.270 align:middle line:84%
It's OK for a Jew
to do that, in fact

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:37.580 align:middle line:84%
because we're praying
to the same God, Allah.

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:40.110 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of the politics
that are involved here,

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:40.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:43.100 align:middle line:90%
There was a Jewish land here.

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:45.900 align:middle line:84%
There was a Jewish temple
here, and there should be,

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:49.070 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion, one
unified city of Jerusalem.

00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:53.137 align:middle line:84%
To divide it is going to
bring on the end, I think,

00:36:53.137 --> 00:36:53.970 align:middle line:90%
sooner that we hope.

00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:55.011 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can we unify it?

00:36:55.011 --> 00:36:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Can we make a Jerusalem for
Palestinians and Israelis

00:36:58.850 --> 00:36:59.990 align:middle line:90%
and make it work?

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:03.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: We sure can if
we have the will to do it.

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:07.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, Jerusalem has been formally
annexed by the state of Israel,

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:10.950 align:middle line:84%
even though the Palestinian
Authority doesn't accept that,

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:12.710 align:middle line:84%
but it has been
formally annexed.

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:13.950 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:17.060 align:middle line:84%
A large number, I'd
say the great majority

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:20.880 align:middle line:84%
of East Jerusalem Arabs have
taken Israeli citizenship.

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:23.190 align:middle line:84%
They have full citizenship
in the state of Israel.

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:26.480 align:middle line:84%
They even have representatives
in the Israeli Knesset.

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.130 align:middle line:90%
And yes, there is trouble.

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:29.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes, there is trouble.

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:31.730 align:middle line:84%
There are stabbings that
continue, even recently.

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:33.110 align:middle line:90%
I follow this all the time.

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:33.590 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Look at what
happens in our cities,

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.090 align:middle line:90%
for crying out loud.

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:39.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: But there is relative
peace, and let me tell you,

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:43.580 align:middle line:84%
I would let my kids play in
the streets of Jerusalem much

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:45.740 align:middle line:84%
easier, with a
clearer conscience

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:47.970 align:middle line:90%
than in many places in New York.

00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:50.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ken, in 1948,
when the state of Israel

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:54.080 align:middle line:84%
was formed, should
we have, as a world,

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:56.660 align:middle line:84%
carved out something
for the Palestinians

00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:59.030 align:middle line:90%
somewhere at the same time?

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: That was what was put
forward to the United Nations

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:03.440 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.600 align:middle line:84%
It was a two-state
solution back then.

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:07.550 align:middle line:84%
There would be a
Jewish state created,

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:10.880 align:middle line:84%
and there would be an
Arab state created,

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.252 align:middle line:84%
and the borders were carved
out, as well, at that time.

00:38:13.252 --> 00:38:14.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: The Arab
side rejected.

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:20.150 align:middle line:84%
The Jewish side accepted the
United Nations partition plan.

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:22.150 align:middle line:90%
The Arab side, sadly, rejected.

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because they still
wanted where Israel was.

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:24.165 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Because
they could have

00:38:24.165 --> 00:38:29.180 align:middle line:84%
had everything that they wanted
and more had they agreed.

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:32.660 align:middle line:84%
But instead what happened was
that the Hashemite kingdom

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:35.810 align:middle line:84%
of Jordan annexed the
area that was supposed

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:37.310 align:middle line:90%
to be the Palestinian state.

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:41.060 align:middle line:84%
It was Jordanian, in
fact, up until 1967.

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:44.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: '67 Israeli
got that back.

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Even so, the
borders were tenuous at best.

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Up until the 1967 war, there
was about nine to 11 miles

00:38:56.150 --> 00:39:00.080 align:middle line:84%
from the Mediterranean Sea
to the border of Jordan,

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:03.740 align:middle line:84%
and that was the Jewish state,
separating Galilee in the north

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:05.990 align:middle line:90%
from Judea in the south.

00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:10.540 align:middle line:84%
That's the country, 9 to
11 miles wide, a strip.

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:12.140 align:middle line:90%
How defensible is that?

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Israel has
basically told Iran,

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:17.075 align:middle line:90%
you are not going to get nukes.

00:39:17.075 --> 00:39:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And they've warned
them about that.

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Could that be the beginning
of the apocalypse?

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: If you have
an apocalyptic mindset,

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:26.627 align:middle line:90%
it sure could.

00:39:26.627 --> 00:39:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And I hate to go there,
because-- and again,

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:31.460 align:middle line:84%
looking at Isaiah, Isaiah
is an interesting character,

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:35.570 align:middle line:84%
because on the one hand, he
delivers apocalyptic messages.

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Isaiah 24, beginning,
is a whole apocalyptic--

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:42.530 align:middle line:84%
they call it the little
apocalypse of the prophet

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:44.090 align:middle line:90%
Isaiah.

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And yet, at the same time, he
has this triumphant message of,

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:51.680 align:middle line:84%
look, the Torah is going
to go forth from Jerusalem,

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:54.410 align:middle line:84%
and all the peoples
will stream up

00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:58.550 align:middle line:84%
to come to the knowledge
of the God of Israel.

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:01.070 align:middle line:84%
He's conflicted, and
that's exactly what

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:03.180 align:middle line:84%
I cope with just
as an individual,

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:07.580 align:middle line:84%
as a person, the idea and
the dream of real peace

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:08.990 align:middle line:90%
in the Messianic Age.

00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:10.760 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I'll
tell you this--

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.860 align:middle line:84%
even orthodox rabbis,
much as we don't

00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:16.280 align:middle line:84%
like to get apocalyptic, have
this concept of what they call

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:20.990 align:middle line:84%
[SPEAKING HEBREW],, the
pangs of the messiah.

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:23.690 align:middle line:90%
And this is in Talmud, mind you.

00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:26.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, Christians talk about
the great tribulation

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.010 align:middle line:90%
prior to the second coming.

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:31.190 align:middle line:84%
This is the Jewish version,
that before the messiah comes,

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:34.580 align:middle line:84%
there will be pangs,
like birth pangs,

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:38.280 align:middle line:84%
and there will be violence
as we've never seen.

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.770 align:middle line:84%
There will be a
lack of knowledge.

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:43.332 align:middle line:84%
There will be youth
disrespecting their elders.

00:40:43.332 --> 00:40:44.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sounds like now.

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:47.585 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Deprivation
of all kinds,

00:40:47.585 --> 00:40:50.160 align:middle line:90%
and that is traditional Judaism.

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:52.070 align:middle line:84%
It just doesn't
say exactly when.

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:55.100 align:middle line:84%
So we look and we watch,
and we're conflicted again,

00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:58.340 align:middle line:84%
because on the one hand, I look
at what's going on with Iran.

00:40:58.340 --> 00:40:59.720 align:middle line:90%
This is terrifying.

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And we add North
Korea into that.

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:03.500 align:middle line:90%
This is a terrifying mix.

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:06.620 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand,
hey, I go back to Isaiah.

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:07.460 align:middle line:90%
There is hope.

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:08.430 align:middle line:90%
There is optimism.

00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:10.350 align:middle line:90%
We're never to lose that hope.

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:11.720 align:middle line:90%
When will the messiah come?

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:14.000 align:middle line:84%
When we make the world
ready to receive Him.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.230 align:middle line:90%
We have to keep trying.

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:18.980 align:middle line:84%
We have to keep reaching
out, even to enemies

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:21.830 align:middle line:84%
and even to build
interfaith understanding,

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:23.589 align:middle line:90%
I'm big into that.

00:41:23.589 --> 00:41:25.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about one
of the greatest discoveries,

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:28.790 align:middle line:84%
I think, of all time,
the Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: My goodness,
the greatest discoveries

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:33.034 align:middle line:84%
happen when you
least expect them.

00:41:33.034 --> 00:41:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And you don't need
sensationalism, I always

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:38.570 align:middle line:90%
say, to find the sensational.

00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:40.220 align:middle line:84%
Sensational is all
around us, you just

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:41.570 align:middle line:90%
have to open your eyes.

00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:44.660 align:middle line:84%
Out of the blue, in the
middle of the 20th century,

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:48.590 align:middle line:84%
just around the formation or
the vote on the state of Israel,

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:53.150 align:middle line:84%
the same year, we've
got an Arab shepherd lad

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:56.372 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Muhammed
ed-Dib is his name.

00:41:56.372 --> 00:41:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In a cave,
goes in a cave.

00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: He's searching
around for a lost goat

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:03.980 align:middle line:84%
and goes into a cave and
finds this whole series

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:06.530 align:middle line:84%
of earthenware jars leaning
up against the cave wall

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:10.975 align:middle line:84%
in the inner, darkened recesses
and discovers the first of-- he

00:42:10.975 --> 00:42:12.100 align:middle line:90%
doesn't know what they are.

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:16.610 align:middle line:84%
He pulls out a series of wadded
up old, leathery parchments.

00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:17.600 align:middle line:90%
He can't read them.

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:18.500 align:middle line:90%
He speaks Arabic.

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:19.250 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't know Hebrew.

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:21.166 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're put
in little containers.

00:42:21.166 --> 00:42:23.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: They're in
jars, in clay jars,

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:26.160 align:middle line:84%
uncannily preserved
for 2,000 years.

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And he discovers the first
of this entire library

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:33.590 align:middle line:84%
from the days of Jesus and John
the Baptist and Herod the Great

00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:36.020 align:middle line:84%
and the Romans and this
whole cast of characters

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:39.890 align:middle line:84%
and they're 90%
of them in Hebrew.

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Hebrew, which is what
brings me into the mix.

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Hebrew hasn't changed in
2,000, even 3,000 years.

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:50.000 align:middle line:84%
I look at that Isaiah seal
and the Hezekiah seal,

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.580 align:middle line:84%
I can read that, because
this is the same language

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:54.290 align:middle line:90%
that we speak in Israel today.

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:57.320 align:middle line:84%
So I get up close and personal
with the Dead Sea Scrolls

00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:59.030 align:middle line:84%
and oh, yeah,
we're good friends,

00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:02.510 align:middle line:84%
the Scrolls and I. This
is Hebrew, and by the way,

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:05.044 align:middle line:84%
I think Jesus spoke
not just Aramaic,

00:43:05.044 --> 00:43:07.460 align:middle line:84%
I think he spoke Hebrew, too,
and I think he taught in it.

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And what an illumination on
this entire period that gave us

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:15.280 align:middle line:90%
Judaism, Christianity, Islam.

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We still
don't know everything

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:18.205 align:middle line:90%
about the Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:43:18.205 --> 00:43:19.760 align:middle line:90%


00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.160 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: There are
several different theories

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:26.050 align:middle line:10%
on the origin of these texts.

00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:29.260 align:middle line:10%
The predominating theory
is that the scrolls were

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:32.800 align:middle line:10%
the work of a Jewish
sect called the Essenes,

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:36.760 align:middle line:10%
who it is believed
resided in nearby Qumran

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:39.430 align:middle line:10%
and that the scrolls were
hidden away in the caves

00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:43.960 align:middle line:10%
to protect them from the
advancing Roman army.

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.570 align:middle line:10%
Other theories for the
writers of the scrolls

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:49.450 align:middle line:10%
include early Messianics,
or Christians,

00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:52.690 align:middle line:10%
or Zadokite priests.

00:43:52.690 --> 00:43:54.700 align:middle line:10%
A newer theory is
that the scrolls

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:58.090 align:middle line:10%
were from various libraries
and synagogues in Jerusalem

00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:00.010 align:middle line:10%
about 15 miles from the caves.

00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:03.825 align:middle line:90%


00:44:03.825 --> 00:44:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Fascinating.

00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:06.606 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No matter
what theory you

00:44:06.606 --> 00:44:08.180 align:middle line:90%
believe it's all fascinating.

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:10.054 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well, I did
my doctorate, actually,

00:44:10.054 --> 00:44:13.850 align:middle line:84%
in Dead Sea Scroll
research, and this continues

00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:17.030 align:middle line:84%
to be the number one
focus of everything I do,

00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:19.550 align:middle line:84%
but it leads in so many
different directions.

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Prior to that period, after that
period, all through history,

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:26.150 align:middle line:84%
we have this incredible
living legacy.

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is amazing work.

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:30.870 align:middle line:84%
Is it what the Bible is based
on, the Dead Sea Scrolls?

00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:33.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: These are the
earliest copies of the Hebrew

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:34.880 align:middle line:90%
Bible in all of the world.

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:37.370 align:middle line:84%
We have at least
fragments of each

00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:39.800 align:middle line:84%
and every book of
the Hebrew Bible,

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:42.300 align:middle line:84%
not New Testament, mind you,
but the Hebrew Bible, Genesis,

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:43.100 align:middle line:90%
Exodus--

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:44.724 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And does
this echo everything?

00:44:44.724 --> 00:44:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And we have
the entire scroll

00:44:46.490 --> 00:44:49.280 align:middle line:84%
of the book of the
prophet Isaiah,

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:52.670 align:middle line:84%
66 chapters long,
beginning to end,

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:54.440 align:middle line:90%
found in one of those caves.

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:57.380 align:middle line:84%
That is the centerpiece of
the whole collection, which

00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:02.120 align:middle line:84%
I've been in touch with many
times, seen it personally there

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:03.620 align:middle line:84%
in the Shrine of
the Book Museum.

00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, that dates to
around the second century

00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:10.400 align:middle line:84%
before the Common Era,
which is the oldest

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.350 align:middle line:90%
biblical text in the world.

00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:17.000 align:middle line:84%
But even that is a good five
centuries after the prophet

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.800 align:middle line:90%
himself lived.

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:23.660 align:middle line:84%
So you've got a gap of 500 years
from the days of the prophet

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:25.970 align:middle line:90%
Isaiah until the Isaiah scroll.

00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, we've got that little
tiny seal that is our smoking

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:32.510 align:middle line:90%
gun, if it's true--

00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:33.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If it's true.

00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:37.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: --that
will bridge that gap.

00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:39.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With the
scrolls, why is it

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:42.570 align:middle line:84%
so important to try
to decipher who wrote

00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:45.663 align:middle line:90%
them, who were the originators?

00:45:45.663 --> 00:45:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Ah, because that
will illumine everything

00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:53.880 align:middle line:84%
we know about this most seminal
period perhaps for the dawn

00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:55.480 align:middle line:90%
of Western culture.

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:58.710 align:middle line:90%
Were they Pharisee-type Jews?

00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:00.960 align:middle line:90%
Were they Sadducee-type Jews?

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:03.750 align:middle line:90%
Were they Essene-type Jews.

00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:07.770 align:middle line:84%
My own thinking, by the way, has
been shifting on all of this,

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:10.230 align:middle line:84%
and I'm more and
more seeing them

00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:16.050 align:middle line:84%
as descendants of an Essene-type
group, who themselves

00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:18.000 align:middle line:84%
were very much
into what we would

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.210 align:middle line:90%
call prophecy and mysticism.

00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:24.030 align:middle line:84%
That could be a
whole show in itself.

00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:26.071 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was a copper
scroll, wasn't there?

00:46:26.071 --> 00:46:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And a
great scroll written

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:32.360 align:middle line:84%
on pure, highly-refined
sheets of copper.

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's see that.

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:34.695 align:middle line:90%


00:46:34.695 --> 00:46:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: The copper scroll
is unique among the Dead Sea

00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:41.590 align:middle line:84%
Scrolls, because its text was
carved on a thin copper sheet.

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:44.470 align:middle line:84%
This method of writing was
common in the ancient world.

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:47.440 align:middle line:84%
However, such a large scroll
written in this manner

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:48.820 align:middle line:90%
is most unusual.

00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:51.970 align:middle line:10%
Because the copper scroll
was very badly corroded,

00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:55.360 align:middle line:10%
it remained untouched in
the central museum in Amman

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:56.600 align:middle line:10%
for four years.

00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:00.430 align:middle line:10%
Then in 1955, it was transferred
to the Manchester College

00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:02.500 align:middle line:10%
of Technology, where
a special device

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:05.290 align:middle line:10%
was designed by
Professor H. Wright Baker

00:47:05.290 --> 00:47:07.130 align:middle line:10%
to slice open the scroll.

00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:10.720 align:middle line:84%
The strips were later laid
side-by-side and photographed

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:12.310 align:middle line:90%
so that they could be studied.

00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:15.010 align:middle line:84%
The choice of the more
durable medium of copper

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:17.530 align:middle line:84%
may be explained by the
extraordinary nature

00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:18.730 align:middle line:90%
of its contents.

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:21.460 align:middle line:84%
The copper scroll
lists 64 places

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:24.420 align:middle line:84%
in which buried treasure
had been concealed.

00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Who it actually belonged
to and how it was amassed

00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:28.420 align:middle line:90%
is not known.

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Several attempts have been
made to locate and excavate

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:33.880 align:middle line:84%
the sites referred to
in the copper scroll,

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:37.360 align:middle line:84%
some supposedly being in
Jerusalem, others at Qumran

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:39.730 align:middle line:84%
and other sites in
the Judean desert.

00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:42.010 align:middle line:84%
One possible reason
why all these attempts

00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:44.350 align:middle line:84%
to find the treasure
have been unsuccessful

00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:47.470 align:middle line:84%
can be found in the last
lines of the copper scroll.

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:50.620 align:middle line:84%
They refer to another, so
far undiscovered, scroll,

00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:53.560 align:middle line:84%
which is supposed to more
fully explain the location

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:55.330 align:middle line:90%
and inventory of the treasures.

00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:58.270 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps this is not even
a list of real treasures

00:47:58.270 --> 00:48:00.580 align:middle line:90%
but merely a Utopian conception.

00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:01.472 align:middle line:90%


00:48:01.472 --> 00:48:02.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That is
amazing, isn't it?

00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:06.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Amazing, and to date,
not a trace of this treasure

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:09.860 align:middle line:84%
has ever come to light,
though there are people,

00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:12.380 align:middle line:84%
even as we speak, I
know a few of them

00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:15.350 align:middle line:84%
who think they have an idea
and are looking for it.

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there more Dead
Sea Scrolls out there possibly?

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:19.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: We never know.

00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:21.350 align:middle line:90%
That's the beauty of it.

00:48:21.350 --> 00:48:23.900 align:middle line:84%
It looks, to some,
like everything

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:26.550 align:middle line:84%
has been found that
might possibly be found,

00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:30.091 align:middle line:84%
and yet, when you least expect
it, something will pop up.

00:48:30.091 --> 00:48:32.090 align:middle line:84%
The Israeli government
has made several attempts

00:48:32.090 --> 00:48:35.300 align:middle line:84%
to find additional
scrolls and parchments

00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:38.150 align:middle line:84%
and very little
has been yielded.

00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:42.290 align:middle line:84%
But out of nowhere, we
have a Dead Sea Stone,

00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:45.710 align:middle line:84%
as it were, that surfaced
not too many years ago.

00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Again, totally
unexpected, that seems

00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:53.320 align:middle line:84%
to be a Dead Sea Scroll
written on stone,

00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:58.040 align:middle line:84%
that also has certain references
to a messianic figure who

00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:59.660 align:middle line:90%
will rise in three days.

00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:00.850 align:middle line:90%
Now go figure.

00:49:00.850 --> 00:49:01.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same thing.

00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:02.535 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Very interesting.

00:49:02.535 --> 00:49:03.535 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:49:03.535 --> 00:49:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Have all the Dead Sea
Scrolls that we have found

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:08.390 align:middle line:90%
been deciphered?

00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Yes and
no, because we've

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:13.910 align:middle line:84%
got among them, among the
complete scrolls that we have,

00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:16.730 align:middle line:84%
we've got tens upon tens
of thousands of teeny,

00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:19.310 align:middle line:84%
tiny little
fragments and pieces,

00:49:19.310 --> 00:49:23.120 align:middle line:84%
some of them no larger than a
thumbnail or a postage stamp.

00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Only recently, we have a
new document pieced together

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:30.020 align:middle line:84%
from 62 of these tiny
little fragments.

00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:32.880 align:middle line:84%
It's taken years and years
and years and years of work.

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:35.270 align:middle line:84%
This is the world's
biggest jigsaw puzzle.

00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And just recently,
within the last months,

00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:41.750 align:middle line:84%
this has come forth
as a new Dead Sea

00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Scroll that seems to indicate
a different type of calendar,

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:50.420 align:middle line:84%
a solar calendar, very
unusual in Judaism,

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:53.420 align:middle line:84%
and even lists a
couple of new feasts

00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:55.280 align:middle line:84%
that are not on
the Jewish calendar

00:49:55.280 --> 00:50:00.320 align:middle line:84%
today, the Feast of Oil, New
Oil and the Feast of New Wine

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:02.780 align:middle line:90%
and the Feast of New Wood.

00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And there's yet another
scroll, small document

00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:10.610 align:middle line:84%
that right now, we're
told, is being worked on,

00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:12.367 align:middle line:90%
has not yet been released.

00:50:12.367 --> 00:50:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That would be exciting.

00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:16.769 align:middle line:84%
When do you think the Dead Sea
Scrolls were actually made?

00:50:16.769 --> 00:50:17.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: We're talking--

00:50:17.810 --> 00:50:18.893 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What time period?

00:50:18.893 --> 00:50:20.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Also in dispute.

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:22.250 align:middle line:84%
One of my friends think
that they actually

00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:26.330 align:middle line:84%
date from the earliest Christian
period, the first century

00:50:26.330 --> 00:50:29.060 align:middle line:84%
of the Common Era,
first century AD.

00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:30.300 align:middle line:90%
I think they're earlier.

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:32.508 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think they're
before or after Christ?

00:50:32.508 --> 00:50:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Before, before.

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:35.881 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yet, they talk
about a Christ basically.

00:50:35.881 --> 00:50:38.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: They talk about
a teacher of righteousness

00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:43.820 align:middle line:84%
who will come and basically
a messianic figure, a teacher

00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:46.290 align:middle line:84%
of righteousness, by
the way, who was slain

00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:47.820 align:middle line:90%
and yet, who will come back.

00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it possible
that someone like Jesus

00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:54.590 align:middle line:84%
knew about the contents
of the Dead Sea Scrolls

00:50:54.590 --> 00:50:56.780 align:middle line:90%
and decided to act it out?

00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:59.090 align:middle line:84%
That it was like
a script for him

00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:01.120 align:middle line:84%
to become part of what
they were talking about?

00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Ah, and that also
dovetails with this Dead Sea

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:09.140 align:middle line:84%
Scroll in stone that talks about
this mysterious character who

00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:11.450 align:middle line:90%
will rise in three days.

00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:13.610 align:middle line:84%
We think that's the
right reading of it,

00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:15.350 align:middle line:90%
will rise in three days.

00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Is this perhaps a script that
the historical Jesus actually

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:25.160 align:middle line:84%
knew of and said, this
is going to actually come

00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:27.680 align:middle line:90%
to pass in myself?

00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking as a
Christian believer or not.

00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:34.040 align:middle line:84%
We're just scholars, but
that's entirely possible

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:37.340 align:middle line:84%
that there was this script
that Jesus was acting out.

00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:40.770 align:middle line:84%
This was a tradition that was in
place even for the past century

00:51:40.770 --> 00:51:41.570 align:middle line:90%
or more.

00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:42.736 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He played the part.

00:51:42.736 --> 00:51:44.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yes, prior to him.

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:46.300 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I'm the guy.

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:47.100 align:middle line:90%
Now is the time.

00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would be brilliant on
his part if that's the case.

00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:50.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Sure.

00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would
like to think of it

00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:54.140 align:middle line:84%
though as more
godly, wouldn't you?

00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:56.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well, I
tell you, there's

00:51:56.660 --> 00:52:00.410 align:middle line:84%
reason to believe that Jesus
had his own mystical side

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:03.170 align:middle line:84%
and was in tune along
with another group.

00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:07.580 align:middle line:84%
I like to identify him
with ancient Hasidic Jews.

00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:10.520 align:middle line:84%
We know of modern Hasidic
Jews with their black coats

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:11.930 align:middle line:90%
and black hats and side curls.

00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:14.430 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't realize there
was an ancient group of them

00:52:14.430 --> 00:52:18.920 align:middle line:84%
as well who called
God my Father.

00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- in Judaism,
we call this chutzpah.

00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:27.900 align:middle line:84%
It's like brazen effrontery
to call God my Father.

00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:30.080 align:middle line:90%
We don't say that, but they did.

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:33.800 align:middle line:84%
They had that kind of intimate
connection with the divine.

00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, Jesus
uses the same words

00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:38.600 align:middle line:90%
in his own mouth, my Father.

00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:43.520 align:middle line:84%
I place him in the league with
those ancient Hasidic Jews,

00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:47.540 align:middle line:84%
who were definitely seeking
for this divine connection.

00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:51.080 align:middle line:84%
There are stories of divine
healings going forth from some

00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:52.550 align:middle line:90%
of these ancient characters.

00:52:52.550 --> 00:52:55.340 align:middle line:84%
One of them, we're told,
could even bring rain.

00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:57.080 align:middle line:84%
He would stand in
a circle and refuse

00:52:57.080 --> 00:53:00.760 align:middle line:84%
to move from it until it
rained during a drought,

00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:02.500 align:middle line:90%
and sure enough, it rained.

00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:04.790 align:middle line:90%
And this is before Jesus.

00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:06.730 align:middle line:84%
So Jesus was not
the only one who

00:53:06.730 --> 00:53:10.980 align:middle line:84%
had this kind of, shall we
call it Kabbalistic or--

00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:11.310 align:middle line:90%


00:53:11.310 --> 00:53:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Knowledge?

00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:14.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: --mystical yeah--
mystical side to him.

00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:16.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ken, exactly
what is the Torah?

00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And I understand you have
a little surprise for us.

00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: It gets awkwardly
translated as "the law,"

00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:25.840 align:middle line:84%
but actually, the word itself
in Hebrew means "the teaching."

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:27.220 align:middle line:90%
It's a verbal noun.

00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:28.450 align:middle line:90%
It's how to.

00:53:28.450 --> 00:53:29.440 align:middle line:90%
It's a how to book.

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:31.780 align:middle line:90%
How to live rightly, justly.

00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:33.047 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it their Bible?

00:53:33.047 --> 00:53:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: It's the
heart of the Bible.

00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:36.730 align:middle line:84%
The Bible for Jews
consists of the Torah,

00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:39.640 align:middle line:84%
that is the books of Moses,
Genesis through Deuteronomy,

00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:40.720 align:middle line:90%
the Pentateuch.

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:43.480 align:middle line:84%
It's just the Jewish
word for Pentateuch.

00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, the
prophets, that's

00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Isaiah and his whole gang, and
then assorted writings, psalms,

00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:50.780 align:middle line:90%
proverbs, and so on.

00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And all together,
it's what Christians

00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:56.050 align:middle line:84%
call the Old Testament,
what Jews call the Tanakh,

00:53:56.050 --> 00:53:59.627 align:middle line:84%
but at the heart of it
is the Torah, the law.

00:53:59.627 --> 00:54:01.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look
at what you brought us.

00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:02.694 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Absolutely.

00:54:02.694 --> 00:54:05.122 align:middle line:90%


00:54:05.122 --> 00:54:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, through
the magic of television,

00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:10.380 align:middle line:84%
we have brought you
a 200-year-old Torah

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:13.380 align:middle line:84%
that Dr. Ken Hanson is
going to talk with us about.

00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Ken, this is magnificent, and
the feel of this parchment,

00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:18.240 align:middle line:90%
what is this?

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:19.860 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: This is called vellum.

00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:22.410 align:middle line:84%
It's the skin of
a kosher animal.

00:54:22.410 --> 00:54:27.310 align:middle line:84%
It can be cow, sheep,
deer, even reindeer,

00:54:27.310 --> 00:54:30.420 align:middle line:84%
as long as it's a kosher animal
and it cannot be killed just

00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:32.130 align:middle line:90%
for its skin.

00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:38.370 align:middle line:84%
But the animal is slaughtered
ritually for eating purposes,

00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:40.440 align:middle line:90%
and then the skin is taken.

00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:46.590 align:middle line:84%
It's soaked in a solution of
lime, lime solution for some 18

00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:51.400 align:middle line:84%
days and then brought out and
cut into individual pieces.

00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:54.102 align:middle line:84%
Each one called a [HEBREW]
and then sewn together.

00:54:54.102 --> 00:54:55.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sewn together.

00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And this was composed
about two centuries ago,

00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:00.720 align:middle line:90%
about two centuries ago.

00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:03.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, the original
Torah is thousands of years old.

00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:05.640 align:middle line:84%
So why is this
only 200 years old?

00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:07.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Which, of
course, we don't have,

00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:10.534 align:middle line:84%
because our texts only go back
as far as the Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:55:10.534 --> 00:55:11.866 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So this is the copy of.

00:55:11.866 --> 00:55:13.885 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: So copy of
copy of copy of copy,

00:55:13.885 --> 00:55:15.010 align:middle line:90%
and that's the way it goes.

00:55:15.010 --> 00:55:16.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who made it?

00:55:16.110 --> 00:55:19.724 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: An anonymous scribe
living somewhere in Ukraine.

00:55:19.724 --> 00:55:21.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It might have taken
him forever to do this.

00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: It takes about--

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
all done by hand.

00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: It takes
about three years

00:55:25.410 --> 00:55:31.410 align:middle line:84%
to write one of these entirely
by hand, three years of labor.

00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And every letter must be
written exactly perfectly.

00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:39.090 align:middle line:84%
If a mistake is
found anywhere, it

00:55:39.090 --> 00:55:40.650 align:middle line:90%
can be corrected, one letter.

00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:43.720 align:middle line:84%
If a second mistake is found,
it can also be corrected.

00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:46.470 align:middle line:84%
There's a little stylus used
to shave it off and write

00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:47.580 align:middle line:90%
in the correct letter.

00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:51.000 align:middle line:84%
If three mistakes are found,
three strikes and you're out.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:51.801 align:middle line:90%
The whole thing--

00:55:51.801 --> 00:55:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is gone.

00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:54.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: You have to
start all over again.

00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the text has
remained remarkably stable

00:55:58.770 --> 00:56:00.700 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:03.867 align:middle line:84%
Even the Dead Sea Scrolls,
it's almost word-for-word

00:56:03.867 --> 00:56:05.450 align:middle line:84%
identical to what
has come down to us.

00:56:05.450 --> 00:56:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, it's amazing.

00:56:06.010 --> 00:56:06.810 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:56:06.810 --> 00:56:08.730 align:middle line:90%
Now, look, I'm a Roman Catholic.

00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:10.170 align:middle line:90%
You're Jewish.

00:56:10.170 --> 00:56:12.630 align:middle line:84%
Why are we wearing
yarmulkes right now?

00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well, we want to,
according to Jewish tradition,

00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:20.160 align:middle line:84%
recognize that the divine
is above all of us.

00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And we have to pay due
respect to that reality.

00:56:24.330 --> 00:56:28.210 align:middle line:84%
We are who we are,
and God is above.

00:56:28.210 --> 00:56:32.760 align:middle line:84%
So we cover our heads out
of respect and deference

00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:38.430 align:middle line:84%
and especially reading the
divine word, the divine Torah.

00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ken, we have a
couple of minutes left.

00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Just give us a little highlight
of what some of this means.

00:56:44.130 --> 00:56:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: I have
this open to what

00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:50.020 align:middle line:84%
is my favorite part
of the entire Torah.

00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Of course, Isaiah
talked about the Torah.

00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:54.570 align:middle line:84%
He said "out of Zion
shall go forth the Torah."

00:56:54.570 --> 00:56:57.106 align:middle line:90%
[SPEAKING HEBREW], right?

00:56:57.106 --> 00:56:58.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've got this open
to my favorite part.

00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:02.130 align:middle line:84%
This is the middle of
the Book of Exodus.

00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:04.410 align:middle line:84%
This is the crossing
of the Red Sea.

00:57:04.410 --> 00:57:05.965 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you can read this?

00:57:05.965 --> 00:57:06.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Absolutely.

00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:08.048 align:middle line:90%
Of course, I lived in Israel.

00:57:08.048 --> 00:57:12.084 align:middle line:84%
So any modern Israeli can
get up close and personal

00:57:12.084 --> 00:57:14.500 align:middle line:84%
and cuddle up with this text
and read it like a newspaper.

00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Talks about the
parting of the Red Sea.

00:57:15.570 --> 00:57:16.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Parting
of the Red Sea.

00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And every Torah
everywhere in the world

00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:20.880 align:middle line:84%
is written with the same
three-column calligraphy

00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:22.040 align:middle line:90%
right at this point.

00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the
Israelites passing

00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:27.490 align:middle line:84%
through the parted
waters of the Red Sea.

00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:31.810 align:middle line:84%
See the way it's written here
in this beautiful artsy manner?

00:57:31.810 --> 00:57:35.150 align:middle line:84%
So here we have
what the text says.

00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, I cannot touch
the text itself.

00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:38.820 align:middle line:90%
It's divine.

00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:39.750 align:middle line:90%
It's a holy text.

00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you can
touch it with this.

00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: So a special
instrument called a [HEBREW]..

00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:44.670 align:middle line:90%
It means "a hand."

00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:46.140 align:middle line:90%
can be used as a pointer.

00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:50.130 align:middle line:84%
It has to be made of a very fine
metal, silver, in this case.

00:57:50.130 --> 00:57:51.150 align:middle line:90%
And we read--

00:57:51.150 --> 00:57:52.690 align:middle line:90%
[SPEAKING HEBREW]

00:57:52.690 --> 00:57:54.660 align:middle line:90%


00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And so Moses and the children
of Israel sang this song.

00:57:59.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And what was the
song that they sang?

00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:02.490 align:middle line:90%
[SPEAKING HEBREW]

00:58:02.490 --> 00:58:04.500 align:middle line:90%


00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:08.790 align:middle line:84%
I will sing to the
Lord, to the eternal,

00:58:08.790 --> 00:58:10.580 align:middle line:90%
for He has greatly triumphed.

00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:11.907 align:middle line:90%
This is at the Red Sea now.

00:58:11.907 --> 00:58:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's parted
it by this point?

00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:14.290 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:15.650 align:middle line:90%
[SPEAKING HEBREW]

00:58:15.650 --> 00:58:16.710 align:middle line:90%


00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Famous passage, the
horse and the rider

00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:21.330 align:middle line:90%
are cast into the sea.

00:58:21.330 --> 00:58:22.729 align:middle line:84%
And you see the
waters of the sea

00:58:22.729 --> 00:58:24.270 align:middle line:84%
open, the Israelites
passing through.

00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:25.853 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Boy, that's
an amazing story,

00:58:25.853 --> 00:58:29.790 align:middle line:84%
and you know they have found
remnants of chariots in the Red

00:58:29.790 --> 00:58:32.670 align:middle line:90%
Sea, that is unbelievable.

00:58:32.670 --> 00:58:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: The archeology
is all over this area,

00:58:35.250 --> 00:58:38.280 align:middle line:84%
and it's a story
in its own right.

00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And also contested,
I should add,

00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:41.970 align:middle line:84%
because our
minimalist friends say

00:58:41.970 --> 00:58:43.860 align:middle line:90%
there probably was no exodus.

00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:46.560 align:middle line:90%
Well, we'll get into that.

00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the parting of
the sea itself, a lot of people

00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:55.230 align:middle line:84%
have said that there was some
kind of climatological event

00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:56.214 align:middle line:90%
that changed it.

00:58:56.214 --> 00:58:57.630 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
really happened?

00:58:57.630 --> 00:58:58.430 align:middle line:90%
Come on now.

00:58:58.430 --> 00:59:02.700 align:middle line:84%
You mean, a guy actually
stood up, waved his staff,

00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:05.540 align:middle line:90%
and the sea divided.

00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And then the Egyptians
came rushing through.

00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:11.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: The
chronology is key here.

00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:14.720 align:middle line:84%
We'd have to really go into
depth about the chronology.

00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:15.770 align:middle line:90%
When did it happen?

00:59:15.770 --> 00:59:21.200 align:middle line:84%
Did it happen in the
1200s BC or the 1400s BC?

00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:23.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm shifting my mind
on that, as well,

00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:25.100 align:middle line:84%
and going earlier
in the chronology,

00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:29.720 align:middle line:84%
because there was a terrific
cataclysm that took place

00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:34.480 align:middle line:84%
in the Mediterranean Sea on the
island we call today Santorini,

00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:38.090 align:middle line:84%
a massive volcanic
eruption, 10 times more

00:59:38.090 --> 00:59:40.460 align:middle line:84%
powerful than
Krakatoa that would

00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:44.630 align:middle line:84%
have sent unbelievable tsunamis
all across the Mediterranean.

00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:47.060 align:middle line:84%
Would have darkened
the sky, caused

00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:48.120 align:middle line:90%
meteorological phenomena.

00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:48.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:51.110 align:middle line:84%
They think Atlantis
may have been there.

00:59:51.110 --> 00:59:53.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Yes, I've been
to Santorini many times,

00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:56.450 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure, in fact,
that this is the origin

00:59:56.450 --> 00:59:57.920 align:middle line:90%
of the story of Atlantis.

00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:00.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So his
timing was perfect.

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well, it
could be, depending

01:00:02.090 --> 01:00:04.100 align:middle line:90%
on when we date that explosion.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:04.950 align:middle line:90%
We're working on it.

01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:07.310 align:middle line:84%
It's very complex
stuff that we're into,

01:00:07.310 --> 01:00:10.370 align:middle line:84%
but that kind of
event could certainly

01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:13.430 align:middle line:84%
have produced the cataclysm
that we're talking about when

01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:14.480 align:middle line:90%
it comes to the exodus.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ken, that's fantastic.

01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:17.999 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for being
on the program.

01:00:17.999 --> 01:00:19.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: It's wonderful.

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:20.750 align:middle line:10%
It's exciting.

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:22.020 align:middle line:10%
That's what I live for.

01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:23.615 align:middle line:90%
It's in the blood.

01:00:23.615 --> 01:00:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is an amazing
artifact, It really is.

01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that I'm so close
actually touching and holding

01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:32.320 align:middle line:84%
the Torah, even though this
one is only 200 years old,

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:33.120 align:middle line:90%
is amazing.

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:33.470 align:middle line:90%
It truly is.

01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Just a baby, right?

01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:37.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But end times
prophecy, biblical

01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:41.270 align:middle line:84%
prophecy has fascinated me
since I was a little boy.

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:42.770 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of scary
when you think

01:00:42.770 --> 01:00:46.110 align:middle line:84%
about the Book of Revelation
and what could happen.

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:50.980 align:middle line:10%
Let's hope that it's hundreds of
years away but even then, Ken,

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:52.520 align:middle line:10%
I don't wish it on anybody.

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
