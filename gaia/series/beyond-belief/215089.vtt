>>GEORGE NOORY: You're going
to love this Beyond Belief

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.620 align:middle line:90%
episode with Simeon Hein.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.540 align:middle line:10%
He has a PhD in sociology
with an emphasis in statistics

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.050 align:middle line:10%
and research methods.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.970 align:middle line:10%
He's been teaching
remote viewing since 1997

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.860 align:middle line:10%
and is the author of
Dark Matter Monsters.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.890 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Simeon.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:36.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMEON HEIN: Hi, George.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.470 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me here.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great book, by the way.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Oh, thanks very much.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How have you been?

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.180 align:middle line:90%
What's new?

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Well, George, after
doing Dark Matter Monsters,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.580 align:middle line:84%
I've been attending a
lot of Bigfoot events,

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.710 align:middle line:84%
conferences, even
some Bigfoot outings

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.370 align:middle line:84%
to learn more about this
fascinating and really,

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.250 align:middle line:90%
for me, unexpected subject.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.277 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What got you
interested in this?

00:00:59.277 --> 00:01:01.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: George, it was really
my remote viewing students

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.200 align:middle line:90%
right here in nearby Boulder.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.800 align:middle line:84%
I've been teaching there
since the late '90s.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.300 align:middle line:10%
And my RV students, the
natives to Colorado especially,

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.870 align:middle line:10%
would tell me about
their encounters

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.367 align:middle line:10%
with Biggie, the
big guy out there.

00:01:16.367 --> 00:01:17.575 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you believe them?

00:01:17.575 --> 00:01:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: It took
a couple decades.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm kind of thick.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It takes time.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.702 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: It takes a while.

00:01:22.702 --> 00:01:23.780 align:middle line:90%
I heard these stories.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.290 align:middle line:10%
And I couldn't quite think
how that would fit in

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.590 align:middle line:10%
with these other topics until I
began to see patterns, patterns

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.070 align:middle line:10%
in the witnesses.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.050 align:middle line:84%
When I would go to
these conferences,

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.610 align:middle line:90%
I would talk to witnesses.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Some of these people had
never spoken to anyone

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.640 align:middle line:84%
before about their
sightings, their encounters.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.960 align:middle line:84%
So it really drew me in because
I started seeing parallels

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.950 align:middle line:84%
with other types of
paranormal phenomena

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.075 align:middle line:90%
that was really unexpected.

00:01:52.075 --> 00:01:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell me about the book.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: I really decided I had
to write this book because it

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.840 align:middle line:84%
seemed to me, looking across
the various types of topics

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.360 align:middle line:84%
that I'd been studying, there
were some common phenomena

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.370 align:middle line:84%
that I felt really needed to be
discussed-- the orbs that people

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.980 align:middle line:84%
encounter in different types
of paranormal situations.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.010 align:middle line:84%
I was really
surprised to find that

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.330 align:middle line:90%
in people's Bigfoot sightings.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.820 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes they would
only see the orbs.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.850 align:middle line:84%
They'd see the creatures
come out of the orbs

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.010 align:middle line:84%
or go back into orbs,
cases of time loss,

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.858 align:middle line:84%
and, especially, George,
battery and camera failure.

00:02:36.858 --> 00:02:38.900 align:middle line:84%
How many times you've
interviewed so many people?

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:39.733 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:02:39.733 --> 00:02:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: You see this
in ghost sightings.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.430 align:middle line:84%
We saw it in crop circles
with our own equipment.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.950 align:middle line:84%
To hear it from these
witnesses, some of whom

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.620 align:middle line:84%
live right here in Colorado,
to hear about their cameras,

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.330 align:middle line:84%
their iPhones going
on the fritz--

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Zap.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Exactly.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.950 align:middle line:84%
I knew there had to be an
electromagnetic component

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.710 align:middle line:84%
to Bigfoot and some of
these cryptids because

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.360 align:middle line:84%
of the amounts of camera
failure, battery failure, blurry

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.160 align:middle line:90%
photos.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.490 align:middle line:90%
You know the deal.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Explain
what cold fusion is.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.505 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a reason
for this question.

00:03:09.505 --> 00:03:12.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Yeah, well,
cold fusion is

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.980 align:middle line:84%
the name given to this
low-energy nuclear process.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.400 align:middle line:84%
It's now called LENR,
Low-Energy Nuclear Reaction.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.780 align:middle line:84%
It was discovered by
Fleischmann and Pons

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.340 align:middle line:84%
at the University
of Utah in 1989.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, there was no
explanation for how it worked,

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.600 align:middle line:90%
what was going on.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.250 align:middle line:84%
They received, as you know, a
lot of criticism and hostility

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.150 align:middle line:90%
and had to leave the country.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.590 align:middle line:84%
But now we know from
much more experimentation

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.240 align:middle line:84%
from many countries that
it's a real phenomena.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.720 align:middle line:84%
It's not always so
easy to sustain,

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.670 align:middle line:84%
though some people,
Alexander Pakhomov,

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.430 align:middle line:84%
have gotten that reaction
going for up to four months.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.940 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be driven
by microball lightning.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And that comes from the research
of Japanese researcher Takaaki

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.360 align:middle line:90%
Matsumoto.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Again, we see microball
lightning orbs

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.730 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of these
different phenomena

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.605 align:middle line:84%
that we've been talking
about over the years.

00:04:05.605 --> 00:04:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does that flow into
Bigfoot and other phenomena?

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Well, you get this orb
phenomena around Sasquatch.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.600 align:middle line:84%
You get it around
other cryptids.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And the researchers looking
at these LENR reactions,

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.410 align:middle line:84%
these so-called cold
fusion reactions,

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.450 align:middle line:84%
would see this microball
lightning under a microscope.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.470 align:middle line:84%
I think it's actually the same
phenomena at a different scale.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And in cold fusion, it
generates excess heat.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.070 align:middle line:84%
The trick, obviously, is to
get it to be a closed loop

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.250 align:middle line:90%
to sustain itself.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.300 align:middle line:84%
But I think that Bigfoot and
some of these other creatures

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.850 align:middle line:84%
are generating the
intense amounts of energy

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.430 align:middle line:84%
that they have available to
them from microball lightning--

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.030 align:middle line:84%
the overall name for it,
George, is coherent manner.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.380 align:middle line:84%
It seems that they're
tapping into that somehow

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.160 align:middle line:90%
at a quantum level.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same
reason cold fusion

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.460 align:middle line:90%
generates the excess heat.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.043 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's
a connection there.

00:05:04.043 --> 00:05:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's an ape that
is primarily down in Florida

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.335 align:middle line:90%
called the Gigantopithecus.

00:05:09.335 --> 00:05:10.945 align:middle line:84%
What do we know
about this creature?

00:05:10.945 --> 00:05:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Oh, the skunk ape,
yeah, in Southern Florida.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.710 align:middle line:84%
So, George, the amazing thing
about the Bigfoot species

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.360 align:middle line:84%
is there are so many
different types of them,

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.960 align:middle line:84%
all the way from
Southern Florida

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.512 align:middle line:90%
to Alaska, into Russia and--

00:05:26.512 --> 00:05:27.595 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To the Himalayas.

00:05:27.595 --> 00:05:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Himalayas,
Europe, other parts--

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.680 align:middle line:90%
Southeast Asia.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.750 align:middle line:90%
They all have the--

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:33.550 align:middle line:90%
China.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.150 align:middle line:84%
They all have their own
names for this creature.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.150 align:middle line:84%
But the amazing thing is to go
from the skunk ape in Florida

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.220 align:middle line:84%
to the types of Bigfoot
that you have in Alaska,

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.340 align:middle line:84%
there is so much variation,
it's almost hard to comprehend.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.390 align:middle line:84%
It is much variation
in Bigfoot as there

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.150 align:middle line:84%
are in humans in different
parts of the Earth.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:59.110 align:middle line:84%
The Gigantopithecus is an idea
that some anthropologists had

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.560 align:middle line:90%
back in the '80s.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.900 align:middle line:84%
I was very physically
close to one of these.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.770 align:middle line:84%
It was Grover Krantz in
the anthropology department

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.930 align:middle line:84%
at WSU, where I went
to school and got

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.860 align:middle line:90%
my PhD in Pullman, Washington.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.040 align:middle line:84%
He believed that Bigfoot
was a Gigantopithecus.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.020 align:middle line:90%
This is--

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.045 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A skunk ape.

00:06:15.045 --> 00:06:18.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: It's a type of ape that
there's no evidence it actually

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.950 align:middle line:90%
made its way to North America.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.620 align:middle line:84%
But it was discovered in
China millions of years ago.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And there were these
ideas that maybe

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:27.900 align:middle line:90%
came across the Bering Straits.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.355 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did it look like?

00:06:29.355 --> 00:06:33.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: That was a huge ape
that walked on all fours.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.640 align:middle line:84%
There's no evidence that
it walked on two legs.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And of course, as you know,
George, a lot of the witnesses

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.610 align:middle line:90%
describe Bigfoot only--

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it does go
down on all fours,

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.375 align:middle line:84%
but they describe it
walking on two legs.

00:06:47.375 --> 00:06:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you
know you're probably

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000 align:middle line:90%
not dealing with an ape.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.180 align:middle line:84%
It's my belief that this is much
more closely related to a human

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.000 align:middle line:90%
than to an ape.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.762 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is he the missing link?

00:06:58.762 --> 00:07:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: I don't know if
Bigfoot is the missing link.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.340 align:middle line:84%
It seems that Bigfoot
is one of our relatives

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.700 align:middle line:84%
in the distant past,
almost as if we

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.610 align:middle line:84%
were the same species
perhaps millions of years ago

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.860 align:middle line:84%
and diverged in
different directions.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And we went in a technological
direction, Homo sapiens.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.560 align:middle line:84%
But Bigfoot seems to have
gone into a direction

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.280 align:middle line:90%
of being close to nature.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And this would
explain why they have

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.350 align:middle line:84%
these abilities,
natural telepathy.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, many of us have to take
classes to learn telepathy,

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:33.430 align:middle line:90%
remote viewing.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Bigfoot seems to know
how to do this naturally.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.560 align:middle line:90%
Incredible strength, speeds.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most
fascinating aspects of Bigfoot

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.660 align:middle line:84%
is their ability to
become invisible.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was really amazed talking
to so many different witnesses

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.853 align:middle line:84%
to hear the same accounts
of the invisibility.

00:07:49.853 --> 00:07:52.020 align:middle line:84%
These people couldn't believe
what they were seeing.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:56.630 align:middle line:84%
They literally see this ape,
human-like creature, huge.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And like a sheet of light
comes down like sparkly--

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Weird.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: --lights.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.395 align:middle line:90%
And they're gone.

00:08:02.395 --> 00:08:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jim Myers heads up
a museum called the Sasquatch

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:07.740 align:middle line:90%
Outpost.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.420 align:middle line:90%
It's in Bailey, Colorado.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.747 align:middle line:90%
What do we know about this?

00:08:10.747 --> 00:08:13.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Well, it's interesting
you mention that, George,

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.710 align:middle line:84%
because this was one of the
synchronicities that led

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:17.190 align:middle line:90%
me to go off in this direction.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:18.980 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine in
Boulder had told me

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.245 align:middle line:84%
about this Sasquatch
Outpost in Bailey.

00:08:21.245 --> 00:08:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And I just happened to be going
through there with a friend one

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:24.710 align:middle line:90%
day, Bailey.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.568 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her, why don't we
just go this direction in town,

00:08:27.568 --> 00:08:29.610 align:middle line:84%
take a left instead of
going back in the highway?

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's probably
only one museum there.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: There's only
one museum there.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.330 align:middle line:90%
So we're going along.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
she said, look,

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:38.130 align:middle line:84%
it's a huge Bigfoot on the side
of the wall of that building.

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And we looked and said, that
must be the museum that people

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:42.440 align:middle line:90%
had been telling me about.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.560 align:middle line:90%
And I hadn't visited.

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.360 align:middle line:90%
So we went in.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And I was amazed to see that
just a few miles from us,

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.230 align:middle line:84%
George, in the Rockies,
people were having encounters.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.150 align:middle line:90%
They had a map there.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And all these little dots where
the sightings had taken place.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.582 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like the
scales fell from my eyes.

00:08:58.582 --> 00:09:00.040 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
I realized Bigfoot

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.990 align:middle line:84%
wasn't some creature
that was just

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:03.550 align:middle line:84%
in some remote
part of Washington

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:04.910 align:middle line:90%
State in the Cascades.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.730 align:middle line:84%
It was all over the
Rockies and, as I

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:09.230 align:middle line:84%
learned, all over the United
States, Canada, and so forth.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:12.080 align:middle line:84%
But there was that map
with the footprints,

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.040 align:middle line:84%
the sightings, the howling
sounds that had been heard,

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.250 align:middle line:90%
and the tree structures.

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.292 align:middle line:84%
And it was all up and down
the front range, which

00:09:18.292 --> 00:09:19.790 align:middle line:90%
is just a few miles from us.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Simeon, on a
previous Beyond Belief show,

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.380 align:middle line:90%
I had Jim Myers on.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And he took us around to
the Sasquatch outpost.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:30.549 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at what
you are referring to.

00:09:30.549 --> 00:09:34.042 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:34.042 --> 00:09:45.519 align:middle line:90%


00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:47.730 align:middle line:10%
>>JIM MYERS: So
we're about to enter

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.760 align:middle line:10%
the inner sanctum of the
Sasquatch Outpost, which

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.250 align:middle line:10%
is the Sasquatch Encounter
Discovery Museum.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.240 align:middle line:84%
So if you come with
me, we'll head on in.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:08.210 align:middle line:90%


00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:12.190 align:middle line:84%
This is something that we
found back in about 2013.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:15.210 align:middle line:84%
I found a set of elk tracks
where the elk was actually

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:16.210 align:middle line:90%
running.

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And it was defecating as it ran,
which I thought was unusual.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.570 align:middle line:84%
I followed the
tracks until I came

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:25.980 align:middle line:84%
upon this imprint of an
elk's body in the snow,

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.400 align:middle line:90%
like an elk stamp.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:31.240 align:middle line:10%
It's like it was running and it
hit the snow and stopped dead.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.890 align:middle line:10%
And I could see the legs.

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:34.600 align:middle line:10%
I could see the neck, the head.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.920 align:middle line:10%
This elk did not move
once it hit the snow.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Then we noticed
another set of tracks

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.780 align:middle line:84%
coming from a different
direction that

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.080 align:middle line:84%
were 10 to 12 feet
apart with every stride.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And the two sets of tracks
converged right here,

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:52.610 align:middle line:90%
where this elk was in the snow.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And then the big
tracks just carried on.

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And our assumption is this
elk was somehow knocked down

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:02.310 align:middle line:84%
by a Sasquatch, which then
picked it up and carried it off,

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:05.760 align:middle line:84%
which is probably 400 or
500 pounds dead weight.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Given that there were no elk
tracks leaving this location,

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.180 align:middle line:84%
the only explanation
we could come up with

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.850 align:middle line:84%
is that it was picked
up and carried off.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:17.570 align:middle line:84%
The easiest way to know if
Sasquatch is active in an area

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:20.910 align:middle line:84%
is looking for what
they do with trees.

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And tree breaks is the most
common one that we find,

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:27.620 align:middle line:84%
where trees are broken
and left hanging always

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.580 align:middle line:84%
the same way; or
tree arches, which

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:35.000 align:middle line:84%
are trees that are bent over
and then stuck in the ground

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.260 align:middle line:84%
or stuck under another tree
to keep this arch shape.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I've seen these
up to 15 feet high, coming down

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.620 align:middle line:84%
and then stuck in the
ground, maybe a foot

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.760 align:middle line:90%
to keep that tree bent.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.130 align:middle line:90%
These are classic signs.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And I find them everywhere
I go in Colorado.

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:56.720 align:middle line:10%
This is the map that we've had
since we started the museum.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And every pin on
here is a story.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And every story was told
to myself or my wife.

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:06.740 align:middle line:84%
The red ones are actual visual
sightings of a Sasquatch.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.910 align:middle line:84%
The yellow ones have to do with
some kind of a tree structure

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.270 align:middle line:90%
like we spoke about.

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:13.570 align:middle line:90%
Black are footprints.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Green is some kind
of a vocalization,

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:21.070 align:middle line:84%
and blue is an object that was
thrown at someone while they

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.340 align:middle line:90%
were out hiking.

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.820 align:middle line:90%
So this is the whole state.

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.680 align:middle line:90%
This is Bailey right here.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.170 align:middle line:84%
But there were so many
sightings in Bailey,

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:34.720 align:middle line:84%
I had to blow it up and create a
second map just of the activity

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.630 align:middle line:90%
around here.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:39.740 align:middle line:84%
So you can see, I think there's
over 300 pins on the map.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And again, this
is just people who

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:44.580 align:middle line:84%
have talked to me
about their sightings.

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.300 align:middle line:84%
So imagine how many
other people have

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:48.935 align:middle line:90%
seen a Sasquatch in Colorado.

00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:51.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You got to become
a believer after listening

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.430 align:middle line:90%
to Jim Myers talking about it.

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: It's
absolutely fascinating.

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:56.685 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it amazing
to see that map?

00:12:56.685 --> 00:12:57.810 align:middle line:90%
He's done such a great job.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.060 align:middle line:90%
And you go in that museum.

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And you see the different
types of faces and heads

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:02.970 align:middle line:90%
that the Sasquatch have.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And then he has that scale
model that you saw here.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.900 align:middle line:90%
You realize how tall they are.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:10.650 align:middle line:90%
They would go up to the ceiling.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:14.000 align:middle line:84%
You realize why people
have a sense of PTSD

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:14.840 align:middle line:90%
after they've seen--

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.495 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, something,
Simeon, is going on.

00:13:16.495 --> 00:13:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Oh, no.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's no
doubt about that.

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:19.503 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: No doubt about it.

00:13:19.503 --> 00:13:20.760 align:middle line:90%
No, it's definitely going on.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was something that I
wasn't even aware of, even

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.543 align:middle line:90%
living in this area.

00:13:24.543 --> 00:13:26.460 align:middle line:84%
Because I'll tell you
what's going on, George.

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.418 align:middle line:84%
The witnesses are often
afraid, just like they

00:13:29.418 --> 00:13:30.335 align:middle line:90%
are in other subjects.

00:13:30.335 --> 00:13:30.965 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They'll be ridiculed.

00:13:30.965 --> 00:13:31.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Exactly.

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.830 align:middle line:84%
People don't like being
attacked, ridiculed,

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:38.430 align:middle line:84%
laughed at, especially by
colleagues where they work.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.040 align:middle line:84%
So they just don't
talk about it.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.740 align:middle line:84%
They talk about it
to people like me

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.610 align:middle line:84%
because they know
I'm nonjudgmental.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:46.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm already interested
in these crazy topics,

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.400 align:middle line:84%
but they won't talk about
it to people they know.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.742 align:middle line:84%
So these stories are
really suppressed.

00:13:51.742 --> 00:13:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Jim's
referring to there.

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:55.690 align:middle line:84%
He said there's probably
a lot more dots that

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:58.190 align:middle line:84%
could be on that map, but people
haven't told their stories.

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you hear many
stories of missing time

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.600 align:middle line:90%
associated with Bigfoot?

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.410 align:middle line:90%
What do you hear?

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:03.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yeah.

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:04.100 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:05.110 align:middle line:90%
I had a friend.

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And Jim mentioned objects being
thrown at people in the woods.

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:11.540 align:middle line:84%
This person was hiking in the
Rocky Mountains with a friend,

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:16.270 align:middle line:84%
and a huge rock came out of
the bushes going horizontally

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:17.960 align:middle line:90%
right between them.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I don't think
they're trying to hit him.

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: No, they were
just saying, we're here.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:23.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Getting his attention.

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Here's a rock coming,
a big, bowling ball-sized rock

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:27.580 align:middle line:90%
coming right through.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:30.340 align:middle line:84%
That same person-- it's
interesting you mentioned that.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.010 align:middle line:84%
She described going for
a hike with a friend up

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:34.640 align:middle line:90%
in the same area.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.872 align:middle line:90%
And she didn't see a Sasquatch.

00:14:36.872 --> 00:14:38.580 align:middle line:84%
But all of a sudden,
they find themselves

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:41.620 align:middle line:84%
back in the parking lot,
missing about an hour of time.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.870 align:middle line:90%
And it's getting dark.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:44.170 align:middle line:90%
And they can't explain it.

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And people who have
encountered Sasquatch sometimes

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:50.160 align:middle line:84%
talk about all of
a sudden, they look

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.650 align:middle line:84%
at their watch and four
or five hours have gone by

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:54.100 align:middle line:84%
and it's like they don't
know where the time--

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:54.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
know where the time--

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: They've been standing
in the same position.

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.150 align:middle line:90%
It's not even like they're sore.

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:00.190 align:middle line:90%
It's just like time moved.

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:01.060 align:middle line:90%
It's very strange.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:04.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
Sasquatch Genome Project?

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: The Sasquatch Genome
Project was an attempt,

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:14.430 align:middle line:84%
as many people have often done,
to get some DNA evidence to find

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:18.480 align:middle line:84%
out, biologically, where
this creature falls

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.010 align:middle line:90%
in the family tree of life.

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:26.796 align:middle line:90%
And Dr. Melba Ketchum in Texas--

00:15:26.796 --> 00:15:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She was one
and is one of the best.

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:32.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Yeah, a veterinarian,
doctor of veterinary sciences.

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:36.590 align:middle line:84%
Analyzed some hair,
allegedly from a Sasquatch

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:41.060 align:middle line:84%
that they were able to
temporarily sedate and get

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:42.090 align:middle line:90%
some hair from.

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen the photos
of that Sasquatch there.

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, the evidence--
and many other people

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.350 align:middle line:84%
have attempted to get
some DNA evidence.

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:54.420 align:middle line:84%
It always comes
out the same way.

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.520 align:middle line:90%
It's like mostly human, I think.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:01.820 align:middle line:84%
In Dr. Ketchum's analysis, 92%
human and 8% something else.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:02.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:03.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: They're related to us.

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And there's also something
else going on there.

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:06.230 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:07.772 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something
else is important.

00:16:07.772 --> 00:16:09.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Yeah, something
else is important.

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:11.280 align:middle line:90%
What is that something else?

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:15.510 align:middle line:84%
It can't be identified,
the rest of the DNA.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, from what I
hear, what I've read,

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:21.920 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't fit into any DNA
that we have in these huge DNA

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.130 align:middle line:90%
databases.

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:25.020 align:middle line:90%
So we're not sure what it is.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:29.190 align:middle line:84%
It's something mammalian, but it
doesn't fit any known species.

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:31.170 align:middle line:90%
So it's a real mystery.

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, science
has become very timid,

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:35.130 align:middle line:90%
George, as you know.

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Rather than embrace
these mysteries

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:39.010 align:middle line:84%
and look into these
things, they tend

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:42.770 align:middle line:84%
to push this away and not
only ridicule witnesses,

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:45.895 align:middle line:84%
but they ridicule scientists who
want to look at these topics.

00:16:45.895 --> 00:16:46.695 align:middle line:90%
It's unfortunate.

00:16:46.695 --> 00:16:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Simeon, the
group that investigates

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.510 align:middle line:84%
Sasquatch sightings, of
course, we've got on video.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:54.535 align:middle line:90%
They're truly remarkable.

00:16:54.535 --> 00:16:56.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Breaking news out of Texas.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:00.560 align:middle line:10%
Bigfoot is real, according
to a group of researchers.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.422 align:middle line:10%
They call themselves the
Sasquatch Genome Project.

00:17:03.422 --> 00:17:04.839 align:middle line:10%
And they released
what they say is

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:08.109 align:middle line:10%
proof, several
never-before-seen short video

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:11.089 align:middle line:10%
clips of the legendary
and very shy creature.

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:14.740 align:middle line:84%
The group spent five years
and $500,000 coming to this

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:15.680 align:middle line:90%
conclusion.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.130 align:middle line:84%
One clip is of
Sasquatch sleeping

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:22.099 align:middle line:84%
shot during the day in
Kentucky back in 2005.

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:26.180 align:middle line:10%
>> We've all had experiences
that have changed our lives.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.119 align:middle line:84%
I mean, literally
shook the foundations

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:29.160 align:middle line:90%
of what we believe in.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Besides the video, they
say they also have DNA proof

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:34.450 align:middle line:90%
of Bigfoot's existence.

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:37.270 align:middle line:84%
One of the researchers stressed
that their work has been, quote,

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:38.240 align:middle line:90%
"serious study."

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.392 align:middle line:90%


00:17:41.392 --> 00:17:43.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pretty dramatic.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:44.706 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Right.

00:17:44.706 --> 00:17:48.330 align:middle line:84%
George, I've had a subscription
to Science magazine,

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:53.250 align:middle line:84%
the preeminent Science magazine
in the US from the AAAS.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.890 align:middle line:84%
I have read almost
every issue since 1990,

00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:00.095 align:middle line:84%
and I've never seen them
address this type of subject.

00:18:00.095 --> 00:18:00.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They should.

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:01.895 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge story.

00:18:01.895 --> 00:18:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: We've got evidence.

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:04.630 align:middle line:90%
We've got scientists.

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:06.190 align:middle line:90%
We've got hair samples.

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes there are these
little blood samples

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.190 align:middle line:84%
from little objects that pierce
a little bit of the skin.

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:13.170 align:middle line:90%
They have some blood.

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:17.040 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen it looked at
in Science magazine or Nature

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:21.330 align:middle line:84%
magazine, and it's almost like
there's a type of suppression

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:22.990 align:middle line:90%
of these anomalies.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And in the history of science,
suppressing anomalies eventually

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.330 align:middle line:90%
leads to a huge paradigm change.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:29.830 align:middle line:84%
If they're not
going to look at it,

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.770 align:middle line:84%
eventually, the evidence
is going to be there.

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:33.895 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to have to
change our point of view

00:18:33.895 --> 00:18:35.937 align:middle line:84%
of our own evolution,
who we are and how

00:18:35.937 --> 00:18:37.770 align:middle line:84%
we relate to the rest
of the animal kingdom.

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us more
about Melba Ketchum

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:45.810 align:middle line:84%
and exactly what was able to
obtain this DNA hair sample.

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:46.720 align:middle line:90%
How did they do that?

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Well, she has
her own DNA analysis lab,

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:54.210 align:middle line:84%
and she was able
to do the analysis.

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:57.192 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
they get the sample?

00:18:57.192 --> 00:19:01.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Allegedly, this group
that we saw in the video clip

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:06.087 align:middle line:84%
took that hair sample from
that particular creature,

00:19:06.087 --> 00:19:07.170 align:middle line:90%
which they gave a name to.

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:08.370 align:middle line:90%
They called her Matilda.

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:09.745 align:middle line:84%
I think you have
to agree, that's

00:19:09.745 --> 00:19:11.340 align:middle line:90%
a pretty impressive video clip.

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:12.140 align:middle line:90%
It almost rivals--

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:13.807 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
the Patterson-Gimlin.

00:19:13.807 --> 00:19:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Almost like
Patterson-Gimlin,

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Paul Freeman footage
from the Blue Mountains.

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:20.640 align:middle line:90%
Something very close up.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And the first time I saw
that footage, I mean,

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.070 align:middle line:84%
it's really quite
shocking to realize you

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:26.900 align:middle line:84%
could be looking at
this other species

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.440 align:middle line:90%
that we know very little about.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:32.680 align:middle line:84%
So they got the hair
sample from that creature

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.250 align:middle line:90%
that they called Matilda.

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:36.980 align:middle line:90%
And Dr. Ketchum analyzed it.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And when we're
doing science, we're

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.720 align:middle line:84%
looking at these consistent
patterns across different types

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.810 align:middle line:90%
of data sets.

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And what Dr. Ketchum found
is very similar to what

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:51.260 align:middle line:84%
other people have found doing
the same types of analysis,

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.360 align:middle line:90%
that there's a lot--

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:56.840 align:middle line:84%
that this is not
really a relic primate

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.510 align:middle line:84%
as much as it's much
closer to a hominin.

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:01.400 align:middle line:90%
It's much closer to us.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.440 align:middle line:84%
Even though it has a
lot of hair and fur,

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.020 align:middle line:90%
it's closely related to us.

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And people who have interacted
with Bigfoot, George,

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.850 align:middle line:84%
say that they're
highly intelligent.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.040 align:middle line:84%
They have their
own language, as we

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:15.895 align:middle line:84%
know from the Sierra Sounds, Ron
Morehead and the Sierra Nevadas.

00:20:15.895 --> 00:20:16.695 align:middle line:90%
Those--

00:20:16.695 --> 00:20:19.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They seem
to be nonviolent.

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: They often
seem to be nonviolent.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.620 align:middle line:84%
But I have to say,
I have interviewed

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:26.710 align:middle line:84%
witnesses that felt that
they were endangered

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:27.982 align:middle line:90%
and had to flee the area.

00:20:27.982 --> 00:20:28.940 align:middle line:90%
And these are usually--

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:30.357 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe
they provoked them.

00:20:30.357 --> 00:20:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: This often happens when
you have people going way back

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.500 align:middle line:84%
in the back country,
where these Bigfoot maybe

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.370 align:middle line:84%
haven't encountered people
before or at least not

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:40.170 align:middle line:90%
in a long while.

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:42.712 align:middle line:84%
You could be in an area where
there are other family members.

00:20:42.712 --> 00:20:43.610 align:middle line:90%
They have families.

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know why they
become aggressive sometimes.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.800 align:middle line:84%
But you do get some
aggressive Sasquatch.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:53.210 align:middle line:84%
But there are many cases
of them rescuing people out

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:55.650 align:middle line:84%
in the forest, in
the national parks.

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:59.550 align:middle line:84%
People have gotten lost, kids
who've fallen into streams.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:00.540 align:middle line:90%
Very cold water.

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:03.285 align:middle line:84%
They remember being
picked up out of the water

00:21:03.285 --> 00:21:04.410 align:middle line:90%
by something big and hairy.

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:05.968 align:middle line:84%
So they often
rescue people, too.

00:21:05.968 --> 00:21:07.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about footprints?

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:08.550 align:middle line:90%
What have they found?

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:09.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: That's fascinating.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:12.890 align:middle line:84%
I was just part of an
event a couple of weeks

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:15.630 align:middle line:84%
ago on the Olympic
Peninsula in Washington.

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And we did this hydrocal casting
of these were human footprints,

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:22.770 align:middle line:84%
but it was just an
example how to do it.

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:25.760 align:middle line:84%
So there are tons and
tons of these footprints

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.800 align:middle line:84%
that you've probably seen,
I think, in the past.

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:28.300 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they used--

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:29.133 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge casts.

00:21:29.133 --> 00:21:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Very big casts.

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:37.460 align:middle line:84%
The feet are 13, 14
inches long, very wide.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:41.180 align:middle line:84%
You can see the example
in the Sasquatch Outpost.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:43.840 align:middle line:84%
Jim Myers had some
of these casts

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.780 align:middle line:84%
compared to what human feet look
like, if my memory is correct.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.040 align:middle line:90%
And they're just huge.

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.190 align:middle line:90%
They call it Bigfoot.

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:51.260 align:middle line:84%
So this is a really
big creature.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And the imprints,
George, are quite deep,

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:58.800 align:middle line:84%
suggesting that they weigh
easily 1,000 pounds or more

00:21:58.800 --> 00:21:59.600 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.990 align:middle line:84%
So how does a creature
that weighs that much

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:04.180 align:middle line:84%
and is that big, how
are they that fast?

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And how do they disappear so
quickly if they're that big?

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.195 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do the feet
look like human feet?

00:22:09.195 --> 00:22:09.995 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yes.

00:22:09.995 --> 00:22:11.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But just bigger?

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:14.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: They look like
human feet, bigger.

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:19.990 align:middle line:84%
There are some differences in
the arch that people like Jeff

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:21.980 align:middle line:90%
Meldrum have analyzed to--

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:23.650 align:middle line:84%
there's some
characteristics that

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:25.300 align:middle line:84%
are slightly different
than human feet,

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:26.870 align:middle line:90%
but they look like hominin feet.

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:28.870 align:middle line:84%
They definitely look very
similar to human feet,

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:29.590 align:middle line:90%
but very big.

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:31.382 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
happen if they declared

00:22:31.382 --> 00:22:33.036 align:middle line:90%
Bigfoot an endangered species?

00:22:33.036 --> 00:22:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Well, I
think you're really

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:39.360 align:middle line:84%
hitting on why we haven't really
talked about this as much as we

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.660 align:middle line:90%
should have as a society.

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:43.830 align:middle line:10%
Because as soon as this
species is recognized

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:46.290 align:middle line:10%
as really existing,
as people who

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:48.780 align:middle line:10%
work in the national parks and
the national forest service

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:54.840 align:middle line:10%
know, it would mean probably
invoking the Endangered Species

00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:01.090 align:middle line:10%
Act, having areas that are now
open to commerce and tourism

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:03.335 align:middle line:10%
probably closing some
of those areas off.

00:23:03.335 --> 00:23:04.960 align:middle line:84%
It would have big
consequences, George.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.043 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt about it.

00:23:06.043 --> 00:23:10.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's more likely
not to be an animal

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:13.210 align:middle line:84%
as another type of human,
at least in my view.

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And that would invoke even
more types of protections.

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think the bureaucracies
that you and I live

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:21.600 align:middle line:84%
under in the United States
have really hesitated

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.200 align:middle line:90%
to want to make those changes.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.440 align:middle line:84%
It'd be pretty big if we
went in that direction,

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.570 align:middle line:84%
but I think that's the only way
it could really go, ultimately.

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.903 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Patterson-Gimlin
film, which you mentioned,

00:23:29.903 --> 00:23:31.620 align:middle line:90%
shot in '67?

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:32.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Right.

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:32.750 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:33.958 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Northern California?

00:23:33.958 --> 00:23:35.922 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yeah, Bluff Creek.

00:23:35.922 --> 00:23:38.585 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were there to
do a movie on Bigfoot, right?

00:23:38.585 --> 00:23:39.385 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yeah.

00:23:39.385 --> 00:23:42.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.868 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Patterson
and Gimlin came down.

00:23:44.868 --> 00:23:45.785 align:middle line:90%
They were two Cowboys.

00:23:45.785 --> 00:23:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you explain
what is on the film?

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Well, the
Patterson-Gimlin film

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:56.640 align:middle line:84%
is the most well-known
film of an actual Bigfoot.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.450 align:middle line:90%
It's movie.

00:23:57.450 --> 00:23:59.000 align:middle line:90%
It's 300 frames shot.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Female Bigfoot.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:00.958 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Female Bigfoot.

00:24:00.958 --> 00:24:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this Bigfoot
had breasts, which

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:06.570 align:middle line:84%
is one very good argument
why it's not a suit.

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:09.140 align:middle line:84%
Because that would take a lot
more effort to make a suit

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:10.830 align:middle line:90%
like that in a female form.

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:15.420 align:middle line:84%
But you can see muscles
moving in this creature.

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:16.620 align:middle line:90%
She's tall.

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And Patterson and Gimlin
came down from Yakima,

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.435 align:middle line:84%
just because they were
interested in the subject.

00:24:22.435 --> 00:24:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And they knew that
there had been

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:27.440 align:middle line:84%
sightings in that area in
Bluff Creek from logging crews

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.350 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:31.040 align:middle line:84%
It went all the way
back to the '50s.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Jerry Crew, actually, the guy
that created the name Bigfoot,

00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:37.500 align:middle line:84%
was part of a logging operation
out there in that area.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.750 align:middle line:84%
So there had been Bigfoot
sightings there for a while,

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:42.120 align:middle line:84%
and they went down
just out of curiosity.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.700 align:middle line:90%
They brought their camera along.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:45.060 align:middle line:90%
And here they are.

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And they come across one
which we now call Patty.

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:51.240 align:middle line:84%
I actually saw this
in '72 as a preview,

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:54.540 align:middle line:84%
a little minidocumentary to a
movie in the movie theaters.

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:56.250 align:middle line:84%
So that's when I
first saw that film.

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:57.570 align:middle line:90%
But most people have seen this.

00:24:57.570 --> 00:24:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
realistic looking--

00:24:59.240 --> 00:24:59.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:00.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Muscles are moving.

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:01.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Limbering.

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:02.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yeah.

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And no one's ever
been able to reproduce

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:06.950 align:middle line:90%
that walk that Patty has.

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:09.953 align:middle line:84%
Because Bigfoot, their feet
don't walk the way we walk.

00:25:09.953 --> 00:25:12.120 align:middle line:84%
They actually put their
feet in front of each other.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And it looks different
than a human track.

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:16.890 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, that film
is fascinating.

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:20.120 align:middle line:84%
But I've heard Bob Gimlin,
he's been at these conferences.

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And he said he's really
sorry he ever took

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:28.370 align:middle line:84%
the film because he said they
got so much ridicule in Yakima.

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:30.590 align:middle line:90%
His wife worked in the bank.

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:32.560 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you know
about this is people

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.040 align:middle line:90%
would say mean things to her.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.740 align:middle line:84%
They would come up to
the house and yell.

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And he said there
was no benefit.

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And he's never made
any money from it.

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:41.450 align:middle line:90%
But that's what they saw.

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:42.260 align:middle line:90%
They took the film.

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:43.800 align:middle line:90%
I believe it's 100% real.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On an episode
of Open Minds on Gaia,

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.520 align:middle line:84%
we had Jack Cary
talk about the film.

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:50.780 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:52.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
One of the things

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:54.160 align:middle line:84%
is the naysayers
always say, oh, it's

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.660 align:middle line:90%
just someone in a gorilla suit.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is always
the first thing

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:01.490 align:middle line:84%
that comes up is the
authentication of the videos.

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And first, let's just talk about
that for a moment to the best

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:05.460 align:middle line:90%
you can.

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:06.470 align:middle line:90%
I would appreciate that.

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:07.270 align:middle line:90%
>>JACK CARY: Sure.

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:12.010 align:middle line:10%
Well, as in the famous
Patterson-Gimlin film,

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:14.660 align:middle line:10%
where they were stating that
this had to be an individual,

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:19.010 align:middle line:10%
all the skeptics, this is a guy
in a gorilla suit walking along,

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:21.810 align:middle line:10%
had to have been faked.

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:25.070 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting is they
never take into account the year

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:30.210 align:middle line:84%
in which that film was produced
and taken, which was 1967.

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:34.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, in Hollywood, at the
time, the best monkey suits

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:36.410 align:middle line:84%
anywhere in the world
were being utilized

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:38.188 align:middle line:84%
on the set of
Planet of the Apes.

00:26:38.188 --> 00:26:39.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Planet of the Apes.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: It cost them
$1 million a day

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:44.040 align:middle line:84%
to dress those actors
in those uniforms,

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:48.020 align:middle line:84%
and they don't hold a
candle to the creature

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:49.590 align:middle line:90%
in the Patterson-Gimlin film.

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's the kind of
technology it would take.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Now the arm itself is
beyond human length.

00:26:57.050 --> 00:26:58.370 align:middle line:90%
It's been measured.

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And yet, in one of the
frames, the creature

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:02.520 align:middle line:90%
squeezes it's fingers.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:06.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, animatronics were
a thing that they were

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.910 align:middle line:90%
dreaming about in that year.

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And yet, that's the
kind of technology

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:14.980 align:middle line:84%
that would be required in order
to produce that kind of a hoax.

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Why haven't they found
physical evidence--

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:23.610 align:middle line:90%
bones, skin, something?

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: George, it's
a good question.

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:28.940 align:middle line:84%
I think that when bones and
evidence have been found,

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:31.310 align:middle line:90%
it's often been taken away.

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:36.040 align:middle line:84%
We know in the past centuries,
when large giant bones were

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:40.070 align:middle line:84%
allegedly found out West in
this part of the country,

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:42.650 align:middle line:84%
the Smithsonian would always
come in and take them away,

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:45.110 align:middle line:84%
but never really have any
record of them later on.

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And from the accounts I've read,
when bones have been discovered

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:52.700 align:middle line:84%
out in national parks
and places like that,

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.730 align:middle line:84%
the supervisors
there seem to want

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:56.840 align:middle line:90%
to have the evidence go away.

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.600 align:middle line:84%
They don't want people to be
scared coming to these parks,

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.510 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want
the people to be

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:05.270 align:middle line:84%
talking about this within
their own operations there.

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:09.470 align:middle line:84%
So I think some of the
evidence has been suppressed.

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And then it's a very
good question, generally,

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:14.540 align:middle line:84%
why don't we have more
physical evidence.

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:16.400 align:middle line:84%
But we often don't
have physical evidence

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.720 align:middle line:90%
of a lot of other animals.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:22.140 align:middle line:84%
I spend a lot of time walking
around in nature, in the woods.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And you generally don't
find a lot of bones.

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there pretty
much are going

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:27.940 align:middle line:90%
to be devoured by scavengers.

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, we don't
find deer carcasses.

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:32.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: They don't
last very long.

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:35.680 align:middle line:84%
From my own experience, they're
there may be a week or two.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.930 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I've seen this happen.

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And all the traces
of it are gone.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.030 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
different animals

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:46.308 align:middle line:84%
and birds and things that'll
come and decompose a carcass.

00:28:46.308 --> 00:28:47.850 align:middle line:84%
So nature is very
good at doing this.

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:50.300 align:middle line:84%
So I think those are
two reasons why we don't

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.570 align:middle line:90%
have any more direct evidence.

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could Sasquatch
be the biblical version

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:56.820 align:middle line:90%
of the Nephilim?

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:58.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: It could be, George.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:59.230 align:middle line:90%
You look back--

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:00.855 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You always
thought about that?

00:29:00.855 --> 00:29:02.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: No, I think it's a--

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:06.980 align:middle line:84%
it's something I've looked into
recently, even learning Hebrew

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.170 align:middle line:84%
to go back to some
of those old texts

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:11.070 align:middle line:84%
and read it in the
original Hebrew.

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And there's not
just the Nephilim.

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.310 align:middle line:84%
There's the Rephaim
and other types

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:17.878 align:middle line:84%
of giants that are mentioned
in the Old Testament.

00:29:17.878 --> 00:29:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Goliath
could have been one.

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:20.290 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Exactly.

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:21.630 align:middle line:90%
So it could be, George.

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:22.430 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:24.040 align:middle line:84%
It could be that
this has actually

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:28.610 align:middle line:84%
been part of our history, our
biblical history the whole time

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:30.310 align:middle line:84%
but we just haven't
been interpreting.

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:37.810 align:middle line:84%
We've been anthropomorphizing
the characters in the Bible,

00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:39.780 align:middle line:84%
thinking they're
just large humans.

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:43.430 align:middle line:84%
But these could be what we
think of now as Bigfoot,

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:46.300 align:middle line:90%
these sort of giants.

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:49.210 align:middle line:84%
Listening to discussions
of biblical scholars

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:52.670 align:middle line:84%
about these different
creatures and the giants,

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:55.650 align:middle line:84%
they usually say, well, they
were referring to wild animals

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:56.450 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:57.470 align:middle line:90%
But how do you know?

00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:59.200 align:middle line:84%
How do you know it's not
the same thing that people

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.075 align:middle line:90%
are encountering now?

00:30:00.075 --> 00:30:01.617 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
Native Americans say

00:30:01.617 --> 00:30:02.530 align:middle line:90%
about this creature?

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Well, that's
a really good--

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:04.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do they call it?

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: There are
hundreds of names.

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:09.370 align:middle line:90%
Our name, Sasquatch comes--

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:10.850 align:middle line:90%
that's a Native American name.

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:13.660 align:middle line:84%
There are hundreds of
different names for Sasquatch

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:15.560 align:middle line:90%
throughout North America.

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
a very good point

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:20.680 align:middle line:84%
because there are so many
different names for Sasquatch

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.490 align:middle line:90%
going back hundreds of years.

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:24.310 align:middle line:84%
I think that's some
of the best evidence

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:26.600 align:middle line:84%
that this creature
really exists.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Because all the Native
Americans here encountered them,

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:32.000 align:middle line:90%
created a name for them.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And I actually encountered
a Native American

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:40.460 align:middle line:84%
at one of the conferences
recently in Forks, Washington,

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:43.010 align:middle line:84%
who said his grandfather
traded with Sasquatch.

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:43.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Traded?

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:44.700 align:middle line:90%
What did they trade?

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: It's exactly
what I asked him.

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:49.010 align:middle line:84%
He said it happened
as recently as 1913.

00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:51.550 align:middle line:84%
That's the last time
they saw the Sasquatch,

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:53.390 align:middle line:90%
that particular group.

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:54.380 align:middle line:90%
I went up to him.

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.810 align:middle line:84%
He said his grandfather
was a salmon fisherman.

00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And the Sasquatch would
bring medicinal herbs,

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:03.380 align:middle line:84%
and they would trade salmon for
medicinal herbs year after year.

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
Northwest Coast Indians--

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:11.360 align:middle line:84%
I just heard this again in the
Olympic Forest, just a couple

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.220 align:middle line:84%
of weeks ago from
another person who

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:15.240 align:middle line:90%
lived on the Makah Reservation.

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.380 align:middle line:90%
And same story.

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:18.270 align:middle line:90%
Salmon for medicinal herbs.

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:19.880 align:middle line:90%
So you start hearing this.

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And there's no incentive for
them just to make that up.

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:25.480 align:middle line:84%
They were trading
with some Sasquatch.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:28.470 align:middle line:84%
You normally don't find apes and
animals that trade with humans.

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:32.005 align:middle line:84%
So again, it puts them more in
the human category than the ape.

00:31:32.005 --> 00:31:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a caller on Coast
to Coast radio a couple of years

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:40.950 align:middle line:84%
ago who was fishing by the side
of a lake and caught two trout.

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:42.440 align:middle line:90%
He looked up.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And peering over behind
him was a Bigfoot.

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:48.710 align:middle line:84%
He said, it scared the living
daylights out of me, George.

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:51.290 align:middle line:84%
I handed the Bigfoot
the two trout.

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And he took them, walked away,
came back, and gave me one back.

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:58.810 align:middle line:90%
Do you believe that story?

00:31:58.810 --> 00:31:59.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yeah, I do.

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:00.650 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Because people that have done
nice things for Sasquatch

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.010 align:middle line:90%
out there, perhaps--

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:08.960 align:middle line:84%
I've read cases of veterinarians
doing some minor surgery

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.520 align:middle line:84%
on an injured juvenile
or something in glacier,

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:12.330 align:middle line:90%
places like this.

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:15.530 align:middle line:84%
The next morning they
will find a row of fish

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:16.740 align:middle line:90%
on the picnic table.

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:17.060 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Big thank you.

00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:18.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Big thank you.

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:22.860 align:middle line:84%
The Sasquatch understand this
reciprocity, which we take as--

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It tells you there's
some intelligence there.

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Intelligence,
the hallmark of human--

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:28.970 align:middle line:84%
intelligence is
this exchange we do.

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:29.845 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And emotion.

00:32:29.845 --> 00:32:33.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Emotion,
exchange, sense of value.

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's something
that's very uniquely human.

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:38.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 1926, there
were some tribes

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:42.980 align:middle line:84%
that were meeting over some
police department situation.

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:44.310 align:middle line:90%
What was that?

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:48.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: That's a story that I've
heard Dave Paulides mentioned,

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:54.020 align:middle line:84%
and it was a meeting of
three different groups

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:56.670 align:middle line:84%
out there, Native
American groups,

00:32:56.670 --> 00:33:00.005 align:middle line:84%
because, apparently, someone
had encountered a Sasquatch.

00:33:00.005 --> 00:33:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And the sheriff wanted to
go out and hunt him down.

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And these tribes,
these three tribes

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:09.190 align:middle line:84%
in the Northwest there held
a press conference and said,

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:12.280 align:middle line:84%
don't hurt them, don't injure
them, we trade with them,

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.770 align:middle line:84%
just like this story I related
to you a few moments ago.

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:18.020 align:middle line:84%
So even back to 1926-- we're
talking a hundred years ago

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:18.820 align:middle line:90%
now--

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:22.650 align:middle line:84%
tribes said that they were
trading with Sasquatch

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:26.585 align:middle line:84%
and that they considered
them to be another tribe.

00:33:26.585 --> 00:33:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They wouldn't
make that stuff up.

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: No, they
wouldn't make it up.

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who would waste their
time making that stuff up?

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:34.105 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Who would waste
their time back then,

00:33:34.105 --> 00:33:37.390 align:middle line:84%
having a press conference before
you had modern communication.

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:38.500 align:middle line:90%
No, I totally agree.

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.880 align:middle line:90%
They weren't making it up.

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And that is very
important evidence

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:48.210 align:middle line:84%
that Native Americans have been
talking about this for over 100

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:49.080 align:middle line:90%
years now.

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.497 align:middle line:84%
They had different
names for them.

00:33:50.497 --> 00:33:55.838 align:middle line:84%
Even out here, people
called them Mountain Devils.

00:33:55.838 --> 00:33:57.880 align:middle line:84%
100 years ago, people
didn't know what they were.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they refer to
them as escaped gorillas.

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:01.355 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Yeti
in the Himalayas.

00:34:01.355 --> 00:34:02.155 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yeti.

00:34:02.155 --> 00:34:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there are so many
different names for them.

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:08.880 align:middle line:84%
But the Native Americans had
their own names for them.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:11.107 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's very good
evidence that they existed

00:34:11.107 --> 00:34:12.440 align:middle line:90%
and they were dealing with them.

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.487 align:middle line:84%
Also, their pictograms,
the pictographs--

00:34:14.487 --> 00:34:16.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Before I even
knew about Sasquatch,

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.310 align:middle line:84%
I used to read stories
about the Abominable Snowman

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:20.840 align:middle line:90%
in the Himalayas.

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:23.250 align:middle line:90%
Fascinated by this creature.

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:25.469 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's one
and the same, don't you?

00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:26.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: I think so.

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the Yeti, they
were just adapted

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:31.170 align:middle line:84%
to being in snow
conditions all the time,

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:33.600 align:middle line:84%
which is why they'd
be white haired.

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.330 align:middle line:84%
But even some of
the explorers there

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:36.920 align:middle line:90%
talked about seeing them, so.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why isn't there more
of an investigation going on,

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:40.320 align:middle line:90%
Simeon?

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:43.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've got people
like you, Jim Myers,

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.630 align:middle line:90%
dedicated researchers.

00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:48.460 align:middle line:84%
But why isn't government
doing something about this?

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Well, it's very
similar to the UFO situation.

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.810 align:middle line:84%
We just had these
hearings this week.

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:55.643 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:34:55.643 --> 00:34:58.087 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: I think the government
knows a lot more about this

00:34:58.087 --> 00:34:58.920 align:middle line:90%
than they're saying.

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:00.860 align:middle line:84%
There is absolutely
no way people

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:03.410 align:middle line:84%
in the National Forest Service
and the National Park Service

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:04.702 align:middle line:90%
and Bureau of Land Management--

00:35:04.702 --> 00:35:06.485 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But why hide it?

00:35:06.485 --> 00:35:09.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: I think they want
to preserve the status quo,

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:10.540 align:middle line:90%
the way--

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:12.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm just speaking as
a sociologist here

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:15.270 align:middle line:84%
is that there's a tendency for
organizations and bureaucracies

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:18.960 align:middle line:84%
to want to keep the status quo
going because it would mean

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.730 align:middle line:84%
a big change in
those organizations

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:25.410 align:middle line:84%
to recognize another species
they would have to put signs

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:28.420 align:middle line:84%
telling people, you're going
to be in a Sasquatch area.

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:31.150 align:middle line:90%
There's liability and so forth.

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:34.330 align:middle line:84%
So I think they
know a lot about it.

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And they have chosen,
probably incorrectly,

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:39.670 align:middle line:90%
not to tell us about it.

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:42.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're the ones
really paying for it.

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:45.700 align:middle line:84%
So I think we do
know more about it.

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:48.145 align:middle line:84%
But the other point,
George, is that Sasquatch

00:35:48.145 --> 00:35:50.020 align:middle line:84%
and some of these other
cryptids, by the way,

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:51.730 align:middle line:90%
are very good at hiding.

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:54.910 align:middle line:84%
They're simply very
good at avoiding people.

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And even if you go on
one of these outings--

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.360 align:middle line:84%
I went with Jim Myers on his
Bigfoot adventure weekend

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:01.550 align:middle line:90%
a couple of years ago.

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good guy.

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:03.642 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: We didn't see anything.

00:36:03.642 --> 00:36:07.680 align:middle line:84%
But the group just about 1 mile
and 1/2 away, maybe 2 miles did.

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.810 align:middle line:84%
They had it on
their flare cameras.

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:11.750 align:middle line:90%
They had some call and response.

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:14.800 align:middle line:84%
But it's not like you can just
go somewhere and automatically

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:15.600 align:middle line:90%
see them.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:19.160 align:middle line:84%
They really do have
this ability, based

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:23.100 align:middle line:84%
on people I've talked
to, to cloak, to morph,

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:27.360 align:middle line:84%
to look like a tree or
like another animal.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:30.800 align:middle line:84%
We have these reports of them
turning into deer occasionally.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.300 align:middle line:84%
You hear it the
first time, like you

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:33.925 align:middle line:84%
were saying before
when we were talking

00:36:33.925 --> 00:36:35.342 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning
of the interview.

00:36:35.342 --> 00:36:36.720 align:middle line:90%
And it takes a while to sink in.

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.555 align:middle line:84%
But when you hear it
enough from people

00:36:38.555 --> 00:36:41.180 align:middle line:84%
and you hear it from people who
have no interest in making this

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:44.720 align:middle line:84%
up, you get the feeling
that this is a creature that

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.650 align:middle line:90%
has paranormal abilities.

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:48.470 align:middle line:84%
At least that's the
way we would call it.

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:50.630 align:middle line:84%
A multidimensional
aspect to them.

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:54.076 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think it's more
physical than dimensional?

00:36:54.076 --> 00:36:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: They have clearly a
physical flesh and blood side.

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:00.180 align:middle line:90%
People see them.

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:03.100 align:middle line:84%
They look completely
physical, but that

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:06.620 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean that they don't
have the ability to transform.

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.420 align:middle line:84%
However they're
actually doing it,

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:11.710 align:middle line:84%
I think it has something to
do with sound and frequency

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:17.170 align:middle line:84%
to create another phase space
as quantum mechanics tells

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:18.320 align:middle line:90%
us exists.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:21.830 align:middle line:84%
Quantum mechanics tells us
everything has a frequency.

00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:24.370 align:middle line:84%
They seem to have
the ability, at least

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:27.050 align:middle line:84%
it seems to me, to
change their frequency.

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, they're
just not here anymore.

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:32.810 align:middle line:84%
They're here one
moment, and they vanish.

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:35.200 align:middle line:84%
I've even heard this
from loggers and so forth

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:38.870 align:middle line:84%
of them going behind trees,
thin trees, and they're gone.

00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:39.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Poof.

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:40.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yep, just like that.

00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:43.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How has Hollywood
handled this subject?

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Usually, the way
this is depicted in Hollywood

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:52.130 align:middle line:84%
is either in a humorous
Harry and the Hendersons way,

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:58.150 align:middle line:84%
or as sort of a big sort
of hairy, benign creature

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:00.022 align:middle line:90%
like Chewbacca in Star Wars.

00:38:00.022 --> 00:38:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And then occasionally,
you'll get a scary movie

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.900 align:middle line:84%
where they're just
like completely

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:06.010 align:middle line:90%
a monster with no humanity.

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:10.060 align:middle line:84%
The truth is really
somewhere in between.

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think Hollywood could
actually do a little more.

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:13.890 align:middle line:90%
Because a lot of these stories--

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:15.940 align:middle line:84%
and you're familiar with
these witnesses, too.

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:19.390 align:middle line:84%
They talk about these very
human-like characteristics--

00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:21.760 align:middle line:84%
gifting, people leave
things for them.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.830 align:middle line:84%
The Sasquatch leaves
something else.

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:26.225 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind of things
do they leave for them?

00:38:26.225 --> 00:38:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: They leave crystals,
little shiny objects.

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And very interestingly,
they often

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:37.110 align:middle line:84%
leave things that have a lot
of relevance to your life

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:39.850 align:middle line:84%
that you really wonder how
anyone would have known about,

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:42.970 align:middle line:84%
like you would be talking about
something with a friend outside.

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, you'd
find that line on the porch,

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:48.660 align:middle line:84%
almost as if they were
eavesdropping on you

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:50.770 align:middle line:84%
and decided, OK, we're
going to find something--

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or reading
our minds or something.

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.217 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Yeah,
something like that.

00:38:53.217 --> 00:38:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And where do they find
all these objects?

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes these are
canteens from 80 years ago

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:00.120 align:middle line:84%
or real things
that we don't even

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.890 align:middle line:90%
use anymore from another era.

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:04.720 align:middle line:84%
Where do they keep
them in the meantime?

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:07.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a big mystery, but they
leave very interesting--

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:09.630 align:middle line:84%
I've had friends that
have found objects

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:11.190 align:middle line:84%
right in their
driveways, and there

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:13.630 align:middle line:84%
are no kids around or anything
else to leave them, so.

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:17.725 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Simeon, could Bigfoot
be an extraterrestrial?

00:39:17.725 --> 00:39:19.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: That's
always a possibility.

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:24.220 align:middle line:84%
In my research and
from the DNA research,

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:27.720 align:middle line:84%
it seems more like it's
something on the human family

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:31.095 align:middle line:84%
tree, but something that's had
hundreds of thousands of years--

00:39:31.095 --> 00:39:32.165 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of an evolution.

00:39:32.165 --> 00:39:35.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Yeah, in a
different direction,

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.970 align:middle line:84%
which has led them to develop
these paranormal abilities

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:43.350 align:middle line:84%
that those of us alive now feel
like we need to take a course in

00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:45.780 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to do, like
remote viewing or PK

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:47.020 align:middle line:90%
or something like this.

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:49.905 align:middle line:84%
The Sasquatch seem to know
how to do this naturally.

00:39:49.905 --> 00:39:51.780 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting
thing about your question

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:54.450 align:middle line:84%
is they are often
seen around UFOs.

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
in the UFO field

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:59.185 align:middle line:84%
have wanted to keep the
Sasquatch out of their UFO.

00:39:59.185 --> 00:40:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I keep thinking
of Star Wars and Chewbacca.

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:05.210 align:middle line:90%
It was a Bigfoot.

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:06.990 align:middle line:90%
Chewie was a Bigfoot.

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: If you look at
the research of people

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:11.660 align:middle line:84%
like Stan Gordon, Pennsylvania,
and so forth, a researcher

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:14.600 align:middle line:84%
from Western Pennsylvania,
he's documented a lot of cases

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:17.540 align:middle line:84%
where you had UFOs,
orbs, and so forth

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:19.950 align:middle line:90%
in the same fields as Sasquatch.

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing,
having talked to Stan

00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:27.380 align:middle line:84%
many times, is that you get
these waves of UFO sightings

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:30.050 align:middle line:84%
at the same time you have
waves of Bigfoot sightings

00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:31.610 align:middle line:90%
in the same year or something.

00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:33.881 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You find that bizarre?

00:40:33.881 --> 00:40:35.108 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yeah, I--

00:40:35.108 --> 00:40:36.566 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are
no coincidences.

00:40:36.566 --> 00:40:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Yeah, it's
a clue that we're

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:40.940 align:middle line:84%
dealing with some
family of phenomena

00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:44.250 align:middle line:84%
here that we're not
very familiar with.

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:48.300 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like some sort
of space is opening up.

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:50.250 align:middle line:84%
You could almost call
it like a portal.

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
other things there

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:53.820 align:middle line:90%
when those portals open up.

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:56.310 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe we're
changing to become

00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:58.300 align:middle line:84%
more similar to these
sort of phenomena.

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:00.235 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure which one
it is, but they do seem

00:41:00.235 --> 00:41:01.360 align:middle line:90%
to happen at the same time.

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about orbs?

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:04.770 align:middle line:90%
Ball lightning.

00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:07.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Orbs and ball
lightning are also

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:11.770 align:middle line:84%
another topic that has been
studied for hundreds of years,

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:15.240 align:middle line:84%
but mainstream science
has suppressed it.

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:18.450 align:middle line:84%
Ball lightning is
a subject you can

00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:21.840 align:middle line:84%
find 200 years of
study of ball lightning

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:26.350 align:middle line:84%
in Europe, especially in
Russia, in the Soviet Union.

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And yet, in the West,
it's not something

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:33.960 align:middle line:84%
that we talk about very much
outside of special access

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:34.900 align:middle line:90%
programs.

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:36.940 align:middle line:84%
When you look at some
of this research,

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:38.950 align:middle line:84%
George, coming out
of the Air Force,

00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:40.830 align:middle line:84%
the Air Force did a
study of ball lightning

00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:43.510 align:middle line:90%
in '95 from J. Reece Roth.

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And then Eric Davis of
the Davis-Wilson Notes

00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:50.100 align:middle line:84%
did a study for the Air Force
that came out around 2003.

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:52.270 align:middle line:90%
They're heavily redacted.

00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:55.010 align:middle line:84%
So if ball lightning is
just a natural phenomena

00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:57.950 align:middle line:84%
with no special
significance, why

00:41:57.950 --> 00:42:01.280 align:middle line:84%
are half of the pages in
a ball lightning report

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:04.110 align:middle line:90%
completely redacted?

00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Just like these UFO pages we saw
in this congressional hearing

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:09.660 align:middle line:90%
a couple of days ago.

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:13.640 align:middle line:84%
The original ball lightning
research from the Air Force goes

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:14.760 align:middle line:90%
back to the '50s.

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.290 align:middle line:90%
And what did they find?

00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:17.162 align:middle line:90%
Antigravity.

00:42:17.162 --> 00:42:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we've got
a great example of what

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:21.060 align:middle line:90%
ball lightning looks like.

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:22.240 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:28.010 align:middle line:90%


00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:30.220 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing stuff, isn't it?

00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:33.890 align:middle line:90%


00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:35.880 align:middle line:90%
Looks like a UFO.

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:38.666 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Yeah, it's
extremely strange.

00:42:38.666 --> 00:42:40.535 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What creates that?

00:42:40.535 --> 00:42:44.138 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Well, as you can
see from the video, what

00:42:44.138 --> 00:42:45.930 align:middle line:84%
ball lightning is, to
answer your question,

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:49.740 align:middle line:84%
it's a free floating fireball,
but it's not necessarily warm.

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:50.600 align:middle line:90%
It seems to me--

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:51.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was going
to say, you don't think

00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:53.600 align:middle line:90%
it would set a forest on fire?

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:54.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: No, no.

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:57.320 align:middle line:84%
People who've encountered
it actually say it's cold.

00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:58.790 align:middle line:84%
It can actually
turn a room cold.

00:42:58.790 --> 00:43:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It hurts
you if it hit you?

00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:00.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: It can.

00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:01.600 align:middle line:90%
It can.

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.960 align:middle line:84%
One of the researchers
from Russia, Nikitin,

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:07.570 align:middle line:84%
has found a lot
of evidence where

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:10.220 align:middle line:84%
people were injured by those
orbs passing through them.

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:12.850 align:middle line:84%
But what ball lightning is
part of this family of matter

00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:14.390 align:middle line:90%
we call coherent matter.

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:17.830 align:middle line:84%
It's where all of the particles
are at the same frequency

00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:19.190 align:middle line:90%
and the temperature.

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And they act like a wave,
something that was discovered

00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:25.580 align:middle line:90%
by NIST here in Boulder in '95.

00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:27.405 align:middle line:90%
Bose-Einstein condensate.

00:43:27.405 --> 00:43:30.380 align:middle line:84%
Ball lightning is like a
Bose-Einstein condensate,

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:32.750 align:middle line:84%
but at room temperature
and not in a lab.

00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:34.520 align:middle line:90%
It's out there in the wild.

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:37.300 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind of a mistaken
idea that it only

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:38.660 align:middle line:90%
is found around thunderstorms.

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:40.520 align:middle line:84%
That's true about
70% of the time.

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.580 align:middle line:84%
But 30% of the time,
people just see

00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:44.650 align:middle line:84%
it like you saw it in that
video along the rail--

00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What creates it?

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:46.418 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: --moving along.

00:43:46.418 --> 00:43:50.115 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: It's created by charged
clusters, a charged separation.

00:43:50.115 --> 00:43:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds
like cold fusion.

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:52.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: It is.

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:53.880 align:middle line:84%
It's very similar
to cold fusion.

00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:57.020 align:middle line:84%
That's why people
like Takaaki Matsumoto

00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:59.390 align:middle line:84%
concluded that cold
fusion is actually

00:43:59.390 --> 00:44:01.800 align:middle line:84%
ball lightning in
a microscopic form.

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:03.570 align:middle line:90%
So it's a very strange subject.

00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:05.580 align:middle line:84%
We could talk for an hour
about ball lightning.

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:08.610 align:middle line:84%
It manifests itself in different
ways, but it moves around.

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:10.080 align:middle line:84%
If you talk to
witnesses, George,

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:12.140 align:middle line:84%
it almost seems
like it's conscious.

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And you can't rule
out that it is.

00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:17.070 align:middle line:84%
It seems to follow you,
to walk along a trail.

00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:20.300 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes it
ends its life, which

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.010 align:middle line:84%
can be a few seconds
or a few minutes,

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:25.200 align:middle line:84%
in an explosion, which can
be very dangerous, very loud.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it
just fades away.

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:29.430 align:middle line:84%
But just like paranormal
phenomena, George,

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:31.410 align:middle line:90%
it can go through walls.

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:32.830 align:middle line:90%
It can go through solid objects.

00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:33.655 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That could
go through walls?

00:44:33.655 --> 00:44:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: Yes, solid objects.

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And appear
on the other side?

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:37.750 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: It can go right
through solid objects

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:41.615 align:middle line:90%
in a charged neutral state.

00:44:41.615 --> 00:44:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Because it doesn't
have a charge,

00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:45.030 align:middle line:90%
it can just pass through matter.

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:47.120 align:middle line:84%
It's a highly condensed
form of matter

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:48.313 align:middle line:90%
that creates its own rules--

00:44:48.313 --> 00:44:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there
any sound tied to it?

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HEIN: Yeah, sometimes
people hear whistling sounds,

00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:54.410 align:middle line:90%
hissing sounds.

00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:56.350 align:middle line:84%
There are even
cases where people

00:44:56.350 --> 00:44:59.420 align:middle line:84%
hear these screaming sounds
from the ball lightning.

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:01.760 align:middle line:84%
It's probably just all the
energy that it's generating.

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:05.620 align:middle line:84%
But ball lightning, a
grapefruit sized-ball lightning

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:09.650 align:middle line:84%
apparently has the energy of
at least 10 hand grenades.

00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:10.450 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:45:10.450 --> 00:45:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:12.320 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: --extremely powerful.

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:16.005 align:middle line:84%
If we could tap that, it could
actually be a source of energy.

00:45:16.005 --> 00:45:17.630 align:middle line:84%
The thing about ball
lightning, George,

00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:18.920 align:middle line:90%
is it doesn't last very long.

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:19.365 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It disappears.

00:45:19.365 --> 00:45:20.282 align:middle line:90%
>>HEIN: It disappears.

00:45:20.282 --> 00:45:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And cold fusion, LENR research
is an attempt to sustain it,

00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:28.520 align:middle line:84%
if you could sustain that
ball lightning and control it.

00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:30.460 align:middle line:84%
But generally, what
these ball lightnings

00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:34.820 align:middle line:84%
do is they actually destroy any
containment vessel they're in.

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:36.380 align:middle line:90%
They transform matter.

00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:38.900 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
alchemy, nuclear alchemy.

00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And they turn elements
into other elements.

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:45.250 align:middle line:84%
It's just a whole
fascinating aspect of it.

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:48.610 align:middle line:10%
And the fact that it's
seen around Bigfoot,

00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:51.660 align:middle line:10%
other cryptids is a
clue to us that there's

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:54.810 align:middle line:10%
some sort of
electromagnetic aspect

00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:59.290 align:middle line:10%
to Bigfoot and cryptids that
we really haven't considered,

00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:02.320 align:middle line:10%
that they're not just an
ordinary animal or creature.

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:04.620 align:middle line:10%
They have some other
abilities that you and I

00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:07.120 align:middle line:10%
don't know we have and we
haven't tapped into yet.

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:09.240 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How do people
track Simeon Hein's work?

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:11.340 align:middle line:10%
>>HEIN: Oh, well,

I don't know what I would
react if I did see one,

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:37.980 align:middle line:90%
limbering across the street.
