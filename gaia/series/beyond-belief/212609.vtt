>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.320 align:middle line:10%
Elizabeth April
with us, renowned

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.630 align:middle line:10%
clairvoyant and
intuitive psychic

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.910 align:middle line:10%
often referred to as EA.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.930 align:middle line:84%
As a bestselling author and
widely recognized speaker,

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.400 align:middle line:84%
she dedicates her platform
to spark global change

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.130 align:middle line:84%
and help humanity unveil
its latest potential.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, before we go to the
live Elizabeth April,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.905 align:middle line:90%
take a look at this.

00:00:43.905 --> 00:00:48.184 align:middle line:90%


00:00:48.184 --> 00:00:50.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH APRIL: So
there are infinite amounts

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.670 align:middle line:84%
of interdimensional beings who
are all very intrigued and very

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.850 align:middle line:84%
interested on planet Earth,
humans, what we're doing here.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.445 align:middle line:10%
I help people have
interdimensional contact.

00:01:03.445 --> 00:01:06.310 align:middle line:90%


00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.740 align:middle line:90%
I was abducted at the age of 18.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.920 align:middle line:84%
That's how I learned how to
connect in an appropriate way

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.250 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrials.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.020 align:middle line:84%
So because I've had the amount
of experiences that I've had,

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm considered an
expert in this field.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.940 align:middle line:84%
Mostly my technique
is through telepathy.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.850 align:middle line:84%
So that really means
quieting the mind,

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.750 align:middle line:84%
getting into a meditative
state, and really opening up

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.100 align:middle line:84%
the heart chakra, and allowing
that experience to happen.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.100 align:middle line:84%
Elizabeth, welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Thank you so much.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.847 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for having
me back, George.

00:01:38.847 --> 00:01:40.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did this
all happen for you?

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.382 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: It's been a journey.

00:01:42.382 --> 00:01:43.215 align:middle line:10%
It's been a journey.

00:01:43.215 --> 00:01:47.380 align:middle line:10%
I really got started with
extrasensory abilities when

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.430 align:middle line:10%
I was younger, questioning the
reality that we were taught

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.450 align:middle line:10%
exists.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.050 align:middle line:10%
And through that process
of questioning, opening up

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.565 align:middle line:10%
to the possibilities not just
on planet but also off planet.

00:02:00.565 --> 00:02:01.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Truly remarkable.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, how do you help people
with interdimensional contact?

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah, so I
like teaching people

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.230 align:middle line:84%
that, first of all,
extraterrestrials do exist.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.000 align:middle line:84%
But also we have a little bit
of extraterrestrial within us.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And the more that we can connect
to ourselves at a deeper level,

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.910 align:middle line:84%
the more we can connect
to extraterrestrials

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.500 align:middle line:90%
beyond this planet.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had
an abductee case

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.413 align:middle line:90%
when you were 18 years old.

00:02:30.413 --> 00:02:31.330 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what happened.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.850 align:middle line:84%
I went away to a 10-day
meditation retreat.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And on the second night of
that meditation retreat,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.410 align:middle line:84%
I ended up getting abducted
by tall white beings.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And before that, I was
really open to things

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.250 align:middle line:84%
like remote viewing and past
life regression and mediumship.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.120 align:middle line:84%
But I'd never really considered
that aliens were here.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they must exist.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.140 align:middle line:84%
But there's no way
they would be here.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Why would they even bother with
planet Earth and human beings?

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And so after that
abduction, it really

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.850 align:middle line:84%
opened my mind up to some of the
possibilities and some really

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.950 align:middle line:84%
big questions as
far as who are we?

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.360 align:middle line:90%
What are we doing here?

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.540 align:middle line:84%
Why are they even
interested in us?

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.075 align:middle line:84%
And what does the future
look like with contact?

00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many times
have they abducted you?

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah, so I actually
got abducted quite frequently

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:26.900 align:middle line:90%
in childhood.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And then since that
physical abduction,

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.650 align:middle line:84%
I have been abducted probably
close to 10 times since then.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of my contact
with extraterrestrials

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.335 align:middle line:84%
is through remote viewing,
astral projection,

00:03:40.335 --> 00:03:41.135 align:middle line:90%
and telepathy.

00:03:41.135 --> 00:03:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There is
a, I'm convinced,

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.620 align:middle line:84%
hybridization program going
on where extraterrestrials

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:57.100 align:middle line:84%
are breeding humans, taking the
baby, and doing God knows what.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.900 align:middle line:90%
Has that happened to you?

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.440 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: So I'm not a part
of the hybridization program.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.630 align:middle line:90%
But I am very familiar with it.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And there's actually multiple
different hybrid programs

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.510 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.180 align:middle line:84%
So just like you
mentioned, there

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.380 align:middle line:84%
is hybrid mothers on planet
Earth who have babies.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And then the baby is
taken and developed

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.950 align:middle line:90%
and raised up on a ship.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.010 align:middle line:84%
But then there's also more
of a subtle hybrid program

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.910 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.910 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the missing
link with human beings

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.700 align:middle line:84%
in our evolutionary
process comes down

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.440 align:middle line:90%
to extraterrestrial involvement.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.020 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, I
believe that we are

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.280 align:middle line:84%
hybrids with a lot of
extraterrestrial DNA within us.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you look forward
to your abductee cases?

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.110 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah, I do.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.960 align:middle line:84%
I look forward to all
extraterrestrial contact, even

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.665 align:middle line:84%
the negative stuff because
it always allows me to learn.

00:04:47.665 --> 00:04:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
negative portion of this?

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: So there are good and
bad species in the universe

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.030 align:middle line:84%
and good and bad
species and beings

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.310 align:middle line:84%
who are interacting with
planet Earth and human beings.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.170 align:middle line:84%
So some of them just don't
have our best interest in mind.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's where they go above
and beyond our own free will

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.930 align:middle line:90%
to abduct us.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's more of the
negative experiences,

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.795 align:middle line:84%
is when they really don't
consider our own needs

00:05:20.795 --> 00:05:21.595 align:middle line:90%
and wants.

00:05:21.595 --> 00:05:25.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you remember
all your abducted cases?

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.060 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes, I do.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How could that be?

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: So I do a lot
of trance meditation

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.220 align:middle line:84%
and also a lot of
past life regression

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.660 align:middle line:90%
on myself and for my clients.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's just a matter
of regressing myself

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.620 align:middle line:84%
to a point where I can tap
into my own subconscious mind.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And that way, I
can remember things

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.315 align:middle line:84%
that I've even been repressed
or wiped from my memory.

00:05:46.315 --> 00:05:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When was
the last one you had?

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Oh, that's
a good question.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Say yesterday.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.310 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Definitely
not yesterday.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.700 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I'd say
maybe six months ago.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does that
come on their behalf,

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.320 align:middle line:90%
or do you summon them up?

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.420 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: That one
was a surprise.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.890 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of my contact, like
I mentioned, is nonphysical.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.950 align:middle line:84%
So I'll go up to
their ship at least

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.480 align:middle line:90%
a couple of times a month.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.170 align:middle line:84%
The physical abductions
happen much more rarely.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why is it takes
a lot of resources on their end

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.245 align:middle line:90%
to physically abduct humans.

00:06:23.245 --> 00:06:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Describe what
the ship looks like.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: So the mothership,
it's actually quite long.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.578 align:middle line:90%
And it's extremely large.

00:06:33.578 --> 00:06:34.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a football field?

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.520 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: It feels
like a whole city.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.767 align:middle line:84%
Oh my goodness, no,
much larger than that.

00:06:38.767 --> 00:06:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bigger than that?

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.095 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah.

00:06:41.095 --> 00:06:42.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But what
does it look like?

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: So it's quite
long, metal-looking.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.300 align:middle line:90%
It has lots of windows.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.640 align:middle line:84%
It has a command center at
the front and the back of it.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.375 align:middle line:84%
The command center has huge,
huge windows that are rounded.

00:06:56.375 --> 00:06:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: ETs running
all over the place.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:59.960 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah,
maybe not running.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.980 align:middle line:84%
But many different species exist
on that ship in particular.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a Galactic
Federation mothership,

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.270 align:middle line:84%
so it's like many
different beings

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.625 align:middle line:84%
from many different
solar systems

00:07:10.625 --> 00:07:12.665 align:middle line:90%
who really are combined there.

00:07:12.665 --> 00:07:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
communicate with each other?

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.740 align:middle line:90%
Do you hear them talking?

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah, a lot
of it's too telepathic

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.920 align:middle line:84%
so you can see the
energy exchange

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.650 align:middle line:84%
and even hear the conversations
that take place on the ship

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: are they robots
or are they biological?

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: they're
majority biological

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.788 align:middle line:84%
and then there are some
robotic or more AI type

00:07:32.788 --> 00:07:33.830 align:middle line:90%
beings who are there too.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what
is a starseed to you?

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: So a starseed
from my understanding

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.830 align:middle line:84%
is a soul who comes
from off planet,

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.620 align:middle line:84%
so a Galactic soul
who has volunteered

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.680 align:middle line:84%
themselves to be a
human at this time

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.120 align:middle line:90%
with a purpose and a mission.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can people
know if they're starseeds?

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:57.140 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: So there's a lot of
different starseed symptoms.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And one of the main
symptoms is feeling

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:02.230 align:middle line:84%
like you're just not
from planet Earth,

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.960 align:middle line:84%
feeling like you're the
outcast in your family,

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.600 align:middle line:84%
but also feeling like
you're here for a reason

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.825 align:middle line:84%
and feeling like you have
a mission and a purpose.

00:08:09.825 --> 00:08:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
the purpose of a starseed

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.695 align:middle line:90%
really is on this planet?

00:08:13.695 --> 00:08:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: So I think the
purpose of a starseed

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:19.330 align:middle line:84%
is to help transition
humanity from one

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:23.920 align:middle line:84%
vibrational state of being into
an alternate state of being.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.410 align:middle line:84%
So it's really here
to support and help

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:27.370 align:middle line:90%
within that transition.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you a starseed?

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.640 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: I believe so, yeah.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are there many?

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: There's a lot more
than we would assume, yes.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I mean, you look human.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:38.920 align:middle line:90%
Are you 100% human?

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.470 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: So like I
said, biologically,

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.845 align:middle line:84%
I think we all have a little
bit of ET mix within us.

00:08:44.845 --> 00:08:45.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just a little bit.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Just a little bit.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:52.325 align:middle line:84%
But my soul is very much
so not from this planet.

00:08:52.325 --> 00:08:54.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who is your parents?

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.580 align:middle line:90%


00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: So my ET
parents are Zeta.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.110 align:middle line:90%
So they're Grey.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:03.180 align:middle line:90%
And of course, I have--

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why don't you have
a big head and huge eyes?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: So my
physical DNA is, I

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:12.877 align:middle line:84%
mean, human, which is once
again this mix, this hybrid.

00:09:12.877 --> 00:09:13.710 align:middle line:90%
We're an experiment.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.240 align:middle line:90%
We're a hybrid experiment.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.880 align:middle line:84%
But my soul is very
much so connected

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.033 align:middle line:84%
to the Zetas and the
Galactic Federation.

00:09:20.033 --> 00:09:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you were
telling me before the program

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.242 align:middle line:90%
that you just had a baby.

00:09:23.242 --> 00:09:24.225 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes, I did.

00:09:24.225 --> 00:09:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it a human baby?

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.870 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes, he is.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.420 align:middle line:84%
However, I did tell
my Galactic family

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:33.810 align:middle line:84%
that if he wanted to show
up looking a little bit more

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.520 align:middle line:90%
alien, that would be OK, too.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People who are
starseeds, are they hybrids?

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah, so humans
who are starseeds,

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.890 align:middle line:84%
they definitely have higher
amounts of extraterrestrial DNA

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:47.730 align:middle line:90%
within them.

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.100 align:middle line:84%
But once again, it
comes down to their soul

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.440 align:middle line:84%
being more extraterrestrial
than their physical body

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.385 align:middle line:90%
with that purpose.

00:09:54.385 --> 00:09:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know what
a cyborg is, right?

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.040 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Part
human, part machine.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.035 align:middle line:90%
Are they making some of those?

00:10:02.035 --> 00:10:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Not really.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.085 align:middle line:84%
They're really focused on more
of the organic biological.

00:10:06.085 --> 00:10:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people
could be starseeds

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.660 align:middle line:90%
and they don't even know it?

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:10.460 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: A lot.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.210 align:middle line:84%
I think there are so many
starseeds on this planet

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.670 align:middle line:84%
who have no idea who they
are and why they're here,

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:19.655 align:middle line:84%
which does lead to a lot of
mental health and anxiety

00:10:19.655 --> 00:10:20.455 align:middle line:90%
and depression.

00:10:20.455 --> 00:10:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think Elizabeth
that we could be starseeds

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:29.950 align:middle line:84%
if we have an interest in
extraterrestrial life, UFOs,

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:32.170 align:middle line:84%
and we just are
curious about it?

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.870 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah, I think a lot of
people who naturally gravitate

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:38.620 align:middle line:84%
towards life outside
of this planet

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.022 align:middle line:84%
and who have those
big picture questions,

00:10:41.022 --> 00:10:43.480 align:middle line:84%
it's a good indication that
they are a starseed themselves.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:47.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were to get a
blood test, what would it show?

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: It would
show O positive.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:51.652 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what I am.

00:10:51.652 --> 00:10:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Oh, very cool.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:53.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're my sister.

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and I do
believe that each blood

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.880 align:middle line:84%
type is linked to a different
extraterrestrial species.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.510 align:middle line:84%
But I haven't cracked
the code on which

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.630 align:middle line:84%
blood type is associated
to which species quite yet.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:12.010 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I think that there's
a lot of junk DNA that we

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:15.880 align:middle line:84%
have within us that science
just refuses or chooses

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.140 align:middle line:90%
not to explain.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that there's a lot
of our extraterrestrial essence

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:21.610 align:middle line:90%
within that junk DNA.

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:24.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We hear a lot about
the Galactic Federation.

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:27.025 align:middle line:90%
What is the Galactic Federation?

00:11:27.025 --> 00:11:29.950 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: The Galactic
Federation is an organization

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:34.090 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrials who have
one purpose, one mission, which

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:39.430 align:middle line:84%
is to ensure that
everyone in the universe

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:43.990 align:middle line:84%
is aligning to the
laws of the universe.

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And so they're a little bit
of like a regulator as an--

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:50.185 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well intentioned?

00:11:50.185 --> 00:11:52.475 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Very positively
intentioned, yes.

00:11:52.475 --> 00:11:58.483 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why don't they step
in and save worlds from strife?

00:11:58.483 --> 00:11:59.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look what's
been happening

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.540 align:middle line:84%
on this planet over
the last few years.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Why don't they step
in and stop it?

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: So there
is something called

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:09.950 align:middle line:84%
the law of nonintervention,
which essentially

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:14.240 align:middle line:84%
states that every being across
the universe has free will.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But they do intervene.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.015 align:middle line:90%
They're doing a hybrid program.

00:12:17.015 --> 00:12:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes.

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And so when an intervention
does happen, either individually

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:26.330 align:middle line:84%
or collectively, it is aligned
to the contracts of that soul.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.540 align:middle line:84%
So the soul has signed up
for that hybrid program.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And we as a collective
on planet Earth

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:33.920 align:middle line:84%
have signed up
for the challenges

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.130 align:middle line:84%
that we're experiencing here
so that we can learn what

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:41.000 align:middle line:84%
that low vibration is in
order to hopefully choose

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.290 align:middle line:90%
the higher state of vibration.

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:44.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Elizabeth,
Dr. David Jacobs

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:47.000 align:middle line:84%
believes that the
visitation of ETs

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.870 align:middle line:84%
is very nefarious, that it's
not good, that it's dangerous.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.682 align:middle line:90%
Do you agree with him?

00:12:52.682 --> 00:12:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: I believe
there's both, absolutely.

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:57.190 align:middle line:84%
I believe we live in
a binary universe.

00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:00.175 align:middle line:84%
And I believe with that, we get
the positive and the negative.

00:13:00.175 --> 00:13:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us
about starseed DNA.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.760 align:middle line:90%
What do you know about that?

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.160 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: So I believe that,
like I was mentioning earlier,

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.730 align:middle line:84%
we all have this
junk DNA within us

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:14.830 align:middle line:84%
and that when we reach a certain
vibrational frequency level,

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:18.050 align:middle line:84%
we unlock different
types of our DNA.

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:21.520 align:middle line:84%
So a good example
would be reptilian DNA.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.220 align:middle line:84%
We actually have a portion of
our brain called the reptilian

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.020 align:middle line:90%
brain.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
fight-or-flight mechanisms

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.160 align:middle line:90%
come into.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And so when we're
in a lower vibration

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:33.160 align:middle line:84%
or a fear-based vibration,
we are very much so

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.310 align:middle line:84%
in that fight or flight mode
because we are unlocking

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:38.900 align:middle line:90%
that aspect of our DNA.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And so as we go into
higher vibrations,

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:44.150 align:middle line:84%
we unlock higher
aspects of our DNA

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.540 align:middle line:84%
which give us things like
extrasensory abilities.

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is it important
to unlock these senses?

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: I think it's important
to unlock these senses

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:56.990 align:middle line:84%
because it allows us to
really step into our power

00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and to understand that we have
that source frequency, we have

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:04.310 align:middle line:84%
that God energy
within us, and that we

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.185 align:middle line:84%
are all creators
of our own reality.

00:14:06.185 --> 00:14:08.735 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us
about this awakening.

00:14:08.735 --> 00:14:09.570 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:11.405 align:middle line:90%
And what happens?

00:14:11.405 --> 00:14:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: So awakening
is just the realization

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:18.000 align:middle line:84%
that there is so much more than
this physical material world.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.790 align:middle line:84%
So awakening is such a broad
term for understanding life

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:24.530 align:middle line:90%
beyond what we've been taught.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And we can only truly
awaken as a human being

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:31.920 align:middle line:84%
when we start to question
the reality around us.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you happy that
this has happened to you?

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:36.605 align:middle line:90%
Does it bother you?

00:14:36.605 --> 00:14:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: I think if I
was not aware of life

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:44.550 align:middle line:84%
beyond this reality, I would
be very sad and depressed.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:48.180 align:middle line:84%
So I guess in a sense,
I am very glad that I

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.417 align:middle line:84%
understand things beyond what
we've been taught in school.

00:14:51.417 --> 00:14:53.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do your friends
and family say about this?

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: I think they thought
it was really weird at first.

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And then they were
able to accept.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And luckily, they've
been open-minded enough

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:07.260 align:middle line:84%
to evolve their
understanding of reality

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.450 align:middle line:84%
and live much better
lives because of it.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they believe
this has happened to you?

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:12.225 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes.

00:15:12.225 --> 00:15:13.725 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
convinced of that?

00:15:13.725 --> 00:15:14.580 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Absolutely.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What other
challenges might starseeds

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.230 align:middle line:90%
face during their awakening?

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah, definitely losing
all your friends and family

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:27.840 align:middle line:84%
members, feeling very outcasted,
feeling like you're alone

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.740 align:middle line:84%
in so many senses because
it's just not common knowledge

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:34.900 align:middle line:84%
when you do step into that
world beyond this one.

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.900 align:middle line:84%
So it can be very difficult
for a lot of people.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.317 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you
have some clients

00:15:38.317 --> 00:15:39.360 align:middle line:90%
who struggle, don't you?

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.193 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Absolutely.

00:15:40.193 --> 00:15:43.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you soothe
them and get them through this?

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: What I hear
often from people

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:48.390 align:middle line:84%
is that when they maybe
watch an interview

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:51.360 align:middle line:84%
or watch a video
of mine, they'll

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:55.290 align:middle line:84%
tell me that I've now spoken
everything that they've

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:56.830 align:middle line:90%
thought for a very long time.

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:59.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's an immediate
feeling of, oh my goodness,

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:00.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm not alone in this.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And that right
there really helps

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:07.770 align:middle line:84%
to ease their anxiety of feeling
like they're the only one who's

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:08.715 align:middle line:90%
questioning things.

00:16:08.715 --> 00:16:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And, Elizabeth,
we have a clip of you

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.030 align:middle line:84%
from "Interviews
with EDs" on Gaia,

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.670 align:middle line:84%
where you're talking about
healing a client's trauma.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:16.915 align:middle line:90%
Let's look.

00:16:16.915 --> 00:16:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: And then we dive even
deeper into those imbalances.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.660 align:middle line:90%
Where is that habit pattern?

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:23.770 align:middle line:90%
Where is that trauma?

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:26.680 align:middle line:84%
Where is that block coming
from in this lifetime?

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Usually, I'll go back
into their childhood.

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:30.040 align:middle line:90%
Hey, was your mom like this?

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And were there a lot
of expectations on you?

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:34.375 align:middle line:90%
Validation, validation.

00:16:34.375 --> 00:16:35.500 align:middle line:90%
And then we go even deeper.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And we go into some
past lifetimes.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:38.230 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:41.140 align:middle line:84%
So this has been going on
over and over as a repeated

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.790 align:middle line:90%
cycle in this lifetime.

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:44.170 align:middle line:90%
Where has this been?

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And where did this get
started in past lifetimes?

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:48.400 align:middle line:90%
So I'll give you a good example.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.080 align:middle line:84%
Just the other day,
just last week,

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.870 align:middle line:84%
I went into this
first-time client.

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:53.890 align:middle line:90%
She was very skeptical.

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:55.750 align:middle line:84%
She's never seen
a psychic before.

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:58.180 align:middle line:90%
And I went into this past life.

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:00.220 align:middle line:90%
And it was in the--

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.210 align:middle line:90%
what is it?

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:04.750 align:middle line:84%
Like mid-1400s, so
Dark Ages medieval era.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:06.880 align:middle line:90%
And it was just her and her mom.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And her mom, the only word
that I could define it

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.450 align:middle line:90%
was like smuggler.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:11.859 align:middle line:90%
She was a smuggler.

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:14.349 align:middle line:84%
So she would take
stolen goods, usually

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:17.579 align:middle line:84%
very precious stolen
goods back in the 1400s.

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And so she would
take these goods.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.619 align:middle line:84%
And then she would
sell them to buyers.

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:23.524 align:middle line:84%
So she was kind
of the middleman.

00:17:23.524 --> 00:17:25.010 align:middle line:84%
She didn't do the
stealing, but she

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:26.157 align:middle line:90%
was the middleman in between.

00:17:26.157 --> 00:17:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>>RUEBEN LANGDON: The pawn shop.

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:29.180 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah, exactly.

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And so she ended up
getting caught and put

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:36.530 align:middle line:84%
into jail for just like six
months, this medieval jail.

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And so her mom started freaking
out and told her daughter.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:42.260 align:middle line:90%
Her daughter was 15.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And so this is my client
now, the daughter,

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.330 align:middle line:90%
in this past life.

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:50.718 align:middle line:84%
And so the mom said, hey, you
have to break me out of jail.

00:17:50.718 --> 00:17:52.010 align:middle line:90%
You have to get me out of here.

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:53.730 align:middle line:84%
I have to keep my
business running.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:56.210 align:middle line:84%
So the mother had really no
concern over the daughter,

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:58.627 align:middle line:84%
really wanted the daughter to
just get her out so that she

00:17:58.627 --> 00:17:59.820 align:middle line:90%
could keep making money.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.540 align:middle line:84%
So the daughter tries to
smuggle the mom out of jail.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.340 align:middle line:84%
The daughter ends up
getting put into jail

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:05.662 align:middle line:90%
for a year and a half.

00:18:05.662 --> 00:18:06.620 align:middle line:90%
So here's the daughter.

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:09.590 align:middle line:84%
Here's my client
sacrificing herself

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:11.750 align:middle line:84%
for her mother in
that past lifetime.

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:13.970 align:middle line:84%
At around the age
of 15, 16 years old,

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:15.380 align:middle line:90%
she gets put into the jail.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:18.260 align:middle line:84%
The mom gets out six
months later, no big deal.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.060 align:middle line:90%
The mom goes on living her life.

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: And then
bother about doesn't even

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.030 align:middle line:90%
try to smuggle the daughter out.

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:24.815 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Doesn't even bother
with the daughter, OK?

00:18:24.815 --> 00:18:25.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LANGDON: OK.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.183 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: And then it goes
on and yada, yada, yada.

00:18:27.183 --> 00:18:29.168 align:middle line:90%
Turns out my client--

00:18:29.168 --> 00:18:30.710 align:middle line:84%
I think she was in
the US somewhere--

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:32.120 align:middle line:90%
her jaw was dropped.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, you're talking
about my life in this lifetime,

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:36.300 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no, this is
very clearly the 1400s.

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And you see the attire and
the dress and whatever.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, well, my mom
was the biggest drug smuggler

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:51.055 align:middle line:90%
in America for 25 years.

00:18:51.055 --> 00:18:51.855 align:middle line:90%
>>LANGDON: Wow.

00:18:51.855 --> 00:18:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: And at the age of
15, she packed up a suitcase.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.640 align:middle line:90%
And she left me on the beach.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And she ran from the police
because they were after her,

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.100 align:middle line:90%
same age, 15 years old.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.690 align:middle line:90%
And she was a drug smuggler.

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:06.300 align:middle line:90%
There's that word, "smuggler."

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:09.060 align:middle line:84%
So the impact of
these past lifetimes,

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.850 align:middle line:84%
I usually hear all the time,
you're talking about this life,

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:12.650 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:15.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my dad was an
alcoholic abusive in this life.

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:17.550 align:middle line:84%
No, really that happened
in the past life,

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:20.085 align:middle line:90%
same soul, repeated pattern.

00:19:20.085 --> 00:19:23.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This repeat
happens a lot, doesn't it?

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.630 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: It does, yeah.

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What advice
would you give

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:30.140 align:middle line:84%
to somebody who may
have had episodes just

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.685 align:middle line:90%
like you talked about?

00:19:31.685 --> 00:19:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: The biggest
advice that I could give

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:36.860 align:middle line:84%
is take a look at the
patterns in your own life

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:40.640 align:middle line:84%
going all the way back to
childhood in this lifetime.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And see what lessons
are constantly

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:44.720 align:middle line:90%
replaying in your life.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And usually that
indicates a past lifetime

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:48.710 align:middle line:90%
that needs to be cleared.

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does everybody want
to know about their past lives

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.435 align:middle line:90%
through a starseed program?

00:19:53.435 --> 00:19:56.055 align:middle line:90%


00:19:56.055 --> 00:19:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: I don't think a lot
of people are curious about it.

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:01.320 align:middle line:84%
But I definitely
would recommend.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.612 align:middle line:84%
If everyone on the planet
got a past life regression,

00:20:04.612 --> 00:20:06.570 align:middle line:84%
I think the world would
be a much better place.

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:07.987 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
people even know

00:20:07.987 --> 00:20:10.065 align:middle line:90%
that they might be a starseed?

00:20:10.065 --> 00:20:11.400 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Not a lot.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.470 align:middle line:10%
Right now, a very
small percentage

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:16.310 align:middle line:10%
of the actual starseeds
out there know

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:17.310 align:middle line:10%
that they're a starseed.

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you bring that
up to people, what do they say?

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.560 align:middle line:90%
You might be a starseed.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: There's two
different responses.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.920 align:middle line:84%
I've definitely
walked up to people

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.110 align:middle line:84%
and told them that
they're an alien before.

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.910 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:31.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You just walk
right up and tell them that?

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:32.570 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes, I do.

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:33.653 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do they say?

00:20:33.653 --> 00:20:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: And sometimes this
is where I meet my friends.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.770 align:middle line:90%
So two different responses.

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:42.010 align:middle line:90%
One is like, OK, cool.

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And they completely
shut it down.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
response is, ooh,

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:47.950 align:middle line:90%
that would make a lot of sense.

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they struggle
with many problems?

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes, absolutely.

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:57.240 align:middle line:84%
Starseeds face many challenges
throughout their life.

00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's once again
overcoming those hurdles

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:03.570 align:middle line:84%
and those challenges
which gives them

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:06.435 align:middle line:90%
that strength later in life.

00:21:06.435 --> 00:21:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give me an
example of somebody

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:11.510 align:middle line:84%
who just didn't want
to know anything

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:14.330 align:middle line:90%
about their starseed background.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:16.085 align:middle line:90%
What happened to them?

00:21:16.085 --> 00:21:19.760 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: So I did have a
client a number of years ago.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And she came to me
with family issues.

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:middle line:90%
So very human issues.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And when I told her
that she was actually

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:31.550 align:middle line:84%
a starseed with a mission,
she just couldn't accept it.

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And she said that she
didn't believe in aliens.

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And I never ended
up seeing her again.

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:41.210 align:middle line:84%
So I'm actually not sure
what happened to her.

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:42.320 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.580 align:middle line:90%
And that's totally OK.

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And I only receive information
that people are ready for.

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:49.430 align:middle line:84%
So I was a little
bit surprised she

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:51.120 align:middle line:90%
wasn't totally ready for that.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:54.380 align:middle line:84%
But I hope that she took
that and did something

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:55.280 align:middle line:90%
with it later on.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you hopeful for
the future of humanity or not?

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:00.350 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: I'm beyond hopeful.

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:03.590 align:middle line:84%
I think every day we see a
lot of trauma in the world.

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:05.390 align:middle line:90%
But also every day I see hope.

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:08.870 align:middle line:84%
I see organizations
cleaning up the ocean.

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:11.990 align:middle line:84%
I see inventions that
are healing people.

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:15.200 align:middle line:90%
I see people-- acts of kindness.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So I really do have this hope
that the younger generations

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:20.960 align:middle line:84%
and even the older
generations are

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:26.180 align:middle line:84%
going to start to understand
this world at a deeper level.

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has there
been an evolution

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.875 align:middle line:84%
of starseeds from, let's
say, the last few years?

00:22:30.875 --> 00:22:32.370 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah, absolutely.

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:36.410 align:middle line:84%
So 2020 actually
really awakened so many

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:40.110 align:middle line:84%
of these starseeds who were
just living their everyday life.

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:40.910 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:42.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was so
important about 2020?

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: 2020 took a
lot of people outside

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:46.350 align:middle line:90%
of their reality.

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:50.240 align:middle line:84%
It really forced people to
get outside of the 9 to 5

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.010 align:middle line:90%
and start questioning things.

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:55.460 align:middle line:84%
They had a lot more time
to be introspective,

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:58.535 align:middle line:84%
which I think is what
helped people awaken.

00:22:58.535 --> 00:23:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Pretty dramatic
stuff, isn't it?

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:02.745 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Very.

00:23:02.745 --> 00:23:06.495 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 2024 to '28,
what could happen?

00:23:06.495 --> 00:23:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: So right now
we're kind of just ending

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.150 align:middle line:84%
this phase of
starseed awakening.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:15.270 align:middle line:84%
A lot of starseeds have
been activated 2020

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:18.750 align:middle line:84%
going into 2023
and even into 2024.

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And right now, we're moving
from a holding pattern.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.380 align:middle line:84%
So starseeds have been
feeling like they've

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:26.790 align:middle line:90%
been waiting for something.

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:28.890 align:middle line:84%
But they don't know what
they're waiting for.

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And now we're moving
into this action phase,

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.760 align:middle line:90%
which is, OK, it's go time.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And so these starseeds are
starting to align themselves

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:38.670 align:middle line:90%
to their true mission.

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And between 2024 and
2028, we're going

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:45.450 align:middle line:84%
to see a lot of people
stepping into their mission,

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:46.560 align:middle line:90%
helping others.

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And this isn't just energy
workers, for example.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:53.670 align:middle line:84%
This is starseed politicians,
starseed lawyers,

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:57.570 align:middle line:84%
starseed police officers, all
really aligning themselves

00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:00.600 align:middle line:84%
to their mission and making
the world a better place

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.955 align:middle line:84%
by moving us into
a higher frequency.

00:24:02.955 --> 00:24:05.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you don't see
a collapse of society?

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:06.850 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Absolutely, I do.

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:12.320 align:middle line:84%
Yes, because society has been
built on an old energy system.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And so as we move into
higher frequencies,

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:17.260 align:middle line:84%
we need to collapse
the old in order

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:21.985 align:middle line:84%
for there to be room to
rebuild into a new society.

00:24:21.985 --> 00:24:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we have an
incredible clip of you

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.070 align:middle line:84%
from "Interviews
with EDs" on Gaia

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:31.026 align:middle line:90%
discussing the age of Atlantis.

00:24:31.026 --> 00:24:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: The first image that
he gave me anyway was this.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And he gives me
the word expansion.

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:38.660 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is the time that
we're in is expansion.

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And then he throws me
into another image, which

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.890 align:middle line:90%
is the image of the planet.

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:48.320 align:middle line:10%
And he was showing me all of
the vortexes on the planet

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.930 align:middle line:10%
reawakening because
there was a time where

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:54.860 align:middle line:10%
a lot of the vortexes
were deactivated.

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And so the vortexes
are reawakening.

00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:58.850 align:middle line:84%
He also brought me
all the way back

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:01.430 align:middle line:84%
to the time of ancient
Atlantis and Lemuria.

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:03.620 align:middle line:84%
So he was showing me this
really hustle, bustle,

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:07.400 align:middle line:84%
this bustling civilization
during ancient Atlantis

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.210 align:middle line:90%
and Lemuria.

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying that
this is nothing new.

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:12.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we are expanding.

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:13.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes, this is happening.

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:14.852 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there's a lot
of things that are

00:25:14.852 --> 00:25:16.550 align:middle line:90%
reactivating and opening up.

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:19.860 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
we've seen this all before.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:22.340 align:middle line:84%
So he gave me the
word of rebirth.

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:23.450 align:middle line:90%
Rebirth.

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:26.510 align:middle line:84%
This is not the first time
this has ever happened.

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:27.740 align:middle line:90%
This is happening again.

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And he's talking
about the cycles.

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that he
was throwing me back

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:34.980 align:middle line:84%
to ancient Atlantis and
Lemuria because this

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:39.567 align:middle line:84%
is the last time we saw
the expansion at the point

00:25:39.567 --> 00:25:40.650 align:middle line:90%
that it's going to get to.

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:42.180 align:middle line:90%
It's definitely not there yet.

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:46.470 align:middle line:84%
But we're going back to those
days of Atlantis and Lemuria.

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:50.550 align:middle line:84%
We've got technology and
that kind of consciousness

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:53.340 align:middle line:84%
and awareness and that
vibrational frequency that's

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:54.180 align:middle line:90%
all coming back.

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:57.120 align:middle line:84%
So his main point, the
emphasis that he wanted to make

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.570 align:middle line:90%
is this cycle.

00:25:58.570 --> 00:25:59.670 align:middle line:90%
It's not new.

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:01.290 align:middle line:90%
We're just seeing it again.

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And also he's saying, deep
down somewhere within us,

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:09.000 align:middle line:84%
a lot of us as human
beings, as souls, we've

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.990 align:middle line:84%
been here since that time,
since Atlantis and Lemuria.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, we're remembering
what we once lost.

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:20.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Atlantis and Lemuria
comes up a lot, don't they?

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:21.680 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Why?

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Because back then we had
access to all knowledge,

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:31.500 align:middle line:84%
all technology, and higher
vibrational frequency.

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.500 align:middle line:84%
But we didn't necessarily
have the accountability,

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.710 align:middle line:84%
or the integrity, or the
responsibility back then.

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's why that
community failed.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's why a lot of us
who have lived back then

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:47.100 align:middle line:84%
in past lifetimes are bringing
through that knowledge of,

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:50.400 align:middle line:84%
it's great to have those
higher frequencies and access

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.930 align:middle line:90%
to knowledge.

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:54.895 align:middle line:84%
But we have to have access
to it with responsibility

00:26:54.895 --> 00:26:55.695 align:middle line:90%
and integrity.

00:26:55.695 --> 00:26:57.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For how many years
do you think, Elizabeth,

00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:00.816 align:middle line:84%
starseeds have been
on this planet?

00:27:00.816 --> 00:27:02.770 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: For a very long time.

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:05.005 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Since the
beginning of humankind?

00:27:05.005 --> 00:27:07.010 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes, I would say so.

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:07.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When the Bible
talks about fallen angels.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:13.300 align:middle line:90%


00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:16.900 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: So fallen
angels, even the Bible

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:20.050 align:middle line:84%
talking about angels
I believe are just

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:22.390 align:middle line:84%
the Bible talking
about extraterrestrials

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:24.700 align:middle line:84%
coming to planet Earth
to give messages.

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, a
lot of those messages

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:30.205 align:middle line:84%
from extraterrestrials
have been misinterpreted.

00:27:30.205 --> 00:27:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Eventually,
we will all be

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.450 align:middle line:84%
forced to awaken our
starseed DNA, won't we?

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:37.870 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: I believe so because
the vibration on planet Earth

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:39.370 align:middle line:90%
is increasing.

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's just going to
continue to increase.

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:45.310 align:middle line:84%
There's really no running away
from that higher vibration.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
force everyone to wake

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:50.445 align:middle line:84%
up to this reality beyond
what we've been taught.

00:27:50.445 --> 00:27:52.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there starseeds
throughout the planet?

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:55.300 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yes, there are
everywhere in every culture,

00:27:55.300 --> 00:28:00.070 align:middle line:84%
speaking every language
across all countries.

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:02.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is fascinating.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.070 align:middle line:90%
What's the upside?

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:06.085 align:middle line:90%
What's the downside?

00:28:06.085 --> 00:28:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: So the downside is
what we're seeing right now.

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:10.900 align:middle line:84%
It's the collapse of
society as we know it.

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:14.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot of trauma, a lot of
turmoil, a lot of challenge,

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:16.600 align:middle line:90%
a lot of strife.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:20.020 align:middle line:84%
The upside is we're actually
going to rebuild society

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:23.050 align:middle line:84%
in a new way that's going to
be sustainable for everyone

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:24.370 align:middle line:90%
and not just the 1%.

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:26.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who is Khan?

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Khan is my
interdimensional self,

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:31.240 align:middle line:90%
at least one of them.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:35.575 align:middle line:84%
He is a mantis being who
exists in the 12th dimension.

00:28:35.575 --> 00:28:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Elizabeth,
we have a clip of you

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:40.450 align:middle line:84%
from "Interviews with EDs"
on Gaia where you channel

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:43.750 align:middle line:90%
a mantis being named Khan.

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Khan is a mantis being.

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:49.010 align:middle line:90%
He's from the 12th dimension.

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And when I first got
in contact with him,

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.200 align:middle line:84%
I had just undergone
foot surgery.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if it
was just the fact that I

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:03.460 align:middle line:84%
was in a state of
meditation or if I just

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:06.160 align:middle line:84%
wasn't working at the time
and I was really relaxed

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.210 align:middle line:90%
or what have you.

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:10.510 align:middle line:84%
But in an instant,
all of a sudden,

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:14.590 align:middle line:84%
this giant mantis being
comes into the room.

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And so we had a lovely
conversation back in 2015

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:19.150 align:middle line:90%
when he first introduced me.

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:21.730 align:middle line:84%
I had this huge
download, unlocked

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:26.110 align:middle line:84%
a massive amount of DNA within
me when he came through.

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:27.790 align:middle line:90%
I asked him who he was.

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:29.755 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I am you.

00:29:29.755 --> 00:29:31.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LANGDON: Well, can
we bring him through

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:35.180 align:middle line:84%
and start having some words
and dialogue with Khan.

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:35.980 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: For sure.

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:36.550 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LANGDON: Sweet.

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:44.360 align:middle line:84%
So, Khan, wondering what your
role is in this ascension

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:47.380 align:middle line:84%
process that we're going
through right now on the planet?

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:51.080 align:middle line:90%


00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:51.910 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: OK.

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:53.210 align:middle line:90%
Very beautiful.

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:54.010 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:57.460 align:middle line:84%
So he's showing me the
image of the planet.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And he's showing me himself
incarnating into this planet.

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:05.875 align:middle line:84%
And he gave me
some words as well.

00:30:05.875 --> 00:30:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And he was showing
me that he incarnates

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:15.340 align:middle line:84%
into individual creatures, so
a lot of animals, even plants,

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:19.660 align:middle line:84%
to teach lessons through
those individual incarnations.

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:23.980 align:middle line:84%
He also says that he can and
does come through other people

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:25.810 align:middle line:84%
as well, like other
people channel him.

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:31.060 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't incarnate as one
person in particular as Khan.

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:32.660 align:middle line:90%
But he allows other people.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:35.590 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, he's kind
of acting as this oversoul

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:36.400 align:middle line:90%
for planet Earth.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he does a lot of work
out there in the universe.

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:43.060 align:middle line:84%
But essentially for this
planet in particular, he does--

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:45.890 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to get the
words again from him.

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:50.200 align:middle line:84%
He's saying that he
individually incarnates to teach

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.480 align:middle line:90%
a collective conscious lesson.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.710 align:middle line:90%
And that's what he does.

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:56.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when you
say that Khan is a mantis,

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:58.720 align:middle line:84%
you mean a praying
mantis, that figure

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:02.020 align:middle line:84%
that we see in "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind"

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:05.680 align:middle line:84%
and that large-looking,
insect-looking being?

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:06.820 align:middle line:90%
That's what he looks like?

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah, he's not very
good looking to our standards.

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you channel
him on a regular basis?

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah, so he is
part of my counterpart.

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:17.260 align:middle line:90%
He's part of my soul collective.

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:19.260 align:middle line:84%
He's like a part of
me in the future.

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:22.217 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if I ask him
questions, can he answer them?

00:31:22.217 --> 00:31:23.050 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Absolutely.

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long does
it take for you to get

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:26.288 align:middle line:90%
into that meditative state?

00:31:26.288 --> 00:31:27.205 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Very quickly.

00:31:27.205 --> 00:31:30.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right, let's do it.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.635 align:middle line:84%
Khan, is there future
hope for planet Earth?

00:31:35.635 --> 00:31:39.750 align:middle line:90%


00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: OK.

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:44.070 align:middle line:84%
So I will explain that
the way that I channel.

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:45.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't transchannel.

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.580 align:middle line:90%
He will give me an answer.

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:48.720 align:middle line:90%
And then I will relay it.

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.428 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
waiting for this answer?

00:31:50.428 --> 00:31:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: No, I've got it.

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:54.525 align:middle line:84%
He said that there is great
hope for the future of humanity.

00:31:54.525 --> 00:31:56.448 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In spite of
everything that happens?

00:31:56.448 --> 00:31:57.990 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yes, in
spite of everything.

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why don't you
step in and save us?

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: He's saying it is not
my responsibility to do so.

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:08.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But why do you
have an interest with us

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:09.050 align:middle line:90%
in the first place?

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:15.810 align:middle line:90%


00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: He's saying there is
a great impact that humanity

00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:21.550 align:middle line:84%
has on planet Earth for
the rest of the universe.

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:26.365 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When did your beings
start coming to this planet?

00:32:26.365 --> 00:32:29.290 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: He's saying, we
have always been here.

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you see
this from the get-go?

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:35.850 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: He's saying, we
have observed planet Earth

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:37.012 align:middle line:90%
for a very long time?

00:32:37.012 --> 00:32:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you our gods?

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:39.915 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: No.

00:32:39.915 --> 00:32:41.355 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you believe in God?

00:32:41.355 --> 00:32:44.020 align:middle line:90%


00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:48.535 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: He's saying, we
understand a higher source.

00:32:48.535 --> 00:32:50.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who created you?

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:54.335 align:middle line:90%


00:32:54.335 --> 00:32:56.855 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: He's
saying, I created me.

00:32:56.855 --> 00:32:59.735 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How can that be?

00:32:59.735 --> 00:33:03.326 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: He said he called
himself into existence.

00:33:03.326 --> 00:33:05.345 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you have family?

00:33:05.345 --> 00:33:06.730 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes.

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:09.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mother, father?

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:10.680 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: No.

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:14.010 align:middle line:90%


00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:20.730 align:middle line:84%
He has a chosen partner
and he has chosen children.

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:23.820 align:middle line:84%
But they were not
formed biologically.

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do
you think you have

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:31.250 align:middle line:84%
a role here to save humanity
without getting involved,

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:32.210 align:middle line:90%
as you say?

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:35.243 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: So he's
saying that he--

00:33:35.243 --> 00:33:37.961 align:middle line:90%


00:33:37.961 --> 00:33:40.460 align:middle line:84%
he's saying that he does
not have a direct role.

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.920 align:middle line:84%
He's saying that
Elizabeth has a role.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.100 align:middle line:84%
But he says it's one of
many roles on planet Earth.

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:48.732 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
you find Elizabeth?

00:33:48.732 --> 00:33:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: He's saying that
there was no finding.

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:56.290 align:middle line:90%
We are pieces of each other.

00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:59.250 align:middle line:84%
He's also saying that
he chose to incarnate

00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:02.640 align:middle line:84%
or he chose this
lifetime as Elizabeth.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:06.962 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how long
will you remain here?

00:34:06.962 --> 00:34:08.770 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Until the job is done.

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:10.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How old are
you by Earth time?

00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:15.139 align:middle line:90%


00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:18.469 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: He's saying hundreds
of thousands of Earth years.

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:22.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You are hundreds of
thousands of Earth years old?

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:23.825 align:middle line:90%
Do you ever die?

00:34:23.825 --> 00:34:26.680 align:middle line:90%


00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: He's saying
he will choose when

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:34.513 align:middle line:90%
he wants to exit that form.

00:34:34.513 --> 00:34:38.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you do feel
that the planet is going

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:42.076 align:middle line:90%
to go down the right road?

00:34:42.076 --> 00:34:46.554 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: He's saying you
are on the right track, yes.

00:34:46.554 --> 00:34:50.696 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there going to be
a coming shift pretty soon?

00:34:50.696 --> 00:34:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: The shift is
already taking place.

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:56.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, let's
bring Elizabeth back.

00:34:56.860 --> 00:35:00.916 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you're channeling him,
are you aware of what he says?

00:35:00.916 --> 00:35:02.140 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes, I am.

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:03.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:06.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's like he
will be next to me.

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:09.460 align:middle line:84%
I always have him on my
upper right hand corner.

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And then it'll be a
telepathic conversation.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes if it's
a very complex answer,

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:18.875 align:middle line:84%
he will give me a picture
instead of just words.

00:35:18.875 --> 00:35:21.025 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does he
ever bother you?

00:35:21.025 --> 00:35:23.070 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: No, he never does.

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:24.450 align:middle line:90%
I always have to go to him.

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I feel
like I'm bothering him.

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it's not like
you're ready to fall asleep

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.480 align:middle line:84%
and he pops up on you no
or something like that?

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.986 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Never.

00:35:31.986 --> 00:35:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These shifts,
what's causing these changes?

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: It's an
increasing vibration.

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And from my understanding,
our solar system

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:43.210 align:middle line:90%
is moving through the universe.

00:35:43.210 --> 00:35:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And we're actually just
moving through something

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:49.830 align:middle line:84%
called a photon belt,
which just actually has

00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:51.580 align:middle line:90%
higher energy within it.

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:54.625 align:middle line:84%
So we're just naturally getting
hit with higher vibrations.

00:35:54.625 --> 00:35:58.825 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How will humanity
interact with the starseeds?

00:35:58.825 --> 00:36:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: I think in a
lot of ways humanity

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:04.000 align:middle line:84%
won't really realize
that starseeds are

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.040 align:middle line:90%
who they are potentially ever.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:11.350 align:middle line:84%
So I think that humanity
at a very surface level

00:36:11.350 --> 00:36:16.060 align:middle line:84%
will look at starseeds as
leaders, changemakers, thought

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:17.500 align:middle line:90%
leaders in our community.

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:20.440 align:middle line:84%
But maybe we'll never
see them or accept them

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:23.230 align:middle line:90%
as extraterrestrial incarnates.

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:27.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you see any dangers
for the planet, wars ahead

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:28.690 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that?

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yes, I
believe that there's

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:37.330 align:middle line:84%
going to be a lot more war but
also environmental cataclysms

00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:39.615 align:middle line:84%
as well that we have
in store for us.

00:36:39.615 --> 00:36:41.755 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we will
win in the long run?

00:36:41.755 --> 00:36:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: I believe
we're currently winning.

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that consciousness
and the higher vibration,

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:48.543 align:middle line:90%
there's no going back from here.

00:36:48.543 --> 00:36:50.460 align:middle line:84%
It's just going to get
more and more powerful.

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it won't change
without any sacrifices

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:54.932 align:middle line:90%
or will it?

00:36:54.932 --> 00:36:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: I think
that we've already

00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:58.520 align:middle line:90%
done a lot of sacrifice.

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And once again, humanity has
to choose which direction we

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:03.890 align:middle line:90%
want to go into.

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:06.515 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the time that
comes through challenge.

00:37:06.515 --> 00:37:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've heard of linear
reality and quantum reality?

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:10.280 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes.

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.572 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's the difference?

00:37:11.572 --> 00:37:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: So linear
reality, the easiest way

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:17.810 align:middle line:84%
to put it is like going from
A to B to C. Quantum reality

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:20.390 align:middle line:84%
is where A, B, and
C are simultaneously

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:23.230 align:middle line:90%
existing at the same time.

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:24.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which do you prefer?

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:26.035 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Quantum, of course.

00:37:26.035 --> 00:37:27.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's easier?

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:32.165 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: It's more complex
but easier at the same time.

00:37:32.165 --> 00:37:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Since you've
been doing this,

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:37.955 align:middle line:84%
what has been the most profound
thing you've gone through?

00:37:37.955 --> 00:37:40.200 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: That's a good question.

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:42.110 align:middle line:84%
I would say the
most profound thing

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:45.080 align:middle line:84%
that I've gone through is
my own spiritual awakening

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:49.190 align:middle line:84%
and understanding that I didn't
need a leader or a mentor

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:52.490 align:middle line:84%
or a teacher in
order to navigate

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:54.480 align:middle line:90%
my way through those energies.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that I can
inspire other people

00:37:57.290 --> 00:38:00.860 align:middle line:84%
to be their own leader
rather than to externalize

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:02.207 align:middle line:90%
their power into someone else.

00:38:02.207 --> 00:38:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Elizabeth, if
you were able to time

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:08.870 align:middle line:90%
travel, what would you do?

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:11.630 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: So I believe
that time is nonlinear.

00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:14.060 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that we
all have the ability

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:17.060 align:middle line:84%
to go backwards in time
and forwards in time.

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:21.704 align:middle line:84%
If I were to be able to time
travel and change anything,

00:38:21.704 --> 00:38:22.540 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't.

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:23.455 align:middle line:90%
I think we're exactly--

00:38:23.455 --> 00:38:25.035 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would have
everything stay the same?

00:38:25.035 --> 00:38:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yes, collectively
and individually.

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You wouldn't change
World War II or Hitler

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:31.150 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that?

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:32.530 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: I wouldn't.

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a rule that
says you cannot dabble with

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.340 align:middle line:90%
the past?

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yes, there are
many very complex rules

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:40.390 align:middle line:90%
to time travel.

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about the future?

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:47.686 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yes, there are also
rules to the future as well.

00:38:47.686 --> 00:38:50.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many starseeds
are on this planet?

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:51.900 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: There are many.

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of the
8 billion humans,

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:55.350 align:middle line:90%
how many might be starseeds?

00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: I think
quite a few million.

00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:58.335 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That many?

00:38:58.335 --> 00:38:59.135 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes.

00:38:59.135 --> 00:39:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they in positions
of politics and companies

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:04.080 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that?

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:07.740 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah, they are
seated within every system

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:08.730 align:middle line:90%
of planet Earth.

00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:14.122 align:middle line:84%
And not all of them are
aware of their mission yet.

00:39:14.122 --> 00:39:17.156 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
your next project?

00:39:17.156 --> 00:39:20.615 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: My next project is
to release my second book.

00:39:20.615 --> 00:39:22.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which would be on what?

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: It's interviews
with interdimensionals.

00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:29.035 align:middle line:90%
So what I've decided to do is--

00:39:29.035 --> 00:39:29.835 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like Khan?

00:39:29.835 --> 00:39:31.020 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Exactly.

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:34.710 align:middle line:84%
So me as Elizabeth just asking
different interdimensional

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:38.290 align:middle line:84%
beings questions about
their life, their mission,

00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:40.770 align:middle line:84%
their role, and also
really important

00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:43.080 align:middle line:84%
questions about
humanity and what

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.606 align:middle line:90%
we need to know here from them.

00:39:45.606 --> 00:39:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who are the
other people you channel?

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: I can talk to
any interdimensional

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.360 align:middle line:90%
being telepathically.

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But Khan
is your regular?

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.820 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Khan is my regular.

00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And then I also have
another counterpart

00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:03.360 align:middle line:84%
of mine named Heera,
who is a Zeta Reticuli

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:04.740 align:middle line:90%
being, a gray being.

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
a male or female?

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.870 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: That's a male.

00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And then also my other
regular is named Kinetic.

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:13.170 align:middle line:90%
And he is a Pleiadian being.

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:16.020 align:middle line:90%
And he works with the planet.

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And he helps me
understand what's

00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:20.190 align:middle line:90%
happening on planet Earth.

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And he works for
a security council

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:25.170 align:middle line:84%
up on the Galactic
Federation ship.

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we
channel one of them?

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.605 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: We can channel Kinetic.

00:40:28.605 --> 00:40:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
let's do that.

00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:36.710 align:middle line:84%
Kinetic, my question is, are
you hopeful for the future

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:39.706 align:middle line:90%
of planet Earth?

00:40:39.706 --> 00:40:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yes, we are beyond
hopeful for the future

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:44.220 align:middle line:90%
of planet Earth.

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:47.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is there so
much evil on this planet?

00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:50.894 align:middle line:90%
And there is.

00:40:50.894 --> 00:40:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Evil, as you
call it, or negativity

00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:03.860 align:middle line:84%
is just a reflection of
the rest of the universe.

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:06.645 align:middle line:84%
There is no judgment
with that vibration.

00:41:06.645 --> 00:41:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Surely, the
rest of the universe

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:10.680 align:middle line:90%
can't be evil like planet Earth.

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:13.410 align:middle line:90%


00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Nefarious agendas,
negativity, or low vibrations

00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:21.130 align:middle line:84%
do exist in the rest
of the universe.

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were raising
a child on this planet today,

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:29.810 align:middle line:84%
would you be hopeful
for its future?

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yes, especially since
I would be able to raise them

00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:37.631 align:middle line:90%
with knowledge and information.

00:41:37.631 --> 00:41:41.896 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is next for the
planet in the next few years?

00:41:41.896 --> 00:41:45.180 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: One of the biggest
ascensions that this planet has

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:46.780 align:middle line:90%
ever gone through.

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:50.066 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
positive or negative?

00:41:50.066 --> 00:41:51.770 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes, it will be.

00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:55.115 align:middle line:84%
It's an upward
trajectory of energy.

00:41:55.115 --> 00:41:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do we get there?

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:59.766 align:middle line:90%
Will it be a tough road to hoe?

00:41:59.766 --> 00:42:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: You are
currently getting there.

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And it is a very
tough road for many.

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
the past few years

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:11.740 align:middle line:84%
have been pretty
tough on humans.

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:15.254 align:middle line:90%
Will it get any better?

00:42:15.254 --> 00:42:17.910 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: It will still get
worse before it gets better.

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:22.632 align:middle line:90%


00:42:22.632 --> 00:42:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your relationship
with Elizabeth April,

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:30.340 align:middle line:90%
is she here to send us messages?

00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:33.090 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yes, she is one
of the many messengers.

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:36.026 align:middle line:90%


00:42:36.026 --> 00:42:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're hopeful
that with people like Elizabeth

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:44.705 align:middle line:90%
April, our future is intact?

00:42:44.705 --> 00:42:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yes, we are very
hopeful that the volunteers are

00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:52.755 align:middle line:84%
changing the planet
the way it needs to be.

00:42:52.755 --> 00:42:55.135 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can we all channel you?

00:42:55.135 --> 00:42:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yes, you can
all ask us questions

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:01.750 align:middle line:84%
and connect with us
at a telepathic level.

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:03.775 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you come to
us in our dream state?

00:43:03.775 --> 00:43:07.351 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes, we do many times.

00:43:07.351 --> 00:43:09.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, let's
bring Elizabeth back.

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:10.240 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.845 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Thank you, Kinetic.

00:43:12.845 --> 00:43:15.705 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, how
old is that being?

00:43:15.705 --> 00:43:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah, he
told me his age once.

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.840 align:middle line:84%
He's very old, definitely
not as old as Khan.

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:23.060 align:middle line:90%
So Kinetic has a physical body.

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:25.408 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
know each other?

00:43:25.408 --> 00:43:27.700 align:middle line:10%
>>APRIL: No, I don't think
they've ever worked together

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:29.900 align:middle line:10%
before.

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:33.170 align:middle line:10%
So Kinetic is a couple
thousand years old,

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:36.370 align:middle line:10%
which is much older than
most Pleiadians are.

00:43:36.370 --> 00:43:41.080 align:middle line:10%
And from what I've
asked him in the past,

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:42.670 align:middle line:10%
I said, why are you still here?

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Why wouldn't you
just reincarnate

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:45.820 align:middle line:90%
in a different body?

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And he said that he
really wanted to be here

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.390 align:middle line:90%
for Earth's ascension.

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:52.210 align:middle line:84%
So he wanted to maintain
his body for that.

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:54.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Elizabeth, thanks
for being on "Beyond Belief."

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:57.250 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Thank you so much
for having me, George.

00:43:57.250 --> 00:43:59.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Her channeling
is absolutely amazing.

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:03.280 align:middle line:10%
But the most important message
that I got from this, there's

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:04.840 align:middle line:10%
hope for our planet.

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
